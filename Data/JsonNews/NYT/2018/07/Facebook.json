Once they hooked the beast, the men reeled it in from their rowboats near the shore and hauled it onto the beach. The text, which is dated to the second or third century, describes one onlooker as standing on a cliff and beholding the \u201ctremendous toil of the men in this warfare of the sea.\u201d But was this \u201csea monster,\u201d or \u201ccetus\u201d as it is called in Latin, actually a whale? The authors also believe the finding could mean that the Romans, who had more than 200 processing plants for fish on the European and African coasts of the Western Mediterranean, may have conducted industrial-scale whaling.Dr. Rodrigues and her colleagues obtained ten suspected whale bones collected from sites in Spain and Morocco near the Strait of Gibraltar. The team genetically analyzed the DNA from the bones and found that two belonged to gray whales and three belonged to right whales. Most of the other bones belonged to sea creatures that live in the Mediterranean today, such as a fin whale, a sperm whale, a long-finned pilot whale and a dolphin. Unexpectedly, one belonged to an African elephant. Unlike the other whale species discovered during the research, gray whales and North Atlantic right whales are known to swim near the shoreline to reproduce and birth their calves, which could have made them targets for Roman hunters.Using radiocarbon dating as well as a method that dates sediment where the bones where found, the team dated the gray and right whale bones to years from around 230 B.C. to 525 A.D. During part of this period, the Roman Empire controlled the Strait of Gibraltar.More bones and additional evidence will need to be uncovered before scientists can confidently say that ancient Roman whaling occurred. It is possible the whale bones the team analyzed belonged to stranded or dead whales that the Romans scavenged.\u201cThis proposition that they were as far south as the Mediterranean, maybe breeding off the coast of Iberia and having a calving ground, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d Dr. Szabo said.\u201cTheir population is incredibly at risk,\u201d said Dr. Szabo. \u201cIf we can go into those bones and try to look at their genetic profile from the past we can better understand the species today.\u201dA picture caption in an earlier version of this article, using information provided by a researcher, misstated the estimated age of a whale rib fragment.

{"Headline": "The Biggest Spender of Political Ads on Facebook? President Trump", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s official: President Trump is the single biggest political advertiser on Facebook.Mr. Trump and his political action committee spent $274,000 on ads on the social network since early May, outpacing the second-biggest spender, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood spent just over $188,000 on Facebook ads over the same period.The ads bought by Mr. Trump and his PAC were also seen the most by Facebook\u2019s users, having been viewed by at least 37 million people since May. That compared with 24 million people who saw the second-most viewed group of political ads, which were also from Planned Parenthood.Facebook now requires buyers of political ads on its network to be verified as United States citizens or permanent residents, to cut down on foreign interference. That means Facebook\u2019s political ad archive largely provides a portrait of domestic activity, spotlighting both the digital ad buying of Democratic and Republican elected officials and political candidates, as well as nonprofit organizations, for-profit groups and PACs. The archive also shows how much these ads were actually consumed by the social network\u2019s users.\u201cOne of the challenges in previous election cycles is that we never had a good repository of political ads,\u201d said Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He said the study was an \u201cimportant initial analysis that reveals both the potential, and the many limitations, of Facebook\u2019s political ad database.\u201dThe N.Y.U. researchers broke out the top 449 spenders of political ads on Facebook since May for The New York Times. Of those, 210 were left-wing groups, 124 were right-wing groups and 115 groups were politically neutral, they said.Damon McCoy, who conducted the study with two fellow researchers, Laura Edelson and Shikhar Sakhuja, said they were not able to tally the total spending for Republicans and Democrats because their analysis was ongoing, though they planned to release those figures in the future.But the new study found a healthy amount of activity from what the researchers described as left-leaning politicians. Of the top 20 political candidates and PACs purchasing Facebook ads, 12 were identified as Democrats while eight were Republicans, according to data provided by the N.Y.U. researchers.Facebook\u2019s database worked well for identifying specific ads, Mr. McCoy said, but it did not give an overview of how a particular group or politician was advertising on Facebook. Some groups, he said, used multiple names to promote ads, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which also had ads placed as the A.C.L.U.The researchers said they also found 43,575 cases of ads with political content that did not name a sponsor, indicating that whoever purchased the ad did not go through Facebook\u2019s verification process. They added that men and women between the ages of 25 to 34 were the most targeted for ads, while those under 17 or above 65 were the least targeted.Facebook said it welcomed the new study and hoped others would begin delving into its data.\u201cThis report is the exactly how we hoped the tool would be used \u2014 outside experts helping to analyze these ads on Facebook,\u201d said Rob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management. \u201cIt brings more transparency to the messages people see and increases accountability and responsibility over time, not just for us but advertisers as well.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.The Facebook ads from Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, ran the gamut from those challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s position on reproductive rights to ads about its services in various states.\u201cRunning ads on Facebook is a targeted and cost-effective way to reach both our 2.4 million patients and 12 million supporters,\u201d said Erica Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. She pointed out that the figures in the database included ads from the organization\u2019s 56 affiliates, including services they provide, as well as \u201cadvertisements raising the alarm about what is at risk as the Trump-Pence administration and many states try to take away access to health care.\u201d\u201cWhile Facebook is trying to deal with a very real problem of fake news, their solution is far from perfect and creates the unintended consequence of painting a false picture of political advertising on their platform,\u201d Ms. Sackin said.According to the study, most other politicians shelled out well under $100,000 on ads on the social network, reaching only hundreds of thousands of Facebook users.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zero Tolerance for Zero Tolerance", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe children at the border are just the latest casualty of this deeply misguided approach to public policy.Ms. Yoffe is a contributing editor at The Atlantic and a contributing writer at HuffPost\u2019s Highline. This Thursday the Trump administration faces a deadline handed down earlier this summer by a United States District Court judge: reunite the children separated from their parents at the border by federal law enforcement. There\u2019s no way the White House will pull it off. Reports indicate that hundreds of parents will not be seeing their children because the government can\u2019t locate the parents or has already deported them.This entire catastrophe isn\u2019t just the result of a deliberately cruel and incompetently implemented policy, though it is certainly that. These sundered families are the latest casualty of \u201czero tolerance\u201d \u2014 a misguided mind-set that bludgeons the people it targets, no matter how vulnerable.For a generation, American policymakers have been addicted to zero tolerance as a response to all social ills: crime, drugs, sexual violations \u2014 even misbehaving schoolchildren.Start with crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal and state governments went on a criminal justice binge, vastly expanding our criminal codes, especially in the \u201cwars\u201d against crime and drugs and deploying zero-tolerance policing. The result is that some 70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2014 a number equal to Americans with a college degree, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. We remain the nation that \u201cincarcerates a larger share of its population than any other,\u201d according to a recent Pew Research Center report. This despite the fact that crime in the United States is at a modern low.She was black, and the family brought a suit claiming racial discrimination. They ultimately won, but those who have tracked the implementation and consequences of zero-tolerance policies have documented how black and brown people are disproportionately punished by them.In the years since, similarly absurd incidents have become a feature of school life. Take the 2015 case of the sixth-grade Virginia boy referred to juvenile court and suspended for almost the entire year because he had a leaf in his backpack that administrators thought was marijuana. Even after tests confirmed the 11-year-old was in possession of a leaf from a maple tree, the suspension stood because the leaf resembled cannabis, and the state policy required that administrators notify police and possibly expel students for possessing \u201cimitation\u201d drugs. Widespread outrage over these kinds of cases has led some state legislatures, like Texas\u2019, to pass zero-tolerance reforms. But once zero tolerance has been adopted, it\u2019s not easy to undo the bureaucratic incentive to punish indiscriminately. This year, according to a report by Texas Appleseed and other public interest groups, more than 1,200 Texas schoolchildren were referred to law enforcement for making \u201cterroristic threats,\u201d a potential felony. One such \u201cthreat\u201d: a 12-year-old with a disability who made a gun with his fingers and pretended to shoot at make-believe creatures in a hallway. He was arrested.Usually at the beginning of a zero-tolerance campaign, those leading the charge promise it will vanquish the worst of the worst: the drug kingpins, the gang leaders, the serial sexual predators, the murderers. But it inevitably turns out there aren\u2019t very many of them. So the definition of what will not be tolerated starts expanding, allowing politicians and other moral arbiters to say they are cleansing society of those who commit any kind of lapse. People who urge a more proportionate, incremental and individualized response to complex problems are tarred as being some percentage \u2014 usually 100 \u2014 tolerant of the menaces that trouble us.A central example of this kind of category expansion is the sex-offender registry. It began more than 20 years ago after several horrific murders of children by serial predators. Today, around 900,000 people are on the registry. Exceedingly few of them are the kinds of criminals who prompted the list in the first place. One is an 18-year-old in New Hampshire who asked a 15-year-old of his acquaintance for sex. Nothing happened. But adults found out about the proposition, and because the 18-year-old made the request via computer, he is on the registry for life. Then there is the severely intellectually disabled Missouri man who was being molested by a younger male neighbor. The neighbor then convinced the man, who was then 26 years old and living with his parents, to expose himself to an underage female. Both the men were arrested, and the disabled man has been on the registry ever since. Because of his conviction, he can no longer participate in the Special Olympics or clear tables at a local restaurant where he used to work. The legal bills exhausted his parents\u2019 retirement funds. Despite the overwhelming evidence that zero-tolerance policies sweep up the harmless and the innocent, we are so habituated to thinking in zero-tolerance terms that when a new issue appears, it is often our default response. Some feminists, myself included, have raised this concern about this aspect of the #MeToo movement. We worry that a zero-tolerance approach could undermine the movement\u2019s moral authority by destroying the careers of men without first fairly assessing the allegations against them and by failing to make distinctions about a wide range of misconduct.Zero tolerance is also washing over corporations in the form of firings for speech that is deemed offensive. You can agree that Roseanne Barr deserved to be fired for her overtly racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett and also be concerned that people are losing their jobs for far less. Last December, a Netflix executive named Andy Yeatman was approached while coaching his daughter\u2019s soccer game and asked why an actor on a Netflix series who had been accused of rape had not been fired. Mr. Yeatman was not connected to that series, and to end the conversation he said such things were taken very seriously at Netflix, but maybe in this case the accusations weren\u2019t believed. He immediately regretted his remark \u2014 but it was too late. The woman who had approached him said she was a victim of the actor, and while still on the field, Mr. Yeatman got a call from a reporter. He was fired a few days later.There is nothing like audio of terrified children, accounts of their deplorable detention conditions and the realization some families may never be reunited to cause national revulsion at this iteration of the Trump administration\u2019s touted zero-tolerance stance. What happened is not only a moral outrage, but, in following the zero-tolerance playbook, has been a huge diversion of resources. The Department of Health and Human Services has \u201cburned through at least $40 million in the past two months for the care and reunification of migrant children,\u201d according to Politico.To prevent such future injustices, and to address the many continuing ones, we should adopt a new approach: zero tolerance for zero tolerance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Suffrage Movement Betrayed Black Women ", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "OpinionSupported byMr. Staples is a member of the editorial board.It became clear after the Civil War that black and white women had different views of why the right to vote was essential. White women were seeking the vote as a symbol of parity with their husbands and brothers. Black women, most of whom lived in the South, were seeking the ballot for themselves and their men, as a means of empowering black communities besieged by the reign of racial terror that erupted after Emancipation.The tension escalated in the run-up to the 15th Amendment, a provision that ostensibly barred the states from denying Negro men the right to vote. Reasonable people could, of course, disagree on the merits of who should first be given the vote \u2014 women or black men. Stanton, instead, embarked on a Klan-like tirade against the amendment. She warned that white woman would be degraded if Negro men preceded them into the franchise. Admiring historians have dismissed this as an unfortunate interlude in an exemplary life. By contrast, the historian Lori Ginzberg argues persuasively that racism and elitism were enduring features of the great suffragist\u2019s makeup and philosophy. Douglass cut to the central fallacy of the white suffragist push \u2014 that African-American women could magically separate their blackness from their femaleness.The 15th Amendment was, of course, ratified. Women would wait another 50 years for the 19th. Racism intensified among suffragists as they neared their goals. African-American luminaries like the noted anti-lynching crusader Ida B.

{"Headline": "Border Patrol\u2019s Last Line of Defense? It Isn\u2019t at the Border", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecurity measures in Texas start at the Rio Grande but extend deep into the United States, as agents and smugglers go to ever greater lengths to outfox one another.Migrants coming from Central America regularly pay more than $10,000, and Mexicans often fork over $6,000 just to cross into the United States and continue on to their intended destination. As the costs of human smuggling soar, the smuggling networks have greater resources to evade detection. So while people often think of the border as akin to a goal line that migrants are trying to cross, in many ways it\u2019s more like the 50-yard line.Border Patrol takes what it calls a \u201clayered approach.\u201d Here in the Rio Grande Valley, that starts with patrol boats on the muddy river. Next are 18-foot steel fences set back from the river, where agents patrol in trucks. In more remote areas, they use all-terrain vehicles or horses. Border Patrol officers smooth the dirt by the fence \u2014 almost like a Zamboni at an ice rink \u2014 with giant tires pulled behind a truck, so that later they can see fresh tracks left by migrants.Smugglers sometimes wrap migrants\u2019 shoes in scraps of fabric to try to obscure their footprints. And guides increasingly take the trouble to dress their charges in camouflage for the border crossing. There, agents have to rely on their instincts, Mr. Quintanilla said. In just seconds, they decide whether to send a vehicle, and its passengers and cargo, for a more thorough inspection.Agents are trained to observe incongruities when questioning a nervous driver, like a single key in the ignition \u2014 sometimes a sign of a vehicle being used for smuggling, since most people\u2019s car keys jangle on chains with house keys, work keys or knickknacks \u2014 or when cars ride low in the back where migrants may be hiding. In the 1980s, guides trying to connect drivers with migrants coming out of the brush would often leave an X or other mark along the side of the highway. Now cellphones and mapping apps allow for carefully choreographed pickups and drop-offs without leaving such obvious traces for agents to follow.\u201cI\u2019ve seen loads that used a combination of cellphones, sat phones and two-way radios, all three, to pull these off,\u201d said Benjamine Huffman, chief of strategic planning and analysis for the Border Patrol.It was so hot the day a photographer and I visited that one of the agents\u2019 dogs kept making a beeline for water when he was supposed to be sniffing out concealed humans and trafficked drugs. The agents have to endure exhaust fumes for entire shifts, day after day, that made me lightheaded in just an hour.Smugglers hide migrants in the trunks of cars, stacked in the beds of pickup trucks and covered with tarps or even locked inside toolboxes in the beds of pickup trucks. Agents have found migrants in the backs of dump trucks and buried in sawdust. Migrants have crammed themselves into all manner of compartments built to avoid detection.Transporting unauthorized migrants is a federal crime, and drivers expect to be well compensated for their risk. The payments vary, from a few hundred dollars to more than $1,000 per migrant. Criminal complaints reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with law enforcement officials show that not all drivers are members of smuggling networks. Some are recruited on Craigslist or Facebook; some drive a group to settle a debt.One woman, who was stopped last May on a ranch road in West Texas with three undocumented immigrants in her silver Mercedes, told officers she was expecting $6,000 to drive them two hours from Kinney County to San Antonio. She was sentenced to eight months in prison and three years of probation.Increasingly, smugglers are relying on 18-wheelers, locking migrants in the trailers, often hidden behind the loads of cargo. Last year, a migrant named Mart\u00edn G\u00f3mez Arellano died inside a concealed compartment in a tractor-trailer seized at the Falfurrias checkpoint. Agents found another migrant in the vehicle, but Mr. G\u00f3mez Arellano remained trapped in a 30-inch toolbox.Agents say they are trying to protect migrants from dangerous smuggling rings. \u201cThat\u2019s what they see them as: a dollar sign,\u201d said Frank Garza, a supervisor at the Falfurrias checkpoint. \u201cNot as a person, just an amount.\u201dEfforts to evade detection at the border and at checkpoints are nothing new. Illegal immigration peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million people were caught trying to sneak across the border. Spectacular examples have included people hiding in an engine block, behind a dashboard and even inside a passenger seat. Under President Trump, there is intensified emphasis on catching people entering illegally. Here in Falfurrias, Border Patrol is building an even bigger checkpoint just up the road, redoubling its efforts to uncover hidden migrants.Advertisement"}

I was astonished.The short-attention-span jolt of Twitter is perfect for a few specialized things: breaking news, viral links \u2014 and presidential hissy fits. But above all, it turns out, Twitter is perfect for jokes.As a child, when I heard jokes and watched sitcoms, I considered comedy to be a wonderful, ineffable mystery \u2014 like sex, or the Trinity. But the joke formats and memes of social media are training wheels, template-izing comedy for beginners. It\u2019s impossible to look through the microscope at the comedy petri dish all day and not start to pick up on its rhythms and mechanics. For better or for worse, we\u2019re all becoming comedy writers now, in a writer\u2019s room the size of a planet.But for comedy nerds, Twitter adds another addictive element: gamification. Every time I take out my phone, I can see with numerical precision exactly how funny (or unfunny) my last joke was. Earlier this year, I tweeted this: Once Joke Twitter had warped my brain and increased my comedy awareness, I started seeing a rising tide of comedy everywhere. Airlines were putting visual gags in their safety demonstration videos. Church marquees were now corny puns, not Bible verses. Nearly every big-bucks Super Bowl commercial was an absurdist comedy sketch, with ad agencies all hoping to out-weird the others and go viral. We were getting our news, obviously, from comedy shows. For most of human history, laughter and comedy were scarce resources in bleak times. The more the better! But that\u2019s not remotely true anymore. I have thousands of hours of comedy waiting for me on streaming video, essentially free, that I will probably never watch. Hundreds of jokes are scrolling through my Twitter feed every hour. This crazy overabundance, I\u2019m now convinced, has not been a net good for me.There\u2019s no way to escape our new comedy-first culture; there doesn\u2019t even seem to be an alternative anymore. When comic irony is synonymous with hipness, any other sensibility, whether it\u2019s religious solemnity or emo-style earnestness, just seems stodgy and out of touch by comparison. Perhaps that\u2019s the worst part of my Twitter joke habit: it\u2019s changing who I am in real life. My snarky repartee is smoother than ever, but in situations when a more heartfelt connection is required, I find that I\u2019m a little out of my element. Those aren\u2019t emotional muscles that we exercise as much anymore. Part of me wants to opt out of the social media dopamine loop altogether. But my hedonic treadmill is turned up so high that it\u2019s hard to make the leap. Real life seems drab now, compared to the high-speed barrage of ironic banter online. It\u2019s the dream of my sitcom-watching childhood come true: nothing but punch lines as far as the eye can see.Ken Jennings is the author, most recently, of \u201cPlanet Funny: How Comedy Took Over Our Culture.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As Alasdair MacIntyre argued many years ago, you can\u2019t know what to do unless you know what story you are a part of. Story is more important than policies.We post-Cold War Americans haven\u2019t really settled on what story we are a part of. We\u2019ll flock to anybody who can tell us a story that feels true. Back in the 1980s, the Democrats told two different stories. One was the compassion story associated with Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy: Too many Americans are poor, marginalized and left behind. We must care for our brothers and sisters because we are all one family.The other was the brainpower/meritocracy story associated with Gary Hart and later the New Democrats: Americans are masters at innovation. We must use our best minds to come up with innovative plans to solve our problems and head into a new technological century.I don\u2019t hear those two stories much anymore. The Democrats are emphasizing fighting grit these days, not compassion or technocratic expertise. The second is the multicultural story: American history has been marked by systems of oppression. Those who have been oppressed \u2014 women, African-Americans, Latinos \u2014 need to stand together and fight for justice. Well, we should humbly admit we\u2019re in virgin territory at a time when all the tectonic plates are shifting.

They did it because if you throw race into your economic arguments you end up turning off potential allies in swing states like Wisconsin, Iowa and Pennsylvania. They did it because if you throw economics into your race arguments you end up dividing your coalitions on those issues. In brief, Democrats have stayed away from this narrative because the long hoped-for alliance between oppressed racial minorities and the oppressed white working class has never materialized, and it looks very far from materializing now.Maybe this year is different, but for 100 years, Democrats have tended to win with youthful optimism and not anger and indignation. The Democrats who have won nationally almost all ran on generational change \u2014 on tired old America versus the possibilities of new America: F.D.R.\u2019s New Deal, J.F.K.\u2019s New Frontier, Bill Clinton\u2019s bridge to the 21st century and Obama\u2019s hope and change. If I had to advise on a Democratic narrative I\u2019d start with three premises: First, by 2020 everybody will be exhausted by the climate of negativism and hostility. Second, the core long-term fear is American decline; are we losing our mojo? Third, communities and nations don\u2019t come together when they talk about their problems; they come together when they do something on behalf of their children. This story pushes people toward reconciliation. It is future-oriented. It points to a task that we urgently need to undertake. But who knows what will work. We\u2019re walking into the unprecedented.Advertisement"}

Republicans may grumble over this, but they are Trump\u2019s indecent enablers.Opinion ColumnistThis time, Trump\u2019s crossed the line! He\u2019s done! He\u2019s finished! He\u2019s toast!Yet he\u2019s not finished.Yet he\u2019s not done.Now, Trump wants us to believe he wished to deploy a double negative, no less. A double negative! What he meant to say was: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it WOULDN\u2019T be Russia.\u201dThis is nonsense. Simple declarative sentences are also available, as in: \u201cI believe that, in an act of aggression, Russian interfered in the 2016 election.\u201d They have particular impact when the Russian president is standing next to you.No, Trump was in full Putin-pandering mode. He said that Putin was \u201cextremely strong and powerful in his denial.\u201d Besides, Russia is a place where Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 emails \u201cwouldn\u2019t be gone so easily.\u201dYuck. Yet Trump\u2019s not finished.Even if he does daily damage to America\u2019s standing in the world, conducts \u201cdiplomacy\u201d with no preparation and no coordination with allies, believes he can wing it on the world stage with his rabble-rousing rally shtick, and, as William Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it to me, \u201cleaves Putin looking bemused at this gift that keeps on giving.\u201dYet the lines Trump crosses \u2014 the endless indications that, as James Fallows put it in The Atlantic, he is either Russia\u2019s \u201cconscious tool\u201d or \u201cuseful idiot\u201d \u2014 never bring about his downfall.That is, above all, due to the corruption and debasement of the Republican Party, which has turned into the Trump party, roared on by the right-wing talk machine honed over many years now through Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and the rest. The machine that says that Democrats are evil and want to blow up the American way of life \u2014 guns, God and all. The machine that said Barack Obama was a Kenyan socialist.\u201cRepublicans in Congress have responded in a spineless and morally vacant way to this president who is a horrible embarrassment,\u201d Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, told me. \u201cThey know that, other than on immigration and trade, Trump has no policy views. Their attitude is, \u2018anything we can pass, he\u2019ll sign, we can manipulate him, get the judges we want.\u2019 But they\u2019re trapped in a culture that\u2019s almost cultlike and know that if they challenge Trump, the base will turn on them.\u201dMost Republicans stuck with Nixon well after indications of wrongdoing emerged. But as the Watergate evidence piled up, they did begin to desert him. Still, with the exception of Senator John McCain, Ornstein does not see the likes today of Hugh Scott, John Rhodes, Howard Baker, Barry Goldwater, William Cohen and other leading Republicans who broke with Nixon.And so Trump is not done, not yet, not by any means.\u201cThe framers were very much aware that we could end up with an immoral demagogue,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cThey built in safeguards, the most significant being an independent Congress, with power of the purse, oversight, confirmation, impeachment. But at every level, this Congress has failed miserably. Republicans have done nothing but try and protect Trump, despite outrageous ineptitude, cabinet offices being manipulated to make money, children treated in criminal fashion \u2014 no oversight hearings, nothing! This is the biggest abdication I have ever seen.\u201dYes, some Republican lawmakers did raise their voices to denounce Trump\u2019s interactions with Putin, or at least express confidence in American intelligence agencies. But these were mere words \u2014 too little, too late. They are complicit in Trump\u2019s Russian complicity, his base, possibly criminal, flirtation.The president is not done.Soon, there may be indictments from Robert Mueller, the special counsel, of high officials or members of Trump\u2019s family. What then? Ornstein\u2019s nightmare scenario: Trump fires Mueller, pardons himself and everyone else, sends his followers into the street, and, after the inevitable bloodshed, declares martial law.Not yet.

{"Headline": "American Accused of Being ISIS Fighter in Syria Faces Prosecution in U.S.", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCoalition-backed forces in northern Syria have captured a 28-year-old United States citizen who is believed to have been fighting for the Islamic State, one of only a handful of Americans to be apprehended on the battlefield, officials said.Ibraheem Musaibli, who is from Dearborn, Mich., was seized by the Syrian Democratic Forces this month as he tried to escape the Middle Euphrates River Valley, where the American-backed militia has been working to root out one of the last pockets of Islamic State control.Mr. Musaibli was transferred to a holding facility, where he was identified as a member of the militant group by another detainee, according to one administration official briefed on the arrest.The authorities have set in motion a plan to bring him to the United States for prosecution, along with an Indiana woman whose husband was an Islamic State member and who has also been detained.Mr. Musaibli is expected to face charges of supporting the terrorist group, also known as ISIS.Spokesmen for the State, Justice and Defense Departments, and for the F.B.I., declined to comment.The authorities say that Ms. Elhassani traveled to Syria with her husband and children. When her husband was killed fighting for ISIS, they say, she and her four children, the youngest of whom is 8 months old, made their way to a refugee camp guarded by the Syrian Democratic Forces, where she identified herself to local authorities.Ms. Elhassani\u2019s 10-year-old son once appeared in an ISIS propaganda video pledging to carry out attacks against the West, raising fears that he had been radicalized, officials said. She and her children will be transported on the same military flight carrying Mr. Musaibli back to the United States, they said.Only a few dozen Americans are known to have traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State.Mr. Musaibli had maintained a low profile and did not appear in the George Washington database, although he was known to law enforcement officials.As a teenager in Michigan, he dropped out of high school to help his father run a perfume store, according to his younger brother. He married, had a son and eventually moved to Yemen.Officials believe he traveled to Syria in approximately 2015.Contacted through Facebook Messenger, Mr. Musaibli\u2019s younger brother Abe Musaibli, expressed disbelief at the thought that his sibling had joined ISIS. \u201cMy brother is a saint,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u201dAbe Musaibli said he was not aware that his brother had been taken into custody. The last time they spoke, he said, was two months earlier.Ibraheem Musaibli sent a series of text messages to his family after leaving for Syria in which he confirmed his intention to join the Islamic State, said two officials from different agencies who were briefed on the matter.In the years that followed, he became disillusioned with the militants and sought a way out, the officials said, and his family reached out to the F.B.I. A brief negotiation ensued, said one official, in which the F.B.I. offered to bring him back to the United States in exchange for him turning himself in. He refused, and the negotiations broke down, one official said.Mr. Musaibli\u2019s capture is only the second known instance of a suspected male American ISIS member being captured in Syria.The first man was apprehended in September at a checkpoint on an active battlefield, adjacent to territory controlled by ISIS, according to court filings. They identify him only as \u201cJohn Doe.\u201dIn his possession was a thumb drive containing internal Islamic State records, including bomb-making materials, court records show. His name, moreover, appears on an internal ISIS intake form, the detailed application that newcomers to the group are asked to fill out upon arrival in ISIS-controlled territory, the records say.After the Justice Department decided that it lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him, the military proposed releasing him back in Syria. He is fighting that plan in court.The John Doe case is emblematic of the challenges that Western democracies face when their citizens are captured fighting for ISIS.So far, Britain, France and other European nations have refused to take back the majority of their citizens being held in prisons in Syria, fearing that the cases against them would fall apart under the normal rules of criminal prosecution.The John Doe case has made military officials leery about taking custody of other detainees. But if Mr. Musaibli is facing a sealed indictment, as officials have indicated, that could make prosecution easier.\u201cThe difference is that here you have a case that is already set up,\u201d said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington\u2019s Program on Extremism.\u201cThat is a very different animal than picking up someone on the battlefield who is nowhere in the system,\u201d Mr. Hughes said, adding, \u201cIf he is already indicted, then you have enough to build a case, because you had enough to build the indictment.\u201dAdam Goldman and Karam Shoumali contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Don\u2019t Panic.", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you want to beat Trump, centrism is not the answer.Opinion ColumnistClearly, the time has come for a serious national conversation. And so political insiders across the land are asking: Has the Democratic Party become too extreme?I\u2019m not wholly unsympathetic to people of good faith who want Democrats to win in November, but who fear that America is more conservative than left-wing activists like to believe. I grew up at a time when Democrats were deeply afraid of liberal overreach. For many of the people who taught me about politics, the debacle of George McGovern\u2019s 1972 rout was formative. Its lessons were reinforced by the overwhelming defeat of Michael Dukakis, who was painted as soft on crime and mocked by George H.W. Bush for being a \u201ccard-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.,\u201d as if concern for civil liberties were shameful. I wasn\u2019t old enough to vote when Bill Clinton was first elected, but I remember what a relief it was when he broke the Republicans\u2019 12-year stranglehold on the White House, and how necessary and worthwhile his compromises seemed. Now, however, Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat has overshadowed McGovern\u2019s as the Democratic Party\u2019s paradigmatic trauma. There are several lessons you can draw from her loss, some of them conflicting \u2014 some voters saw her as too corporate, others as too liberal. But it\u2019s clear that in a polarized electorate, grass-roots fervor and a candidate\u2019s charisma matter a lot, and an agenda that seems too modest can be as risky as one that appears overly ambitious. Centrists might not think these are good ideas, but they are not wild fantasies; they represent efforts to grapple with the chronic economic insecurity that is the enemy of political stability. Democrats will not defeat Trump and his increasingly fanatical, revanchist party by promising the restoration of what came before him; the country is desperate for a vision of something better. Whether or not you share that vision, if you truly believe that Trump is a threat to democracy, you should welcome politics that inspire people to come to democracy\u2019s rescue. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Archaeologists in China Discover the Oldest Stone Tools Outside Africa", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterChipped rocks found in western China indicate that human ancestors ventured from Africa earlier than previously believed. The find may add a new chapter to the story of hominin evolution, suggesting that some of these species left Africa far earlier than once believed and managed to travel over 8,000 miles east of their evolutionary birthplace. The age of the Chinese tools suggests that the hominins who made them were neither tall nor big-brained. Instead, they may have been small bipedal apes, with brains about the size of a chimpanzee\u2019s.\u201cThe implications of all this are large,\u201d said Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cWe must re-evaluate our understanding of human prehistory in Eurasia.\u201d Asian fossils showed that these hominins were about as tall as living humans and had fairly big brains. While chimpanzees have brains about a third the size of ours, Homo erectus had a brain about two-thirds as large. In Africa, paleoanthropologists were discovering an even longer fossil record of hominins. The oldest yet found date back more than six million years. The earliest hominins could walk on two legs, but they were short and only had chimpanzee-size brains. By 1.9 million years ago, Homo erectus or some close relative was striding across East Africa. Many paleoanthropologists came to assume that Homo erectus were the first migrants to leave Africa. But this picture grew blurry in the 1990s, as older hominin bones were discovered in other parts of Asia. In Dmanisi, Georgia, scientists uncovered remarkably ancient fossils, some as old as 1.75 million years. Some stone tools found there appeared to be even older: 1.82 million years. The Dmanisi hominins didn\u2019t much resemble Homo erectus: They were short and had tiny brains. In China, researchers also found evidence of early hominin occupation. In 1964, researchers unearthed a Homo erectus skull in a western county called Lantian. Initial estimates found it to be 1.15 million years old. The researchers decided to make a thorough search of the gully, clambering across the steep slope to search for more artifacts. \u201cWorking up and down it can be hair-raising at times,\u201d said Robin Dennell, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Exeter who joined Dr. Zhu\u2019s team in 2010.The risk paid off. The researchers found over a hundred stone tools embedded in 17 geologic layers of the gully. But it was painstakingly slow work, because the researchers wanted to make a compelling case that these really were tools made by hominins \u2014 and that they really were ancient. \u201cWe wanted to make it watertight and bombproof,\u201d said Dr. Dennell.In the new study, he and his colleagues argue that the stones could not have been naturally damaged. The surrounding rock had formed from grassland soil, which didn\u2019t contain stones the size and shape of the tools. Instead, the researchers argue, the hominins at Lantian must have traveled miles away to mountain streams to find the right stones for making tools. The hominins carried the tools with them to use in gathering food, perhaps using sharp-edged stones to carve meat from carcasses. To determine the age of the tools, the researchers took advantage of the planet\u2019s changing magnetic field. From time to time, Earth\u2019s magnetic field flips, turning north to south. Magnetic minerals in the soil and ocean are pushed into alignment with the field; when they are trapped in rocks, they still point in the telltale direction. Geophysicists have precisely determined the timing of these magnetic flips, which have taken place at the same time all around the world. It\u2019s a useful way to date the material found in layers of rock.The layers in the gully formed over many hundreds of thousands of years. And the oldest tools were neatly sandwiched between rocks that formed between two flips of the magnetic field: one 2.14 million years ago, and a second about 1.85 million years ago.Dr. Dennell and his colleagues estimate that the tools are close to the far end of that window: 2.12 million years old. That would make these tools the oldest evidence of hominins ever found outside Africa. And that makes it unlikely that the first hominins to expand out of Africa were Homo erectus. Instead, Dr. Dennell speculated, a much earlier branch of the human tree ventured forth. The trigger for that migration? Maybe it was figuring out how to make sharp stone tools.\u201cSuddenly you had a primate that could obtain meat from a carcass, and it opened up a new world for them,\u201d Dr. Dennell said. \u201cThat simple technology was enough to get them out of Africa and right across Asia.\u201dRick Potts, the head of the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program, found the new study compelling, offering strong evidence that the stones were indeed tools and that they were extremely old. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said.Dr. Potts did not think that the hominins of Lantian were short and small-brained, though. Instead, he speculated that there are Homo erectus-like fossils older than 2.1 million years waiting to be discovered back in Africa.But John J. Shea, a paleoanthropologist at Stony Brook University, is yet to be convinced that anyone crafted the stones. At the very least, he argued, Dr. Dennell and his colleagues should make a statistical comparison between these supposed tools and naturally damaged rocks. And Dr. Shea was leery of relying on tools alone for evidence that hominins were in Asia over two million years ago. \u201cBottom line \u2014 no hominin fossils, no hominins,\u201d he said.Since paleoanthropologists have already found a 1.63 million-year-old skull in the Lantian province, Dr. Dennell said it was possible that researchers might someday find a far more ancient hominin fossil lurking alongside the tools.\u201cMind you, it will take some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be worth looking.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thai Cave Rescue: The Watery Trap Is Now Empty", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by[UPDATED at 11:58 a.m. Eastern, July 10]The cave is empty again.With the rescued safe, it was time for the rescuers to make their own exit.On Tuesday, after 18 days of drama that gripped Thailand and the world, the last people exited the flooded cave complex in which 12 young soccer players and their coach had been trapped.Here are the latest developments.\u2022 All members of the Wild Boars soccer team and their 25-year-old coach are safe at the Chiang Rai hospital, the authorities said.It took dozens of divers, hundreds of volunteers and 18 days to do it, but the rescue operation at Tham Luang Cave has succeeded.The final stage of the extraction mission began at 10:08 a.m. local time on Tuesday, with 19 divers dispatched to the remote cavern where the last four members of the Wild Boar soccer team and their coach have been sheltering since June 23.\u201cTwelve Boars and coach are out of the cave. Everyone is safe. Now we are waiting to welcome our frogmen,\u201d read a post on the Thai Navy SEAL Facebook page on Tuesday night.Soon after, another post went up: \u201cWe are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what. All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave.\u201dAround 9:40 p.m., Thai officials confirmed that the four-member military team that had stayed with the boys in their cavern for days had also left the cave, together. With that, the rescue operation is officially complete.On Sunday and Monday, around 100 divers, medical personnel and support staff evacuated eight soccer teammates. The rescue effort involved guiding boys with little in the way of swimming skills through passageways filled with churning water.The operation did claim one life: Saman Gunan, a 38-year-old former Navy SEAL diver who volunteered to help in the search and rescue. He died early on Friday after carrying air tanks into the flooded cave, losing consciousness underwater after running out of air himself.At certain points, the underwater crevices through which people had to squeeze were barely wide enough to accommodate an adult human body, according to both Narongsak Osottanakorn, the head of the search operation, and a diver who had explored the cave complex.In a news conference after the rescue, Mr. Narongsak said that all of the team members were safe at the hospital at Chiang Rai.\u201cI would like to say we have good news: We got five people out safely,\u201d he said. He added that family members would be able to visit the boys tonight, though separated by a window.They will spend at least a week warding off possible infection, according to Dr. Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, the permanent secretary to Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health.Two of the boys rescued Sunday are suffering from mild pneumonia, said Dr. Tosthep Buthong, the Chiang Rai public health chief, at a news conference on Tuesday morning.Jintrakarn Sriwanithkul, 18, a student at the Maesai Prasitsart School attended by six of the team members, was at the school as the news broke that the entire team had been saved.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing news!\u201d he said.Like many of the players who became trapped, he had been inside Tham Luang Cave before.\u201cWhen I first heard about them being missing, I thought they\u2019d come out in two to three days because they knew the cave well,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s scary there but also pretty,\u201d he added. \u201cI guess a lesson from this is that natural disasters can happen, especially during rainy season.\u201dIn the town of Mae Sai, the abbot at the temple where the young coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, works, was overjoyed.\u201cI\u2019m so happy, but it\u2019s not just for Ek and the team,\u201d said the abbot, Prayuth Jetiyanukarn. \u201cThe whole world has been watching over these 18 days and they are celebrating with us.\u201dThe abbot was overcome, and started crying.\u201cBecause Ek is an orphan, I feel like his father. And Ek felt responsible for the 12 Wild Boars so I felt like I had 13 worries on my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 18 days but it felt like years.\u201d\u2014 Hannah Beech, Muktita Suhartono and Navaon Siradapuvadol, in Mae SaiThe world\u2019s fixation on the successful Thailand rescue was not lost on President Trump, who included a congratulatory message to the saviors of the soccer team in his daily litany of Twitter postings, which otherwise focused on attacking his critics, extolling his latest nominee to the Supreme Court and complaining about NATO, Iran and trade deals he regards as unfair.Mr. Peray, 54, said he is from the French Alps and has lived in Bangkok, the Thai capital, for 30 years. \u201cPolitics is my main interest,\u201d he said.Yet another cartoon made a sharp point about Thai politics.

The words \u201cThai democracy\u201d are written on a wall behind her.\u201cSorry, but it might take a longer time than expected to get you out of here,\u201d the cartoon version of Mr. Prayuth tells Lady Liberty. Mr. Prayuth is a military general who seized power from a democratically elected government in a bloodless coup in 2014, and has repeatedly postponed plans for free elections.But overall, Mr. Peray\u2019s cartoons about the cave rescue are poignant tributes to the trapped boys, served with a dash of whimsy. A recurring word is \u201cHOPE,\u201d in capital letters, and his characters include an angel in white, a Buddhist monk in orange robes and an earnest elephant wearing a searchlight.Mr. Peray said he meant hope not only for the boys, but mankind.\u201cThis story is different than everyday ugly politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is making us feel good about ourselves that mankind is not completely lost after all.\u201d\u2014Mike Ives, in Hong KongOn Sunday, in the town of Mae Sai, where the boys\u2019 soccer team is based, residents and family members were cheering the sound of every helicopter and ambulance they heard, in an uproar of celebration at the news that the first four boys had been taken out of the cave.\u201cI am so happy!\u201d said Kamon Chanthapun, an adviser to the team. \u201cI was so worried because they are just children, stuck for so long in the dark.\u201dYoung men rode in the back of flatbed trucks, cruising the streets and cheering.Mae Sai is a town that thrives on border commerce. Some residents have relatives across the border in Myanmar, and thousands cross over from that country each day to work, trade or attend school in Thailand.One of the boys in the cave, Adul Sam-on, is a student at the Ban Wiang Phan school here. Inside, students had written messages on heart-shaped sticky notes placed up in a big heart shape on a bulletin board with optimistic messages. \u201cHopefully our friend can come out safely,\u201d read one.The head coach for the soccer team, Nopparat Khanthawong, who did not enter the cave with the others two weeks ago, said: \u201cI\u2019m happy that children are coming out. All I can do is to send my prayers and support to the children and rescuers.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the physical condition of the boys. Please keep them coming!\u201d\u2014 Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono, in Mae SaiThat may surprise people from countries where swim lessons are a rite of passage for most children. But in Southeast Asia, not knowing how to swim is normal.Dr. Linnan said it was not uncommon to see rates of swimming in low- and middle-income countries that is \u201cwell below\u201d 20 percent, even among sailors, fishermen and others who earn their living on the water.Dr. Linnan, a former medical epidemiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said Thailand has made \u201cenormous strides\u201d in the last decade toward preventing child injury and morbidity. For example, he said, the government established a national day care program, a move that helped to prevent drownings among very young children.But he said he hoped recent events at Tham Luang Cave would be a \u201cteachable moment,\u201d highlighting a need on a national scale for further efforts to prevent drowning.\u201cI hope that will be the silver lining in this cloud,\u201d he said.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong KongOne boy promised to do his chores when he gets home. Another asked for barbecued pork.In letters home, written on water-stained paper and posted Saturday on the Thai Navy SEALs\u2019 Facebook page, the trapped boys and their soccer coach sought to reassure their families that they were in good hands and in good spirits.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d wrote Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 13, who is called Bew. \u201cI\u2019ve been away for two weeks. I\u2019ll help Mom every day. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy in here,\u201d wrote Panumat Saengdee, 14, known as Mix. \u201cThe SEAL team takes very good care of us.\u201dThe boys\u2019 parents had written to them earlier. The letters, carried by divers making six-hour trips in each direction, are the first direct communication between the parents and their sons. Attempts to establish a phone line to the cavern where the boys are trapped have not yet been successful.Divers navigated flooded passages, with some openings as small as 3 feet wide, to rescue the soccer team.\u201cMom, Dad, I love you guys, and little sister Toi,\u201d wrote Pipat Poti, 15, whose nickname is Nick. \u201cIf I get out please take me to a pork barbecue place. I love you, Dad, Mom.\u201dThe boys\u2019 coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, wrote to the parents as a group, promising to take care of them as best as he could. The parents had written to him, assuring him that they did not blame him for the situation.\u201cThank you all for the support,\u201d the coach wrote. \u201cI deeply apologize to the parents.\u201dHe also wrote to his own family members \u2014 an aunt and his grandmother \u2014 asking them not to worry too much about him. \u201cAunty, can you please tell Granny to prepare vegetable juice and pork snacks?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll eat them when I get out. Love you all.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono, at the Tham Luang CaveOn Friday, a Thai Navy SEAL commander said the oxygen level in the boys\u2019 cavern was about 15 percent and falling. That wasa concern, because levels below 16 percent can cause oxygen depletion, a condition known as hypoxia.Under normal conditions, the air people breathe consists of about 21 percent oxygen, 78 percent nitrogen and one percent argon and other gases, including carbon dioxide. When the mix changes, humans can feel a range of health effects, subtle and otherwise.But Mr. Novosel said an oxygen concentration of 15 percent or less would be \u201creally problematic\u201d for anyone trapped inside. It would allow people to survive, but make even basic activities difficult, he said.On Saturday, Mr. Narongsak, the official leading the rescue operation, said that at one point the oxygen level had been so low in a chamber where many rescuers were working that nonessential personnel were sent out of it.He also said that rescuers were concerned about the level of carbon dioxide in the cavern where the boys are trapped.People naturally release carbon dioxide when they exhale. Professor Cheung said that the carbon-dioxide concentration in air was generally no more than about 0.2 percent, and that a concentration of more than about 5 percent would cause a person to feel breathless. At about 10 percent, he said, a person would become unresponsive.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong Kong, and Richard C. Paddock at the Tham Luang CaveA retired Thai Navy SEAL diver died in Tham Luang Cave when he ran out of air while underwater, the Thai authorities said on Friday.The diver, a volunteer identified as Saman Gunan, 38, ran out of air while placing spare air tanks along the route to the cavern where the boys are trapped.Mr. Saman ran into trouble at about 1 a.m. on Friday, and efforts to revive him were not successful, said Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew, the Thai Navy SEAL commander.The operation to rescue the boys is now focused on delivering air and running a communications line to the group\u2019s location from a nearby cavern known as Chamber Three. The distance from there to the group is about 1,700 meters, officials say, and one part of the effort now is to run a hose across that distance to pump air into the team\u2019s chamber.For now, the only way to communicate between officials coordinating the rescue effort and the group in the cave is by messenger, a journey of about six hours one way.Installing a communications line would facilitate any rescue operation and allow the boys to talk to their families.Four Thai Navy SEALs, including a doctor, are with the boys, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old soccer coach.\u201cWe are praying for each of you, for each of the families and for these children,\u201d said Mario Sepulveda, who was the second of more than 30 miners pulled to safety in a specially built capsule after being trapped for more than two months, in a rescue televised around the world.Mr. Sepulveda, who was nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d for his exuberant exit from the rescue capsule, became a motivational speaker after the incident.In the video released Wednesday, he said he wanted to send \u201ca lot of strength to the authorities and the families of these 12 children who are underground.\u201dHis message was echoed by others who went through the ordeal in Chile.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be scared,\u201d Omar Reygadas, another miner, told The Associated Press earlier this week. \u201cBecause we were scared, too. Our tears also ran. Even as adult men, we cried.\u201d\u2014 Palko KaraszMae Bua Chaicheun, a rice farmer who lives near Tham Luang Cave, wanted to help in the search for the missing boys. So last week, she volunteered for five days at the rescue center, delivering drinking water to soldiers and helping clean up.When she returned home to her village in the flatlands a few miles from the cave, she found that her fields were flooded with water that had been pumped from the caves in the effort to reach the 12 boys and their soccer coach.She had already prepared the soil on her five acres and was about to plant rice. Now she has to start over.But she is not concerned about that. Most importantly, the boys were found alive.When she saw the news that the boys were found, she said she put her hands together in front of the TV and thanked Buddha.\u201cI had goose bumps,\u201d she said.She is one of dozens of farmers downstream from Tham Luang Cave whose fields have been flooded by the surplus water pumped out to reduce flood levels in the cavern.The government is offering compensation to farmers whose land was flooded. In her case, that would have come to about $430, plus seed and fertilizer. But she said she didn\u2019t want to add to the government\u2019s burden in the midst of the search, and did not register.\u201cI am more than willing to have my rice fields flooded as long as the children are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys are like my children.\u201d\u2014 Richard C. Paddock, in Nong Oo Village\u201cI was very surprised,\u201d he told a reporter after the award was announced in 2012. \u201cPeople would say in jest that I should have got an M.B.E.,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something I have really thought about.\u201d\u2014 Mike IvesVideo clips taken by a Thai Navy SEAL member showed the 12 boys and their soccer coach in the cave, looking skinny but seemingly healthy and in good spirits.Divers reached them on Monday night and have been taking them food, medicine and other supplies as officials and diving experts try to figure out how to extract them from the Tham Luang Cave.Dr. Phak mentions the rigor of that training and, holding the disinfectant, tells the boys: \u201cI had wounds all over my body. I couldn\u2019t take a bath. To heal the wounds, I had to apply this all over.\u201dThe diver taking the video says to a boy who appears to be one of the youngest, \u201cShow me your smile.\u201dThe boy smiles shyly and holds up two fingers.\u201cWhat do the 13 of you want to say to your fans?\u201d the doctor asks. \u201cEverybody in this world has been following your news.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono and Richard C.

{"Headline": "G.M. Used Graffiti in a Car Ad. Should the Artist Be Paid?", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time when graffiti was perceived to be a scourge, a public nuisance made by outlaws who sprayed their work on subway cars then slipped into the shadows, occasionally pursued by the police.The law, however, is struggling to catch up with the change in taste and culture, especially when it comes to the issue of when graffiti \u2014 an ephemeral form of art \u2014 deserves the safeguards of a copyright. This month a federal judge in California will entertain exactly that question as he hears oral arguments in a copyright lawsuit that could determine if graffiti wins new protections, or if companies can use it for commercial purposes without having to compensate the artists who create it.For just that reason, court papers say, a freelance photographer working with General Motors used the mural in 2016 as the backdrop for a series of photos for a Cadillac ad campaign called \u201cArt of the Drive.\u201d G.M. posted the photos on its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts without Mr. Falkner\u2019s knowledge or consent. So he sued the company in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, where the photographer is based, claiming that G.M. had infringed on his mural\u2019s copyright. A hearing to consider arguments in the case is scheduled for Monday.In theory, federal copyright law grants broad safeguards to graffiti; any original creative work that is \u201cfixed in a tangible medium of expression\u201d is automatically protected by a copyright. But not all graffiti is the same, and the courts have only just started to consider whether legal distinctions can be drawn between commissioned and unauthorized graffiti; or if a few words scribbled in the bathroom of a bar deserve the same protections as the works of established artists like Mr. Falkner, who has shown his pieces in galleries across the United States and Europe.In 2014, three graffiti artists \u2014 among them Jason Williams, who uses the tagging name Revok \u2014 sued the fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, claiming he had infringed on their copyrights by borrowing parts of a mural they had painted in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District in a line of clothes, shoes and handbags. The case was settled out of court for undisclosed terms before a judge could consider the merits of the case.Mr. Falkner\u2019s case is set to turn on another unsettled question of copyright law. Last month, lawyers for G.M. sought to end his lawsuit by claiming in court papers that the company was allowed to use his parking garage mural because of a provision in the law that says images of \u201carchitectural works\u201d do not have copyright protections. In their papers, the lawyers argued that the parking garage was itself an architectural work and that Mr. Falkner\u2019s mural was not protected under the law because it was \u201cincorporated into a building.\u201d\u201cIf the parking structure is a \u2018building,\u2019 then that is the end of the analysis,\u201d G.M.\u2019s lawyers wrote. They added: \u201cJoe Public should not be required to research the history of the building and hire architectural experts before he snaps a photograph.\u201dLouis Petrich, the automaker\u2019s lead lawyer, declined to be interviewed. But Mr. Falkner\u2019s lawyer, Jeff Gluck, who also represented Mr. Williams, disputed G.M.\u2019s line of reasoning.Last week, Mr. Gluck filed his own court papers, suggesting that the architectural exemption was put in place to protect the public from being sued for taking and posting photos of significant structures like the Washington Monument or the Space Needle in Seattle. If a parking garage \u2014 even one covered in art \u2014 could be construed as a significant structure, Mr. Gluck maintained, it would have widespread implications.\u201cIf GM\u2019s view prevailed,\u201d he wrote, \u201call graffiti art that exists on a building \u2014 that is, most graffiti art \u2014 would suddenly be unprotected by copyright.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "8 Suspect Claims From the Trump-Putin News Conference ", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact Check of the DayPresident Trump contradicted U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and President Vladimir V. Putin said he didn\u2019t know that Mr. Trump was in Russia in 2013. \u201cMy people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it\u2019s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\u201cYou have groups that are wondering why the F.B.I. never took the server \u2014 haven\u2019t they taken the server. \u201c\u201cThe government has uncovered no evidence that your client violated federal law with respect to the House computer systems. Particularly, the government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House members\u2019 offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information.\u201d This is false.Mr. Trump was responding to a question that was meant for Mr. Putin, about why Americans should believe the Russian president\u2019s statement that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election. Instead, Mr. Trump jumped in to claim that the \u201cconcept\u201d of Russian election interference did not emerge until after the November 2016 vote. In fact, the Democratic National Committee, congressional Democrats and the Obama administration had sounded the alarms months before the election. As for his claim that the Electoral College is \u201cmuch more advantageous for Democrats,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that Democrats have lost two out of the past five presidential electoral votes, despite winning the popular vote. His claim that he beat Mrs. Clinton \u201ceasily\u201d is also dubious. Mr. Trump\u2019s share of Electoral College votes ranked 46 out of 58 elections. He also lost the popular vote by the third largest margin among winning presidential candidates since 1824. Mr. Trump was responding to a Russian reporter who said the American president had called Mr. Putin \u201can adversary, a rival.\u201d Mr. Trump denied that he had ever used those words. Here is what he said in that interview: \u201cWell, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn\u2019t think of the European Union, but they\u2019re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn\u2019t mean they are bad. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It means that they are competitive.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be competing \u2014 as you know, the United States is now \u2014 or soon will be, but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\u201cWhen President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn\u2019t even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow.\u201d \u2014 Vladimir PutinIn November 2013, Mr. Trump hosted the Miss Universe pageant in a suburb of Moscow. Mr. Putin\u2019s claim of ignorance of Mr. Trump\u2019s presence is contradicted by Mr. Trump himself, as well as two other people. \u201cFor instance, we can bring up the Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u2014 Vladimir PutinBill Browder is a London-based financier who has led an international campaign against Russian human rights abusers. Mr. Putin\u2019s estimate of the amount of money that Mr. Browder\u2019s associates contributed to the Clinton campaign is overstated. Daniel Ziff also donated between $50,001 and $100,000 to the Clinton family\u2019s charitable foundation in 2015.

{"Headline": "Motherhood in the Age of Fear", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "OpinionWomen are being harassed and even arrested for making perfectly rational parenting decisions. Supported byMs. Brooks is a writer. CHICAGO \u2014 I was on my way home from dropping my kids off at preschool when a police officer called to ask if I was aware there was an outstanding warrant for my arrest.\u201cNo, no,\u201d I told him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201dI needed to call my husband, but my fingers were shaking. I don\u2019t remember if I was crying when he answered, only that he was saying he couldn\u2019t understand me, that I needed to calm down, to tell him what had happened.What happened began over a year before on a cool March day in 2011, at the end of a visit with my parents in Virginia. I needed to run an errand before our flight home to Chicago, and my son, then 4, didn\u2019t want to get out of the car.\u201cCome on,\u201d I said.\u201cNo, no, no! I wait here.\u201dI took a deep breath. I knew what I was supposed to do. But I was tired. I was late. I didn\u2019t want, at that moment, to deal with a meltdown. And there was something else: a small, quiet voice I\u2019d been hearing more and more lately. \u201cWhy?\u201d the voice asked.Why did I have to fight this battle? He wasn\u2019t asking to Rollerblade in traffic. He just wanted to sit in the car. Why couldn\u2019t I leave him, just this once?If it had been warm out, I would have said no. I knew about how quickly a closed car can overheat, even on a 60-degree day. But it was cool and cloudy. I\u2019d grown up in that same town in the 1980s and had spent hours waiting in the back seat of my parents\u2019 station wagon, windows open, reading or daydreaming, while they ran errands. Had so much really changed since then?So I told him I\u2019d be right back. I cracked the windows and child-locked the doors and set the alarm. When I got back five minutes later, he was still playing his game, smiling. We picked up his sister and our suitcases back at my parents\u2019 house and caught our flight home.It took me a while to figure out what had taken place in the parking lot \u2014 that a stranger had watched me go into the store, recorded my son, recorded the license plate on my mother\u2019s car and called 911.When our flight landed in Chicago, there was a message on my phone: \u201cI\u2019m trying to get ahold of Mrs. Kimberly A. Brooks. I need to speak with Mrs. Brooks about an incident this afternoon in a parking lot.\u201dOnce I realized what had happened, I felt like a terrible mother. I felt as though I\u2019d been caught doing something very bad, even if I didn\u2019t understand what the bad thing was, exactly, or what the rationale was for its badness. I felt, I think, what just about every woman feels when someone attacks her mothering: ashamed.When I tried to explain this to my outraged father, he said: \u201cLast I checked, kidnapping is a crime. Someone could break into my house and shoot me in the head, but the police aren\u2019t showing up to arrest me if I forget to lock my door.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they see it the same way when kids are involved,\u201d I told him.\u201cThe same way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou mean rationally?\u201dI spent the next months determining the best legal course of action, and also the best course of action for living with the humiliation of being accused of criminally negligent parenting. My story might have ended here. This is what shame does to women: It isolates us and makes us feel our stories aren\u2019t really stories at all but idiosyncratic flaws. The only reason my story continued was that I started seeking out other mothers who had been through similar struggles. I found six willing to speak about their experiences, and I expect there are many more out there. I was not the only one who had paid the cost of parenting in the age of fear.And so now children do not walk to school or play in a park on their own. They do not wait in cars. They do not take long walks through the woods or ride bikes along paths or build secret forts while we are inside working or cooking or leading our lives.As one mother put it to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m afraid for my kids, or if I\u2019m afraid other people will be afraid and will judge me for my lack of fear.\u201d In other words, risk assessment and moral judgment are intertwined.In a country that provides no subsidized child care and no mandatory family leave, no assurance of flexibility in the workplace for parents, no universal preschool and minimal safety nets for vulnerable families, making it a crime to offer children independence in effect makes it a crime to be poor.And yet middle-class and affluent mothers are not immune from this kind of surveillance and punishment, either. One such mother I spoke with was charged with felony child endangerment when she left her napping 4-year-old daughter in the car for a few minutes with the windows open while she ran into a store. During her arrest, she remembers the officer saying, \u201cStay-at-home mom\u2019s too busy shopping to take care of her kid? Does your husband know how you take care of your child while he\u2019s out earning the big bucks?\u201dI presented this theory of mother-shaming to Julie Koehler, one of the last \u201cbad moms\u201d I interviewed. She had introduced herself to me over email with the subject line, \u201cI am the horrible Starbucks mother!\u201dThe officer asked where she had been, and when she lifted her cup, he said, \u201cSo you abandoned your children?\u201dThat\u2019s when Ms. Koehler laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not against the law in Illinois to leave your children unattended. You have to prove that I\u2019m willfully endangering their life by going into Starbucks and getting a cup of coffee where I can see them the whole time. Good luck getting that case approved by a state\u2019s attorney.\u201dThe officer didn\u2019t end up pressing charges, but instead put in a call to the Department of Children and Family Services. As a result Ms. Koehler had to provide references attesting to her parenting, her children had to get physicals from a doctor, and the family was interviewed in their home, all before the case could be dismissed.It\u2019s not lost on Ms. Koehler that her ability to refuse to be intimidated is the result of her profession and privilege as a white, affluent mom. In her view, this makes it all the more important that mothers like her, mothers like me, stand up for our right to parent our children without public shaming, investigation or prosecution.\u201cIf this happened to anyone of color,\u201d she said, \u201cthey could have been shot in the street.\u201d She continued, \u201cBut no matter what color you are, no matter how much money you do or don\u2019t have, you don\u2019t deserve to be harassed for making a rational parenting choice.\u201dWhen I asked what advice she would give to other women in this situation, she said: \u201cI would tell them to ask the officer what law she was breaking. I would tell them to ask why and how going into a store for a few minutes meant she was abandoning her child. I would tell her to ask if she was under arrest, and if not, if she was free to go. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not a cop but a person on the street, calling them names, yelling at them that you\u2019re a terrible mother, threatening to call the police and have their children taken away, then I\u2019d tell them to be extremely calm and clear with that person. I\u2019d tell them to take out their own phones and start recording the interaction. I\u2019d tell them to say calmly and assertively: \u2018I haven\u2019t done anything wrong; I haven\u2019t broken any law. My child is fine. I don\u2019t know you, so please step away from us. You are harassing me, and you\u2019re harassing my child. If you don\u2019t stop harassing us, I\u2019ll have to call the police.\u2019\u201dAs I listened to her, it occurred to me that I had never used the word harassment to describe this situation. But why not? When a person intimidates, insults or demeans a woman on the street for the way she is dressed, or on social media for the way she speaks out, it\u2019s harassment. But when a mother is intimidated, insulted or demeaned because of her parenting choices, we call it concern or, at worst, nosiness. A mother, apparently, cannot be harassed. A mother can only be corrected.Dr. Sarnecka, the cognitive scientist, has an answer to this. Her study found that subjects were far less judgmental of fathers. When participants were told a father had left his child for a few minutes to run into work, they estimated the level of risk to the child as about equal to when he left because of circumstances beyond his control.I love the way this finding makes plain something we all know but aren\u2019t supposed to say: A father who is distracted by his interests and obligations in the adult world is being, well, a father; a mother who does the same is failing her children.I felt these fears every time I stood at a birthday party with 30 other parents, watching for two hours as our children played. I felt it at the park when, just at the moment I took out a book to read, my son stumbled and bumped his chin, and a woman began shouting, \u201cWhere is this child\u2019s mother? Is this child being supervised?\u201dAs I write this, I am sitting on a bench in a residential neighborhood. It is a beautiful summer afternoon, but there are no children playing on the sidewalks. They are safe at camp, inside their houses, buckled into car seats, plugged into screens, never enjoying what the writer Mona Simpson called \u201cthe luxury of being unnoticed, of being left alone.\u201d In the end I was lucky. The prosecutor agreed not to pursue charges in exchange for 100 hours of community service. My family and close friends stood by me. I was not placed on a registry of child neglecters. I didn\u2019t lose my job. The truth is, I don\u2019t feel that bad about what happened to me anymore. Instead I worry about all the ways our country seems to be at war with children, even as we insist our greatest responsibility is to protect them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bayer Will Stop Selling the Troubled Essure Birth Control Implants", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBayer announced on Friday that it would discontinue sales of its Essure birth control implant by the end of the year, bowing to a lengthy campaign by health advocates and thousands of women to get the device off the market.The implant has had a troubled history. It has been the subject of an estimated 16,000 lawsuits or claims filed by women who reported severe injuries, including perforation of the uterus and the fallopian tubes. Several deaths, including of a few infants, have also been attributed to the device or to complications from it.Bayer said its decision to halt sales of the device was not related to the litigation or safety issues, but to a decline in use as women chose other options. Bayer has repeatedly denied that the implant is dangerous or caused injuries.Madris Tomes, a former F.D.A. medical device official who runs a company that analyzes adverse event data, puts the figure closer to 30,000.\u201cWith side effects ranging from hair loss and tooth loss to chronic pain, severe bleeding, miscarriages and even death, the benefit risk profile touted by Bayer simply didn\u2019t jibe with the data that was pouring into the F.D.A. from both patients and physicians,\u201d said Ms. Tomes, who has done pro bono work for an Essure patient advocacy group.The Essure implant consists of two small coils made of a nickel alloy and a polytester-like fiber. It is placed through the vagina into the fallopian tubes, and is designed to create an inflammatory response that causes scar tissue to form, blocking the tubes. The United States was the only country where the device, considered a nonsurgical sterilization implant, was still being sold. Bayer had stopped selling it in England, Brazil, Canada, France and several other countries.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said Friday that sales of the device in the United States had declined by about 70 percent since the agency ordered Bayer to conduct a post-market study on women using the device and to place the boxed warning and patient decision checklist on the labeling.Bayer blamed \u201cinaccurate and misleading publicity\u201d as a key factor in sales loss. The company also said that American women were becoming less interested in permanent contraception, and instead were relying more on other birth control options, like long-acting reversible contraceptives.\u201cThe benefit-risk profile of Essure has not changed,\u201d the company said, \u201cand we continue to stand behind the product\u2019s safety and efficacy, which are demonstrated by an extensive body of research.\u201dPublic health advocates have long been troubled by what they see as a lack of solid data on Essure\u2019s safety and effectiveness.\u201cThousands of women have reported serious complications from Essure, and there has been no unbiased long-term research to refute or confirm those reports,\u201d said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, who has been a paid expert witness in one of the cases involving Essure plaintiffs against Bayer. \u201cBoth the F.D.A. and the company are responsible for a situation where women could not make informed decisions.\u201dThe company said it would continue to enroll patients in a postmarket surveillance study and will work with the F.D.A. to ensure appropriate follow up.Steven Immergut, a Bayer spokesman, said that as of mid-April, there were about 16,800 plaintiffs who have filed claims regarding Essure. Many of the lawsuits have been consolidated or merged from states across the country. \u201cWe believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to continue to vigorously defend Essure,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Full circle: My family, Lithuanian Jews, stepped onto the teeming dock at Cape Town in June 1895, with their bundles borne from Europe.\u201cVisitors are no longer allowed in because somebody stole Mandela\u2019s spoon,\u201d he says.The bowl, the cup (but no spoon), a sleeping mat, a rectangle of blue sky visible through the window \u2014 here, in this tiny space, Mandela maintained the captaincy of his soul. Anyone harboring the dangerous illusion of humanity\u2019s perfectibility should remember: A tourist stole Nelson Mandela\u2019s spoon.It\u2019s the 100th anniversary of Mandela\u2019s birth this month. Celebrations unfurl across the world. He was the master of his fate. The white man\u2019s arsenal could not touch him. It was over. As with Mahatma Gandhi, the riveting inner force prevails.The spoon-stealers are out there. Sometimes it seems these thieves with their airs, their acquisitive self-importance and their capacity for cruelty to children, are taking over the world.They are not. Other forces are at work, raising people up rather than casting them down, uniting, not dividing. Mandela chose to confront humanity in its iniquity and vanquish violence in the name of hope.Then, when it was over, sanctions lifted, they joined the economic world, the sporting world. Suddenly a South African passport was a great thing. They could say, \u201cI never voted for torture!\u201d and forget their complicity in South African policing by pigment \u2014 the segregated schools, the forced removal of blacks from their homes, the banishment of blacks to invisible townships of dust and drudgery.For Jews, South Africa was liberation from pogrom, first, lifesaving distance from the Holocaust later. Yet most Jews went along with apartheid \u2014 by no means all, however, including several of Mandela\u2019s lawyers. There are more bystanders than heroes in times of oppression. That\u2019s part of the survival gene \u2014 even if humanity\u2019s ultimate survival depends on the few who will resist.South Africa was as good a place as any for a Jew to live in the 20th century. If you\u2019re busy persecuting millions of blacks you don\u2019t have much time left for tens of thousands of Jews. That\u2019s what I heard when I was old enough to hear it.Thank you, Madiba, for pardoning my family, me, the whites of South Africa, the spoon thieves, today\u2019s political infants, all humanity for its iniquity and tribal stupidity. Thank you for lifting our gaze.I fly to Johannesburg and go out to Soweto one day. There, I meet Macdonald Maanda Muhali, age 30. He\u2019s been out of a job for more than a year. He used to work as a security guard doing perimeter patrols. Now he watches \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d or \u201cPrison Break\u201d all day on the TV he bought when he had a job. He lives in a single room. The toilet is outside. Job applications go unanswered. Sometimes he washes cars or lays a pipe for cash.

Then I ask him if whites got off too easily.\u201cMandela forgave them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must trust him. If the people who suffered most forgave, why shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d You feel no anger? \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201dWe go out. Garbage skitters across a square. Idle young men chat and smirk. Girls in purple sweaters and gray skirts emerge from school. A woman sells the brooms, rakes and dusters arranged on her head. I buy sausages at a butcher.

In a telephone interview, he said that Kipling, an English journalist, author and poet who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 and wrote \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d supported \u201ccolonialism and had racist attitudes.\u201d Mr. Malik-Johnson pointed to works like Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden.\u201dAround 40 percent of the university\u2019s students comes from outside Britain, Mr. Malik-Johnson pointed out. He said that views such as Kipling\u2019s did not fit in with a diverse body.So Mr. Malik-Johnson and his colleagues painted over it with another poem by the African-American poet Maya Angelou instead. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to erase Kipling \u2014 we did it deliberately so you could still see his words,\u201d Mr. Malik-Johnson said. \u201cIt was to start a conversation.\u201dThey finished painting on Monday, then posted a photo on Facebook.

Glasgow University in Scotland last year set up a project to find out if the institution benefited financially from the slave trade, such as receiving donations from businessmen involved in it.Kipling was born in India, and some of his poems are set there. \u201cCompromised is the right word for him,\u201d said Rana Mitter, a professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s China Center, in a telephone interview. \u201cHe was someone who displayed some of the worst aspects of his time,\u201d he added, \u201cbut there are many places in his writing where his racial attitudes are very different to the typical British ones of the time.\u201dMr. Malik-Johnson said he recognized that Kipling had some enlightened views for his time, but added, \u201cIf you say someone was less racist than the other British people of the 19th century, it\u2019s not a very high bar to reach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said a confrontation broke out after officers approached the man, who was identified on Sunday as Harith Augustus, 37, and that an officer fired fatal shots.\u201cWhen they approached him, he tried to push their hands away,\u201d Chief Waller said. \u201cHe started flailing and swinging away, trying to make an escape. And as he made an escape, he reached for the gun.\u201dChief Waller said the police recovered a semiautomatic weapon from Mr. Augustus, whom he did not believe was licensed to carry a concealed gun.Activists, residents and local journalists quickly converged at the shooting scene, a busy area near a commuter rail station and shopping district in the South Shore neighborhood. Many people recorded tense confrontations between residents and officers. Some were heard disputing the Police Department\u2019s version of events.William Calloway, a prominent activist who lives near the scene, arrived within minutes of the shooting and streamed video images of the aftermath on Facebook. According to Mr. Calloway, witnesses said that Mr. Augustus had not appeared to reach for a gun.Mr. Augustus was a state-licensed barber whom Mr. Calloway said worked near the shooting scene.By 10:30 p.m., the shooting scene had been cleared.

Nippon sends it out with chives and a spicy daikon mash, which complement its quiet flavor, and cooked fragments of fugu, which don\u2019t.The least expensive serving, what is called a \u201chalf portion\u201d for $70, is just big enough to give four people a couple of bites each. If I were going to spend money on fugu again, though, I would make a beeline for the sperm sacs, or shirako. Barely broiled, either plain with salt crystals or brushed with a miso glaze, Nippon\u2019s shirako is as smooth and thick as fudge, with a flavor that recalls buttered crab meat, among other things.Restaurant Nippon\u2019s soba noodles are nutty, bouncy, springy, slightly rough and very good. I like them chilled, dunked in ponzu. Against my better judgment I even like the odd, Americanized soba salads, with a pile of noodles and meat or tofu on a platter with a fistful of lettuce.The custom-farmed buckwheat also goes into an astoundingly good thing called soba miso that comes smeared on a small wooden paddle. A black sludge of fermented buckwheat studded with buckwheat kernels, it looks like brownie batter and tastes a little like chocolate, too, as well as roasted nuts and espresso and cooked mushrooms.Whether negimaki was invented at Nippon or simply made its first United States appearance there, it\u2019s hard to see why tough beef wrapped around undercooked scallions captured America\u2019s imagination. More intriguing is another original, beef oroshi, essentially shabu shabu except that it is cooked offstage and you get nothing but meat and broth with some spicy grated daikon.This is also the birthplace of agedashi mozzarella. If you have ever wondered what fried cheese in dashi would taste like, you will find the answer here.The backbone of the menu, though, is traditional Japanese food, nearly all of it good and some of it better than that. There is fluke for those who won\u2019t pay up for fugu, and it is just what you\u2019d want it to be. Broiled eel over rice makes a wonderfully soothing meal.The kamonabe is a duck hot pot cooked over a burner set on the table. The duck may not be entirely tender, but it is flavorful. The broth is a symphony. For scale, theatricality and deeply reassuring flavor, its only rival is the sukiyaki, but the kamonabe comes with a dividend: a bowl of rice cooked in the leftover broth as a second course.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "OpinionIn the 1990s, kid-centered politics was successful, if not transformational. It can offer the beginnings of an agenda for progressive renewal. Supported byMr. Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.For years, I\u2019ve held onto a memo that a professional mentor gave me around 1990, a typewritten document by the pollster Stanley Greenberg with the title \u201cKids as Politics.\u201d Mr. Greenberg, who has shown the sharpest understanding of traditionally Democratic voters drawn to the appeal of Ronald Reagan then or Donald Trump today, argued that a political agenda centered on children could not only improve kids\u2019 lives but also open the door to a broader liberalism and to Democrats more generally; kid-centered politics would help Americans \u201crediscover government.\u201dPolitics centered on children went beyond a few federal programs. \u201cWhen candidates talk about kids,\u201d Mr. Greenberg wrote, \u201cthey are talking about the fundamental economic and social terrain on which Democrats must run.\u201dWhether Democrats choose the path or not, children are likely to be at the center of political fights in 2018 and beyond.A focus on children could even be, and was, compatible with the sort of business-friendly and Wall Street-friendly politics that Democrats adopted in the Clinton era \u2014 the very brand of politics many young Democrats are eager to relegate to the past. Democrats of the current era, including most of the prospective 2020 presidential candidates, are unlikely to be satisfied with a political language that focuses mainly on children. They\u2019re on to bigger ideas that get to the core of the economy and fairness, like a job guarantee or universal basic income. Even universal child care seems to have slipped from the agenda.There\u2019s also a dangerous strain of kids-first politics, one that focuses on the relative benefits of programs for the elderly and disabled, Social Security and Medicare, compared with those for kids. That makes sense if the only resources to increase benefits for kids could come from those programs rather than, for example, closing the tax loopholes for private equity.The role of women in the current Democratic revival is related to the new opportunity to put kids at the center of the agenda. Yet kids\u2019 politics is not limited to women. As men play a larger role in caregiving, kids are, as Mr. Greenberg promised, a universal value.The success of \u201ckids as politics\u201d in the 1990s and the power of children as a political theme today can still offer the beginnings of an agenda for progressive renewal. The lesson to take from the previous round is that children don\u2019t automatically open the doors to a rediscovery of active government or a robust social safety net. The challenge today is to take the next step, to show how protecting kids and giving them a sound start in life requires more than just government spending programs but a real reassessment of old assumptions about the economy and how all families can share in its benefits.

{"Headline": "Psychology Itself Is Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "mindMany famous studies of human behavior cannot be reproduced. Even so, they revealed aspects of our inner lives that feel true.Supported byThe urge to pull down statues extends well beyond the public squares of nations in turmoil. Lately it has been stirring the air in some corners of science, particularly psychology. In recent months, researchers and some journalists have strung cables around the necks of at least three monuments of the modern psychological canon: The assaults on these studies aren\u2019t all new. Each is a story in its own right, involving debates over methodology and statistical bias that have surfaced before in some form. \u201cThis is a phase of cleaning house and we\u2019re finding that many things aren\u2019t as robust as we thought,\u201d said Brian Nosek, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, who has led the replication drive. \u201cThis is a reformation moment \u2014 to say let\u2019s self-correct, and build on knowledge that we know is solid.\u201d Psychology has millions of amateur theorists who test the findings against their own experience. The public\u2019s judgments matter to the field, too. It is one thing to frisk the studies appearing almost daily in journals that form the current back-and-forth of behavior research. It is somewhat different to call out experiments that became classics \u2014 and world-famous outside of psychology \u2014 because they dramatized something people recognized in themselves and in others. They live in the common culture as powerful metaphors, explanations for aspects of our behavior that we sense are true and that are captured somehow in a laboratory mini-drama constructed by an inventive researcher, or research team. The Stanford prison experiment is a case in point. In the summer of 1971, Philip Zimbardo, a midcareer psychologist, recruited 24 college students through newspaper ads and randomly cast half of them as \u201cprisoners\u201d and half as \u201cguards,\u201d setting them up in a mock prison, complete with cells and uniforms. He had the simulation filmed. After six days, Dr. Zimbardo called the experiment off, reporting that the \u201cguards\u201d began to assume their roles too well. They became abusive, some of them shockingly so.Dr. Zimbardo published dispatches about the experiment in a couple of obscure journals. He provided a more complete report in an article he wrote in The New York Times, describing how cruel instincts could emerge spontaneously in ordinary people as a result of situational pressures and expectations. That article and \u201cQuiet Rage,\u201d a documentary about the experiment, helped make Dr. Zimbardo a star in the field and media favorite, most recently in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in the early 2000s. Perhaps the central challenge to the study\u2019s claims is that its author coached the \u201cguards\u201d to be hard cases. \u201cAnd, when the guards did behave in these ways and escalated that behavior, with Zimbardo watching and apparently (by his silence) approving, would that not have confirmed in the subjects\u2019 minds that they were behaving as they should?\u201d \u201cMy instructions to the guards, as documented by recordings of guard orientation, were that they could not hit the prisoners but could create feelings of boredom, frustration, fear and a sense of powerlessness \u2014 that is, \u2018we have total power of the situation and they have none,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe did not give any formal or detailed instructions about how to be an effective guard.\u201dWhich argument is more persuasive depends to some extent on where you sit and what you may think of Dr. Zimbardo. Is it better to describe his experiment, questions and all \u2014 or to ignore it entirely as not real psychology?One psychologist who doesn\u2019t have to choose is David Baker, executive director of the Center for the History of Psychology at the University of Akron, which hosts the National Museum of Psychology. \u201cWe put everything in that\u2019s an important part of our history, including the controversy,\u201d Dr. Baker said. \u201cTo me, the target question of an experiment should be considered,\u201d he added. \u201cIn this case, do social context and expectations significantly change behavior. And if so, when and how so?\u201dThe issues surrounding the marshmallow studies and the ego depletion work are different, but land researchers in the same fundamental bind: Is this something, or is it nothing?Even younger psychologists who are eloquent partisans on the side of self-correction can be conflicted.\u201cWith ego depletion especially, it seems like there\u2019s some truth there \u2014 we have a subjective feeling of cognitive fatigue\u201d after exercising self-control, said Katie Corker, as assistant professor of psychology at Grand Valley State University in Michigan. A recent replication, rigorously done by one of the original authors, found evidence of an effect, but it was a small one, Dr. Corker said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not studying it right, I don\u2019t know. The better question may be, what does it take to kill off a big finding like this? Or, what should it take?\u201dGiven modern ethics restrictions, mounting precise replications of old experiments is not always possible. The prison experiment would likely have to be seriously modified to pass institutional review. The marshmallow test and ego depletion studies are fair game for further examination, and in those cases modifications may in fact clarify the picture. Some children do exhibit a streak of self-restraint early that seems to become central to their developing personality. What is the best way to measure that ability, or trait? What are its rewards over time, and its costs?A more careful investigation of the \u201csubjective cognitive fatigue\u201d resulting from exercising self-control might help answer the latter question. It may also save ego depletion from being discarded prematurely as a useful scientific concept.When Dr. Nosek published his first major replication paper in 2015, finding that about 60 percent of prominent studies did not pan out on a second try, it was a gift to skeptics eager to dismiss the entire field (and maybe all of social science) as a joke, a congregation of poorly anchored findings that shift in the wind, like nutrition advice.It\u2019s not. On the contrary.Housecleaning is a crucial corrective in science, and psychology has led by example.

{"Headline": "Why NATO Matters", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe allies are looking with dread to this week\u2019s summit as President Trump continues his campaign to undermine a decades-old partnership.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Born after World War II, NATO linked America and Europe not just in a mutual defense pledge but in advancing democratic governance, the rule of law, civil and human rights, and an increasingly open international economy. The alliance was the core of an American-led liberal world order that extended to Asia and relied on a web of international institutions, including the United Nations and the World Bank. American military protection gave the allies space to develop their economies and pluralistic societies. Despite compromises and occasional failures, the experiment was broadly successful. Yet NATO is being weakened from within \u2014 by members\u2019 failure to spend enough on defense; by the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; and perhaps most of all, by President Trump, who seems to prefer President Vladimir Putin of Russia to America\u2019s European allies.NATO has always depended on leadership from the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy and most lethal military power. Mr. Trump not only doesn\u2019t want to lead the West, he has denigrated the alliance, bullied its leaders and accused NATO and the European Union of exploiting American largess. \u201cWe\u2019re the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019ll see NATO and I\u2019ll tell NATO, \u2018You\u2019ve got to start paying your bills.\u2019\u201dBut NATO is not a golf club, and money, the only thing Mr. Trump prizes, is just one, narrow measure of the costs and benefits of belonging. This president has shown no understanding of the power of partnership, and the reciprocal nature of its bonds, in an alliance that stands for something far bigger than paying your dues on time. Mr. Trump is burning up all the credit the United States has accrued with our allies across decades by attacking the basis of this alliance, if not the very idea of any alliance \u2014 thus, deliberately or not, doing the bidding of Mr. Putin in his quest to divide the West. \u201cNATO can withstand four years under Trump,\u201d one former NATO ambassador said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll withstand eight.\u201d Given the legacy of Republican support for national security and democratic allies, one might expect that Republican congressional leaders would speak up. But, cowering before Mr. Trump, they have been virtually silent as he has undermined America\u2019s alliances.Sooner rather than later, NATO is also going to have to decide what to do with Turkey and the other countries that are eroding the fabric of the alliance by repudiating democratic principles.At this week\u2019s gathering, the result that matters most is a firm and convincing commitment to a strong NATO, ready to contribute to stability today, and to adapt to future challenges. With no coherent vision of his own to make Americans, and democracy generally, more secure in a world without NATO, Mr. Trump would do well to make that commitment, and honor the friends we have.

{"Headline": "Can You Guess These Three Surprising Energy Trends?", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "Advertisement\nPeople often notice big, sudden price changes \u2014 like, say, when an avocado shortage sends the cost spiraling up at their local grocery. It can be harder to keep track of what happens to the cost of an essential product or service over the course of years.There has been an intense public debate about energy prices, in particular, and whether efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases would send the cost of electricity soaring. It\u2019s time to check in on what has happened \u2014 whether those costs have changed in the way critics and advocates for clean energy had predicted.Conservative politicians, energy executives and others regularly play down the risks posed by climate change and argue that emission reductions would lead to job losses and slower economic growth.But those who support renewable energy said those sources would become cheaper over time as more wind farms and solar panels came on line. So, what really happened?Unsurprisingly, health care, cable TV and many other services Americans use regularly have become more expensive over the last 10 years. But that is not true of electricity \u2014 an essential service.Change in prices since 2007, adjusted for inflation40%Tuition20Rent0ApparelElectricity-17%\u201320Wirelessservice\u2013402007200820092010201120122013201420152016201740%Tuition20Rent0ApparelElectricity\u201320Wirelessservice\u2013402007\u201809\u201811\u201813\u201815\u201817In addition to warnings about the perils to the economy of aggressive climate policy from conservatives, we have also heard claims that wind and solar energy were expensive baubles that could not compete with fossil fuels without subsidies. Recent experience shows that people can, in fact, reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases without damaging the economy.Texas is an oil-rich state that nobody would consider in thrall to idealistic environmentalists. So how has the relative contribution of various energy sources to the state\u2019s electricity market changed over the past decade? Take a guess.Parts of Texas have lots of wind, which is why developers have put up so many turbines. The state also gets lots of sun, which is why many experts think that solar panels will, over time, become another major source of energy there. Last year, solar panels contributed less than 1 percent of the electricity generated in Texas.Texas net electricity generation, thousand megawatt-hoursNaturalGas200k150kCoal100kWind50kNuclearOther020072008200920102011201220132014201520162017200kNaturalGas150kCoal100kWind50kNuclearOther02007\u201809\u201811\u201813\u201815\u201817Some conservatives and industry executives have argued that the policies of President Obama amounted to a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Utilities are indeed using much less coal, but their decisions have primarily been driven by a drop in the price of natural gas, not Obama-era policies. How much has the use of gas changed over the last decade? Take a guess.There are many reasons why electricity prices have been so stable. Among the most important ones is the boom in shale gas production, which led to a dramatic drop in the price of gas. As a result, many electric utilities converted to natural gas, which generates about half the emissions of coal, over the last two decades. While some environmentalists oppose hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the practice, when paired with regulations to limit its impact on ground water and air, can be an important part of a transition to cleaner fuels.Natural gas price, dollars per million B.T.U.$105$2.800200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018$105$2.800200720092011201320152017The fact that the United States has been able to reduce emissions from the power sector while keeping prices low shows that the world can address climate change by ushering in an era of abundant, affordable and clean energy.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez toppled a political giant last month, but he\u2019s popped right back up onto the ballot. Though Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeated Joseph Crowley, a leading House Democrat, in a congressional primary that sent shock waves through the party, Mr. Crowley\u2019s name will almost certainly appear on the ballot in November under a third-party line. That\u2019s thanks to a quirk in New York State\u2019s election laws, an embarrassingly retrograde system that protects incumbents by confusing voters and suppressing turnout.Mr. Crowley said that was untrue, and explained that it was unduly onerous for him to remove his name from the Working Families Party line he had won before the Democratic primary. He also reiterated his support for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in the November general election.\u201cAlexandria, the race is over and Democrats need to come together,\u201d he wrote.We agree. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 a bright light in the Democratic Party who has brought desperately needed energy back to New York politics \u2014 needs to remain focused on the pressing issues she built her candidacy on.Bill Lipton, state director of the Working Families Party, said he asked Mr. Crowley to consider the third option. Mr. Crowley declined, saying on Thursday that he felt accepting the nomination of the Working Families Party for another office elsewhere in the state was akin to election fraud, since it suggests to voters he is running for an office he has no intention to occupy. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on moving out of New York, have a clean record, hope God\u2019s will is that I don\u2019t die and won\u2019t commit what I honestly believe to be election fraud,\u201d he said on Twitter.Fair enough, Mr. Crowley.If Mr. Crowley means what he says, his presence on the November ballot is unlikely to have much of an impact since New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, which covers parts of Queens and the Bronx, is overwhelmingly Democratic. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has also become extremely well known and popular. But the episode is a grating reminder of the brokenness of the state\u2019s election laws.Jerry H. Goldfeder, a well-known election lawyer, said New York\u2019s election laws are \u201cextremely, uniquely peculiar.\u201d \u201cThey need a total revamping to make it easier for voters to understand, for candidates to run and to make sure the winners reflect the preferences of the voters,\u201d Mr. Goldfeder said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Okwonga is a writer, poet and football fanatic. He has published two books on the sport.This was part of Offsides, a newsletter on the broader issues and hidden stories around the World Cup. When anything could happen and a country\u2019s fate is in the balance, there\u2019s often nothing better than a tune. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand: It was the 1994 World Cup and I was there with my uncle, at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, watching the quarterfinal match between Brazil and the Netherlands. The South Americans in the crowd had just been stunned into silence: The Netherlands had scored for the second time in 12 minutes, bringing the score to 2-2. Then a Brazilian woman raised a trumpet to her lips and began to play a mocking funeral march. The crowd in our section burst into laughter, the tension evaporated, and they cheered their team on to a 3-2 victory. In addition to being a football fan and a writer, I\u2019m a musician, so this is a subject close to my heart. But I also firmly believe that music is one of the crucial ways that we show who we are and what we care about, and so it\u2019s worth paying attention to the role it plays in this tournament.

{"Headline": "If Ronaldo Can\u2019t Beat Uruguay, the Least He Can Do Is Pay Taxes", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Portuguese soccer star\u2019s financial maneuvers can tell us a lot about the world\u2019s failure to adapt to globalization. Mr. Zucman is an economist.In both cases, the Spanish authorities found the players guilty of dodging taxes on the income derived from their image rights. These rights \u2014 which they, like many other professional athletes, had transferred to shell companies in exotic tax havens \u2014 account for a large part of their income. For the top players on the planet, such rights can amount to many millions of dollars a year. That some of the world\u2019s most famous athletes could defraud tax authorities seems at first incomprehensible: They should know that their tax returns will be closely scrutinized, and being labeled tax evaders certainly does not enhance the value of their image or their popularity with fans. Why should we care about Ronaldo\u2019s income and tax affairs? Because they illustrate our collective failure to adapt to globalization, and the lessons we can draw from this example extend beyond soccer to the rest of society.But we can fix this. We\u2019re often told that taxing the most successful among us is impossible or counterproductive. But in fact, professional sports often shows how misguided this argument is.Once tax evasion was curbed, governments could tax top incomes at higher rates, for the greater good. And don\u2019t believe anyone who says this would harm the economy \u2014 these claims usually don\u2019t make much sense. Look no further than Ronaldo: His image would still be as valuable to Nike if he had to pay more in taxes, and it does not cost him much to provide it \u2014 so nothing bad would happen if he had to pay more. With a lower after-tax income, he would still score as many goals. You don\u2019t hurt anyone when you tax the Ronaldos of the world \u2014 you just make it possible for everyone to gain when they do.The United States isn\u2019t typically known for its redistributive tax policies nowadays, but even Americans still understand this basic truth: Sky-high incomes for star athletes are socially useless. That\u2019s why American sport leagues have either salary caps (as in the N.F.L.) or luxury taxes (as in the N.B.A.) that severely limit how much teams can spend on players. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mythical River Flows Through Indian Politics", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOP-DOCSHindu nationalism in the country reaches new heights in a quest to find a sacred river.Ms. Abraham and Mr. Madheshiya are filmmakers based in Mumbai, India. One scorching May afternoon in 2015, as nearly a hundred men and women employed by an Indian government project dug across villages in search of the mythical river Saraswati, a trickle of water appeared, bubbling out of a paddy field. For days, national newscasters reported on the miracle of finding a river we\u2019d only read about in the Vedas \u2014 ancient religious texts \u2014 drumming up Hindu nationalism across the country. Pilgrims and tourists thronged from far and wide. \u201cThis is groundwater. Dug out at a mere depth of seven feet. Can you see that this is not a flowing river?,\u201d questioned a farmer, Jarnail Singh, one of the few reasoning voices.Among the believers was Manohar Lal Khattar, the chief minister of Haryana State, who rushed in to worship the river and her namesake goddess. He had announced a grant of 500 million rupees ($7 million) to revive and regenerate the river, which is believed to have disappeared more than 5,000 years ago. The Haryana Sarasvati Heritage Development Board, which Mr. Khattar heads, wants to change the name of the Indus Valley civilization to the Sarasvati river civilization.With the discovery of river Saraswati, the Hindu right wing in India is jubilant because it aligns with its nationalist claims that Hindus are indigenous inhabitants of India and that Hindu civilization is the oldest in the world. The argument is simple: The Vedas were written 10,000 years ago, and they mention the river Saraswati, proving that an advanced civilization existed then. Disregarding a majority of historians, who date the Vedas between 3,500 and 3,000 years old, the Hindu right wing claims that the discovery of Saraswati proves India is the oldest civilization in the world. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Organization), have long complained that Indian history has been written from the Western perspective and must be rewritten to rightfully represent India\u2019s Hindu past.This short documentary is produced in collaboration with the Sundance Institute Short Documentary Fund supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

Under existing Russian law, social media users can be punished for content deemed to promote homosexuality, to threaten public order or to be \u201cextremist\u201d in nature, with fines as well as prison time.Under the proposed rule, part of a creeping crackdown on digital rights under President Vladimir V. Putin, websites with more than 100,000 daily visitors and a commenting feature must take down factually inaccurate posts or face a fine of up to 50 million rubles, about $800,000.The bill gives social media companies 24 hours to delete \u201cinaccurate\u201d information after being notified of its existence, raising concerns that moderators will be left to interpret the term, which is vaguely defined in the measure.The legislation has passed one of three votes in Parliament.Critics worry that out of an abundance of caution, moderators are likely to interpret truthfulness to the authorities\u2019 advantage. They say the bill would make it easier for the state to pressure social media companies to cooperate with security services by requiring them to establish offices in Russia, a step that the social media giants Facebook and Twitter have avoided so as not to fall under Russian legal jurisdiction.The bill \u201cwill become an instrument of censorship\u201d unless social media companies develop algorithms to distinguish real news from fake news, removing the human element and potential bias, Vladimir V. Zykov, the head of an association of social media users in Russia, warned in a recent meeting with lawmakers.\u201cAs with the term \u2018terrorist,\u2019 it has basically become an insult used to smear and discredit opponents,\u201d he added.Still, \u201cthe proliferation of deliberately falsified information online is a widely recognized problem,\u201d even as efforts to counter it can be abused, Mr. Shahbaz said. Already this year, at least five countries have passed laws regulating fake news online, he added.Russian lawmakers have also noticed these initiatives \u2014 some meant to counter Russian-made fake news \u2014 and have co-opted their language and arguments. Marina A.

You Are, Too?", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsLong before Josh Loigman and Ann Porter became lawyers, they got used to defending themselves in the court of public opinion.Mr. Loigman, an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, agreed that \u201cthere\u2019s definitely a stereotype about vegans, that they\u2019re these hippie, liberal people. That\u2019s not us at all.\u201dMs. Porter, 28, and Mr. Loigman, 30, met in 2013 as first-year law school students at George Washington University. Both had been deflecting doubts since they were children about their conviction that eating meat is immoral. Both were also learning to fend off judgment for their conservative political views, especially among fellow vegans. But if they were a match made in right-leaning, animal-rights heaven, it took them a while to realize it.\u201cAfter the speaker everyone was sitting around talking,\u201d said Caroline Gignoux, one of Ms. Porter\u2019s law school friends and her companion that night. \u201cWe saw Josh, and I don\u2019t know how, but I knew he was vegan. Annie commented to me how buff this guy was. We thought all vegans were really skinny. So we decided that would be our icebreaker. We went over to his table and said, \u2018How are you so buff?\u2019\u201d\u201cHe started sending us news about animal welfare and articles he didn\u2019t agree with because of their perspective,\u201d Ms. Porter said. Within a week, he asked them to lunch at Rice Bar, a Korean restaurant near the law school. The three-way invitation was Mr. Loigman\u2019s way of being aboveboard about his relationship status. But Ms. Gignoux knew before her bibimbap (a mixed-rice dish) was served that her presence was incidental.\u201cIt became clear as soon as we sat down that they had this intellectual spark,\u201d Ms. Gignoux said. \u201cThey were talking about animal rights and how they were intertwined with politics. I couldn\u2019t contribute anything to the conversation. But Annie is brilliant, and he was totally on her level.\u201dIn liberal-leaning Manhattan, Ms. Porter said, her fiscal and social conservatism is challenged regularly. At that first lunch with Mr. Loigman, \u201cI thought we\u2019d have a debate about it. But he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m conservative, too,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Porter grew up in Summit, N.J., with her parents, Prudence and Michael Porter, who indulged, reluctantly, her hobby of rescuing animals. By the time she was a teenager she had adopted dogs, cats, snails, frogs, birds and a freshwater clam named Clammy. She announced her vegetarianism around age 7.Ms. Porter discussed her passion for animals all the time. Mr. Loigman suspected he could convince her to convert from a vegetarian to vegan, a matter of offloading dairy and eggs from her diet and non-vegan clothes from her wardrobe.\u201cHe sent me this article by Matthew Scully,\u201d a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, Ms. Porter said. \u201cThe article was about the parallels between being pro-life and veganism.\u201d Ms. Porter, who is against abortion rights, was moved. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how inconsistent my belief systems were. I opened the refrigerator and saw milk in there, and I was disgusted,\u201d she said.Her conversion happened right then.Her status as Mr. Loigman\u2019s girlfriend, though, was taking its time to develop. It was not until the beginning of their second year of law school that Mr. Loigman sent what they now affectionately call \u201cthe Scully article,\u201d originally printed in National Review. (\u201cWe are a couple with a William F. Buckley Jr., obsession,\u201d Mr. Loigman said of the late conservative pundit who founded that magazine.) And though their friendship was well established by then and both were single, Mr. Loigman\u2019s initial romantic overture was inviting Ms. Porter to a sports bar to watch a football game. Dinner, at halftime, was veggie Subway sandwiches.He now calls his first-date planning skills \u201cpathetic.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better since then,\u201d he added.After graduating from law school, Mr. Loigman and Ms. Porter accepted jobs in New York before taking the bar exam in 2015. By then, their intellectual swooning phase was over, and they were a contented couple. But, \u201cI\u2019m pretty traditional, so I didn\u2019t want to move in together until we were engaged,\u201d Ms. Porter said. They settled into apartments seven blocks apart and hunkered down. \u201cMost couples went out Friday nights. Josh and I would sit home and debate the death penalty.\u201d (One is a proponent of capital punishment, the other is ambivalent.)While they were debating, Mr. Loigman was growing a savings account to buy a cushion-cut diamond ring. \u201cI put change into that account for years,\u201d he said. When he started working at the district attorney\u2019s office in 2015, chunks of his paycheck went in, too. On Sept. 7, 2016, or maybe Sept. 8 \u2014 time stamps on their phones are inconclusive \u2014 Mr. Loigman proposed at a lake house they rented for a weekend getaway in West Shokan, N.Y.He intended to present the ring on Sept. 8, but Ms. Porter woke up a little before midnight on Sept. 7 while Mr. Loigman was setting the scene, complete with a custom-made board game about their relationship, to propose. He regrouped, recited the Aristotle quote, \u201cFriendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies,\u201d and asked Ms. Porter to be his wife. Ms. Porter, through what she called \u201chysterical tears,\u201d said yes.At a reception in an outdoor pavilion, the usual choice of chicken or fish was replaced with vegan options: rice noodles with coconut green curry, tomato basil risotto and tofu with Japanese sweet potato.

{"Headline": "Facebook to Remove Misinformation That Leads to Violence", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook, facing growing criticism for posts that have incited violence in some countries, said Wednesday that it would begin removing misinformation that could lead to people being physically harmed.The policy expands Facebook\u2019s rules about what type of false information it will remove, and is largely a response to episodes in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India in which rumors that spread on Facebook led to real-world attacks on ethnic minorities.\u201cWe have identified that there is a type of misinformation that is shared in certain countries that can incite underlying tensions and lead to physical harm offline,\u201d said Tessa Lyons, a Facebook product manager. \u201cWe have a broader responsibility to not just reduce that type of content but remove it.\u201dFacebook has been roundly criticized over the way its platform has been used to spread hate speech and false information that prompted violence. The company has struggled to balance its belief in free speech with those concerns, particularly in countries where access to the internet is relatively new and there are limited mainstream news sources to counter social media rumors.\u201cI think that there\u2019s a terrible situation where there\u2019s underlying sectarian violence and intention,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher, who will become an opinion contributor with The New York Times later this summer. \u201cIt is clearly the responsibility of all of the players who were involved there.\u201dThe social media company already has rules in place in which a direct threat of violence or hate speech is removed, but it has been hesitant to remove rumors that do not directly violate its content policies.Under the new rules, Facebook said it would create partnerships with local civil society groups to identify misinformation for removal. The new rules are already being put in effect in Sri Lanka, and Ms. Lyons said the company hoped to soon introduce them in Myanmar, then expand elsewhere.The company\u2019s rules help to show how it distinguishes between free speech and hate speech. Judge for yourself.He went on to outline Facebook\u2019s current policies around misinformation. Posts that violate the company\u2019s community standards, which ban hate speech, nudity and direct threats of violence, among other things, are immediately removed.The company has started identifying posts that are categorized as false by independent fact checkers. Facebook will \u201cdownrank\u201d those posts, effectively moving them down in each user\u2019s News Feed so that they are not highly promoted across the platform.The company has also started adding information boxes under demonstrably false news stories, suggesting other sources of information for people to read.But expanding the new rules to the United States and other countries where objectionable speech is still legally protected could prove tricky, as long as the company uses free speech laws as the guiding principles for how it polices content. Facebook also faces pressure from conservative groups that argue the company is unfairly targeting users with a conservative viewpoint.When asked in an interview how Facebook defined misinformation that could lead to harm and should be removed versus that material it would simply downrank because it was objectionable, Ms. Lyons said, \u201cThere is not always a really clear line.\u201d\u201cAll of this is challenging \u2014 that is why we are iterating,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we are taking serious feedback.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Facebook social media platforms that are subject to new rules about misinformation. The rules apply to Instagram, but not WhatsApp.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Lost Re-election in 2020", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sneak peek at The Times\u2019s news analysis from Nov. 4, 2020.Opinion ColumnistIn the end, it was a lot simpler than it often seemed. Donald J. Trump, who spent much of the past four years as a historically unpopular president, lost his bid for re-election Tuesday. His approval rating hasn\u2019t approached 50 percent since he took office, and neither did his share of the vote this year. In an era of deep national anxiety \u2014 with stagnant wages, rickety health insurance and aggressive challenges from China and Russia \u2014 voters punished an incumbent president who failed on his central promise: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201dSince he rode down the Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy five years ago, Trump has frequently looked like a man for whom the normal rules of politics did not apply. He won a shocking upset in 2016, which lent him an aura of invincibility. Pundits started to doubt much of what they had previously believed.But as Trump seethed \u2014 and tweeted \u2014 in defeat late Tuesday and President-elect Elizabeth Warren celebrated, the arc of the Trump story is starting to make more sense than it has for much of his chaotic presidency:The normal rules of politics do apply to Donald Trump, after all.In hindsight, the extraordinary nature of the circumstances that propelled Trump in 2016 have become obvious: the unpopularity of his opponent, Hillary Clinton; the help from Russia; the late involvement of James Comey, the then-F.B.I. director who now hosts an ABC talk show; and Trump\u2019s razor-thin victories in several states.\u201cTrump said he was going to fix things, and he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Kevin O\u2019Reilly, 54, of Manchester, N.H., who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, Trump in 2016 and Warren this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really cares about the middle class. He cares about himself.\u201dExit polls showed disillusionment across the swing states that Trump won four years ago and lost this year, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In a sign of the country\u2019s changing political map, he held on to Ohio and Iowa, two relatively old and white states \u2014 but became the first Republican since 1992 to lose Georgia.Huge margins among women were central to the victory of Warren, who will become the country\u2019s first female president. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of him,\u201d said Jennifer Diaz, a 47-year-old from Cobb County, Ga., outside Atlanta.Heading into the campaign, Trump\u2019s advisers believed they had two major advantages: the economic growth of the past four years and the undeniable liberalism of Warren and her running mate, former Attorney General Eric Holder. Neither panned out as the Trump campaign had hoped.Warren\u2019s liberalism, meanwhile, did make some voters anxious, exit polls showed. But most swing voters do not follow the minutiae of policy debates, and many simply decided that she understood their problems better than Trump.She and Holder consciously borrowed from the populist strategy of Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign against Mitt Romney. Rather than emphasize Trump\u2019s personal behavior, as the 2016 Clinton campaign did, they cast him as a greedy billionaire who corruptly used the presidency to enrich himself further. They also largely ignored Trump\u2019s repeated criticisms of the ongoing N.F.L. national anthem protests.A final vote tally will not be available for weeks, but The New York Times\u2019s \u201celection needle\u201d currently projects Trump to win 46.1 percent of the popular vote. If that holds, it would be nearly identical to his share in 2016. This year, however, third-party candidates won fewer votes, and Warren is on pace to clear 50 percent.From the start of Trump\u2019s meteoric political career to the end, he never enjoyed the support of most Americans.

{"Headline": "Ahed Tamimi, Palestinian Teenager Who Slapped Israeli Soldier, Is Released From Jail", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 Prison time is almost a rite of passage for some Palestinian activists, and Ahed Tamimi, the West Bank teenage firebrand who rose to international prominence after she kicked and slapped an Israeli soldier, tried to use hers profitably.\u201cI learned a lot,\u201d Ms. Tamimi, 17, said hours after her release on Sunday from an Israeli prison, where she served an eight-month term. \u201cI learned how to stay patient, to be in a group. I did my best to use the time to study. I came out more educated, and understand the world better than when I went in.\u201dShe also came out no less determined.She now plans to study law with an eye to suing Israel in international courts for what she describes as the violations and war crimes of the occupation.\u201cOf course I\u2019m not going to forget the cause,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to invest in my studies, because knowledge is the strongest weapon for a struggler.\u201dDeclaring that the resistance would go on, she said her imprisonment had been \u201cdifficult but meaningful.\u201d She expressed solidarity with the female Palestinian prisoners she left behind.The soldier and a comrade stood impassively during the altercation, then left the scene.The episode occurred shortly after a 15-year-old cousin of Ms. Tamimi was shot in the head by a rubber bullet fired by Israeli forces. He was gravely injured but survived.Many of the 500 or so residents of Nabi Saleh belong to the extended Tamimi clan.For nearly a decade, the village has been conducting a grass-roots campaign of weekly Friday protests against the Israeli occupation, land seizures and an adjacent settlement that has taken control of a village spring. The protests regularly end in stone throwing against Israeli security forces.Family members, including Ms. Tamimi\u2019s father, Bassem, have been in and out of prison. Three residents of the village have been killed in the clashes with Israeli forces.To supporters, Ms. Tamimi is a courageous, consciousness-raising icon of popular Palestinian resistance. Pro-Israeli detractors view her and her family as publicity-seeking agitators who exploit children by putting them at the forefront of the struggle and as experts in what they say are staged provocations they call \u201cPallywood.\u201dIn March, after being put on trial in an Israeli military court, Ms. Tamimi accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to charges including assault and incitement. She was sentenced to eight months, minus time served in detention, and received a fine and a three-year suspended sentence. Her mother accepted a similar deal.Ms. Tamimi said of the soldiers\u2019 conduct, \u201cObviously they saw the cameras and that\u2019s why they were so restrained.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong that I should regret,\u201d she added. \u201cAt the end of the day, the soldier came to my house. I didn\u2019t go to his house.\u201d Further defending her actions, she said the soldiers \u201cwere part of the force who shot my cousin half an hour before.\u201dCritics of Ms. Tamimi point to a part of the video in which she declared, \u201cOur strength is in our stones,\u201d and appeared to condone, or justify, stabbings, suicide bombings and other violence.The December altercation occurred soon after President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, enraging the Palestinians who claim the eastern half of the contested holy city as their own future capital. In the video, Ms. Tamimi said Mr. Trump must bear responsibility for the reactions that his decision could \u201cbring upon\u201d the Palestinians.\u201cEveryone must do things so we can unite this way,\u201d she said.The point is hardly theoretical. On Thursday, another Palestinian teenager, Muhammad Yusef, 17, from the village of Kaubar, not far from Nabi Saleh, entered a Jewish settlement and stabbed to death an Israeli man, Yotam Ovadia, 31, and injured two others before one of them fatally shot the assailant.Ms. Tamimi now skirts questions about her position on violent means of resistance, aware that she is on parole and that any perceived incitement to violence could land her back in jail.In general, she says, resistance is \u201ca natural reaction to the occupation of our land.\u201d\u201cResistance is not just the stone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the poems we write. Art.\u201d Her father chimed in: \u201cAlso the boycott and the isolation of Israel.\u201dAsked what she would do the next time soldiers show up in her yard she weighed her words: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds, and they gave me a suspended sentence to restrict me. But anyone who knows me has a sense of what is going to happen.\u201dMs. Tamimi was speaking at a friend\u2019s house in a Ramallah suburb during a quiet moment in a dizzying, if carefully choreographed, day. Surrounded by family and supporters, she wore a black and white checkered kaffiyeh, a Palestinian national symbol, draped across her shoulders beneath her trademark unruly blonde mane.The day had begun at 4:10 a.m. in a prison in northern Israel. A few hours later, the Israelis delivered her and her mother to their village. After a hero\u2019s welcome there, the family set out for Ramallah.Ms. Tamimi paid her respects at the tomb of Yasir Arafat, the father of the Palestinian cause, and was received by his successor, President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, who praised her as \u201ca model of the Palestinian struggle for freedom, independence and statehood,\u201d according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.Back in Nabi Saleh later in the afternoon, Ms. Tamimi held a news conference. She declared that she was boycotting the Israeli news media and would not take any questions from Israeli reporters, though several were present and the website of the liberal Haaretz newspaper live-streamed the event.Palestinian flags were raised and nationalist songs played over loudspeakers. Ms. Tamimi held court in the center of the village. Behind her was a giant replica of a slingshot and a masked female figure in school uniform, poised to launch a huge pencil.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Nabi Saleh, West Bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Rescuers in a Thai Cave Pulled Off the Impossible", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAE SAI, Thailand \u2014 It began as a misadventure by 12 boys and their soccer coach in a flood-prone northern Thai cave, which soon seemed destined to end in tragedy.It turned into a nearly three-week-long story of survival, international collaboration and triumph over the impossible \u2014 one that was avidly embraced and followed live across the world.A team of cave divers rescued the last of the boys and their coach on Tuesday from deep inside the warren of underground passages near Thailand\u2019s border with Myanmar, one of Southeast Asia\u2019s more remote regions.One by one, the divers brought the final four members of the Wild Boars team and their coach out of the flooded Tham Luang Cave.How they did it was a mix of trial and error, improvisation, skill, massive water pumps, miles of guide rope and strategically placed air tanks along the two-mile-long escape route, much of it submerged.It took 10 days for rescuers to even locate the boys, then nearly a week before the rescue could even begin.One diver died in preparing the evacuation. The other rescuers, laden with scuba gear, carried the boys \u2014 who could not swim and wore full face masks \u2014 as they squeezed through flooded crevices that would challenge the most seasoned divers. The final trek to freedom took four hours or more per child.\u201cWe are not sure if this is a miracle, or science, or what,\u201d the Thai Navy SEALs posted on their Facebook page. \u201cAll the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave.\u201dThe rescue of the Wild Boars touched a global nerve, an uplifting counterpoint to the wars, atrocities, ethnic conflicts and crises afflicting countries like Syria, South Sudan and Yemen \u2014 not to mention closer to home in Myanmar and in Thailand itself, where there is a long-running war near the southern border.For many people around the world, Thailand\u2019s extraordinary operation to save 12 boys and their coach was a welcome contrast to the images of the United States separating immigrant children from their parents and locking them up.The five Wild Boars who emerged Tuesday were immediately taken by ambulance and helicopter to a hospital in Chiang Rai, the nearest large city, and were to be placed in quarantine with the eight boys rescued Sunday and Monday.They were expected to stay for about a week in quarantine, where family members who once feared they were dead can see them through a window.Among the last to emerge from the cave was the Boars\u2019 25-year-old soccer coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, who helped the boys stay alive by conserving their energy during the 10 days before aid arrived.Family members and friends were predictably ecstatic over the news that everyone was finally safe. Hundreds of millions of others around the world cheered with them.\u201cIt was 18 days but it felt like years,\u201d said Prayuth Jetiyanukarn, the abbot at a temple in the town of Mae Sai where Mr. Ekkapol works.The abbot\u2019s eyes welled.\u201cI\u2019m so happy, but it\u2019s not just for Ek and the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world has been watching over these 18 days and they are celebrating with us.\u201dAt a packed news conference after the rescue, the chief of the operation, Narongsak Osottanakorn, was visibly pleased.\u201cWe have done something that no one expected that we could complete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an impossible mission.\u201dAlso making their way out of the cave were four Thai divers, an army doctor and three members of the Thai Navy SEALs, who had stayed in the cave with the Boars for more than a week after they were found and helped them prepare for their underwater escape.Mr. Narongsak said that all four divers were healthy after eight days underground. They are expected to join the Wild Boars and Mr. Ekkapol in quarantine, however, because of the fear of infection.\u201cThis morning, I promised to take nine people out,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said. \u201cWe\u2019re a success now.\u201dTham Luang Cave, about two miles from the border with Myanmar, is the bed of an underground river that flows during the monsoon season.The cave also is a maze of passageways and chambers, with side routes and dead ends that make it formidable to navigate, especially when filled with water.Just reaching the cavern where the group ultimately took refuge was a feat even for the most skilled searchers.The Wild Boars and their coach entered the cave after their soccer practice on June 23, a week before the rainy season generally begins.But a heavy rain started falling and the cave complex quickly began to fill with water, forcing them deeper into the maze to avoid drowning.Mr. Narongsak, then the governor of Chiang Rai Province, began organizing a search, a task that he later said seemed hopeless.Nonetheless, Mr. Narongsak and other officials threw themselves into it. They mobilized dozens of members of the Thai Navy SEALs, hundreds of soldiers, volunteers and workers from 20 government agencies.Leaders of the operation tried every approach they could devise.Some failed, such as searching for a back door to the cave or drilling holes from the mountain above in the hope of lifting the boys out.But two made a big difference: installing massive pumps to drain water from the cave and building an improvised dam to keep floodwaters from flowing in.To help the members of the Navy SEALs, who had little experience in cave diving, search leaders turned to a group of highly skilled foreign cave divers, a rare breed of explorer.The boys and their coach were finally found on July 2 by two British divers who were extending guide lines into the cave.One diver, John Volanthen, reached the end of his line, fastened it in the mud, and emerged from the water to find 13 pairs of eyes staring at him.The boys, having no idea of the international fixation over their plight, were surprised to learn that the diver was from Britain.Had Mr. Volanthen\u2019s line been 15 feet shorter, he would most likely have missed them.The boys requested food and asked whether they could leave right away. But that operation would take another six days to start, and two more before all were evacuated.The four Thai divers stayed with them, nursing them back to health and feeding them a high-protein diet.Officials said that extracting the boys through the treacherous underwater passageways would be more difficult than finding them. Few, if any, of the boys knew how to swim, much less use diving gear.Ultimately, the rescue officials concocted a plan to have small teams of divers bring out the boys by holding them under their bodies as they swam. The boys wore full face masks, rather than scuba gear, to make it easier for them to breathe underwater.A successful rescue depended on positioning a supply of air tanks along the route they would take.Disaster struck early Friday when a volunteer diver, Saman Gunan, 38, a former member of the Thai Navy SEALs, lost consciousness and died as he returned from putting air tanks in place.\u201cI call him the hero of Tham Luang Cave,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said.On the first two days of the rescue, 18 divers \u2014 13 foreigners and five Thai \u2014 took part, bringing out four boys each time. On the final day, at least 12 divers took part.Jintrakarn Sriwanithkul, 18, a student at the Mae Sai Prasitsart School attended by six of the Wild Boars, grew excited at word of the successful rescue.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing news,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first heard about them being missing, I thought they\u2019d come out in two to three days because they knew the cave well.\u201dForeign journalists converged on the cave by the hundreds in the kind of mass coverage usually reserved for major news events, like the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 four years ago.For Thailand\u2019s military leaders, who seized power in a coup the same year and have yet to hold promised elections, the rescue was an opportunity to show their concern for residents of the country\u2019s northernmost province.King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who let it be known early on that he was closely following the search effort, donated food and supplies.Whether the king\u2019s unusual personal interest gave added impetus to the effort is unclear. But a top police official who visited the cave told search leaders to spare no expense.The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general, visited the cave twice to meet with officials, rescue workers and families of the missing boys. He assured relatives that the government would not abandon them.In the end, the final rescue part of the mission took just under nine hours, starting from the time the divers entered the cave to the time they had emerged with all four boys and Mr. Ekkapol.\u201cI would like to say thank you to His Majesty and royal family to support us,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said. \u201cI am thankful for all support from Thai people and all around the world.\u201dSome members of the Thai Navy SEALs stayed near the cave at quarters in Mae Sai. By the end, scuba gear, boxes of instant noodles and wet towels were strewn all around.One member of the SEALs said that the operation might have looked easy from the graphics in newspapers, but that it was tough. They worked 12-hour days at a minimum and returned to quarters exhausted.Nangnoung Namun, a weaver by trade who has been cooking hundreds of meals a day for the SEAL team as a volunteer, was elated by the successful rescue.\u201cNow I can sleep peacefully,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved.\u201dThe first confirmation that all 13 were finally safe came from the SEAL team with a post on their Facebook page shortly before 7 p.m.\u201c12 boars and coach are out of the cave,\u201d they announced. \u201cEveryone is safe.\u201d\u201cHooyah,\u201d the Facebook post concluded.Hannah Beech, Navaon Siradapuvadol and Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Impeach Rosenstein? C\u2019mon, Man", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its latest futile gesture, the House Freedom Caucus sets its sights on ousting the man overseeing Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Not to make Mr. Rosenstein feel any less special, but this is the fourth year in a row that Freedom Caucusers have pulled a summer-break stunt so nakedly self-serving that it would be comic if it weren\u2019t so odious in its quest to erode public faith in government and in democratic institutions more broadly. Indeed, for all those wondering how the Republican Party reached the point where Donald Trump could swallow it whole with his furious everything-is-awful-and-everyone-is-out-to-get-you brand of demagogy, look no further than the nihilists in the Freedom Caucus.Ms. Yates is right to be concerned. It\u2019s not that the Freedom Caucus members don\u2019t recognize the damage they\u2019re doing \u2014 or even that they don\u2019t care. It is that delegitimizing government is at the heart of their movement. These backbench bomb-throwers came to power on an explicit promise to stop President Barack Obama from achieving his goals and, as a bonus, to punish any Republican lawmaker showing even the slightest inclination to cooperate with the opposition. Conflict and obstructionism have always been their purpose, fueled by their relentless message that government is always the problem, that all experts are idiots, that cultural and coastal elites hate Real Americans and that all of Washington is corrupt and broken beyond repair. Except themselves, of course. As has often been noted, Mr. Trump did not invent the apocalyptic message that he has used to dazzle the Republican base. He merely distilled it to its essence. But the base had been groomed for his arrival for years, in no small part by lawmakers like Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan, who have repeatedly proved eager to tear down democratic institutions in the service of their own political aims. So while the Freedom Caucus\u2019s pitiful effort to oust Mr. Rosenstein should not be taken seriously on practical grounds, it is a tragic reminder of the bleak path down which the Republican Party has been slouching in recent years. The rot was there long before Mr. Trump showed up to exploit it, and it is likely to remain long after he is gone. Advertisement"}

Ms. Smarsh is the author of the forthcoming \u201cHeartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.\u201d The trouble begins with language: Elite pundits regularly misuse \u201cworking class\u201d as shorthand for right-wing white guys wearing tool belts. My father, a white man and lifelong construction worker who labors alongside immigrants and people of color on job sites across the Midwest and South working for a Kansas-based general contractor owned by a woman, would never make such an error.Most struggling whites I know live lives of quiet desperation mad at their white bosses, not resentment of their co-workers or neighbors of color. My dad\u2019s previous three bosses were all white men he loathed for abuses of privilege and people. It is unfair power that my father despises. The last rant I heard him on was not about race or immigration but about the recent royal wedding, the spectacle of which made him sick.\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about the royals?\u201d he told me over the phone from a cheap motel after work. \u201cBut they\u2019ll get the best health care, the best education, the best food. Meanwhile I\u2019m in Marion, Arkansas. All I want is some chickens and a garden and place to go fishing once in a while.\u201dWhat my father seeks is not a return to times that were worse for women and people of color but progress toward a society in which everyone can get by, including his white, college-educated son who graduated into the Great Recession and for 10 years sold his own plasma for gas money. After being laid off during that recession in 2008, my dad had to cash in his retirement to make ends meet while looking for another job. He has labored nearly every day of his life and has no savings beyond Social Security.Yes, my father is angry at someone. But it is not his co-worker Gem, a Filipino immigrant with whom he has split a room to pocket some of the per diem from their employer, or Francisco, a Hispanic crew member with whom he recently built a Wendy\u2019s north of Memphis. His anger, rather, is directed at bosses who exploit labor and governments that punish the working poor \u2014 two sides of a capitalist democracy that bleeds people like him dry.\u201cCorporations,\u201d Dad said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the point of the sword that\u2019s killing us.\u201dAmong white workers, this negative energy has been manipulated to great political effect by a conservative trifecta in media, private interest and celebrity that we might call Fox, Koch and Trump.As my dad told me, \u201cThere\u2019s jackasses on every level of the food chain \u2014 but those jackasses are the ones that play all these other jackasses.\u201dStill, millions of white working-class people have refused to be played. They have resisted the traps of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and nationalism and voted the other way \u2014 or, in too many cases, not voted at all. I am far less interested in calls for empathy toward struggling white Americans who spout or abide hatred than I am in tapping into the political power of those who don\u2019t.Like many Midwestern workers I know, my dad has more in common ideologically with New York\u2019s Democratic Socialist congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez than with the white Republicans who run our state. Having spent most of his life doing dangerous, underpaid work without health insurance, he supports the ideas of single-payer health care and a universal basic income.Among the 30 states tidily declared \u201cred\u201d after the 2016 election, in two-thirds of them Mrs. Clinton received 35 to 48 percent of the vote. My white working-class family was part of that large minority, rendered invisible by the Electoral College and graphics that paint each state red or blue.In the meantime, critical stories here in \u201cred states\u201d go underdiscussed and underreported, including:To find a more accurate vision of these United States, we must resist pat narratives about any group \u2014 including the working class on whom our current political situation is most often pinned. The greatest con of 2016 was not persuading a white laborer to vote for a nasty billionaire with soft hands. Rather, it was persuading a watchdog press to cast every working-class American in the same mold. The resulting national conversation, which seeks to rename my home \u201cTrump Country,\u201d elevates a white supremacist agenda by undermining resistance and solidarity where it is most urgent and brave.Advertisement"}

The officials also accuse these strongmen of sabotaging military operations.President Ashraf Ghani said Wednesday that he had ordered a crackdown on unruly militias because soldiers had complained to him that they had blurred the lines of who is enemy and who is friend and had contributed to high casualties.\u201cI tied the hands of three strongmen and brought them to Kabul,\u201d he said, Mr. Qaisari being one of them.Afghan officials said the decision to arrest Mr. Qaisari was made months ago. He was accused of killings and sabotaging military operations.A delegation of visiting officials and generals on Monday called Mr. Qaisari to a meeting in the brigade command in Faryab and had asked him to surrender and board the plane to Kabul with dignity, one senior official said. But his bodyguards resisted by force and then started shooting.Mr. Qaisari was bound and detained, then transferred to the capital, Kabul. Mohammed Ismail, a unit commander for Mr. Qaisari, called the meeting a trap.\u201cAs soon as he entered the meeting, the commandos were there,\u201d Mr. Ismail said. \u201cThey either wounded or killed his people and took him.\u201dMr. Ismail said four of Mr. Qaisari\u2019s guards had been killed, three wounded and 20 others detained. A guesthouse next to the army brigade command, run by Mr. Qaisari, was targeted by Afghan commando strikes. Officials said Mr. Qaisari\u2019s men opened fire on the helicopter that was taking him away, but Mr. Ismail denied that.Thousands of Mr. Qaisari\u2019s supporters poured into the streets of Faryab\u2019s provincial capital, Maimana, to demand his release, and government offices and shops were closed. On Wednesday, the number of demonstrators swelled and government forces fired on the crowd.The crowds then grew angry and stormed the governor\u2019s office, knocking down doors and setting vehicles on fire. Sayed Qasim Parsa, the head of the main hospital in Faryab, said two people had been killed and 10 wounded.Abdul Qudos Qilich, 70, one of the demonstrators, said that about 5,000 to 6,000 people had been marching peacefully in the city before security forces started shooting.\u201cThe demonstration is going a little out of control now after they killed and wounded,\u201d Mr. Qilich said. \u201cI hear light and heavy weapons still. Some of the protesters want to burn security posts, but we are trying to prevent them.\u201dThe Afghan Army has been deployed to parts of Maimana, and the president has dispatched his director of local governance and his army chief to try to calm the anger.In recent weeks, residents in two provinces protested over what they see as the government\u2019s mismanagement of issues related to coming parliamentary elections. Smaller demonstrations in support of Mr. Qaisari have also been reported in at least three other northern provinces.What complicates Mr. Ghani\u2019s crackdown is that he chose General Dostum as his running mate in the 2014 election despite a long list of accusations that the general had committed war crimes and other human rights abuses.Even after General Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, became vice president, he continued to lead controversial military operations in Faryab Province despite Mr. Ghani\u2019s opposition.He has been in exile in Turkey for about a year.Before his arrest on Monday, Mr. Qaisari, drawing his power from General Dostum\u2019s strong support, had repeatedly threatened government officials. He was angry over the government\u2019s failure to protect Faryab from the Taliban, who have the city of Maimana largely surrounded.Mr. Qaisari\u2019s unit commanders say he controls thousands of fighters, but government officials estimated his force at 300 to 1,000.Weeks after that May meeting, with no improvement in Faryab\u2019s security situation, Mr. Qaisari essentially threatened a coup.\u201cIf they do not pay attention, we will tolerate this one day, or two days, or three days,\u201d Mr. Qaisari said. \u201cAfter that, I will take over everything. I will be the governor. I will be the police chief. I will be in charge of everything in Faryab.\u201dJawad Sukhanyar and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting from Kabul, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

Egyptians Shake Their Heads (and Hips) ", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCairo DispatchThe arrest of a Russian belly dancer exposed simmering tensions in Cairo\u2019s belly-dancing scene. Critics say foreigners are sullying an ancient art form. Many Egyptians love them.CAIRO \u2014 When undercover police officers in Egypt swooped on an upscale nightclub on the Nile last spring and arrested a Russian belly dancer, the focus of their investigation was her costume \u2014 and what, if anything, lay beneath it.Russian diplomats paid a visit. Her manager and her husband back in Moscow pressed her case. In her dingy cell, Ms. Andreeva gave an impromptu performance for a dozen fellow prisoners, mostly prostitutes and drug dealers.\u201cThose women treated me so well,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey asked me to dance, and then we all danced together.\u201dAfter three days, it seemed she would be deported. But at the last minute, a mysterious white knight intervened \u2014 a Libyan businessman with powerful connections, she was told \u2014 and she was sprung from jail.In recent decades, belly dance has inspired conflicting impulses among Egyptians, who see it either as high art, racy entertainment or an excuse for moral grandstanding.But Ms. Andreeva\u2019s plight also highlighted a rather touchy issue: If Cairo is the global capital of belly dance, then why do its hottest new stars come from everywhere but Egypt?At a wedding in a plush Cairo suburb, a barefoot Alla Kushnir shimmied onto the flower-strewn dance floor, a whirlwind of quivers, twists and furious gyrations.Young men in tuxedos, grinning widely, clambered over one another for a better view of the belly dancer. Little girls in party dresses scurried behind, imitating her moves. A group of veiled women at a corner table clapped in approval.\u201cComing to Egypt was my dream,\u201d said Ms. Kushnir, 33, who hails from Ukraine, while stuffing her outfit into a suitcase afterward.Foreigners have dominated the top flights of Egypt\u2019s belly-dancing scene in recent years \u2014 Americans, Britons and Brazilians, but especially Eastern Europeans.Growing up in the port city of Nikolayev, Ms. Kushnir, 33, dreamed of being an archaeologist. She graduated in law. But in 2010, she appeared on a TV show, \u201cUkraine\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d with an extravagant belly-dance routine that set her on a new career path.Purists bemoan the foreign invasion as a cultural travesty. They accuse the outsiders of trampling on Arab heritage for profit and pushing the dance form in a brash direction. Even some foreigners agree.\u201cIn many cases, we lack the nuance, subtlety and grace of Egyptians,\u201d said Diana Esposito, a Harvard graduate from New York who came to Egypt in 2008 on a Fulbright scholarship and stayed to pursue a career in belly dance.\u201cIt feels like the Egyptian dancer is an endangered species, which is very sad,\u201d said Ms. Esposito, who recently moved back to Brooklyn. \u201cSad for the art. Sad for Egypt.\u201dEven so, Egyptian dance still has one undisputed queen \u2014 a dancer who by wide agreement stands above them all.It was just after 3 a.m. at the cabaret in the luxury Semiramis Hotel when Dina glided onto the stage, glittering in the spotlight, as a 17-piece band struck up.Bow-tied waiters bustled about. Puffs of cigar smoke lingered in the air. The audience \u2014 Arab couples, Western tourists, as many women as men \u2014 watched from red velveteen booths, utterly entranced.A legend across the Middle East, Dina Talaat Sayed has danced for princes, presidents and dictators in a career spanning four decades. \u201cAh yes, Qaddafi,\u201d she said with a wry smile, recalling the deposed Libyan strongman. \u201cFunny man. Very funny.\u201dMs. Sayed also knows all about Egyptians\u2019 conflicted attitude about her profession.\u201cLove and hate \u2014 it\u2019s always been like this,\u201d she said. \u201cEgyptians cannot have a wedding without a belly dancer. But if one of them marries your brother \u2014 oh, my God! That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u201cEgyptians see an Egyptian dancer as a hooker,\u201d said Bassem Abd El Moneim, Ms. Andreeva\u2019s manager. \u201cBut a foreigner can be a star.\u201dThere are exceptions beyond Ms. Sayed. One prominent dancer, Amie Sultan, hails from a wealthy family and trained as a ballerina. Another, Fifi Abdou, an Egyptian national treasure viewed with both affection and mockery for her boisterous personality, has been reincarnated in retirement thanks to social media.Recently, Ms. Abdou, 65, perched before a pair of iPads as she broadcast to her three million followers on Facebook and Instagram in an hourlong stream of affectionate babble, air kisses and trademark catchphrases.\u201cScooze me!\u201d she exclaimed randomly as the screen filled with red hearts. \u201cSalma! Love you, love you, love you!\u201dBut for many Egyptians, the price of a career in belly dance can be too high.Randa Kamel, who runs a major belly dance school in Cairo that attracts students from across the world, was beaten as a teenager by a father who disapproved of her dancing. Even now, her 17-year-old son hides her profession at his private high school, and she pulls off her glittering fake nails before meeting his teachers.\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t go on TV,\u201d Ms. Kamel said. \u201cI want my son to have a good life. There\u2019s a certain amount of fame that is not healthy.\u201dMs. Andreeva, the briefly jailed Russian belly dancer, still isn\u2019t sure what spurred the police raid in February, but she blesses the day.Since then, bookings have soared, her appearance fee has doubled, and she is sought by the rich and powerful. Recent clients include the family of a major steel tycoon, the daughter of Egypt\u2019s prime minister and an exiled cousin of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Even the police chief who kept her in his jail has become a fan, and booked Ms. Andreeva for several family weddings, said her manager, Mr. Moneim.\u201cShe\u2019s famous now,\u201d he said, as he whisked her between gigs on a Friday night. \u201cPeople love that.\u201dMs. Andreeva admitted that it was hard to match Egyptian dancers on some levels. \u201cWe are technically good, but they have that Arab soul,\u201d she said.But she compensates by channeling the sheer, raucous energy of Egyptian audiences. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotion here that is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me feel like a rock star.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "How We Lost the Sky", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEThe space above us, once filled by the human imagination, is now crowded with technologies of surveillance and war. Mr. Weisbrode is a historian. Ms. Yeung is a poet.Once upon a time, the sky was everything above the earth, which lay at the center of human experience. The sky was the place of gods. Storms were demonstrations of their powers, and birds their airborne messengers. To attempt to fly, Icarus-like, too high, was a sign of hubris. Vast as it was, the sky remained in some sense \u201cclosed,\u201d forbidden to us, unknown and probably unknowable.The advent of popular air travel did not alter this perception so much as standardize it around the globe. Airplanes could go only so high and could stay in the air for only so long. Additionally, airplanes traveled along fixed routes. By 1919 these routes had been coined \u201cskyways.\u201d They were, and to some extent, remain, extensions of the land, spoken of in the same way as shipping routes. Indeed, much of the literature also describes space as a \u201cfrontier\u201d to be crossed, tamed and ultimately conquered in the way that the land and the seas had once been.The idea behind this was simple and is what today is called a \u201cconfidence-building measure.\u201d It was a statement of political and philosophical intent, nominally sincere but possibly cynical in practice. Using the transparency of the skies, in other words, was meant to shed light, to build mutual trust and perhaps even transpose what was once mysterious into something more knowable.\u201cOpen skies\u201d has come down to posterity as a partly psychological (and perhaps propagandistic) attempt to alter collective behavior \u2014 a sort of Big Brother effect, as it were. But it also marked a different psychological \u2014 or perhaps spiritual \u2014 shift, having less to do with the quality of the sky itself than with the relationship between the sky and the territory below.That it took until 1992 for an open-skies treaty to be signed between the former Cold War rivals suggests that some people like to keep their secrets hidden. Back when Eisenhower introduced the idea, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev protested, it was said, by insisting that Americans wanted to look into his bedroom. When Soviet forces shot down an American U-2 spy plane a few years later and caught Eisenhower in a lie, Khrushchev relished the I-told-you-so moment.By that time aerial photography had multiplied the possibility of its range; satellite imaging was included in its arsenal; the once novel image of the \u201cBlue Marble\u201d planet taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft in 1972 was now normalized and absorbed into the cultural imagination. In 2004, Google would buy Keyhole Inc.\u2019s EarthViewer software, transforming a tool of modern warfare into a convenience for the typical computer user.However, there was more to the coincidence of this shift in territorial meaning. Yes, there was a familiar, generational shift away from one form of linearity in favor of another, from an absolute to a relative sense of both time and space. But something else had happened. The sky had opened and shifted to another axis \u2014 not of the earth itself but to bridge the connection, spatial as well as spiritual, between the land and the air, between the planet and space. As human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two \u2014 each in the presence of the other \u2014 became less predominantly horizontal than vertical.Eisenhower\u2019s open skies \u2014 our airy source of clarity \u2014 became momentarily possible. The views from an airplane in the comparatively unpolluted skies of California in the early 1960s allowed Thom Gunn to write of the intoxicating \u201crichness\u201d of an aerially mappable space \u2014 a vision of \u201cplaces I have not been to\u201d \u2014 which, on cloudless days, is the ideal of scientific clarity: \u201ca cold, hard light without break/that reveals merely what it is \u2014 no more/and no less.\u201dYet, as human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two became again less vertical, and more contrived. The sky filled with all those orbiting gadgets therefore has not only turned the earth upon its axis multiple times and surrounded it with multiple smaller spheres, but also broken it down into a familiar patchwork of seas, plains, ghettos, \u201cstreet views\u201d and possibilities of filtered vision that Google Earth presents us so readily with.The filling of the sky just above the earth with the flotsam and jetsam of the space age leads us to ask whether or not this represents some sort of ironical condition of foreclosure in the early-21st-century imagination, foreshadowed by Louis MacNeice in 1937: \u201cThe sky was good for flying/Defying the church bells/And every evil iron/Siren and what it tells:/The earth compels \u2026.\u201dMeanwhile, many more countries now watch from the sky what each of us is doing in microscopic detail. And so we may be right to ask if another conceptual breakthrough may soon occur in the spatial imagination. And we would be right to fear that the sky may fully close before that happens.Advertisement"}

Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. They go on:Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor \u2014 known among economists as \u201clabor share\u201d \u2014 coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to \u201ctemporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.\u201dThe outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the \u201cfissuring of the workplace\u201d that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account \u201cfor a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.\u201dThe steady erosion of workers\u2019 bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors.\u201cThe Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,\u201d Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court\u2019s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June\u2019s Janus decision, and the Court\u2019s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses.The authors document increasing market concentration:From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues.Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile \u201cgrew 160 percent\u201d while firms \u201cin 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.\u201dWhat economists\u2019 technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people.The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: \u201cConcentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent \u2014 monopsony \u2014 that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.\u201d Firms dominating concentrated labor markets \u201cface relatively inelastic labor supply\u201d (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to \u201creduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.\u201dReduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor\u2019s share of income has fallen.Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart.Labor\u2019s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted.115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:97.17INDEXED TO 2009 = 100\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:INDEXED TO 2009 = 10097.17\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector.In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share.Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: \u201cResults show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.\u201dWhat does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back:Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening:1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it).2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits.3. A general increase in profits.Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately becausewithout any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits.Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profitsaffects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households \u2014 which live on wage/salary income \u2014 and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments.This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate.The growing importance of digital innovation \u2014 new products and processes based on software code and data \u2014 has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter\u2019s vision, digital innovation gives rise to \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, \u201caccrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.\u201dHow much money are we talking about?The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity \u2014 from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies.In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent.While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years.$22.80Tax bill enactedJUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80Tax bill enacted$22.80JUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars.Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we\u2019ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover.That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations \u2014 amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections \u2014 is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates\u2019 probability of victory.These improvements, in turn, \u201clower uncertainty about an election\u2019s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.\u201dThe effect, then, is thatwhen one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most.Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others \u2014 a majority of them men \u2014 have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them.How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

They\u2019ll be gone before August.Talk of an excellent apricot crop this year led me to the Union Square Greenmarket. Indeed, a number of stands had bins and baskets brimming with bright, intensely golden fruit, some of it lightly rouged, some still hinting of green. The farmers and staff members I consulted all confirmed that it was a good season, just starting, though they could not guarantee that there would be fruit beyond the first week of August. The apricots that I selected, yielding without being soft, were rich and lush, with a whisper of tartness. They demand to be eaten, or arranged on pastry and baked without delay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Delivers a Pile of Cash, but No Fireworks", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hold that champagne.Expectations for Amazon\u2019s second quarter were extremely high, and in some respects the company exceeded them when it released results on Thursday. But any hope that it would be the event that hurtled the company\u2019s valuation above the trillion-dollar mark will have to wait.Net sales increased 39 percent, to $52.9 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. Analysts predicted $53.37 billion. What\u2019s a $500 million miss from a highflier? Well, Facebook on Wednesday missed its estimates by about $200 million, on revenue that was a quarter of Amazon\u2019s, and the stock tumbled 19 percent.But Amazon leads a charmed life: Good results mean things are working out, and weak results mean it is investing so things will work out in the future.Net income for the quarter was impressive: $2.5 billion, or $5.07 per share, compared with $197 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2017. Analysts anticipated only about half that. Amazon has now been consistently profitable since early 2015, something a few analysts \u2014 and quite a few short-sellers, who were betting on the stock dropping \u2014 thought they would never see.\u201cA blowout quarter by virtually any measurement,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, Moody\u2019s lead retail analyst.The company\u2019s result eased some tech investor worries that Facebook\u2019s problems would spread elsewhere. Amazon fell $56, or about 3 percent, in regular trading Thursday \u2014 a minor blip in the stock\u2019s relentless march upward over the last decade. The company\u2019s results, posted after the markets closed, made up those losses plus a few dollars more in after-hours trading.Last week, both the power and the perils of Amazon were on vivid display. The company had its fourth-annual Prime Day, a made-up shopping holiday that is available only to Prime customers. It was so successful that the site crashed. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, estimated that Prime Day sales rose 33 percent from last year.But the sale was conducted against the backdrop of work stoppages in Europe that lasted as long as three days, one of the biggest labor actions in the company\u2019s history. The strikes, which happened in Germany, Poland and Spain, did not involve all the workers in those countries. In Spain, the police clashed with the strikers, resulting in at least one worker injury.Amazon responded with a statement saying it was \u201ca fair and responsible employer\u201d that was offering Europeans \u201cgood jobs with highly competitive pay, full benefits and innovative training programs.\u201dIn its announcement about its earnings, Amazon brought up the things it cares most about: its membership club, Prime; its market-leading cloud division, Amazon Web Services; and Alexa, the voice technology that powers the Echo devices people use in their homes.While Amazon gives few numbers on Alexa and Echo, the research firm eMarketer says 41 million people in the United States will use an Echo this year, up 31 percent over last year. Echo has about twice the market share of its closest competitor, Google Home.Amazon is so dominant in e-commerce that it barely needed to mention it in the earnings announcement. It controls exactly half of the online market in the United States. Its next competitors, including eBay and Walmart, own market shares mired in the single digits. Ebay, which bested Amazon in auctions long ago, has been struggling. It said it would lay off hundreds of employees this month.For years, Amazon has been on a hiring binge \u2014 world domination needs many hands. But in the second quarter, it slowed a bit, increasing only 12,000 from the first quarter. In 2017, employment grew 31,000 between the first and second quarters.Daniel Ives, head of technology research for GBH Insights, reaffirmed Thursday his $2,000 target for Amazon\u2019s shares, a price that would make it a trillion-dollar company.\u201cAfter the Facebook debacle last night,\u201d Mr. Ives wrote in a research note, \u201cwe believe the Street will be somewhat relieved to see Amazon deliver another strong quarter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Owls See the World Much Like We Do", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOwl eyes are round, but not spherical. These immobile, tubular structures sit on the front of an owl\u2019s face like a pair of built-in binoculars. They allow the birds to focus in on prey and see in three dimensions, kind of like humans \u2014 except we don\u2019t have to turn our whole heads to spot a slice of pizza beside us. A critical part of perception is being able to distinguish an object from its background. One way humans do this is by grouping elements of a scene together to perceive each part as a whole. In some cases, that means combining objects that move similarly, like birds flying in a flock, or the single bird that breaks away from it. But Dr. Gutfreund and his team believed this ability was more basic \u2014 like seeing past camouflage. A barn owl, for example, might have evolved a similar mechanism to detect a mouse moving in a meadow as wind blows the grass in the same direction. To test visual detection tactics in their feathered subjects, they showed barn owls screens of black, moving dots on a gray background and attached cameras to their heads to track their gazes. Then the team measured how long it took the birds to turn their heads toward a target dot, moving in a different direction than numerous other shifting dots. The owls were able to spot the target. They were better at finding it when the contrasting dot direction was uniform rather than scattered. Even though the elements were all black dots, the direction they were moving made a big difference in the owl\u2019s perception of the world \u2014 and how its brain responded.\u201cWhat we find is considered higher level processing in an area that is not traditionally considered a higher level area,\u201d Dr. Gutfreund said. He thinks this ability was conserved through evolution in a similar part of the human brain called the superior colliculus, which helps direct attention among other functions.But how the ability evolved, or how it may play out differently in birds and mammals is still a mystery, Dr. Gutfreund said. For now, they want to determine the path traveled through the owl\u2019s brain by these movement-grouping signals. Advertisement"}

They said they were the only black people at the pool.Mr. Yates, 25, was watching the children play in the pool, sitting at the edge with his feet dipped in the water, when a woman who identified herself as a property manager asked him to remove his socks because they were not \u201cproper pool attire,\u201d the couple said. When he did not remove his socks or leave the property, they said, she called the police.Ms. Porter, 25, posted an account of the incident on Facebook, along with video of their conversation with a police officer.In an interview on Sunday, she said she felt racially targeted by the manager, whom she identified as Erica Walker. She said white people were wearing clothing other than swimsuits, such as hats or shirts, in the pool.\u201cIt\u2019s not the issue with socks,\u201d Ms. Porter said. \u201cIf socks were not to be worn, that was very well fine. The issue was we were the only one addressed.\u201dRiverset Apartments and its Chicago-based property management company, Trilogy Residential Management, did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday but have released statements condemning discrimination.Ms. Walker, reached by text message on Sunday, declined to comment.Several white people have faced consequences after calling the police on black people, or threatening to do so, at pools this summer.On the Fourth of July, Mr. Yates said, he walked from the apartment to the pool wearing socks and flip-flops. He said he left his socks on as he tended to Ms. Porter\u2019s godsons.\u201cI\u2019m going to be in and out of the pool with the little kids and I don\u2019t want my feet scorching on this ground,\u201d he recalled.A woman in a swimsuit asked him to take off his socks, and then returned while identifying herself as a property manager, he said.Ms. Porter said she asked for identification to show that Ms. Walker worked at the complex, but Ms. Walker would not provide it. She said Ms. Walker asked them to leave and called the police when they refused.Ms. Porter and Mr. Yates commended the police officer for handling the situation professionally; the video shows him trying to defuse the tension.During a conversation with the officer, the couple said, Ms. Walker offered to allow them to go to a different pool at the complex.\u201cThat\u2019s when I finally understand: It\u2019s not the socks, it\u2019s me,\u201d Mr. Yates said.The couple took the children back to the apartment, and Ms. Porter posted about the confrontation on Facebook.

The suggestions made by Mr. Warner\u2019s office aim to address how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by the misuse of those companies\u2019 services.Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For instance, the reports propose large tech companies should:\u25a0 Undergo audits of their data and algorithms.\u25a0 Be liable if they fail to take down illegal or damaging content.\u25a0 Have a duty to identify and remove fake accounts.\u25a0 Be subject to legislation demanding their transparency.Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology companies. Mr. Warner\u2019s office focused on increasing competition in the technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are deemed to be so dominant that they have become \u201cessential facilities\u201d for users. The House of Commons report said the portrayal of tech companies as monopolies \u201cdoes not appreciate the benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.\u201dStill, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long way from becoming law. Some of them \u2014 such as thorough audits of data and algorithms \u2014 may be technically difficult to achieve. Many will require legislation that, at best, will be slow to enact, and, more likely, may never achieve the momentum and support among lawmakers to pass.Mr. Warner\u2019s office acknowledged as much. \u201cIn many cases, there may be flaws in each proposal that may undercut the goal the proposal is trying achieve,\u201d its paper reads, \u201cor pose a political problem that simply can\u2019t be overcome at this time.\u201dThe point of the proposal, though, the paper claims, was merely to prompt conversations: \u201cThe hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion \u2014 among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups \u2014 on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Won\u2019t Donald Trump Speak for America?", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president lays himself at Vladimir Putin\u2019s feet. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The last time President Trump claimed that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible for bad behavior, it didn\u2019t go well. That was nearly a year ago, after a march of neo-Nazis descended into violence and a white supremacist drove his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters, killing a woman.On Monday, Mr. Trump again engaged in immoral equivalence, this time during a gobsmacking news conference after his meeting in Helsinki, Finland, with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. A reporter referred to last week\u2019s indictments of 12 Russian military officials for a coordinated cyberattack on the 2016 election and asked Mr. Trump if he held Russia responsible. \u201cI hold both countries responsible,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Even in a presidency replete with self-defeating moments for the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Monday, which were broadcast live around the world, stand out. The spectacle was hard to fathom: Mr. Trump, standing just inches from an autocratic thug who steals territory and has his adversaries murdered, undermined the unanimous conclusion of his own intelligence and law enforcement agencies that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 election with the goal of helping Mr. Trump win. Mr. Trump called the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation \u201ca disaster for our country\u201d and then performed a selection of his greatest solo hits: \u201cZero Collusion,\u201d \u201cWhere Is the D.N.C.\u2019s Server?\u201d and finally the old chestnut, \u201cI Won the Electoral College by a Lot.\u201d Even top Republicans felt moved to speak up. \u201cThe president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,\u201d Paul Ryan, the House speaker, said. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals.\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said, \u201cThe Russians are not our friends, and I entirely believe the assessment of our intelligence community.\u201dNot to worry, Mr. Trump assured us: Mr. Putin \u201cwas extremely strong and powerful in his denial.\u201d So he must have been telling the truth. Mr. Putin, for his part, was happy to admit that he wanted Mr. Trump to win the election: \u201cYes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\u201d He mocked the idea that he had compromising material on President Trump \u2014 though without denying it \u2014 perhaps because Mr. Trump\u2019s own words were compromising enough. Mr. Putin offered to have Russian intelligence work with its American counterpart to get to the bottom of the meddling case, on the condition that Russian authorities were allowed to question American intelligence officials as well \u2014 which Mr. Trump called \u201can incredible offer.\u201d Yes, incredible.Mr. Trump has said he wants to revive a relationship with Russia that badly deteriorated under President Barack Obama. His opening statement to journalists proclaimed the goal of continuing \u201cthe proud tradition of bold American diplomacy\u201d and emphasized that \u201cdiplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility.\u201dIn theory, such objectives make sense. But Mr. Trump seems to be singularly na\u00efve, or deliberately ignorant, about why his own senior national security advisers have identified Russia as one of America\u2019s chief geostrategic adversaries, along with China.Other than according Mr. Putin the honor of a meeting that begins to erase the ostracism he suffered for invading Ukraine, it is hard to see what Mr. Trump accomplished. The two men talked about forging a new treaty to replace the New Start Treaty, which constrains nuclear weapons and is to expire in 2021, and also discussed cooperating on Syria, though they seem to have passed up a chance for concrete action.There has been no sign that the United States has derived any benefit from Mr. Trump\u2019s obsequiousness toward Mr. Putin, though Mr. Trump himself has now at least gotten a shiny new soccer ball.It remains a mystery why the president, unlike any of his Republican or Democratic predecessors, is unwilling to call out Russian perfidy. He has no trouble throwing his weight around when he is in the company of America\u2019s European allies, attacking them as deadbeats and the European Union as a \u201cfoe,\u201d or when he excoriates the news media as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Put him next to Mr. Putin and other dictators, and he turns to putty. All that\u2019s clear is that a president who is way out of his depth is getting America into deep trouble. An earlier version of this editorial misstated the action taken to charge a Russian woman as a foreign agent. She was charged through a criminal complaint, not an indictment.Advertisement"}

The Senate should examine his full paper trail thoroughly. Mr. Leahy is a Democratic senator from Vermont and member of the Judiciary Committee.With President Trump\u2019s selection of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, the obligation now falls to the Senate Judiciary Committee to carefully consider this nomination. By any measure, it is a daunting responsibility.I have served in the Senate for 44 years, a span that includes 19 nominations to the Supreme Court and 20 years as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. From reproductive rights to presidential immunity, health care to marriage equality, I have never seen so much at stake with a single seat.Like many past nominees, Judge Kavanaugh has impressive academic credentials and judicial experience. But unlike most of his predecessors, Judge Kavanaugh spent much of his career engaged in some of the most partisan fights in our nation\u2019s recent history \u2014 including Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton, the Bush v. Gore case and five contentious years in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. My response: Democrats should not worry. And Senator McConnell\u2019s complaints about possible delays for a Supreme Court nomination ring hollow after he stonewalled Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the court in 2016.I also supported Senator Sessions\u2019s request for documents related to military recruitment at Harvard while Justice Kagan was dean of the law school. It was beyond the scope of our committee\u2019s usual practice. But I agreed with Senator Sessions that the records would be of public interest and therefore ought to be subject to public scrutiny.This is what the American people should expect of Judge Kavanaugh. Every document of public interest should be made public. No artificial restrictions. No abuse of executive privilege. The American people deserve the unvarnished truth, just as Senate Republicans rightly demanded of President Obama\u2019s nominees. Judge Kavanaugh was directly involved in some of the most politically charged moments of our recent history. The Senate owes the American people an unsparing examination of his nomination, which could affect their lives for a generation. I urge Senate Republicans to live up to the bipartisan standard of transparency we set for Justice Kagan and demand his full record. That means all of it.Advertisement"}

This month, police officers in Norfolk, Va., released a video of themselves shimmying down a corridor and pumping their fists in the air, lip-syncing to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk.\u201d The video was a viral hit, viewed more than 70 million times on Facebook. It is one of the most popular entries in a lip-sync challenge initiated by police departments nationwide. The videos have come as police departments increasingly use social media to step up their public relations efforts and try to repair their image after years of anger and protests over police brutality and fatal shootings of black people by officers. \u201cIt is allowing the country to see us in another way,\u201d said Corporal William Pickering, a public information officer with the Norfolk Police Department, which created the \u201cUptown Funk\u201d video. \u201cWe aren\u2019t all robots.\u201d But feel-good videos go only so far to address what many black people and others see as an institutionalized bias that leaves them wary of the same law enforcement officers sworn to protect them. \u201cThe community didn\u2019t break the trust,\u201d said DeRay Mckesson, a civil rights activist and one of the most prominent voices in the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cYou can\u2019t build that one video at a time.\u201dFor some police departments, efforts like the lip-sync challenge are opportunities to show that not all members of law enforcement are like the officers seen in news accounts of police brutality. \u201cThe images are graphic,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy group. \u201cThis is how police are portrayed, with guns and Tasers and pepper spray.\u201dCarlos Ortiz, a public relations officer for the San Antonio Police Department, said, \u201cMost of the time you see a video of a police officer, it is because of a shooting.\u201dMichael Sitrick, a Los Angeles-based expert in public relations crisis management, said the videos not only show officers in a different light, but also lift morale among the officers themselves. \u201cI\u2019m not excusing the bad acts of a few, and neither are they,\u201d Mr. Sitrick said.The lip-syncing officers, he said, have \u201cbecome mini-celebrities\u201d among their peers.

{"Headline": "What Adults Can Learn From Dutch Children\u2019s Books", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe busy urban worlds of \u201czoekboeks\u201d and \u201cwimmelbooks\u201d have a lot to say about everyday European life.Mr. Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.And then the zoekboek really opened my eyes.The first such book we got was \u201cDe Vrolijke Vier Seizoenen\u201d (\u201cThe Merry Four Seasons,\u201d Google Translate tells me, though the book was published in the United States in 2008 as \u201cIn the Town All Year \u2019Round\u201d), by Rotraut Susanne Berner. It depicts the same seven panoramic scenes in a village (including a residential street, a city plaza and a department store) across the seasons. There\u2019s no text except for signage in the scenes. Rolling within each season are subplots (a cat chases a mouse; a parrot escapes; a fallen jogger is tended by a passer-by, from which romance blooms), while macroplots are threaded across the year (a woman has a baby; a school is built; a pumpkin grows). The main action belongs to what people do in each season: plant their gardens, buy Christmas trees, gather in the park with lanterns. Maybe the book is nostalgic for a bygone past, but apart from the winter ice skating, snowball-making and the absence of smartphones, the scenes belong to a present we\u2019d comfortably join.She argues that the zoekboek and the wimmelbook differ from each other: The zoekboek gives the reader explicit search tasks (where\u2019s Waldo?) and often uses words, while the wordless wimmelbooks \u201callow for manifold reading options and encourage a highly active response from children and adults, which rightfully might be called a form of playing.\u201d When I now read traditional storybooks (which we also do at home), they seem rigid and prescribed in comparison.This unabashed display of human bodies in wimmelbooks is wondrous: \u201cEen huis vol,\u201d by Doro G\u00f6bel and Peter Knorr, depicts, among other things, a pregnant woman getting checked by a midwife, a kid sitting on a toilet and another soaping up in the shower, but those are morsels of the book\u2019s charm. The point of view pivots around a ring of houses, viewed in cutaway as if they\u2019re dollhouses. At the center of the ring is a rickety merry-go-round, untarped for a party by a man living in a bowtop wagon, who in one page heads to the preschool with a shovel to help bury a rabbit. I have to resist listing all the activities crammed into the pages of my favorite wimmelbooks because they would come across as cringingly mundane. But the cramming is, in truth, transcendent, this gentle collapsing of time and bending of space to capture worldly things in their everyday profusion. These detail-laden scenes defy both photography and film. They\u2019re human constructions for satisfying the cognitive pleasures of collecting clues, exploring and telling stories.My family reads our wimmelbooks so much, we\u2019re loving them out of their bindings. But they really sank their teemingness into me as I was reading Richard Sennett\u2019s \u201cThe Foreigner: Two Essays on Exile,\u201d in which he describes how the political revolutions of 1848 redefined nationalism from one based on monarchies or concocted geographic partitions to one based on ordinary rituals, everyday life and authentic selves.The revolutionaries of the age \u201cbelieved that a nation was enacted by custom, by the manner and mores of a volk: the food people eat, how they move when they dance, the dialect they speak, the precise forms of their prayers,\u201d Mr. Sennett writes. Wimmelbooks do just that \u2014 they show people glorying \u201cin their ordinary selves,\u201d as he puts it.That the wimmelbooks don\u2019t depict the volk I live among but are often outdated visions (given changing demographics in northern Europe) is obvious. Yet they underscore another of Mr. Sennett\u2019s themes: the foreign exile can\u2019t envision herself in the teeming, which I imagine happening to me when I return to the United States, unable to place myself in the wimmelbook of American life. If such a thing were even possible, that is. What\u2019s interesting to me is the visual perspective of wimmelbooks reflects the experience of riding not in cars but in trains and trams, where you pass close enough to houses to admire the tchotchkes in the windows and even through them to the back garden, at a slightly elevated angle, and at a pace slow enough to whet the curiosity about the residents yet quick enough to miss them if they should appear.

Earlier this month, the White House Council of Economic Advisers called for more \u201cwelfare reform,\u201d which would be accomplished by expanding work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\u201cfood stamps\u201d), Medicaid and rental housing assistance programs. Mr. Trump and his conservative allies in Congress correctly grasp that many Americans dislike policies they associate with \u201cwelfare.\u201d But most non-disabled working-age beneficiaries of these programs do, in fact, work, and critics of Mr. Trump's plan argue that adding bureaucratic hurdles could hinder many otherwise eligible people from obtaining the coverage they need.The reality is that more Americans than ever rely on social policies at various junctures in their lives and they value them highly. At the same time, they increasingly dislike government. These simultaneous trends embody a paradox I call \u201cthe government-citizen disconnect.\u201d Oddly, the conservative war on social policies and conservatives\u2019 efforts to promote self-sufficiency began in the 1970s and 1980s \u2014 not an era of free-market success but rather when its failures became evident, as good-paying jobs departed from many Americans\u2019 lives and communities. Most social policies, though long under siege, have survived. The only policy lawmakers terminated is the one that used to be identified solely as \u201cwelfare\u201d \u2014 Aid to Families With Dependent Children, which was replaced in 1996 with the more restrictive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Today, less than 1 percent of Americans use that program. It would have seemed that the struggle against welfare was over. Yet in recent years, conservatives have begun associating the stigmatizing term \u201cwelfare\u201d with more policies. This caters to a receptive audience: 44 percent of Americans report unfavorable views of welfare. I examined the factors that shaped these opinions, controlling for education, income, gender and race or ethnicity. Those in each of three middle-income groups, with household incomes from $35,000 to $99,000, were significantly more likely to feel unfavorably toward welfare. It was not just the \u201cworking poor\u201d \u2014 those with incomes just above eligibility \u2014 who voiced their hostility; such views pervaded the middle class.Members of the middle class may well feel that life has become harder for their families in recent decades, as they have increased their work effort but seen little income growth. Racial bias, too, helps explain these attitudes: Whites are significantly more likely to voice unfavorable views of welfare than people of color. Beneficiaries of programs for the poor tend to vote less than those who have received benefits skewed toward the more affluent. Policies that are \u201csubmerged\u201d \u2014 that make government\u2019s role less visible by being channeled through the tax code and/or private organizations, while being subsidized by the government \u2014 are in boldface.PERCENT VOTING IN:MIDTERMS20%Welfare/TANFPRESIDENTIALELECTIONSMedicaidFood stampsPublic housing/Section 8Supplemental Sec.

But a divisive politics that draws lines between the deserving and the undeserving obscures actual developments. The use of federal social transfers has grown in all states and in all counties throughout the nation, from 7 percent of the average American\u2019s income in 1969 to 17 percent in 2014, according to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. While the aging of the baby boomers has elevated the amount of income gained from Social Security and Medicare, reliance on other policies has grown at a comparable rate, helping working-age people through decades of stagnant pay, greater job insecurity and reduced employee benefits.Percentage of Americans under age 60 who have ever used these social policies, by income group.80%Benefits that skew to poorer Americans \u2026\u2026 and richer AmericansFood Stamps60%MedicaidHome mortgageinterest deduction40%Employerhealthbenefits20%Lessthan$20K$20-34K$35-49K$50-100KMorethan$100KLessthan$20K$20-34K$35-49K$50-100KMorethan$100KBenefits that skew to poorer Americans \u2026\u2026 and richer Americans80%Food Stamps60%MedicaidHome mortgageinterest deduction40%40%Employerhealthbenefits20%20%Lessthan$20K$20-34K$35-49K$50-100KMorethan$100KLessthan$20K$20-34K$35-49K$50-100KMorethan$100KBy The New York Times | Source: Social and Governmental Issues and Participation Study, 2008The average person has used 4.5 policies, one of which was a means-tested policy. Unsurprisingly, Americans in the highest income group have mostly used non-means-tested policies and those in the tax code. Yet over all they had used the identical number as those in the lowest income group. Similar patterns emerge across all economic, social and political divides. We are all beneficiaries of government. But the high and growing use of social policies points toward the paradox I mentioned earlier. Even though Americans rely more on public social benefits than in the past, they hold extremely negative views of government, as evidenced by long-term trends in numerous survey questions.

And the roadblocks are compounded when a place to eat also involves a fully equipped ice cream factory and bakery, as in the case of Ample Hills Creamery Factory and Museum. The location was one of the complications that pushed the opening back the best part of a year. Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the owners, who founded the company in Prospect Heights seven years ago, were dealing with raw space. \u201cWe had to build the infrastructure from scratch,\u201d Mr. Smith said. They also had to switch architects midstream. The new 15,000-square-foot facility, with a scoop shop and counters in front and behind it, a playroom and an interactive museum of ice cream, is built into Beard Street Warehouses. Part of a series of brick storerooms from the mid-19th century, the warehouses were once used to hold goods like cotton and coffee. The space has allowed Ample Hills to improve production with the capacity to churn out 500,000 gallons a year (right now they\u2019re at 50,000). In place of batch freezers, there is now a continuous system. Mix-ins like cookie pieces made in the bakery are added automatically and pints are filled by machine, not by hand. Mr. Smith said that, if anything, this industrialization should enhance the ice cream\u2019s texture. And though the company is now able to deliver pints to many more retail shops, Mr. Smith said they would keep opening scoop shops, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to be pints in grocery stores.\u201d Los Angeles will have an Ample Hills in the fall, followed by another one on Prospect Park West, to bring the total to 13.Mr. Conlon, the chef and an owner of Fat Rice in Chicago, will be in residence with his vibrant personal take on the food of Macao from Aug. 13 to Oct. 13 at Chefs Club New York in NoLIta.Mr. Olmos, who is from Veracruz, Mexico, and started as a dishwasher at Daniel Boulud\u2019s company, the Dinex Group, 14 years ago, has been named executive chef for Boulud Sud.The Tokyo-based sushi chef trained the team at Sushi Ginza Onodera in preparing traditional Edomae-style sushi, which involves aging some fish so it can develop more umami. Now, he will be behind the counter at the restaurant, which has two Michelin stars, for lunch and dinner from Wednesday through next Monday (except for Aug. 5).The famous pizzeria and restaurant, which opened 10 years ago and put Bushwick, Brooklyn, on the culinary map, will be opening a second location in about a year. It will be part of the continuing redevelopment of the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, waterfront by Two Trees Management, at the site of the former Domino Sugar Factory, adjacent to Domino Park. The new Roberta\u2019s will occupy 2,292 square feet on the ground floor of the second mixed-use building in the development. Brandon Hoy, an owner, said the new Roberta\u2019s would have a design that would be \u201cmore in line with the building itself.\u201d That means modern and glass, and not the rough-hewn look of the original. He also said there would be two wood-fired ovens, a large bar and possibly cafe seating facing the waterfront park.260 Kent Avenue (Grand Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds Died in Syrian Custody, Government Acknowledges", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Seven years ago, Islam Dabbas, an engineering student, was thrown in prison for protesting against the Syrian government. His mother visited him twice, paying bribes to do so, but then the permissions stopped. She heard nothing of her son\u2019s fate ever since.Until last week, when a relative filed for a government registration document and was shocked to see that it gave Mr. Dabbas\u2019s date of death: Jan. 15, 2013.\u201cThe news of his death devastated us, and we wish we had known then,\u201d said his sister, Heba, who lives in exile in Egypt. \u201cSince his arrest, we have lived days of hope and days of despair as uncertainty consumed our minds.\u201dIn recent weeks, hundreds of Syrian families have suddenly learned that their missing relatives have been registered as dead by the government. Government officials have not commented publicly on the new information, said how many people it applied to, or explained how they died.But the documents appear to be the first public acknowledgment by the government that hundreds if not thousands of prisoners died in state custody. Analysts believe the quiet changes in status show that President Bashar al-Assad is confident enough of winning the war and remaining in power that he can make that admission without fear of repercussion, prodding the families of the missing to confirm their worst fears and begin to piece their lives back together.\u201cThe regime is closing one chapter and starting a new one,\u201d said Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIt is telling the rebels and the activists that this chapter is gone, that whatever hope in some surviving revolutionary spirit has been crushed.\u201dIn some towns, the government has posted names of the deceased so their relatives can get death certificates. In other cases, families have obtained documents that attest to their relatives\u2019 deaths. In some cases, security officers have informed families personally.Many of the documents show that the deaths occurred years ago, in the early part of the uprising against Mr. Assad that evolved into a brutal civil war.Since the conflict began seven years ago, tens of thousands of people have disappeared into government jails where torture and mistreatment, sometimes causing death, are rife, human rights groups say. The prisoners included rebels as well as political protesters, and their families were often left struggling to get information.Rights groups see the new death notices as a tacit admission that many detainees died or were killed in government jails.Mr. Assad has largely routed the rebels who sought to oust him and restored his control over much of the country. His government and its Russian and Iranian backers have tried to portray the war as nearing its end, and letting families know that their missing relatives are dead may also be a way of trying to get the country to move on.A missing head of household leaves a Syrian family in bureaucratic limbo. Without his death certificate, for example, his widow cannot remarry and his offspring cannot sell property or handle inheritance issues.But while acknowledging deaths may facilitate such transactions, many doubt that families will accept the news so easily if they hold the government responsible for their loved ones\u2019 deaths.\u201cIt is difficult to move on when the people who are responsible for these mass disappearances are still there,\u201d said Sara Kayyali, a Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cYou are looking the perpetrator in the face, and it is not something you can ignore for a very long time.\u201dThe documents offer no details about the deaths except a date. Many families still want to know how their loved ones died and where their bodies are.Two brothers, Yahya and Muhammad Shurbaji, were arrested within a day of each other in September 2011, according to Muhammad\u2019s son, Obaida. But as the uprising evolved into war and their relatives fled elsewhere in Syria or abroad, they lost track of where the brothers were being held.This month, relatives in Damascus, hearing that dates of death were starting to appear on registration papers for the missing, requested the documents for the brothers. They found that Yahya had died in January 2013 and Muhammad in December of the same year. No cause of death was given, and the family has no idea where their bodies are.\u201cThe shock is indescribable,\u201d said Bayan, the men\u2019s sister, who lives in Leeds, England. \u201cHow cruel is it to kill people and deprive their families of seeing them for one last time, to deny the victims from saying goodbye to their families?\u201dIt remains unclear how many detainees have been recently registered as dead. Many families in Syria are reluctant to discuss their cases for fear of retribution by the government.The Syrian Network for Human Rights, an exile monitoring group that opposes the government, has confirmed 312 recent cases, said its director, Fadel Abdul Ghany.That is a fraction of the more than 80,000 government detainees his group says it has confirmed, so he expects more names will come out over time.He surmised that the information is coming out now because the government feels secure enough to let those who stood against it know that their relatives are dead, he said.\u201cThe regime wants to say that you have to accept me as I am,\u201d Mr. Abdul Ghany said. \u201c\u2018I have won, and you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u2019\u201dThe lack of information has left many families confused and wondering whether the documents are accurate.As the war progressed, extremists gained power in the refugee camp where he lived and the government besieged it, spreading hunger among its residents.In 2015, Mr. Saied paid a smuggler to get him out, but was arrested by the government before he could leave, his wife, Lamis AlKhateeb, said by phone this week from Germany.His mother managed to visit him once the following year and found him skinny and weak, Ms. AlKhateeb said. That was the last time the family saw him.This month, a security officer who knows the family told them that Mr. Saied was dead, but the family has yet to obtain a death certificate. If the notice was intended to help her, Ms. AlKhateeb took little solace.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.

{"Headline": "Not Your Childhood Chicken Salad", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KITCHENPaired with a miso dressing, this take on the classic is a far cry from those cafeteria versions, plopped on plates with an ice cream scoop.The term \u201cchicken salad\u201d conjures for most people the versions they grew up with: the mayonnaise-y interpretations with the chopped celery, or the cafeteria style plopped on a plate with an ice cream scoop, or any number of serviceable, reliable but ultimately dull renditions. Don\u2019t get me wrong: No doubt hundreds of other fabulous chicken salads exist. But when I asked some friends the other day, they described bland chicken salad sandwiches.So I began to think of this refreshing summery dish of chicken with miso dressing more as a delightful cold lunch or supper, and less as a chicken salad per se, despite the cucumbers and lettuce leaves in evidence.I like miso dressing, especially its nutty, nuanced flavor and creamy texture. Sometimes, I make it thick and spoonable, and other times thin enough to drizzle. Miso dressing can be used with a green salad, or as a replacement for mayonnaise on a sandwich. Depending on its thickness, it also makes a great dip for vegetables.Miso, that fermented marvel, is usually made from soybeans, but some kinds are made from barley, wheat or even brown rice. For dressings, I usually prefer the milder white miso (shiro), but yellow (shinshu) or red (aka) are other choices to play with.From your pantry, you\u2019ll also need rice wine vinegar, mirin or sake and toasted sesame oil. If you don\u2019t have Asian sesame paste, use Middle Eastern tahini.Hand-shredding the chicken meat into one-inch strips takes a little time; using a knife is somewhat faster. But I advise against cubes, because the dressing coats shredded chicken more evenly.I like to pile the dressed chicken on a platter, but leave the other ingredients naked, green and crisp. That way, diners can decide how to go about eating this salad. Some people may fill little lettuce cups or roll the chicken into lettuce-leaf wraps. Others may prepare a chopped salad on their plate using a knife and fork.It\u2019s a fresh-tasting casual meal. It\u2019s also very pretty, sprinkled with scallions and sesame seeds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Benefits (and Limits) of Using Tech to Plan a Wedding", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixThis may sound unromantic, but before the internet era, wedding planning was a lot like car shopping. To find a place to get married, you had to read print ads with limited information designed to lure you in for a visit and pressure you into, well, committing.Nowadays, you can be more informed with the help of tech resources like online reviews, wedding planning tools and location websites. But much hasn\u2019t changed: Venues still bombard you with heavily doctored brochures (now digitized!) that make it difficult to compare prices. These ads often lowball you with baseline costs, and venues only share detailed pricing information after you pay a visit.Tech tools aim to make tasks like wedding planning more efficient and easier to manage. Yet the wedding industry remains complex. I\u2019ve been learning this the hard way. My partner and I were immediately overwhelmed when rummaging through PDFs and websites in search of venues, vendors and photographers. Ultimately, we caved and hired a coordinator to do the heavy lifting.Here\u2019s what we learned about the benefits and limitations of using tech tools to plan a wedding. At least so far, since our wedding is not until next year.Both offer web and mobile apps, which include a comprehensive set of tools to plan a wedding from start to finish, including picking a venue, finding vendors, setting up a registry and creating a budget.It\u2019s complicated. On average, couples hire 13 vendors to put together a wedding, according to Wedding Wire.The big planning tools offer searchable lists of vendors and venues, with reviews and links to the businesses\u2019 own sites. People can also turn to broader review websites like Yelp to help vet vendors, photographers and musicians.Now that you have a clear picture of how thorough the top wedding planning tools are, let\u2019s discuss their limits.Because of the deeply personal nature of a wedding, you can\u2019t just plan everything with a few taps on a smartphone or by sitting in front of a computer. Eventually you will have to talk to lots of people the old school way: on the phone or in person.But such customization makes it difficult for couples to obtain realistic bottom-line costs from venues and vendors, said Lauren Goodson, a director of consumer insights for Wedding Wire. The more you tweak, the more hours that go into different components of a ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. Sites like Wedding Wire offer price estimates for some nuances, but eventually you have to move on from tech tools and engage directly with vendors.\u201cThe cookie-cutter approach is less and less effective,\u201d Ms. Goodson said. \u201cIt does take some interaction with the venue to address specific needs of a couple.\u201dShe added that couples often underestimate the cost of their wedding by 40 percent, in part because they are initially unaware of the costs of their customizations.After becoming jaded with online brochures, my fianc\u00e9e and I began asking venues to send us their budget spreadsheets. Neatly arranged cells and numbers are the opposite of romantic, but this was the only way for us to craft a realistic budget including our modifications without losing our minds.One of the biggest advantages of using online tools is the power of reviews. You can find feedback about venues and vendors on a wealth of websites, like Facebook, Yelp, as well as Wedding Wire and The Knot.Mr. Crider, the author, said that when he and his wife were planning their wedding, they visited the Facebook pages for vendors like caterers, cake bakers and photographers to see what people were saying about them. They found the reviews to be very reliable.Online reviews are especially helpful for destination weddings. My partner and I opted to have our wedding out of state, but because of time constraints, we have not yet flown out to visit the venues. At the same time, venues fill up quickly so we knew we had to book something soon, sight unseen.Fortunately, with the extra assurance of reviews on The Knot and Wedding Wire, we were able to tentatively book a venue that was recommended by our coordinator before we go to visit it in a few months.My fianc\u00e9e and I are only at the beginning of this process, though later on we do plan on resorting to tech tools for buying decorations, ordering printed invitations, making an informational website for guests and creating a registry.There\u2019s one thing we probably won\u2019t buy online though: what we wear. For an event this monumental, we had better look good.Mr. Crider said he and his wife ordered their wedding bands and outfits online. Even though they knew their measurements, they had to return the rings because they didn\u2019t fit.\u201cIt was a crapshoot with the wedding rings,\u201d he said.But it doesn\u2019t always have to be that way. Mr. Crider and his wife buy each other new wedding bands every year, picking the traditional material associated with each anniversary. This year, for their seventh anniversary, they ordered copper rings on Etsy \u2014 and they fit.Advertisement"}

Cities work as great natural test cases for evolution, said Marc Johnson, the director of the Centre for Urban Environments at the University of Toronto, Mississauga, who led the research. \u201cIn many ways it\u2019s an unplanned experiment happening throughout the world over and over again,\u201d he said. Since Darwin, researchers have identified three main forces behind evolution: Natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow. This study, Johnson said, shows that natural selection, where some species evolve and are better able to reproduce more than others, is the dominant evolutionary force for urban white clover.It\u2019s only in the last few years that scientists have been paying attention to examining evolutionary processes in urban environments, said Anne Charmantier, an evolutionary ecologist with The National Center for Scientific Research, or CNRS, in Montpellier, France, who was not involved in the research.

{"Headline": "Why Are Some Crows Committing Acts of Necrophilia?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobites\u201cIt was certainly very surprising to me,\u201d said the researcher who observed the birds\u2019 strange behaviors when presented with crow cadavers.The setting was romantic enough. Sunny spring day. A cherry tree blossoming a vivid pink. One party, the suitor, was dark, fetching and amorous. But the other party lay there like a corpse. It was, in fact, a corpse. So began the first documented human observation of a crow copulating with a deceased member of its own species. In April 2015, Kaeli Swift, a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington who studies crows, was demonstrating one of her experiments for a film crew when she left an expired crow, stuffed by a taxidermist, unattended on the ground. A nearby crow soon swooped down upon the stuffed crow, crouching low, its wings spread wide and attempted intercourse. The move astonished Ms. Swift enough that she spent the next three springs and summers recreating these conditions and documenting the behavior.\u201cIt was certainly very surprising to me,\u201d Ms. Swift said of the newly observed behavior. There is anecdotal evidence that other animals engage in necrophilia, she said. Humans have spotted dolphins, whales and squirrels getting down with their dead. \u201cI never heard of this with crows before and I had never seen it.\u201d But what they witnessed in the spring of 2015 made it clear that there\u2019s more to how crows react to the dead than avoiding harm. For the new study the researchers removed the predator element from the equation. After identifying the territory of an adult pair of crows in a Seattle neighborhood, they placed a cadaver on a sidewalk or other exposed area and retreated about 65 feet away. Among the hundreds of crows observed during the study, the majority merely cawed loudly and dive bombed at the corpse without touching it. But 24 percent of the winged subjects pecked, pulled at or dismembered the body. And in 4 percent of the encounters observed, crows attempted copulation. (In one case, a crow mounted a dead pigeon used in the study for comparison.)Kevin McGowan, a professor at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and not involved in the study, said he\u2019d never witnessed a sign of necrophilia in more than three decades of observing crows. But he suspects over-charged hormones are largely at play. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of growth and disappearance of bird gonads during the off-breeding season,\u201d Dr. McGowan said, referring to the way bird testes may expand or shrink, depending on the time of year. That affects the hormones circulating in its system and the reaction to the stimuli the crow encounters. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising that you would see incidental sexual behavior pretty much only in the breeding season.\u201dThe new study did not record whether the individual necrophiliac crows were male or female, but Ms. Swift agreed that the time of year had a lot to do with the results. The sexual and aggressive behavior she observed was limited to the first half of the breeding season, which ends in mid June.\u201cI think the next line of testing would be to do hormonal profiles and see if there are endocrine differences between the birds that engage in this behavior and the birds that don\u2019t,\u201d she said.For now Ms. Swift speculates that the behavior may be a blend of potential responses a crow might have to its dead \u2014 seeing corpses as a sign of danger or a potential mate. Some crows may be incapable of umpiring their own responses to the stimuli, she suggests. So they engage in them all. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a behavior of crows exposed to crow corpses. Live crows only touch, attack and attempt intercourse with crow corpses, they do not scavenge them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mastering Chinese-Style Ribs at Home", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose barbecued racks seen in storefronts \u2014 salty-sweet, charred and thrillingly red \u2014 are easy to replicate at home with a simple marinade and a low oven. Siu mei, or \u201cfork burned\u201d meat, is a particular specialty of Guangdong (formerly called Canton), the province that sent the first large group of immigrants from China to the United States in the late 1800s. Siu mei became a popular export everywhere Cantonese cooks went \u2014 especially cha siu, the juicy, red-tinged, salty-sweet pork that routinely tops bowls of ramen in Japan and fills banh mi sandwiches in the many Little Saigons of the United States. In other words, siu mei is something food lovers buy, not make \u2014 much like charcuterie in France, pit barbecue in the American South and Central European deli meats like pastrami and corned beef. \u201cMy mother was terrified of the siu mei she saw when we moved to Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cEven in Chinatown, it was magenta, not red\u201d \u2014 the sure sign of cutting corners with food coloring. (If we\u2019re sticking to the delicatessen model, you might say that if siu mei corresponds to deli meat, Asian techniques for tofu correspond to cheese; the tofu is curdled, aged, flavored and controlled in many of the same ways.) Tofu-ru, like miso, fish sauce and dashi, evolved over centuries in the interest of adding umami \u2014 savory and mouth-filling flavor \u2014 to the plain food that people ate for most of human history.Ketchup is particularly useful in this recipe because it has plenty of sugar, which provides a desirable stickiness and caramelized edge when cooked. But if adding ketchup seems unbearable, nan ru is available online and in well-stocked Asian markets, and can be used in the recipe instead. Or you can make like many a commercial kitchen and add a few drops of red food coloring to your marinade. (Not too many.) Fatty-skinned birds like geese and ducks, and well-marbled cuts of meat like pork ribs, shoulder and belly, are used for siu mei because the fat continually bathes the meat as it cooks. When choosing racks for this recipe, whether baby backs or full spareribs, make sure that the meat is well marbled with fat, and that there\u2019s a substantial cushion of meat between the bones.Many modern Chinese cooks use maltose instead of honey for cha siu, because it produces a high-gloss, lip-smacking exterior. But the taste is virtually the same: The flavor of honey gets lost among the strong tastes, leaving only sweetness and a little stickiness behind.\u201cYou want them to be crisped on the edges and licked by the heat,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the sweet stickiness, and then juicy meat.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified Guangzhou and Guangdong, in China. Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, not vice versa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4,500 Tech Workers, 1 Mission: Get Democrats Elected", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It was four months and eight days until the 2018 midterm elections, and Anna Eskamani had not spent a penny to promote her political campaign online.Ms. Eskamani, 27, is running to represent Florida\u2019s 47th District in the State Legislature. Like many state-level candidates, she writes her own fund-raising emails and manages her own social media accounts. And with her busy schedule on the campaign trail, advertising online is an afterthought.\u201cMy budget is zero for it right now,\u201d Ms. Eskamani said. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been necessary.\u201dDozens of progressive groups are organizing for Democrats in this year\u2019s midterms. But Tech for Campaigns has focused on a particularly challenging assignment: dragging Democratic campaigns into the digital age, before it is too late.In a year and a half of existence, Tech for Campaigns has become a kind of Democratic Geek Squad \u2014 a national volunteer network consisting of more than 4,500 tech workers with day jobs at companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Airbnb. These volunteers, who include engineers, marketers and data scientists, are matched with Democratic campaigns across the country to provide training on digital skills, such as how to promote themselves on social media, build their email lists and use data analytics to identify potential donors.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake if we don\u2019t build a true centralized digital arm is falling further behind the Republicans and continuing to lose ground, the battles on key issues and elections at every level,\u201d said Jessica Alter, a co-founder of the group and a longtime tech executive. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start now, it will be too late in 2020.\u201dOne of the group\u2019s biggest tasks, Ms. Alter said, is persuading candidates to campaign heavily on social media, rather than relying solely on TV ads and printed mailers. Many Democrats running in 2018 are spending a much smaller percentage of their ad budgets on digital ads than their rivals, sometimes as little as 10 percent versus more than 40 percent for Republicans, according to two political consultants with ties to multiple campaigns.Tech for Campaigns has advised Democrats in about 60 races since it started, including Justin Nelson, who is running for attorney general in Texas, and Rob Quist, who was narrowly defeated in a special congressional election in Montana last year. The group plans to work with 200 campaigns by the end of the year, with a special focus on helping state-level candidates like Ms. Eskamani, who typically do not have the budgets to hire dedicated digital teams.\u201cWe do a lot of things that digital consultants don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cThe most common question we get asked is, \u2018What\u2019s the catch?\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Alter started contacting campaigns last year, she was shocked at how prosaic their technology was. Some campaign workers spent hours manually copying and pasting voter information into email lists. Others were not using basic social media capabilities, such as call-to-action buttons that can be used to ask followers to sign a petition, attend an event or make a donation.\u201cThey have all these really ingrained habits from pre-2016 that are very, very hard to unlearn,\u201d Ms. Alter said.Democrats are often thought to be tech-savvy, because the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were celebrated for their online touch and because much of Silicon Valley backs the party\u2019s candidates. In fact, Ms. Alter said, Democrats in congressional and state-level races have been outmatched by their Republican rivals, who benefited from the party\u2019s heavy tech investments during the Obama years and their enthusiastic embrace of targeted ads on platforms like Facebook and Google.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how not far along we are as a party,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cObama was really good at tech, but it never trickled down to a Senate race, let alone the state-level stuff.\u201dMs. Alter, 38, who sold her start-up last year and now works as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the venture capital firm Social Capital, came up with the idea for a tech volunteer network in early 2017, just after President Trump issued his travel ban targeting residents of several Muslim-majority countries.Outraged about the policy, and looking for a way to help, she enlisted Peter Kazanjy and Ian Ferguson, two friends in tech who shared her liberal politics. They agreed that Silicon Valley tech workers would jump at the opportunity to apply their technical skills to campaigns. How different is selling a candidate online, after all, from selling shoes or shaving kits?\u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d Mr. Kazanjy said. \u201cCampaigns are online/offline e-commerce plays, where the transaction is a vote.\u201dThey sent a Google form to their friends in the tech industry to gauge interest. Within three days, more than 700 people had signed up. The group has since grown to more than 4,500 volunteers, raised more than $100,000 in a crowdfunding campaign, and moved into an office in downtown San Francisco that it shares with a venture capital firm.Nick Hobbs, 29, first heard about Tech for Campaigns while working at Google. Mr. Hobbs, who left the company last year, had always been politically active, but Tech for Campaigns gave him a way to channel his efforts into something productive.\u201cInstead of coming home and watching Netflix, we come home and go to work,\u201d said Mr. Hobbs, who is helping redesign the campaign website of Elizabeth Thomson, a Democrat running in New Mexico\u2019s 24th District.Other left-wing advocacy groups, such as Swing Left and Indivisible, are helping to recruit volunteers and generate grass-roots support in competitive districts. Tech for Campaigns sees its role as behind-the-scenes amplification. Its work is mostly remote, and volunteers use a Slack channel to coordinate as well as regular calls with campaign officials.The group has not been universally welcomed by the party. It has irked some officials and media consultants, whose turf it is edging in on. And the group\u2019s volunteers have learned to give advice to candidates gently, to avoid coming off as arrogant know-it-alls.\u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of Silicon Valley having a savior complex,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t walk in saying, \u2018We\u2019re the experts. Let us run your campaign.\u2019\u201dIn the end, Mr. Hurst defeated his Republican opponent by eight points.\u201cI know, 100 percent, that they made a difference in our campaign,\u201d said Andrew Whitley, Mr. Hurst\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cI was very surprised these Silicon Valley folks were willing to donate their time like that.\u201dBy the end of the recent conference call, Tech for Campaigns had persuaded Ms. Eskamani, the Florida House candidate, to start running ads on her social media accounts. In the coming days, the group said, it would audit her other social media accounts to see which types of posts generated the best engagement and give her tips for increasing their impact.Ms. Eskamani gushed with excitement.\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, my gosh, so much structure. It\u2019s great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "My Gay Voice", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen I talk, people assume a lot about me. For a long time I thought I had to hide.Mr. Branum is a comedian and the author of the memoir \u201cMy Life as a Goddess.\u201dI am a gay man, and that means I do not like the sound of my own voice. I grew up a cerebral, effeminate child in a farm town in Northern California. You may assume when I say \u201cNorthern California,\u201d I mean the vineyard and lesbian-sous-chef-laden lands of the Napa Valley. I do not. By the fourth grade, I learned that there was something about me that made me audibly different from the other boys my age. I could not mask it, I could not change it, I could not fight so well that I could earn the respect of my classmates. My voice evoked rage and disgust from my peers and teachers. I kept it hidden and tried to fit into a role that did not fit me. I played football, I tried to date girls. None of it worked, so I became quiet, very quiet, for a long time.That\u2019s not what everyone does. Some people get really good at making the right noises. They listen closely, they shape and shade their words, becoming a perfect sign and semblance of a man. When you are prey, you learn to camouflage. Also, it\u2019s what we do a lot of the time. The ability to shift between codes is common in many minority groups, but when you\u2019re an invisible minority, some people turn into chameleons. It\u2019s the speech that Mystique gives in \u201cX2,\u201d the terribly named 2003 X-Men movie. Mystique is a mutant with the literal power to chameleon into any shape or voice she chooses, so Nightcrawler says to her, \u201cI heard you can imitate anyone \u2026 then why not stay in disguise all the time?\u201d Mystique says, \u201cBecause we shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d Few lines have so incisively characterized the rage I feel. Some people can\u2019t hide. I am one of those people. I wish I\u2019d spent all of my closeted years of self-hatred turning into a perfect simulation of a masculine, muscular straight guy. I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m one of the gay guys whose voices always marked us as men outside masculinity. Men in our society are expected to be loud, gruff, territorial and combative. Failing to comply with this code can result in disrespect, dismissal or even violence. I came to understand it as a test. I would open my mouth, speak, then wait to see how the room reacted. A gay voice, a truly, magnificently gay voice, isn\u2019t just a weakness, though. Plumage is an adaptation just as much as camouflage. We so frequently hear that straight people don\u2019t have a problem with gays; they just don\u2019t understand why we have to \u201csound like that.\u201d We have to sound \u201clike that\u201d so we can find each other. Gays are a small, diffuse, physically invisible minority. This is deeply isolating. We spend most of our lives in a world built for straight people, where only 70 to 80 percent of our actual life is executable. It takes other gay people for us to have sex, but also for other, less basic operations of identity. Sharing experiences, building relationships and fighting for equality. Silent, we are isolated. Using our voices, we become a culture and a family.At nearly anywhere in the world that isn\u2019t a gay bar, we must assume the people around us are straight. If we make a mistake about that, we could get killed. Identifying other gay people is a delicate science. Staring at dudes like they\u2019re a piece of meat is useful, but it can\u2019t do all the work. I mean the tone and timbre of the sounds that come out of our mouths, but I also mean the uncamouflaged content of those voices. Our real stories and lives. For centuries, we\u2019ve masked our stories to look like everyone else\u2019s, terrified of what people would think of us if they knew our real truth. Of course, the only thing worse than having to be embarrassed about your own voice is having to be embarrassed about someone else\u2019s version of your life. Gay people so often fear other gay voices, voices we cannot control representing our shared experiences and world, but because so much is unsaid, we also hunger for our world to be described with grandeur, with plumage.Gay men don\u2019t like art about being gay. We want it, definitely, but when we\u2019re presented with it, it is unsettling. In the foreword to \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d Oscar Wilde wrote, \u201cThe 19th-century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass. The 19th-century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.\u201d So many gay men love literal mirrors, because in a mirror (or Instagram account), you are simply an image that can be groomed to indistinguishability from straightness. Metaphorical mirrors, which reflect the fullness of our lives, will always remind us that we are different. This is why I hate my voice and the voices of other gay men. Heterosexual society wants to keep us weak, apart and uneducated, so it strips us of the tools we need to find one another and learn from one another. I was trained to be quiet, and to hope other people like me would stay quiet to keep us safe.But many gay voices ignored that teaching and became grand and loud. That\u2019s why I love my voice and the voices of other gay men. From Edwardian novels to pop music, from Broadway to comic books, they\u2019ve erupted with beauty, culture, cooperation, music, opinions about Alfre Woodard and sex. Gay art isn\u2019t just works from an underrepresented community; it\u2019s voices that were trained to hide and be silent but were resolute enough to make noise despite the danger. They didn\u2019t know me, but they did it for me. Advertisement"}

And that means grabbing their attention and getting them fired up about the coming confirmation battle. And if there\u2019s anything Mr. Trump knows how to do, it\u2019s rile up his base.Indeed, while profoundly unqualified and unsuited for the presidency in most ways, Mr. Trump does grasp the salesmanship part of the job. He is a born carnival barker, with a flair for hype and drama that would have wowed P.T. Barnum. And he understands that, for many in his base, this court pick is the main event \u2014 the primary reason they bought a ticket to his show. And the big winner of this installment of The Apprentice: Supreme Court Edition is \u2026 Brett Kavanaugh, judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and full-fledged creature of the conservative judicial establishment. Cue the standing ovation, please, and let the confirmation cage match begin.By 5 p.m. Monday, four hours before the scheduled announcement, the cable networks were breathlessly trumpeting that the president had made his decision. Twitter buzzed with talk of which finalists had been spotted where and which conservative commentators had been briefed on which candidate. By 8:00, the media had whittled the short list even shorter, to Mr. Kavanaugh and Thomas Hardiman, with Mr. Kavanaugh the emerging favorite. But even then, some commentators wondered if this was all an elaborate head fake. Priming the pump, just after 8:30, the White House tweeted out a snippet of video, grandly scored, with a camera cinematically sweeping down a red-carpeted hallway of the White House and into the East Room, where an empty podium stood ready for the president. Message: This is going to be big. Of course, while tantalizing his base was the primary goal, Mr. Trump also revels in holding his opponents hostage while he struts the stage in his victory dance. The more members of the opposition who tuned in to hate-watch Monday\u2019s announcement, the better. Say what you will about the president, he knows how to capture an audience. Advertisement"}

There is also a brief image of a demonstrator, standing in front of a building bearing a \u201cTrump\u201d logo, who is holding a sign critical of the Dakota Access Pipeline.The rest of the video, for the most part, shows the group\u2019s singers lip-syncing in a recording studio and on a rooftop.Because it included specific, recognizable protests, the video counted as engaging with \u201cissues of public importance,\u201d which led to its being flagged as political.Mr. Stevenson, 64, who noted that he once toured with Marvin Gaye, said the group had been careful to remove any explicit sloganeering from the work.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that it wasn\u2019t leaning one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThat it was just how we felt \u2014 people loving each other, regardless of race, creed or color.\u201dThe song\u2019s lyric imagines all people praising God and pictures a world in which \u201cbigotry and hate are absent, only love and peace are present.\u201dMr. Stevenson said Zion\u2019s Joy!, whose Facebook page has just over 1,000 followers, first paid $100 to boost the video in the Midwest. Facebook treated it as a political ad \u2014 and removed it from the platform \u2014 only after the group tried to pay for a second, national boost.The company asked Mr. Stevenson to verify his identify as part of the process of handling such an ad, but he said he had not decided whether or not to go through with it.\u201cThat would be like admitting that it\u2019s political content, and it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re preaching peace and love and coming together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The White House and the Strongman", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisHow the Obama administration watched the demise of Arab democracy \u2014 and paved the way for Trump\u2019s embrace of dictators. Mr. Kirkpatrick is the author of the forthcoming \u201cInto the Hands of Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East,\u201d from which this essay is adapted. That coup was a watershed moment for the region, snuffing out dreams of democracy while emboldening both autocrats and jihadists. And American policy pivoted, too, empowering those inside the administration \u201cwho say you just have to crush these guys,\u201d said Andrew Miller, who oversaw Egypt for the National Security Council under Mr. Obama, and who is now with the Project on Middle East Democracy. Some of the coup\u2019s most vocal American advocates went on to top roles in the Trump administration, including Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser.I was The New York Times Cairo bureau chief at the time of the coup, and I returned to the events years later in part to better understand Washington\u2019s role. I learned that the Obama administration\u2019s support for the Arab Spring uprisings had been hobbled from the start by internal disagreements over the same issues that now define Trump policy \u2014 about the nature of the threat from political Islam, about fidelity to autocratic allies like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and about the difficulty of achieving democratic change in Egypt and the region. Mr. Obama and his closest advisers were often on one side of those debates. They hoped to shift established American policy and forge a new relationship with the Arab world in order to undermine the appeals of anti-Western extremism. Even in the final days before the takeover, Mr. Obama was urging respect for Egypt\u2019s free elections. In an 11th--hour phone call he implored Mr. Morsi to make \u201cbold gestures\u201d to hold onto his office. Most of his government, though, took the other side, reflecting longstanding worries about the intrinsic danger of political Islam and about the obstacles to Egyptian democracy. In a White House meeting the day after Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster \u2014 two days after that last phone call \u2014 Mr. Obama yielded to those views when he accepted the military takeover. In doing so, he had taken a first step toward the policies that have become the overriding principles of the Trump administration. President Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, took office on June 30, 2012. He spent much of his energy struggling against resistance from an entrenched establishment \u2014 the soldiers, spies, police, judges and bureaucrats left in place from six decades of autocracy. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, whose rulers feared elections and dreaded them even more if they were presented as Islamic, lobbied hard to convince Washington that Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were a threat to American interests. And American officials later concluded that the United Arab Emirates were also providing covert financial support for protests against Mr. Morsi. The United States provides $1.3 billion a year in military aid to Egypt, more than to any other country besides Israel, and after the uprising in 2011 the Pentagon boasted that its aid had helped convince the Egyptian generals to accept a transition to democracy. But by the spring of 2013, conversations between Egyptian military officers and their American counterparts were becoming mutual \u201cbitch sessions\u201d about Mr. Morsi, several of the Americans involved later told me.Like others in the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis, then a Marine general in charge of Central Command, often argued that the Muslim Brotherhood was just a different shade of Al Qaeda \u2014 even though the Brotherhood had said for decades that it opposed violence and favored elections while Al Qaeda, in turn, denounced the Brothers as na\u00efve patsies for the West. \u201cThey are all swimming in the same sea,\u201d General Mattis later said in a speech looking back on the period. He blamed Mr. Morsi\u2019s own \u201cimperious leadership\u201d for his downfall. General Flynn, who has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators under an agreement with the special prosecutor, headed the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time. He visited Cairo in the months before the coup to talk to the generals about Mr. Morsi. Whether the Brotherhood or Al Qaeda, \u201cIt is all the same ideology,\u201d he told me in 2016.Civilians in government were skeptical, too. Secretary of State John Kerry had grown close to many of the most fiercely anti-Islamist Persian Gulf royals during his decades in the Senate, even sometimes yachting with them. He had always distrusted the Brotherhood, he told me years later. When he visited Cairo for the first time as secretary of state in March 2013, he took an immediate dislike to Mr. Morsi. \u201cHe is the dumbest cluck I ever met,\u201d Mr. Kerry told his chief of staff as they left the presidential palace. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work. These guys are wacko.\u201dMr. Kerry got along better in his one-on-one meeting with Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. A former military intelligence chief, General Sisi had vaulted himself into the job of defense minister in a shake-up just a few months before. \u201cI will not let my country go down the drain,\u201d General Sisi told Mr. Kerry, as he later recalled to me. He knew then that \u201cMorsi was cooked.\u201d General Sisi was prepared to intervene. Mr. Kerry felt partly relieved, he told me.\u201cIt was reassuring that Egypt would not fall into a civil war or a complete massacre of the public or an implosion,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, although he added, \u201cI did not sit back and think, \u2018Great, our problems are going to be solved.\u2019\u201d Senior American diplomats in Cairo had told me that March that a military intervention was \u201cextraordinarily unlikely.\u201d But by the next month, Ambassador Anne Patterson was picking up other signals from the top generals. In an encrypted email, she warned at least some in the White House that \u201cif not imminent, a coup was a high likelihood within a few months,\u201d one official told me. She predicted that any military intervention would surely be brutal.The White House was sending Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel talking points intended to warn General Sisi that Washington would punish a coup. Among other things, United States law mandated a cutoff of aid to any military that overturned an elected leader.Chuck Hagel, speaking to Gen. Abdel Fattah el-SisiBut the message Mr. Hagel delivered \u201cwas totally, totally different,\u201d a senior official on the National Security Council who read transcripts of the calls later told me. \u201cThe White House wanted the message to be \u2018Democracy is important,\u2019 and Hagel wanted it to be \u2018We want to have a good relationship.\u2019 We never could get him to deliver stern talking points.\u201dIsraeli leaders had said they were counting on General Sisi because they worried that \u2014 despite Mr. Morsi\u2019s repeated pledges \u2014 the Muslim Brotherhood might threaten the border or help Hamas. And General Sisi himself had told Mr. Hagel that \u201cthere are some very evil, very bad forces afoot \u2014 you cannot understand it like we can understand it here.\u201d Mr. Hagel said he had agreed with them all and sought to reassure them: The Muslim Brotherhood \u201cis dangerous \u2014 we recognize that,\u201d Mr. Hagel said he told the Emiratis. \u201cI don\u2019t live in Cairo, you do,\u201d Mr. Hagel said he had told General Sisi. \u201cYou do have to protect your security, protect your country.\u201dPresident Obama was traveling in Africa, and on July 1, he spoke for the last time with President Morsi. The Egyptian military was not \u201ctaking direction\u201d from the United States, Mr. Obama warned, according to a White House aide\u2019s detailed record of the conversation. But he mainly urged Mr. Morsi to strike a compromise with his civilian opponents so that his presidency became \u201calmost a unity government.\u201d Follow Nelson Mandela, Mr. Obama said. He had just visited Mr. Mandela\u2019s sickbed and recalled his post-apartheid government in South Africa. \u201cHe even put his former prison guard \u2014 the man who had been the warden at the prison where he had been held \u2014 and he put him in charge of the security services. It was because of those gestures that he showed he was about bringing the country together,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Morsi. \u201cBe bold,\u201d he added. \u201cHistory is waiting for you.\u201d\u201cVery good advice, from a sincere friend,\u201d Mr. Morsi answered. But it was too late. The military\u2019s presidential guard had moved Mr. Morsi into its own base, ostensibly for his safety. Two days later, on July 3, 2013, General Sisi announced Mr. Morsi\u2019s removal.Mr. Kerry told me he had argued at the White House that Mr. Morsi\u2019s removal was not, in fact, a coup. General Sisi had merely bowed to the public will in order to save Egypt, Mr. Kerry said, noting that the general had announced a plan for new elections. (Mr. Sisi was elected president the next year and again in 2018, each time with more than 95 percent of the vote.)\u201cIn Egypt, what was the alternative? It wasn\u2019t Jeffersonian democracy,\u201d Mr. Kerry told me. \u201cOver whatever number of years we have put about $80 billion into Egypt. Most of the time, this is the kind of government they had \u2014 almost all of the time. And the reality is, no matter how much I wish it was different, it ain\u2019t going to be different tomorrow.\u201d The United States needed the Saudis, Emiratis and Israelis for other priorities, Mr. Kerry said, and he did not want to \u201cget into a fight with them over something as historically clear as how Egypt works.\u201dPresident Obama decided not to make any determination about whether Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster was or was not a coup, effectively accepting it. \u201cThe people who wanted to have a different kind of relationship with the Egyptian people, including the president, were on an island in our own government,\u201d Ben Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, later told me. \u201cThere was a sense of inevitability about the military resuming control.\u201d President Trump and his advisers have hailed Mr. Sisi as a model Arab leader. \u201cA fantastic guy\u201d who \u201ctook control of Egypt, and he really took control of it,\u201d Mr. Trump said when he first met Mr. Sisi.\u201cThe only way to support Egypt\u2019s maturation as a country with civil society, with democracy,\u201d he argued, \u201cis to support President el\u2011Sisi.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Revealed: The People Behind an Anti-Breitbart Twitter Account", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust after the 2016 election, an anonymously run Twitter account emerged with a plan to choke off advertising dollars to Breitbart News, the hard-edge, nationalist website closely tied to President Trump\u2019s administration.\u201cThe way it happened sucks, but I\u2019m super proud of this thing and of all the people who worked on it and all the people who followed it,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said in his first interview since his involvement in the account was revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that we made advertisers think a little bit and realize what they\u2019re supporting.\u201dMr. Rivitz did not expect to rock the ad and media worlds with Sleeping Giants, which he viewed as an apolitical crusade against hate speech. While he is a registered Democrat, he said he had never been politically active outside of attending \u201cmaybe two marches pre-election.\u201d Most of his work for advertisers was focused on television commercials and did not involve social media. He wasn\u2019t a particularly active Twitter user.But Mr. Rivitz said he was struck by what he viewed as \u201cincredibly bigoted and racist and sexist\u201d content on Breitbart News, including in its comment sections, after his first visit to the site in November 2016. The site had gained prominence because of its ties to Stephen K. Bannon, its former chairman, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\u201cI was pretty amazed at the stuff they were printing, and my next thought, being in advertising, was, \u2018Who is knowingly supporting this stuff?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI thought maybe it would be two to three companies, and I quickly realized within a couple hours it was all placed programmatically.\u201dMr. Rivitz was referring to the automated systems that place most online ads and tend to target consumers based on who they are, rather than which site they are visiting.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like the advertisers would want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI just set up this anonymous Twitter handle and set up an anonymous email and just went for it, because I wanted to contact one advertiser \u2014 a progressive loan company from San Francisco.\u201d (The company, Social Finance, quickly pulled its ads.)Brian Glicklich, a spokesman for Breitbart, said, \u201cThe specific allegations they make about our content being racist, sexist or bigoted are false.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the idea behind Sleeping Giants was to inform advertisers, rather than to force boycotts. Breitbart News saw the account\u2019s mission differently.\u201cSleeping Giants\u2019 political playbook is to attack opposing speech through harassment and false claims to try to drive it out of business,\u201d Mr. Glicklich said. \u201cThey and others have failed at this every time it has been attempted. Democracy flourishes from more conversation, not less, which is why Matt Rivitz\u2019s speech suppression through economic force is among the most reviled techniques of coercion.\u201dMs. Jammi, who said her previous interest in politics had amounted to nothing more than following the news, discussed anonymity \u201cearly and often\u201d with Mr. Rivitz.\u201cInitially, we were kind of freaked out at the alt-right influence, and, obviously, one of our primary concerns was staying safe,\u201d she said.Since Sleeping Giants got its start, a great number of brands have taken steps to make sure that they do not appear on Breitbart. The site had about 649 advertisers on its website last month, showing around 1,902 different display ads, according to data from Moat Pro, a digital ad intelligence product. That was down from 3,300 advertisers and 11,500 display ads in November 2016. (Sleeping Giants\u2019 count of departed advertisers is closer to 4,000.)Critics have accused Sleeping Giants of engaging in a form of censorship, a criticism that Mr. Rivitz rejected.\u201cThere are plenty of conservative- and liberal-leaning news organizations that are doing everything in good faith and are talking about policy without bringing divisiveness and racism into it, and that\u2019s where the break is with some of these websites,\u201d he said.He added that he had received a barrage of threats and harassment in the wake of the Daily Caller article, which also named his wife and friends.Ms. Jammi, who was not named by The Daily Caller, said she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of harassment to expect, now that her role had been made public. She added that she hoped the attention would raise scrutiny of the big-tech platforms that kept advertisers in the dark.\u201cBreitbart is where we started, but ultimately the problem is not Breitbart or The Daily Caller \u2014 the problem is the tech companies,\u201d Ms. Jammi said. \u201cI fully support that right for them to write whatever they want. What I have a problem with is Facebook and Twitter monetizing it.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the Sleeping Giants community had grown so robust that he felt like an administrator. Still, he said, its mission remains the same.\u201cPeople can use their free speech to say whatever they want and print whatever they want, and that\u2019s what makes this country great,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean they need to get paid for it, especially by an advertiser who didn\u2019t know they were paying for it.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

The England team, having united a nation, bowed out to little Croatia, beaten by a superior side in the World Cup semifinal.The truth, however, is that this was an average English team, lifted by a superb defense, terrific team spirit, a coach of inspiring sobriety and the heroic goalkeeping of Jordan Pickford. It did not have a midfield to speak of.When Kane switched off up front, as he did for much of the match against Croatia, England\u2019s offensive threat became minimal and the old instinct to heave meaningless long balls upfield returned.You can\u2019t go to a World Cup final without a midfield. You\u2019re lucky, helped by a favorable draw, to reach a semifinal. That was the hard truth Croatia delivered.Croatia had, in Luka Modric of Real Madrid and Ivan Rakitic of Barcelona, the tormentors of England. They held the ball, they probed, they taunted, they created \u2014 and in the end they overwhelmed an English side that just ran out of ideas.Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard, talented English players but neither of them quite ready for prime time, faded. Not precisely midfielders, more gifted opportunists who lurk just behind the front line, they could not begin to marshal and direct the team, as Modric and Rakitic did. Nor could Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool central midfielder who can keep a side ticking over but not provide inspiration.It was telling that of the 12 goals England scored in the World Cup (six of them against hapless Panama), nine came from set pieces. In other words, England, despite the thrashing of Panama, scored just three goals from open play in six matches in Russia. That\u2019s paltry. There was nobody to create those goals \u2014 no Bobby Charlton, as in the glorious 1966 World Cup victory in England.The \u201cThree Lions,\u201d depicted on the crest of the England shirt, and their coach, Gareth Southgate, return home with justified pride. In Trippier, the goal-scoring wing back who has been a discovery of the tournament, and the central defenders \u2014 Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire \u2014 England now have a solid foundation for the future.That anthem has been echoing around England again. The English are long-suffering when it comes to soccer, and so patient. My nephew, Jamie Walden, commented: \u201cFootball\u2019s still coming home. Just going to take a bit longer than expected.\u201dAll that\u2019s needed now is a match-winning English midfielder of composure and vision, the difference between good average and glory. Such players \u2014 a Paul Pogba of France, a Modric \u2014 do not grow on trees. They are the providers of magic.I confess that I do find one solace in this defeat. If England had won the World Cup, the jingoism from The Daily Mail and all the \u201cBrexit\u201d cohorts would have been intolerable. We\u2019d all have had to listen to how the glory and character of England had been restored by Britain exiting the European Union.So I salute Croatia and its midfield geniuses for more reasons than one.Advertisement"}

You just need to follow a few basic rules and, most important, you have to want it.Who really knows! People quit lots of things for lots of reasons. That said, there are a couple of common, easily avoidable mistakes that make new knitters (and their teachers) stumble.Another reason new knitters give up is that projects can sometimes drag on, so try to give yourself a deadline for your first: maybe you\u2019ll want to wear the completed item on an upcoming trip or to give it to someone for their birthday.Last, accept that it\u2019s O.K. to be bad at something when you\u2019re first starting out. As adults we so rarely try things we\u2019ve never experienced before, and there\u2019s truly something liberating in sucking for a week or two before finally getting the hang of it.For those first few projects, generally you\u2019ll want yarn that\u2019s medium-weight, otherwise known as worsted \u2014 not as thin as dental floss nor as thick as rope \u2014 and make sure to read its label to figure out which size needles you should buy to go along with it (generally sizes 6 to 9). Don\u2019t worry too much about your first needles; the size is the important thing, and what they\u2019re made of (bamboo, aluminum, plastic) and how they look (straight versus circular) is more a matter of preference than anything else.It\u2019s time to figure out what kind of student you are.If you learn best in an in-person or group setting and don\u2019t mind potentially spending some time and money, contact your LYS to find out when and how they teach beginners. Sometimes the price of admission is just buying the materials there, and often it\u2019s more for longer, more intensive courses.Congratulations: You\u2019re ready to knit!Block out a chunk of time in your schedule to put some initial time into whichever learning method you prefer. It should be at least a couple of hours with minimal interruptions at first (although soon you should be able to knit and listen to a podcast or watch TV). When you\u2019re first starting out, try to do multiple sessions in a short time period \u2014 a good beginner\u2019s pace is about three times per week.Give yourself time to learn the following techniques: casting on, the knit stitch, the purl stitch, decreasing, increasing and casting off. Each of these will take some trial and error, but once you know them, you\u2019ll be able to make most beginner patterns. (And don\u2019t forget to take breaks to stretch your hands.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Marriage Class at Guant\u00e1namo", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhile imprisoned for 14 years, a young Yemeni man learns about love from a fellow detainee \u2014 and an iguana.It wasn\u2019t easy to meet anyone where I was for all of my 20s and nearly half of my 30s, at the prison camp at the Guanta\u0301namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. After I arrived, I was put in an isolation cell, where huge fans outside of each cell ran day and night, making deafening noise to prevent us from talking to each other.Even when we went outside for recreation, we were not allowed to talk to the other detainees. But outside we did meet new friends: the cats, banana rats, tiny birds and iguanas that came through the fences, asking to share our meals.I had a good friendship with beautiful young lady, an iguana. She was so elegant. She used to come every day at the same time, and we would have lunch together. When I went on a hunger strike, I had no food to give her, and I was ashamed to stand there without food as she came up to me. Sometimes the guards punished us for sharing our meals with the animals, but they couldn\u2019t stop me from talking to her.She couldn\u2019t talk back, but she was a good listener. As the years passed, our friendship grew into a strong bond. Finally, after seven years of isolation, I was moved into a communal block where I could talk with my fellow detainees. I was born in a tiny village in the mountains of Yemen and was only 19 when I came to Guanta\u0301namo. I didn\u2019t know much about the world; the world to me was my village. Now, my world was Guanta\u0301namo.Until I was 12, I thought I had been born from my mother\u2019s knee. I learned in school where babies really came from, but there was no dating in my society, so my knowledge remained theoretical. The same was true for most of us. Very few of us had been married or knew much about the relations between men and women. Even so, talking about women was our favorite topic. Not in a bad way; as Muslims we are forbidden to talk about women in a bad way. But we talked about women because it relaxed us. When someone would tell a story about a woman, we all would listen. While being surrounded by men we imagined loving women.We weren\u2019t the only ones who missed women; the male guards did, too. There were very few female guards. One of the older, married detainees saw that the single detainees were desperate to know about women, so he decided to teach us. We used to arrange classes and learn from each other anything that could be taught. For example, a former chef taught a cooking class. He would say, \u201cNow, I will add the onion to the hot oil \u2014 shhhh shhhh,\u201d imitating the sound of frying onions because of course we had no onions or oil or stoves. He would make jokes, asking the students to please taste the dishes to test if they had enough salt or if they thought the meat was ready, even though there was no salt or meat. I didn\u2019t like that class. It just made me hungrier.On our first day of marriage class, our teacher began by asking us each to say what we thought about how men should treat women. We agreed that men should have absolute respect for women, but many of the students said men always were, and always would be, superior to women. Then the teacher asked: \u201cIf you were a woman, how would you answer my question? How would you want men to treat you?\u201dAt first we started laughing, imagining each other as women.\u201cLook at Mansoor with hair all over his body,\u201d one detainee shouted at me. \u201cYou would scare all of the men.\u201d\u201cIf I were a woman,\u201d another said, \u201cI would make you all dream, cry and spend all of your money \u2014 but none of your ugly faces would touch a single hair of mine.\u201dOur teacher let us joke for a while but then said, \u201cAnswer my question, ladies!\u201d I said that if I were going to choose someone to accompany me for the rest of my life, I would want a wife who was better than me.One of the students tried to embarrass me by saying, \u201cSo will you let your wife be in charge? Should men just be like donkeys, serving women?\u201dI argued that men have been thought to be superior throughout history, but look where we are now. War follows war without end. Men never give birth to a single soul. They only take lives.I said that all of us, guilty or innocent, were sitting around Guanta\u0301namo talking about marriage instead of experiencing it because of what men had done. I finished by pointing out that we all knew that when there was a female commander in charge of our guards, we lived more peaceful lives. When the commander was a man, we were more likely to be treated badly.\u201cMansoor is biased toward women,\u201d one detainee said with a laugh.\u201cIf I were a woman,\u201d another said, \u201cI would marry you!\u201dAs we kept meeting for marriage class, our teacher taught us about loving and being loved. He described what it would feel like when we saw and talked to the woman we loved. He told us how we would act on our engagement day. And then we had an entire class dedicated to the biggest day in our lives, the marriage day. We pretended that one of the students was getting married, and we held a traditional Yemeni wedding celebration. We sang and danced as if it were a real marriage.I have never been in love, but now I could feel its sweetness. Just like the cooking class, the marriage class made me hungrier. I regretted not being married before I came to Guanta\u0301namo. I felt there was a missing part of myself, and that part was a wife and family. For a while I had in my cell a photo from a friend of his 10-year-old daughter. I made a frame out of scraps of cardboard with flowers surrounding it and hung the photo on the wall. Whenever visitors came into my cell, I would tell them she was my daughter.When they looked surprised that I had a blond daughter and started asking more questions about the mother, I would say I had never met her, but still, I had a daughter just the same. I gave her an Arabic name, Amel, which means Hope.One night the guards came in and pepper sprayed us and tore down everything in our cells. They threw away my Hope.I could have stopped going to the marriage classes. I could have stopped dreaming about love. But the only thing harder than living a life without love is living a life without pain. Pain tells us we are alive. That we can still feel. Sometimes, pain is like love. Because I could imagine love, even without my photo, I still had hope.When, after many years of not being able to speak to my family, I was allowed phone calls with them, there was talk of perhaps trying to arrange a marriage for me, and I was tempted to accept this hope. But in marriage class, we had discussed the problem of forced marriage in some countries. The idea of girls being sold like sheep hurt me. And so I declined the possibility of such an arrangement.On the last day of marriage class, our teacher told us to always remember how we had answered his first question about how men should treat women. We all had different answers now. He had made his point. He wished us happy marriages and good lives with love in them.In 2016, after being detained for more than 14 years, I was released from Guanta\u0301namo. But I wasn\u2019t allowed to go home to Yemen. Instead, I live in Serbia. I am lonely. I haven\u2019t yet found a woman to be my friend and my wife and teach me the art of love. I don\u2019t even have an iguana anymore. My hope is still alive. It helps me face the hardships of my daily life. I wish hope and love could help us with the hardships we face as nations too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Without The Daily News Will Be Less Alive, and Less Democratic", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City cannot afford to lose one of its fiercest champions.Ms. Gay is a member of the editorial board.Most days there\u2019s nothing glamorous about working for The Daily News. Covering local news, as its reporters do, can mean sitting through hours of mind-numbing City Council hearings or leaving your family in the middle of the night to race to the scene of a shooting. The other day at City Hall, home to New York\u2019s political press corps, I listened as a Daily News reporter made endless phone calls to find the immigrant children whom the federal government had separated from their parents at the border and brought to New York City.But for Daily News reporters, it\u2019s the best job in the world because for them this is the best city in the world. They are evangelists for New York. Or were.On Monday, word came that Tronc, the Chicago-based corporation that bought The News last year, had slashed its newsroom in half, laying off dozens of the best local journalists and ripping the heart and soul out of the 99-year-old tabloid, one of New York City\u2019s greatest assets and fiercest defenders. The loss for the city will be terrible. The News skewered local politicians, lobbyists and entrenched interests, from wayward mayors to Donald Trump. Unscrupulous developers and corrupt politicians can breathe a sigh of relief. Poor people, working people, racial minorities will lose a powerful, effective voice. The city will be less alive and less democratic, its politicians less accountable to the people they serve. Todd Maisel, who lost his job along with the entire photography department on Monday, was part of the News team that documented the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001. David Handschuh, another photographer, was injured that day. He was laid off several years ago in an earlier round of cuts. The News\u2019s coverage continued long after the attack, including its campaign to get benefits for sick 9/11 emergency workers. For the reporters at The Daily News, this work is a daily, nonstop grind. I know because for a brief time several years ago, I was one of them, of which I couldn\u2019t be prouder.Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday urged Tronc to reconsider, and he said the state was willing to help the company stop the job losses. \u201cThis will undoubtedly devastate many households and hurt an important New York institution,\u201d he said. Painful cuts have become the new normal across journalism, an industry that has struggled to find a sustainable business model amid vast changes in the way Americans consume news. But even in that context, the cuts at The News are too costly to bear. They should ring alarm bells for anybody who cares about the future of New York City. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Balochistan, Dying Hopes for Peace", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncreasing attacks by the Islamic State in Balochistan are connected to Pakistan\u2019s failed strategy of encouraging and using Islamist militants to crush Baloch rebels and separatists.Mr. Akbar is a journalist from Balochistan.On Friday, several hundred tribesmen and students from religious seminaries gathered at a public meeting in Mastung, a town in Pakistan\u2019s southwestern Balochistan province, to hear Siraj Raisani, a 55-year-old politician from the Balochistan Awami Party. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, citing Mr. Raisani\u2019s relationship with the military. The group has been terrorizing Pakistan\u2019s border regions such as Balochistan by attacking unarmed civilians. The suicide bombing was the first time the group targeted a prominent political asset of the military. The carnage in Balochistan can be understood by considering the long history of separatism in the province, the resentment against the federal authorities for denying its people their proper share of resources and opportunities, and the failed strategy of the Pakistani military to use repression and to encourage and use Islamist groups and militants to crush Baloch nationalist rebels and politicians.Before he started his election campaign, Mr. Raisani was mostly known for working with the military to fight the Baloch separatists. In a video posted on social media, Mr. Raisani is administering an oath of loyalty on the Quran to his band of counterinsurgents. The video was uploaded with the soundtrack of an immensely popular Taliban battle song.The most recent insurgency in Balochistan against the Pakistan government and the military \u2014 dominated by ethnic Punjabis \u2014 started in 2004. Five separatist militant groups with about 500 men have been fighting the military. The Pakistani Army has few Baloch soldiers and officers, so it relies heavily on native proxies such as Mr. Raisani for counterinsurgency operations. Mr. Raisani seemed more likely to be attacked by Baloch militants, who killed his teenage son in 2011. In a rare move, Lt. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Army chief of Pakistan, traveled to Balochistan and attended Mr. Raisani\u2019s funeral.The conflict became more complex after the Sept. 11 attacks, as the United States got embroiled in the war on terror; Arab, Central Asian and Taliban militants spilled out of Afghanistan finding sanctuary; and the Chinese started building the massive Gwadar port on Balochistan\u2019s Arabian Sea shore.Gwadar port is the flagship project in the $50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is a part of China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative. But the Chinese presence and investment have not improved the economic conditions of the Baloch people, who have come to see the Chinese as the new colonizers. Baloch militants have attacked Chinese engineers, and about 10 people have been killed.After Sept. 11, Pakistan utilized the resources Washington had provided it to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban to crush Baloch separatists. Since 2004, Pakistan has disappeared, tortured and assassinated thousands of young Baloch students, activists and rebels, as the Americans weren\u2019t concerned about Baloch aspirations and needed the military.The separatist sentiment intensified after the military killed Nawab Akbar Bugti, a prominent Baloch leader. Pakistan\u2019s security establishment responded by using Islamist militant groups such as the Taliban, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Lashkar-e-Taiba to promote radical Islam in the region to balance and isolate the Baloch separatists. But the strategy of using radical Islamist groups and militants boomeranged as the Islamist militants began attacking the Pakistani state after gaining some strength. Islamabad blames India and Afghanistan for supporting Baloch separatists while continuing to allow Taliban leaders to find sanctuary in the province and form new alliances with various jihadist groups. The new jihadis seek to undermine the Pakistani state while the generals still seem to be deluded that they can use and control these groups. Islamabad needs to dismantle these networks and deal with the legitimate demands of the residents of Balochistan for control of their resources, reduce the coercive military presence, stop the rights violations, and move toward equal citizenship for the people of Balochistan.Malik Siraj Akbar is a journalist from Balochistan based in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: A Need for More Statues of Women", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this sweet-but-sweaty Thursday.When it came down, many New Yorkers \u2014 and Times readers, in particular \u2014 argued that it ought to be replaced with a statue of an important woman, arguably a key figure in the sciences given that the Sims statue had stood for so long across the street from the New York Academy of Medicine.The issue seemed to highlight how little public art in the city is devoted to women.It embodied the problem itself rather than any solution.We need statues of real women, like S. Josephine Baker, the pioneering physician and public health official who was hugely influential in reducing infant mortality rates in low-income immigrant communities at the beginning of the 20th century.The city recently reached the same conclusion, announcing that it will erect a series of monuments to women who have been important in the city\u2019s history.Tell us by filling out the form below. We will feature some of the best ideas in a future column.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Friday\u2019s looking iffy, but the weekend, lovely.Wave goodbye to the heat wave.The Bronx-born director of films including \u201cDr. Strangelove,\u201d \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d died in 1999, but his photography is on display at thousands of city street corners as part of a project called \u201cSummer in the City.\u201dThe Museum of the City of New York has resurfaced some of Kubrick\u2019s work from its archives to highlight across the boroughs on LinkNYC kiosks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employee Uprisings Sweep Many Tech Companies. Not Twitter.", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWorkers across the technology industry are forcing their employers to reconsider how their products are being used by the United States government.But it\u2019s premature to declare those giant tech companies as suddenly woke. The government contracts in question are inconsequential to their fortunes.A better test of tech-worker activism would involve a company with a primary product that is being used to inject misinformation and authoritarian speech into mainstream conversation \u2014 and, more to the point, a company that appears to have directly benefited from the toxic flood of political vitriol in which all of us are now drowning.In other words: Will there be an employee uprising at Twitter?The social network favored by President Trump has a complicated political ethos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, and the company has reveled in its centrality to viral progressive movements \u2014 the Arab Spring, #BlackLivesMatter, #metoo and #MarchForOurLives were all animated by forces on Twitter.The tension between Twitter\u2019s liberal employee base and the service\u2019s role in news and politics has only heightened recently. For years, Twitter\u2019s business looked gloomy; with about 300 million users, it had a fraction of Facebook\u2019s billions of members, and it struggled to convince advertisers and the mainstream public of its relevance. But in the last 18 months, Twitter found a new focus in the news. The company shed ancillary businesses and tweaked its central feed to highlight virality, turning Twitter into a bruising barroom brawl featuring the most contentious political and cultural fights of the day.Perhaps. But at what cost to the world?Twitter declined to make Mr. Dorsey available for an interview. The company did put me on the phone with Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal, policy, trust and safety, who echoed the idea that there is robust debate within Twitter about its impact on the world.\u201cA lot of our employees are here because they\u2019re tied to the mission that we\u2019re serving and to our purpose in the world,\u201d Ms. Gadde said. She defined that mission as providing \u201ca healthy public conversation,\u201d but acknowledged the company has had trouble defining exactly what such a healthy conversation might look like.To critics, Twitter\u2019s call for outside help in deciding the most straightforward element of its platform feels like part of a familiar pattern at the company \u2014 slow-walking a response to problems that have long been obvious to users, and that grow more obvious by the day.After all, isn\u2019t there enough evidence already that conversations on Twitter aren\u2019t very healthy?Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was the study\u2019s lead author, suggested that there were several ways Twitter could address this disparity, including by providing users with stats on their behavior. She also said that what happened on Twitter had real-world consequences.\u201cBecause it\u2019s this insular community of journalists following other journalists, when people think of someone who they might like to hire, people whose names keep showing up in their Twitter feeds are first of mind,\u201d Dr. Usher said.You might argue that it is too much to ask Twitter to consider its effect on long-simmering social problems like gender inequality. So let\u2019s look at a more direct way that Twitter impacts discourse: Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, which are very likely to become even more important as the political season heats up before the midterms.But what if that \u201cimportant information\u201d conflicts with Twitter\u2019s mission to promote a healthy public conversation?Sooner or later, Twitter\u2019s executives and employees are going to have to make a decision about which is more important, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets or the company\u2019s desire to promote a healthy public conversation. It\u2019s hard to see how both are tenable.Advertisement"}

Businesses in the area like his, he said, had lost anywhere between 15 percent to 40 percent of revenue because of the Mud Creek landslide. Hotels and inns lost more because fewer visitors from Southern California were coming and staying overnight. Visitors from the south could still get to Big Sur through a treacherous detour inland that involved steep cliffs and hairpin turns, but many stayed away.Visitors from the north still came, he said, but they were more likely to visit just for the day.Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline, according to Susana Cruz, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. Before that, the largest landslide had been in 1983, farther north at Pfieffer Burns State Park.An earlier version of California Today misidentified the Golden Gate Bridge as the Golden State Bridge. We apologize for the error; we were typing too fast.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Located about 200 miles north of Los Angeles, near Death Valley, Cerro Gordo has one saloon with swinging doors and a mysterious bloodstain on a wall beneath three bullet holes.

It\u2019s a stressful thing to sue your former employer for age discrimination.The two women had worked in the English as a second language program at Ohio State since 1983, teaching students from 40 countries. \u201cWe helped build the program from the ground up,\u201d said Ms. Taaffe.He wrote that he was dealing with \u201can extraordinarily change-averse population of people, almost all of whom are over 50, contemplating retirement (or not) and it\u2019s like herding hippos.\u201d Then he inadvertently copied one of his own staff.The director\u2019s successor continued his policies, and staffers heard him deride veteran teachers as \u201cmillstones\u201d and \u201cdead wood.\u201dEventually, more than 20 E.S.L. staffers were squeezed out, their positions threatened with elimination or reclassification at lower salaries. When Ms. Taaffe lodged a formal complaint, a university investigation brought no action. In 2014, both women retired years before they\u2019d intended, because they expected to lose their positions and faced prohibitively expensive health insurance costs if they delayed. Neither could find a comparable position elsewhere.Recent events have brought some vindication, however. \u201cThe Ohio State University is committed to hiring and retaining a diverse and inclusive work force,\u201d the university said in a statement to The Times. The university denied that it had acted unlawfully and took no action against any employee. And it will establish a \u201csecond-look process,\u201d an independent review of age discrimination investigations.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the major victories in the case,\u201d said Dara Smith, an AARP Foundation attorney. The two plaintiffs \u201cwould not accept the settlement until we reassured them that the university would have to change its policies.\u201dThe settlement could prove important for the more than 5 million Americans who work for state governments and entities. \u201cState and local government employers are still learning that there\u2019s an age law and that it\u2019s applied to them since 1974,\u201d said Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, senior attorney adviser at the E.E.O.C. \u201cIt takes a long time to try these cases, and then there\u2019s no payoff even if you win,\u201d Ms. Smith said. The E.E.O.C. can sue for damages on behalf of complainants, though Ms. Smith said she thought it unlikely in this case.The Ohio State settlement, however, demonstrates that \u201cit can be worthwhile to bring these claims\u201d against states, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a public reminder that they need to take age discrimination as seriously as they take other forms of discrimination.\u201dIn a recent study, economists sent about 40,000 invented resumes to employers who\u2019d advertised jobs, then analyzed which applicants got callbacks. The fictitious job hunters had equally attractive credentials, but different high school graduation dates.It dropped by about 18 percent for middle-aged workers and about 35 percent for older workers. But the age factor proved much stronger for women.Many countries, including the United States, hope to persuade older people to remain in the work force longer and claim their retirement benefits later. \u201cWe do all kinds of things to help people boost their retirement security,\u201d Dr. Neumark said. \u201cIf you can work a little longer, it\u2019s huge. Your savings go a lot further.\u201dWhen older workers get dismissed or pushed out, however, they contend with longer periods of unemployment before being rehired, assuming they are rehired. Their new jobs, Ms. Ventrell-Monsees pointed out, often pay less than those they lost. They may have to retire long before they\u2019d expected.But Julie Taaffe and Kathryn Moon are back on campus, hoping their protracted effort will help other older state employees. Ms. Taaffe met with E.S.L. students last month for the first time since 2014 and was relieved to find her teaching skills intact. \u201cI\u2019m planning to stick around for a while,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Like Facebook and Twitter Are Drawing Lines. It\u2019ll Be Messy.", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now, for good reason, the absolutist ethos is over.Over the past two years, pressed by lawmakers and the media about the harm caused by misinformation, state-sponsored propaganda and harassment, tech platforms have begun to radically overhaul their attitudes about what people can say online and how they can say it.This is a huge deal, and it\u2019s well past time for the tech companies to take a firmer stand against lies and harassment. Still, as they wrestle with the question of responsibility and where to draw the line on certain kinds of content, we should all get ready for a very rough ride.Here\u2019s why: A mostly hands-off approach has been central to the tech platforms\u2019 growth, allowing them to get to globe-spanning scale without bearing the social costs of their rise. But because they are now so influential \u2014 Facebook alone has more than two billion users \u2014 and so deeply embedded in our lives, a more hands-on approach to policing content will ripple around the world, altering politics, the media business and much else in society.It could also have the opposite effect than what many critics want: better policing their own content could actually increase the power that tech platforms have to shape our lives.I spent much of the last week talking to people who are working on these issues both inside and outside these companies. I came away from these conversations encouraged about their thoughtfulness, but there are few answers to the questions they face that will satisfy many people.After talking to these companies and others, I got a sense of why their efforts to fix their issues are hard to understand. Tech platforms say they don\u2019t want to be rash \u2014 they are all seeking input from many interested parties about how to develop content policies. They are also still exceedingly concerned about free expression, and still lean toward giving people the freedom to post what they would like.Instead of banning speech, they often try to mitigate its negative effects by reaching for technical approaches, like containing the spread of certain messages by altering recommendation algorithms or imposing limits on their viral spread.\u201cThere are nuanced policies for a reason,\u201d said Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of policy. \u201cSome of this stuff is very complicated, and when we craft these policies, it is not a group of people sitting in Menlo Park, Calif., saying where we think the line ought to be.\u201dMs. Bickert said she has set up regular meetings with a range of experts to hash out how Facebook should draw the lines on a host of specific kinds of speech. In general, the company removes content that is illegal, dangerous, fraudulent or otherwise spammy and inauthentic. But for areas that are less black-and-white, like misinformation, it takes a different approach.\u201cWe reduce the distribution of information that is inaccurate, and we inform people with more context and perspective,\u201d said Tessa Lyons, a product manager who heads Facebook\u2019s effort to curb misinformation in the News Feed.To do this, Facebook has partnered with dozens of fact-checking organizations around the world. It limits the spread of news that has been deemed false by showing those posts lower in users\u2019 News Feeds, and it also displays more truthful articles as an alternative to ones that aren\u2019t accurate.Andrew McLaughlin, a former head of policy at Google who now runs an incubator that aims to build technology for progressive political movements, said he was impressed by Facebook\u2019s efforts.\u201cI think I\u2019m representative of a certain crowd of people who once took a really strong sense of pride in the sturdiness of our commitment to free speech on internet platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my views have certainly shifted in the caldron of experiences \u2014 and I am now glad that platforms like Facebook are really focusing resources and energy on malicious, manipulative propaganda.\u201d (He previously consulted for Facebook, but is not currently working for the company.)But I\u2019m less sanguine, because there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about these policies and their effects.I asked Ms. Bickert if Facebook takes potential political repercussions into account when deciding its policies. She told that me her team \u201cseeks input from experts and organizations outside Facebook so we can better understand different perspectives and the impact of our policies on global communities.\u201dThat\u2019s gratifying, but it doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the problem: Facebook is a for-profit corporation that, for both regulatory and brand-image reasons, wants to appear politically unbiased. But if it determines that some political actors \u2014 say, the alt-right in the United States, or authoritarian dictators elsewhere \u2014 are pumping out more false news than their opponents, can we count on it to take action?The same suspicions apply to other platforms: Even though President Trump arguably violates Twitter\u2019s content policies, he has been allowed to stay up. Imagine the outcry if he was blocked.This gets to the larger issue of transparency. Ms. Bickert is messianic about openness \u2014 she points out that Facebook was the first large platform to publish its entire community standard rule book.That\u2019s salutary. But if Facebook\u2019s written policies are clear, how it carries them out is less so. Little is known, for example, about the army of contract workers the company hires to review content that has been flagged \u2014 in other words, the people who actually make the decisions. (Facebook says they are extensively trained and their actions audited.) And because much of Facebook is personalized and many of its rules are enforced through slight tweaks in its ranking algorithm, the overall effect of its content policies may be very difficult for outsiders to determine.That problem also plagues other platforms. Twitter, for instance, has a content filter that governs which tweets are displayed in parts of your feed and search results. But the filter\u2019s priorities are necessarily secret, because if Twitter tells you what signals it looks for in ranking tweets, people will simply game it.\u201cPeople try to game every system there is,\u201d David Gasca, a Twitter product manager, told me.None of these problems are impossible to solve. Tech companies are spending huge sums to improve themselves, and over time they may well come up with innovative new ideas for policing content. For example, Facebook\u2019s recent decision to release its data to a group of academic researchers may allow us to one day determine, empirically, what effects its content policies are really having on the world.Still, in the end we will all be left with a paradox. Even if they\u2019re working with outsiders to create these policies, the more these companies do to moderate what happens on their sites, the more important their own policies become to the global discourse.A lot of people are worried that Mark Zuckerberg is already too powerful. The danger is that we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sikhs and Hindus Bear Brunt of Latest Afghanistan Suicide Attack", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJALALABAD, Afghanistan \u2014 A suicide bomber struck a crowd of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus arriving to meet with President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday as he visited the eastern city of Jalalabad, an attack that killed at least 19 people and wounded 10 others, officials said.The explosion occurred well outside the compound where Mr. Ghani was holding meetings. He was not harmed, and continued with his schedule as normal, officials said.The attack claimed the life of the only Sikh candidate running in elections in the country this year, a further blow to Afghanistan\u2019s once celebrated diversity, which has been badly affected by decades of violence.The suicide bombing was the second deadly attack in 24 hours in the province surrounding Jalalabad, known as Nangarhar, where the Islamic State has a foothold and has repeatedly claimed responsibility for urban suicide bombings. Late on Saturday, militants targeted a boys\u2019 school in Khogyani district, beheading three workers and setting fire to the school building.Although no group had claimed responsibility for either attack as of Sunday night, the beheadings in particular bore the hallmarks of Islamic State tactics and came just weeks after the group threatened to attack schools in the area in retaliation for military operations. Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar, said officials suspected that the Islamic State was behind the assault.Even as the Afghan government and the United States have pushed for peace talks to end the 17-year war with the Taliban, officials remain on alert that the small Islamic State affiliate could play spoiler.Most of the victims of the suicide bombing in Jalalabad on Sunday \u2014 including 17 of those killed \u2014 were from the minority Sikh and Hindu religious groups who were coming to see Mr. Ghani, according to Najibullah Kamawal, the provincial director of public health.Among the victims of Sunday\u2019s bombing was Avtar Singh Khalsa, the only Sikh candidate running in Afghanistan\u2019s parliamentary elections in October. Health officials in Nangarhar confirmed that Mr. Khalsa died in the attack.His candidacy drew widespread attention across Afghanistan and was celebrated as a sign of the minority group\u2019s resilience and dedication to the country despite the harsh times.Also among the dead was Rawail Singh, who was an active presence in civil society in Kabul. In one of the last pictures posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Singh is seen painting with his fourth-grade daughter. \u201cMy sweet daughter, learning to paint and study in the Afghan National Institute of Music,\u201d part of the caption reads.In the earlier attack on the school in Khogyani district, the assailants beheaded three caretakers at the Malikyar Hotak boys\u2019 high school and then set the offices and library on fire, said Mohammed Asif Shinwari, a spokesman for the Nangarhar education department.Malik Makee, a tribal elder in the district who also runs a pro-government militia, said he and his forces had arrived at the scene after residents asked for help. The three men who were killed were of \u201colder age, like me,\u201d he said.\u201cWe sewed their heads back on their bodies before we took them to the hospital and prepared them for funerals,\u201d he said.Last month, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan declared in a statement and in radio broadcasts that it would target schools \u2014 particularly those that teach girls \u2014 in response to the United States and Afghan military operations.Days later, three suicide bombers tried to enter the Nangarhar education department in Jalalabad, the province\u2019s capital. Ten civilians and one police officer were wounded in that attack, officials said.\u201cAfghan schools are increasingly at risk on military, ideological and political fault lines, with attacks increasing in eastern Afghanistan,\u201d the Norwegian Refugee Council, which runs a program for displaced students at Malikyar Hotak school, said in a statement.Mr. Makee, the militia commander, said the school that was attacked late Saturday was in an area that is largely controlled by the Taliban.Government control in Khogyani has largely been restricted to the district center for many years, with the Taliban controlling vast parts of the area.Last year, as Islamic State fighters were squeezed in neighboring districts, they tried to overrun the Taliban in Khogyani and establish a presence there. But they faced resistance both from the Taliban and the Afghan government.Zabihullah Ghazi reported from Jalalabad, and Mujib Mashal from Kabul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Combat China\u2019s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAt the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow?These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn\u2019t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout?Here\u2019s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you\u2019re used to, could plan a role in the future.Does this sound un-American? It shouldn\u2019t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries\u2019 advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries.But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of \u2014 and will own \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy.You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in?But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. \u201cLife science and software get a lot of money,\u201d he said.I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development.But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China\u2019s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry.One huge problem with today\u2019s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now \u2014 as we\u2019re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy \u2014 there\u2019s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise.Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today\u2019s miracles.It\u2019s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes.A federal plan to win this or that industry isn\u2019t guaranteed to work. But at least it will prompt us, as a country, to think about what\u2019s coming.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain, Time to Let Go of the \u2018Anglosphere\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe other members of this outdated idea of family couldn\u2019t care less.Mr. Kenny is a professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge. Mr. Pearce is a professor of public policy at the University of Bath and a former head of the No.10 Downing Street Policy Unit.Is there a family of English-speaking nations, united by cultural values, liberal market economies, the common law and democracy, that is waiting to welcome Britain with open arms after it frees itself from the constraints of the European Union? Some optimists think so. President Trump arrived in Britain on Thursday for a visit meant to \u201ccelebrate the strong business links between our two countries,\u201d according to Downing Street. And maybe to renew kinship and ties between Britain and the United States? Unlikely. The problem is that in British politics, the Anglosphere has always been a paradox: a politically useful idea that has never lived up to the ambitions of its advocates. The idea of a family of English-speaking nations was useful in arguments about the rise of rival powers, like the United States, in the 19th century. It was useful when politicians were imagining, and telegraphing, the future of the British Empire between the world wars. And it was useful during the soul-searching about Britain\u2019s place in the world that accompanied decolonization and Britain\u2019s entry to the European Community.Then, in the early 1990s, after the Maastricht Treaty created the European Union, those who were skeptical of Britain\u2019s participation in the whole European project reinvented the Anglosphere, somewhat, as a way to imagine Britain\u2019s future as a global, deregulated and privatized economy outside the European Union. It\u2019s this idealized version of the Anglosphere that was an important part of why Britain, in June 2016, decided to leave the European Union.Now, as the British government grapples with the fraught policy questions that leaving the union raises, the Anglosphere is a balm for those same Euroskeptics, who argue that Britain should just strike out on its own and make its own trade deals with some of the world\u2019s leading economies, including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as rising Asian powers like India.But has the idea of the Anglosphere ever actually existed outside of the imaginations of British politicians?The late-Victorian statesman Joseph Chamberlain tried to unite the settler dominions of the British Empire, like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in a tariff union, but he was defeated by fierce resistance from free-traders, the City of London and working-class voters who responded to concerns that the price of food would rise as a result.After World War II, the Conservative leader Winston Churchill famously sought to place Britain at the critical intersection of the \u201cthree majestic circles\u201d of the British Empire and Commonwealth, the English-speaking countries of North America and a \u201cUnited Europe.\u201d But at that point, British power was already on the wane. Instead, the Cold War world was dominated by the superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union. Churchill\u2019s vision did not survive the changing economic and political realities of the 1950s and \u201960s.In the 1960s, the iconoclastic Conservative Enoch Powell railed against allowing subjects of the former British Empire to immigrate to Britain \u2014 a legacy of imperial overreach that he believed was endangering the culture and heritage of England. Powell thought that the only kind of national community that could prosper was one where its members share the same racial background, culture and customs. But \u2014 though he had his supporters \u2014 his attempts to prevent Commonwealth immigrants from making Britain their home was defeated by the growing diversity of multicultural Britain and the unwillingness of the Conservative Party to adopt his agenda.Whenever anyone has tried to actually apply the idea of an Anglosphere, in its various guises, it has always collided with reality. Economic interest or politics or national security has never been enough to persuade the peoples of these different countries to enter into an Anglosphere alliance. And the current Brexit-loving advocates of a global Britain, leading the world in free trade, will meet the same fate.President Trump may agree to a new trade deal with Britain, but it\u2019s unlikely that Britain would decide the terms, a prospect that is fraught with political risks for the British government. Such a deal raises the specter of British voters eating chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef while watching the revered National Health Service being opened up to American multinationals.For Australia and New Zealand, trade links with China and Asia are much more important than those with Britain. And Canada, as a member of Nafta, has long been oriented toward the massive American market. Security and intelligence cooperation among these states and Britain in the so-called Five Eyes group is critical, as is NATO membership, but this kind of cooperation does not require a new Anglosphere bloc.In reality, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand show no inclination to join Britain in new political and economic alliances. More likely, they would rather continue to work within the existing institutions \u2014 like the European Union and the World Trade Organization \u2014 and remain indifferent to, or just perplexed by, Britain\u2019s calls for some kind of formalized Anglosphere alliance.Some pomp and ceremony on this visit might improve relations between Mrs. May and Mr. Trump, which reportedly are not very warm. But it\u2019s sensible to be skeptical that Mr. Trump will think that the Anglosphere is any kind of answer for the United States, just as it has never really been the answer in the past. Despite this, and despite its practical shortcomings, the idea of the Anglosphere will probably endure.The tragedy of the different national orientations that have emerged in British politics after empire \u2014 whether pro-European, Anglo-American, Anglospheric or some combination of these \u2014 is that none of them has yet been the compelling, coherent and popular answer to the country\u2019s most important question: How should Britain find its way in the wider, modern world?As long as that is still being asked, the Anglosphere will continue to be an answer for some of Britain\u2019s political dreamers.Michael Kenny and Nick Pearce are authors of \u201cShadows of Empire: The Anglosphere in British Politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Les Moonves, CBS Chief, Faces Inquiry Over Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Corporation and one of the most powerful people in the media business, is facing an investigation after a report published on Friday revealed allegations of sexual harassment made against him by six women.\u201cUpon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action,\u201d the statement said. The board plans to hire a law firm to conduct the review before it takes any action, the company said.CBS shares fell by more than 6 percent Friday when news of the impending New Yorker article was reported.The article, written by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, describes sexual harassment alleged by six women in the entertainment business against Mr. Moonves. It links the accusations to a broader culture of sexual harassment at CBS, with a special focus on CBS News.Four women spoke to Mr. Farrow on the record, including the film and television actress Illeana Douglas. Ms. Douglas described a meeting with Mr. Moonves in 1997 during which, she said, he was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her while holding her down. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous,\u201d she told The New Yorker.Mr. Moonves, 68, began his career as an actor before recasting himself as a Hollywood producer and, later, as a network executive. Under his watch, CBS went from last place in the ratings to the most-watched television network, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon.\u201dMr. Moonves, who became the president of CBS Entertainment in 1995 and the chief executive of the company in 2006, draws an annual pay package of $69.3 million. But his role as company head has been in jeopardy because of his part in a continuing legal battle against CBS\u2019s parent company, National Amusements.In addition to Ms. Douglas, the women who made on-the-record accusations were the writer Janet Jones and the producers Christine Peters and Dinah Kirgo. All of the women said Mr. Moonves had insisted on sexual favors and retaliated against them when they turned him down. The earliest allegations in the article date to the mid-1980s, and the most recent to 2006.In a statement that CBS had earlier shared with The New Yorker, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dCBS, in a separate statement, said it \u201cis very mindful of all workplace issues and takes each report of misconduct very seriously.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe do not believe, however, that the picture of our company created in The New Yorker represents a larger organization that does its best to treat its tens of thousands of employees with dignity and respect.\u201dAfter the CBS board noted the timing of the New Yorker article relative to the legal dispute as part of its statement, Ms. Redstone denied that she had anything to do with Mr. Farrow\u2019s work.\u201cThe malicious insinuation that Ms. Redstone is somehow behind the allegations of inappropriate personal behavior by Mr. Moonves or today\u2019s reports is false and self-serving,\u201d a statement from her representative said. \u201cMs. Redstone hopes that the investigation of these allegations is thorough, open and transparent.\u201dCBS, for years the No. 1 broadcast network, has been one of the best-performing businesses in the media industry. Its success has largely been attributed to Mr. Moonves, who has been praised for his ability to select hit shows. He moves comfortably among Wall Street investors and Hollywood producers, speaking as easily about negotiating carriage fees as he does programming for prime-time audiences.Two months ago, during the network\u2019s rollout of its fall lineup before an audience of advertisers, Mr. Moonves stood on the stage of Carnegie Hall, basking in applause. Those in the crowd were under the impression that they might have been seeing the network\u2019s leader for the last time, because of his battle against Ms. Redstone.As technology giants like Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have pushed into entertainment, media businesses have responded by bulking up through acquisitions. This year, Ms. Redstone asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded that a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenues at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, have been shrinking over the last few years.In May, CBS and Mr. Moonves lost one of the early rounds of the dispute when a judge ruled against CBS\u2019s effort to reduce Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the network. She, through her family company, controls nearly 80 percent of the company\u2019s voting rights.Issues over those rights and the leadership of CBS will be decided in the court case this year. That lawsuit had already put Mr. Moonves\u2019s storied career at stake; if he loses, he may end up leaving the company.The New Yorker piece also outlines allegations of sexual harassment by several women against a number of CBS News executives, including Jeffrey Fager, the former head of the news division and the current producer of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The story said CBS News executives were still promoted even after allegations of misconduct. The division had paid settlements to some of these women, the article said.At the time, Mr. Rose expressed \u201cembarrassment\u201d for pursuing what he believed to be \u201cshared feelings\u201d with women who had accused him.CBS News has retained law firm Proskauer Rose to conduct a separate investigation into claims of misconduct and said in a statement that \u201canyone raising a complaint is assured that he or she will be protected from retaliation.\u201dCBS News said that its investigation was continuing and that it was examining allegations made in the New Yorker article.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the women who made on-the-record accusations against Leslie Moonves in a New Yorker article. She is Dinah Kirgo, not her sister, Julie.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Team Members Are Out of Thailand Cave, With 9 to Go", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The first four rescued team members were at the hospital, military and local officials said. But it will be hours before other boys can start the trip. Divers are replacing air tanks and supplies along their route until then.\u2022 In the town where the soccer team is based, the celebration was exuberant, even as families awaited word on the rest of the team.\u2022 The rescues came as heavy monsoon rains returned to the area, after days of relative respite. Experts say the rain will not immediately make water levels rise within the cave, but it greatly increases the urgency of the operation.Four of the team members have safely made the harrowing underwater passage out of the cave and were at the hospital, the head of search operations, Narongsak Osottanakorn, said at a news conference on Sunday night.He said there would be a delay of at least 10 hours until other boys were rescued, to allow time for more air tanks and gear to be replaced along their route.Mr. Narongsak, who until a few days ago was also the provincial governor, said that 10 cave divers had accompanied the boys all through the journey. \u201cThey hugged the boys beneath them while they were wearing full-face masks,\u201d he said.The plan had been for the first team member to emerge around 9 p.m. local time, but things went more quickly: The first came out at around 5:40 p.m., he said. The fourth emerged around 7:50.\u201cToday, everything was very smooth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been practicing for the past three to four days, rain or shine.\u201dThe Facebook page for the Thai Navy SEALS announced that \u201cWild Boar No. 4 is out of the cave,\u201d in a reference to the team\u2019s mascot name, the Wild Boars.A Facebook Messenger group organized by some of the players\u2019 parents identified two of the rescued players. One, Mongkol Boonpiam, was said to among those ailing the worst. The other player was identified as Prajak Sutham.An earlier version of this article reported that the boys\u2019 coach was one of the four rescued from the cave on Sunday. The identity of those rescued, however, has not been confirmed, and we are not certain the coach is out of the cave. We will continue to update as more information becomes available.\u2014 Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono, near Tham Luang CaveIn the town of Mae Sai, where the trapped boys\u2019 soccer team is based, residents and family members were cheering the sound of every helicopter and ambulance they heard, in an uproar of celebration at the news that boys were leaving the cave on Sunday.\u201cI am so happy!\u201d said Kamon Chanthapun, an adviser to the team. \u201cI was so worried because they are just children, stuck for so long in the dark.\u201dYoung men rode in the back of flatbed trucks, cruising the streets and cheering.Mae Sai is a town that thrives on border commerce. Some residents have relatives across the border in Myanmar, and thousands cross over from that country each day to work, trade or attend school in Thailand.One of the boys in the cave, Adul Sam-on, is a student at the Ban Wiang Phan school here. Inside, students had written messages on heart-shaped sticky notes placed up in a big heart shape on a bulletin board with optimistic messages. \u201cHopefully our friend can come out safely,\u201d read one.The head coach for the soccer team, Nopparat Khanthawong, who did not enter the cave with the others two weeks ago, said: \u201cI\u2019m happy that children are coming out. All I can do is to send my prayers and support to the children and rescuers.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the physical condition of the boys. Please keep them coming!\u201d\u2014 Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono, in Mae SaiDivers pulling the 12 boys and their soccer coach from the cave were in a race against time, with the threat of rains making an already difficult rescue even more urgent.Mr. Narongsak, commander of the rescue operation, said it could take days to recover the full team. The boys and their coach are being brought out one at a time by 13 foreign cave divers and five Thai Navy SEAL divers, Mr. Narongsak said.He said the boys had been preparing for days to come out through long, flooded passageways that are challenging even for the most skilled cave divers, who must navigate openings so narrow that only one person can go through at a time. Each boy will have two divers trying to bring him out.Further complicating the operation is that some of the boys do not know how to swim, said divers participating in the rescue effort.Ambulances and helicopters are standing by to transport them to a hospital for medical treatment.\u201cEveryone knows exactly what they have to do, because any confusion in there would be really bad,\u201d Mr. Narongsak told a packed news conference.He said this was the best chance to bring out the boys safely.\u201cWe believe there are no days when we have been readier than today,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do the rescue on the day when we are readiest, we might lose the opportunity to carry out this mission.\u201dMr. Narongsak announced that the rescue had begun after officials had cleared the area outside the cave of journalists.Hundreds of journalists had been monitoring the rescue attempt from a base camp by the cave, and the number grew significantly after the boys and their coach were found safe on Monday night.\u201cAssessing the situation now, it is necessary to evacuate the area for the rescue operation,\u201d Komsan Sa-ardluan, the local police commander, told reporters over a loudspeaker. \u201cThose unrelated to the rescue operation, please evacuate the area immediately.\u201d\u2014 Richard C. Paddock and Muktita Suhartono in Mae SaiThat may surprise people from countries where swim lessons are a rite of passage for most children. But in Southeast Asia, not knowing how to swim is normal.Dr. Linnan said it was not uncommon to see rates of swimming in low- and middle-income countries that are \u201cwell below\u201d 20 percent, even among sailors, fishermen and others who earn their living on the water.Dr. Linnan, a former medical epidemiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said Thailand has made \u201cenormous strides\u201d in the last decade toward preventing child injury and morbidity. For example, he said, the government established a national day care program, a move that helped to prevent drownings among very young children.But he said he hoped recent events at Tham Luang Cave would be a \u201cteachable moment,\u201d highlighting a need on a national scale for further efforts to prevent drowning.\u201cI hope that will be the silver lining in this cloud,\u201d he said.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong KongOne boy promised to do his chores when he gets home. Another asked for barbecued pork.In letters home, written on water-stained paper and posted Saturday on the Thai Navy SEALs\u2019 Facebook page, the trapped boys and their soccer coach sought to reassure their families that they were in good hands and in good spirits.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d wrote Ekkarat \u201cBew\u201d Wongsookchan, 13. \u201cI\u2019ve been away for two weeks. I\u2019ll help mom every day. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy in here,\u201d wrote Panumat \u201cMix\u201d Saengdee, 14. \u201cThe SEAL team takes very good care of us.\u201dThe boys\u2019 parents had written to them earlier. The letters, carried by divers making six-hour trips in each direction, are the first direct communication between the parents and their sons. Attempts to establish a phone line to the cavern where the boys are trapped have not yet been successful.\u201cMom, Dad, I love you guys, and little sister Toi,\u201d wrote Pipat \u201cNick\u201d Poti, 15. \u201cIf I get out please take me to a pork barbecue place. I love you Dad, Mom.\u201dThe boys\u2019 coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, wrote to the parents as a group, promising to take care of them as best as he could. The parents had written to him earlier, assuring him that they did not blame him for the situation.\u201cThank you all for the support,\u201d the coach wrote. \u201cI deeply apologize to the parents.\u201dHe also wrote to his own family members \u2014 an aunt and his grandmother \u2014 asking them not to worry too much about him. \u201cAunty, can you please tell granny to prepare vegetable juice and pork snacks?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll eat them when I get out. Love you all.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono, at the Tham Luang CaveUnder normal conditions, the air people breathe consists of about 21 percent oxygen, 78 percent nitrogen and one percent argon and other gases, including carbon dioxide. When the mix changes, humans can feel a range of health effects, subtle and otherwise.But Mr. Novosel said an oxygen concentration of 15 percent or less in the Tham Luang Cave network would be \u201creally problematic\u201d for anyone trapped inside. It would allow them to survive, but make even basic activities difficult, he said.But strenuous activity in such a low-oxygen environment could cause severe problems, especially for anyone with a pre-existing heart or lung condition, he said.On Saturday, Mr. Narongsak, the official leading the rescue operation, said that at one point the oxygen level had been so low in a chamber where many rescuers were working that nonessential personnel were sent out of it.He also said that rescuers were concerned about the level of carbon dioxide in the cavern where the boys are trapped.People naturally release carbon dioxide when they exhale. Professor Cheung said that the carbon-dioxide concentration in air was generally no more than about 0.2 percent, and that a concentration of more than about 5 percent would cause a person to feel breathless. At about 10 percent, he said, a person would become unresponsive.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong Kong, and Richard C. Paddock at the Tham Luang CaveA retired Thai Navy SEAL diver died in Tham Luang Cave when he ran out of air while underwater, the Thai authorities said on Friday.The diver, a volunteer identified as Saman Gunan, 38, ran out of air while placing spare oxygen tanks along the route to the cavern where the boys are trapped.Mr. Saman ran into trouble at about 1 a.m. on Friday, and efforts to revive him were not successful, said Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew, the Thai Navy SEAL commander.The operation to rescue the boys is now focused on delivering air and running a communications line to the group\u2019s location from a nearby cavern known as Chamber Three. The distance from there to the group is about 1,700 meters, officials say, and one part of the effort now is to run a hose across that distance to pump air into the team\u2019s chamber.For now, the only way to communicate between officials coordinating the rescue effort and the group in the cave is by messenger, a journey of about six hours one way.Installing a communications line would facilitate any rescue operation and allow the boys to talk to their families.Four Thai Navy SEALs, including a doctor, are with the boys, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old soccer coach.\u201cWe are praying for each of you, for each of the families and for these children,\u201d said Mario Sepulveda, who was the second of more than 30 miners pulled to safety in a specially built capsule after being trapped for more than two months, in a rescue televised around the world.Mr. Sepulveda, who was nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d for his exuberant exit from the rescue capsule, became a motivational speaker after the incident.In the video released Wednesday, he said he wanted to send \u201ca lot of strength to the authorities and the families of these 12 children who are underground.\u201dHis message was echoed by others who went through the ordeal in Chile.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be scared,\u201d Omar Reygadas, another miner, told The Associated Press earlier this week. \u201cBecause we were scared, too. Our tears also ran. Even as adult men, we cried.\u201d\u2014 Palko KaraszMae Bua Chaicheun, a rice farmer who lives near Tham Luang Cave, wanted to help in the search for the missing boys. So last week, she volunteered for five days at the rescue center, delivering drinking water to soldiers and helping clean up.When she returned home to her village in the flatlands a few miles from the cave, she found that her fields were flooded with water that had been pumped from the caves in the effort to reach the 12 boys and their soccer coach.She had already prepared the soil on her five acres and was about to plant rice. Now she has to start over.But she is not concerned about that. Most importantly, the boys were found alive.When she saw the news that the boys were found, she said she put her hands together in front of the TV and thanked Buddha.\u201cI had goose bumps,\u201d she said.She is one of dozens of farmers downstream from Tham Luang Cave whose fields have been flooded by the surplus water pumped out to reduce flood levels in the cavern.The government is offering compensation to farmers whose land was flooded. In her case, that would have come to about $430, plus seed and fertilizer. But she said she didn\u2019t want to add to the government\u2019s burden in the midst of the search, and did not register.\u201cI am more than willing to have my rice fields flooded as long as the children are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys are like my children.\u201d\u2014 Richard C. Paddock, in Nong Oo Village\u201cI was very surprised,\u201d he told a reporter after the award was announced in 2012. \u201cPeople would say in jest that I should have got an M.B.E.,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something I have really thought about.\u201d\u2014 Mike IvesVideo clips taken by a Thai Navy SEAL member show the 12 boys and their soccer coach in the cave, looking skinny but seemingly healthy and in good spirits.Divers reached them on Monday night and have been taking them food, medicine and other supplies as officials and diving experts try to figure out how to extract them from the Tham Luang Cave.Dr. Phak mentions the rigor of that training and, holding the disinfectant, tells the boys: \u201cI had wounds all over my body. I couldn\u2019t take a bath. To heal the wounds, I had to apply this all over.\u201dThe diver taking the video says to a boy who appears to be one of the youngest, \u201cShow me your smile.\u201dThe boy smiles shyly and holds up two fingers.\u201cWhat do the 13 of you want to say to your fans?\u201d the doctor asks. \u201cEverybody in this world has been following your news.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono and Richard C.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Learning Your Next Language", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this iffy Tuesday.But it\u2019s not that simple.One group is no better (or worse) at learning languages than the other, said Jun Liu, a professor of linguistics at Stony Brook University. For children, the language acquisition process is just more natural \u2014 they are better at picking up intonations and pronunciations, he said.Knowing a second or third language as an adult is an advantage not only for the workplace, but also for simply living in New York City. (At least 192 languages are spoken in the New York metro area, according to 2015 census records.)We set out to find how a person over the age of 18 can become proficient in a second language. What are the challenges they face? Are certain languages easier to learn than others? How does one practice if there is no one nearby with whom to practice?We asked three educators who have taught second or foreign languages.How can an adult learn another language and retain it?All three experts told us the most important factor in picking up a language is motivation.(No shortage of that in New York.)For example, an avid sports fan might have an easier time picking up athletic vocabulary than phrases about a subject he or she rarely interacts with.Are certain languages easier to learn than others? A common assumption is that Romance languages \u2014 such as Spanish, Italian and French \u2014 are easier to learn than others. But that\u2019s not necessarily the case; people may be more familiar with Romance languages only because that learning material has been made more available, Ms. Pietanza said, but that doesn\u2019t mean these languages are \u201ceasier.\u201dIt depends on what your first language is: It\u2019s easier for an adult to learn another language that comes from the same language family as one\u2019s first language, Mr. Liu explained.How can adult learners practice a second language outside the classroom?Find ways to immerse yourself in the language, said Elizabeth Zackheim, chief executive of ABC Languages, a language-learning center in Midtown.\u201cNext time you visit a country where the language is spoken, sign up for a course at a local language school or hire a tutor to work with you daily for a couple of hours,\u201d Ms. Zackheim advised. \u201cThe most important thing is to get out there and use your language as much as possible and have fun with it.\u201dShe added: \u201cSuccess happens every day you show up for class or create a moment of connection in your foreign language. Speaking \u2018correctly\u2019 is nice, but you don\u2019t have to be perfect to make a moment happen.\u201dIf you\u2019re considering learning another language, look no further than our backyard. A few options in New York: independent schools, like ABC Language in Midtown or Bell Language in Midwood, Brooklyn; and free courses, online learning platforms or conversation groups (in English and other languages) at various branches of the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Library systems.The start of a semi-wet, semi-stormy streak.

It\u2019s fine to boil the farro in advance, and you can skip the cider it\u2019s meant to cook in and use water instead. If hungry adults are eating this as a main course, it won\u2019t serve six; think closer to three.This recipe marries two of my favorite dishes: breaded cutlets done Milanese style and the Caprese, queen of summer salads. For a more robust salad to round out the meal, double the dressing and toss arugula into the mix.An Italian classic, and an ode to summer if you use very fresh basil, new potatoes and green beans. This filling recipe feeds eight people; you could cut it in half to serve four, though as long as we\u2019re tinkering I\u2019d also increase the green beans to make it a one-pot meal.I\u2019ll rarely suggest you marinate anything on a weeknight. Unless you work from home or have a flexible schedule, it\u2019s not practical midweek, when speed is paramount. But this steak marinates for 30 minutes and then cooks in a flash, imbued with fish sauce, jalape\u00f1o and lime. (Another option: Start marinating on Sunday night and grill or broil on Monday.) The cucumbers are a cool bite of summer, but juicy tomatoes would also be delicious.Pancakes are irresistible; it is a law of nature. These zucchini-feta numbers make a great vegetarian supper with a salad or corn on the side. Time savers: Grate the zucchini in a food processor, if possible, and use the largest skillet you have to avoid endless cooking in batches. My colleague Brian shredded the zucchini and prepped the other ingredients a day ahead, so he just had to combine, stir and fry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Am Going to Die if I Keep Living the Way I Am.\u2019 She Was Right.", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTess Henry\u2019s body was found in a Las Vegas dumpster on Christmas Eve. This is the story of the six years of addiction that led her there. Ms. Macy is a journalist who covers the opioid epidemic. ROANOKE, Va. \u2014 Last year, on the day after Christmas, I picked up my phone to hear the mother on the other end of the line sobbing.For more than two years, I had followed Patricia Mehrmann and her daughter, Tess Henry, as they endured Tess\u2019s struggle to get off, and stay off, heroin. I wrote about Tess in these pages, using the pseudonym Erica to protect her privacy, back when her privacy mattered.In late 2015, Tess was 26 and enrolled in medication-assisted treatment, or M.A.T. \u2014 a program in which patients are prescribed the \u201cmaintenance drugs\u201d buprenorphine or methadone to stave off the painful symptoms of withdrawal. I drove her to the Narcotics Anonymous meetings she was required to attend as a condition of the program and walked her baby boy around the back of the room when he got fussy.Her prescription for M.A.T. ran out a few months later, and soon she was using heroin again. I kept in touch as she lost custody of her son and couch-surfed through slumlord apartments, then as she toggled between psychiatric hospitals, jail cells, shelters, emergency rooms and the streets. \u201cWhen it starts getting cold out, I\u2019m ready to come in for help,\u201d she told me in a psych-ward common room, where I was permitted to take notes only in pencil, as my pen was deemed a possible suicide tool.But soon Tess once again succumbed to her heroin cravings. On Mother\u2019s Day, she checked herself out of rehab. She had lost her ID and had no way to fly home, so she was fending for herself, middle-manning or dealing in order to use, stuck under the thumb of dealers and pimps. She was sleeping in the corners of casinos, I would later learn, and sometimes in an abandoned minivan. \u201cWhat we really need is an urgent care center for the addicted,\u201d Tess told me the first time we met. She was right. Medical overtreatment was the rule in American medicine \u2014 until the moment addiction set in, and health care scarcity became the norm.There are two approaches to treatment, and Tess was failed by both of them: on one side, kind but abstinence-oriented recovery coaches and, on the other, M.A.T.Tess\u2019s mother, Patricia, wasn\u2019t a believer in M.A.T because she thought it was widely abused. She worked as a hospital nurse and had seen patients admitted for infections after injecting themselves with buprenorphine and other opioids, as well as countless others, like Tess, who had relapsed after being on the program. She also knew just how hard it would be for Tess to qualify for M.A.T. a second time. The hurdles Tess faced are largely still in place today: not enough physicians willing to prescribe maintenance drugs, M.A.T. doctors who refuse to accept insurance and a federal limit on how many patients doctors can treat with M.A.T. Back in 2016, Tess\u2019s doctor accepted only cash, and the doctor\u2019s drug-testing and counseling protocols seemed lax to Patricia. Tess, too, had clearly figured out how to abuse the drug \u2014 Patricia found spoons and buprenorphine powder among her things, and Tess told me she doubled her dosage when stressed.As a reporter, I\u2019m not supposed to try to change the outcome of a story. But in Tess\u2019s case, it seemed wrong to remain silent. When Tess was stuck in Las Vegas and couldn\u2019t board a plane because she\u2019d lost her ID, I urged Patricia to help her get on maintenance drugs so that she could make the three-day bus journey home without getting dope sick. Once, when Patricia texted me about taking care of a 25-year-old patient on Suboxone who had contracted endocarditis, an infection of one of his heart valves, from injecting it and other drugs, I gently replied that while Suboxone was sometimes abused, at least there wasn\u2019t any fentanyl in it, \u201cso it\u2019s somewhat safer than street heroin.\u201dPatricia saw only the problem Suboxone users, in other words. She didn\u2019t see the people I knew who were now stabilized on M.A.T. and getting their kids and jobs back. She didn\u2019t see them because, understandably, these former addicts feel the stigma of being on M.A.T. and remain a quiet bunch.Tess herself believed that abstinence-based rehabs were her best shot at success. She believed this despite the fact that of all her friends who used, she knew only two who had achieved a lasting recovery by following the 12 steps \u2014 and only because they were brothers whose parents shelled out more than $300,000 for multiple long-term rehab and aftercare stints. \u201cI just got on Subs,\u201d Tess texted her mom on Dec. 23, referring to the Suboxone she needed to prevent her from throwing up and having diarrhea on the plane.\u201cI\u2019m so glad you reached out \u2014 so many people pulling for you,\u201d I told Tess, in our last Facebook Messenger exchange.\u201cCan\u2019t wait to be home really,\u201d Tess wrote back. Tess\u2019s quest for treatment had lasted six years, during which time she was repeatedly left to fend for herself by the police, the medical community, the state legislators who refused to expand lifesaving access to Medicaid, weary family members and treatment advocates urging abstinence and tough love and, once, when she begged me to pick her up from a drug house \u2014 and I declined \u2014 by me.It takes the typical opioid-addicted user eight years \u2014 and four to five treatment attempts \u2014 to achieve remission for a single year, according to John Kelly, a researcher and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Tess didn\u2019t have eight years. Her murder remains unsolved. The day of her funeral in January, Dan Polster, a federal judge in Cleveland, was presiding over a hearing in the continuing mass litigation case against opioid makers, distributors and retailers. \u201cAbout 150 Americans are going to die today, just today, while we\u2019re meeting,\u201d Judge Polster said. Last month, a lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs in that case called me to discuss a potential settlement. She wanted my ideas about how to treat the more than two million opioid-addicted Americans.

And the hard-liners will not relent.Yet an injection of common sense is welcome in a political fray that has defied all warnings, many of them from industries, of the enormous damage that would come from a break with the European Union, and especially of an abrupt and uncontrolled break.

{"Headline": "In Mozambique, a Living Laboratory for Nature\u2019s Renewal", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bybasicsAt Gorongosa National Park, scarred by civil war, scientists are answering fundamental questions about ecology and evolution, and how wildlife recovers from devastation.GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, MOZAMBIQUE \u2014 The 14 African wild dogs were ravenous, dashing back and forth along the fence of their open-air enclosure, or boma, bouncing madly on their pogo-stick legs, tweet-yipping their distinctive wild-dog calls, and wagging their bushy, white-tipped tails like contestants on a game show desperate to be seen. Since arriving at the park three months earlier, as they acclimated to their new setting and forged the sort of immiscible bonds that make Lycaon pictus one of the most social mammals in the world, the dogs had grown accustomed to a daily delivery of a freshly killed antelope to feast on. But it had been nearly 48 hours since the pack\u2019s last meal and, hello, anybody out there? Ah, here comes the food truck now. Paola Bouley, the park\u2019s associate director of carnivore conservation, and two of her colleagues rode up to the fence in a pickup, opened the gate, edged the vehicle just inside the boma and began lowering the carcass of a male impala. As she stood in the back of the truck, Ms. Bouley gripped a rope tied to the antelope\u2019s rear legs, with the intention of luring the dogs from the comfort of their enclosure by slowly dragging their breakfast outside. Nice idea, but the dogs couldn\u2019t wait. They snatched at the carcass, tried disemboweling it in midair, yanking at the rope so violently they practically pulled the extremely fit Ms. Bouley to the ground. Stop, stop! she cried. New plan: Let\u2019s tie the rope to the pickup instead. Again, lure and vehicle inched out through the gate, and this time the dogs followed, their coats the color of army camouflage, their ears the size of soap dishes. One, two, three, four, a baker\u2019s dozen. The dogs bounded to freedom and fell on the impala en masse, just as the scientists hoped they would do. Except something was wrong. The dogs stopped eating. They ran around in confusion. One dog was missing, and not just any cur: It was the top dog, the alpha female of the pack. Where was their queen? The scientists scrambled, too.\u201cIt\u2019s Beira \u2014 she\u2019s still inside!\u201d Ms. Bouley called out, referring to the name chosen for the alpha female by local schoolchildren in honor of the capital city of their province. Loping over to the assembled observers, Ms. Bouley said, \u201cShe\u2019s not coming out. She\u2019s cautious. She\u2019s always been cautious.\u201d Now more than ever: Beira was pregnant with pups that the entire pack would help raise. There was too much commotion. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask you to leave,\u201d Ms. Bouley said. It\u2019s tough trying to resuscitate one of Africa\u2019s most storied and biologically diverse national parks from a state of near-annihilation, the result of a brutal 16-year civil war in which an estimated one million Mozambicans were killed and a huge swath of Gorongosa\u2019s wildlife destroyed. Tough, but by no means impossible. Thirty minutes after dispersing her guests, Ms. Bouley sent a joyful update: All pack members had left the pen, and the gate had been closed to prevent their re-entry. The dogs had polished off their last free brunch and were exploring the neighborhood, clearly eager to resume their career as team hunters par excellence. \u201cThis is a very special time for me,\u201d said Pedro Muagura, Gorongosa\u2019s park warden. In Mozambique, he said, many families have a totem animal, and his family\u2019s is the wild dog. Yet until the gang of 14 had been relocated from several sites in eastern South Africa as part of Gorongosa\u2019s restoration plan, the only time Mr. Muagura had encountered a wild dog was as roadkill. \u201cTo see live dogs in my own country, to have them released into Gorongosa,\u201d he said, almost tearfully, \u201cthat is a beautiful thing.\u201dOver the next several days, the ebullient carnivores managed to dispatch another impala and two waterbucks \u2014 beefy, handsome antelopes with bright bull\u2019s-eye markings on their rears. They are all too common in Gorongosa. Beira\u2019s pregnant belly bulged ever more visibly, and the pack was digging her a den. Lions were no longer the only resident meat-eaters able to keep the burgeoning herds of grazing mammals in check. Another apex predator, absent for decades from the park\u2019s 1,500 square miles, was back \u2014 yet more evidence that Gorongosa is on track for a great second act. Named after a mountain on the rim of the park that in turn was named after the Mwani term for \u201cplace of danger,\u201d Gorongosa is far from the largest national park or game reserve in Africa. Kruger National Park in South Africa is five times its size. Gorongosa is not even the biggest park in Mozambique. Yet Gorongosa stands out from the continent\u2019s many photogenic safari destinations as a kind of living laboratory, an ongoing experiment in how nature recovers from the equivalent of a massive hemorrhaging event, and which parts mend best when left to themselves and which require infusions of new blood. Gorongosa has attracted the attention of scientists from around the world who see an opportunity to address, in real time, fundamental questions of ecology, evolution, the rise and fall and shifting distribution of species, and changes in what researchers call the landscape of fear. The bushbuck of Gorongosa, for example, are unusually brazen about venturing away from the concealing foliage that surrounds termite mounds, where the shy, slender antelope traditionally are found. Instead, Gorongosa\u2019s bushbuck are grazing in open grassland, with all the cockiness of African buffalos or zebras. Is that good, neutral or destructive to the local habitat \u2014 to the mix of vegetation and its microfaunal throngs, the flow of water, the cycling of nutrients, the ease with which dung beetles can put the far-flung bounty to use? And how long before the insouciant bushbuck realize that Gorongosa\u2019s predators are multiplying and headed their way?Gorongosa is at once more and less \u201cnatural\u201d than other game reserves in Africa. \u201cThere are no fences around Gorongosa, and that\u2019s the way a park is supposed to be,\u201d said Test Malunga, a field guide at the park. At the same time, the park management, with the blessing of the Mozambique government, has decided to \u201cactively encourage and promote science,\u201d said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University who is on the Gorongosa Project\u2019s board of directors. As a result, researchers are not confined to simple observational studies of the park\u2019s free-ranging wildlife. They can manipulate field conditions to narrow down the spurs to animal movement and foraging choices. They can dart animals to take blood samples, measure their vital signs and then outfit them with GPS collars \u2014 and for the elephants, that means necklaces big enough to girdle an oak tree. \u201cMany parks limit or even prohibit such activities,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cBut without them you can\u2019t have a truly science-based management strategy or definitively answer burning questions at the forefront of ecological knowledge.\u201d Gorongosa also is preternaturally lucky to have a wealthy benefactor dedicated to the park\u2019s restoration and future. Since 2004, Gregory C. Carr, who made a fortune in telecommunications before turning to full-time philanthropy and human rights advocacy, has spent tens of millions of dollars on the park and the 1,300 square miles of so-called buffer zone that surrounds it, where some of the poorest communities in Mozambique, and hence in the world, can be found. Mr. Carr, 59, is genial, driven and unerringly gregarious, a kind of L. pictus in a baseball cap, always looking for new connections, new ideas for helping the park and its people, new ways to win over skeptics and bridge political divides. Despite recurring guerrilla skirmishes in the region, Mr. Carr said, \u201cI think the park has done a pretty good job of being everyone\u2019s friend.\u201d His foundation and various donors-in-arms have invested in local schools, mobile clinics, bee farms, sustainable coffee plantations, girls\u2019 clubs, and a master\u2019s program in conservation biology for Mozambican students. The classroom is Gorongosa. \u201cIt\u2019s the only conservation biology program in the country,\u201d Mr. Carr said. \u201cWe\u2019re told it may be the only one in the world taught entirely in a national park.\u201d Yet thorny sociocultural challenges remain. Mr. Carr is a white American with a lot of money, and though Gorongosa is a national park that belongs entirely to Mozambique, Larissa Sousa, who works in the department of human development at the park, said that many people in the region believe Mr. Carr is the owner of Gorongosa, and they\u2019ve never been inside.In fact, Gorongosa park was founded by colonial Portugal in 1960 largely for the pleasure of affluent Western adventurists, but it was quickly claimed as a national treasure when Mozambique won independence in 1975. Behind the park\u2019s splendor, explained Piotr Naskrecki, an associate director of research at Gorongosa, is its location at the southernmost tip of Africa\u2019s Great Rift Valley, a massive geological formation that, over millions of years, has channeled huge amounts of biodiversity into Mozambique\u2019s midriff. To the east of the rift is soft limestone, kneaded and puckered by water into caves and gorges and giving rise to riverine forests, replete with endemic bats, crickets, mollusks and millipedes that thrive on the limestone\u2019s calcium bounty. On the western rim is hard granite and granitic soils that nurture an entirely different assemblage of life-forms, like a newly discovered species of lizard that wedges itself deep into rock cracks, beyond a predator\u2019s reach. In the middle are the floodplains, cycling seasonally between deluge and drainage, and turning tuxedo-black with concentrated nutrients on which vegetation can bloom and herds of herbivores can fatten. Spanning elevations from sea level to 6,000 feet at the top of Mt. Gorongosa, the park is a great mixtape of \u201cnearly every conceivable habitat,\u201d Dr. Naskrecki said: alpine forest, montane meadow, woodland savanna, grassland, scrub forest, a touch of true rain forest. And as you drive through it, bumping over roads so deeply rutted you feel like a human castanet, you realize you\u2019ve never been so happy in your life. In the 1980s, the music stopped. A civil war broke out, the park was shuttered, and government and rebel forces turned Gorongosa into a battlefield and makeshift abattoir. Elephants were slaughtered for their tusks. Elands, sables, wildebeests, zebras and other large herbivores were hunted for meat or sport. Lions, leopards and hyenas were killed for being in the way, and many animals simply died of starvation. By the time the fighting and rampant hunting ended in the mid-1990s, the park\u2019s thundering census of large mammals had been slashed by 95 percent, to numerical whimpers: 15 African buffalos here, six lions there, five zebras, a few dozen hippos and elephants. Park infrastructure had been destroyed. Only Gorongosa\u2019s bird life, some 500 species strong, survived relatively intact.The park\u2019s wildlife began recovering, but slowly, and on visiting the park in 2003, Mr. Carr said, \u201cI could drive around all day and not see a single animal.\u201d After consulting with a broad range of experts, Mr. Carr proposed to the Mozambican government a public-private partnership that he hoped would both hasten the recovery of Gorongosa\u2019s grandeur and lift the economy, too. \u201cBeing an economic engine and a promoter of human rights, that\u2019s a new way to think about national parks,\u201d said Mr. Carr. \u201cThe people who live around here, this is their homeland, and they have a right to live in a decent environment that can sustain them.\u201d The team started by restocking the larger herbivores, importing 200 buffalos and 200 wildebeests from South Africa. As the bulk grazers began trimming back the overgrown grassland, the park\u2019s array of smaller antelope species, with their twisty, calligraphic horns and their Modigliani faces, could get through to feed and more reliably breed. The expanding prey options soon lofted the lion count, which in turn began luring back tourists for whom a lion sighting is synonymous with a safari vacation. But the lions alone could not handle the swelling ranks of herbivores and omnivores, and Gorongosa\u2019s scientists realized the park needed a more diverse guild of predators. Where were the leopards? Leopards are the most widespread great cats in the world, yet for mysterious reasons they hadn\u2019t found their way back to Gorongosa. As a result, Gorongosa\u2019s baboons, a favorite leopard menu item, are breeding like gray squirrels, devouring everything they can get their unfastidious fingers on and moving fearlessly through the landscape. \u201cYou don\u2019t elsewhere in Africa see baboons walking on the ground at night or sleeping on the ground,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cBut here you do.\u201d The researchers\u2019 efforts to import leopards from elsewhere in Africa have proved legislatively challenging, and so they were thrilled when an adult male leopard, a voluntary immigrant from the buffer zone, showed up in late March and as of midsummer appeared to still be around.The scientists admitted they have made mistakes. \u201cWe tried to introduce the cheetah,\u201d Dr. Naskrecki said, \u201cbut we learned this is not the right environment for them, and historically they have not been here.\u201d African wild dogs, by contrast, have a history in Gorongosa and are under fewer trade restrictions, and Ms. Bouley said they will be bringing in another pack next year. Other puzzling aspects of Gorongosa\u2019s recrudescence remain. On most African reserves, for example, waterbucks are uncommon, bit players compared to other antelope species. In Gorongosa, their numbers have exploded to 50,000. A possible explanation: as one of the few species able to persist on the floodplain year-round, through low water and high, waterbucks may have stayed out of target range during the war and been well positioned to rebound when the shooting stopped. The waterbuck\u2019s triumph, however, may incidentally be slowing the recovery of another water-loving mammal: the hippopotamus. Zebras also have had a surprisingly hard time regaining their footing. Elephants have nearly rebounded to their prewar numbers, the population notably enriched in individuals that naturally lack tusks and thus were spared the selective wrath of ivory poachers. \u201cGorongosa is not a Ming vase that we\u2019re trying to restore,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic ecosystem in recovery\u201d \u2014 working like a dog and getting better all the time.Advertisement"}

It Depends on Where You Live.", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new analysis finds the price of certain drugs varies widely depending on what city they are sold in.What you pay at the pharmacy for generic drugs can vary widely based on where you live, according to a new analysis by the consumer website GoodRx.GoodRx looked at the average cash price of the drug at a pharmacy \u2014 something not every consumer will have to pay. Most people have insurance coverage for their prescriptions, and consumers can often take advantage of discount programs. But a growing number of people are being asked to pay for a greater share, sometimes with a deductible.Some disparities obviously result from a higher cost of living \u2014 New York and San Francisco were the most expensive cities in the country for drugs. But prices can vary widely even between similar cities in the same state: Cleveland\u2019s pharmacy prices were 2.5 percent above the national average, while not far away, Columbus had prices that were nearly 22 percent below average. In Cleveland, the generic version of Paxil, the antidepressant, costs about $46.94, while in Columbus, someone would pay $20.87.Thomas Goetz, the chief of research at GoodRx, said many factors are likely playing a role, like the prevalence in some areas of big-box stores like WalMart and Costco, which sell generic drugs at cheap prices. But that can\u2019t entirely explain what\u2019s going on. Much can still be chalked up to the \u201cdrug prices make no sense\u201d theory, he said. Generic drug manufacturers often charge different prices for versions of the same drug, and pharmacies can then mark up the drug in a variety of ways.\u201cIt\u2019s one more indication of how nonsensical drug prices can be, and how important it is to be vigilant about what you are being asked to pay,\u201d he said.If consumers do shop around, she advised keeping in touch with a single doctor or pharmacist who knows all of the drugs that are prescribed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have an adverse reaction or interaction because there is no one keeping an eye on the big picture,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "8 Saved, 5 to Go in Thai Cave Rescue", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there were five.A week after rescue divers emerged in a dark and flooded cave to discover that \u2014 against all odds \u2014 a missing team of Thai soccer players had somehow managed to survive 10 days of isolation, their rescue continued with astonishing rapidity.On Monday, a day after the first four people were guided to freedom along a torturous underwater course, four more team members were rescued.Here are the latest developments.\u2022 Eight people are now out of the cave complex. The latest four extracted were taken to the hospital.\u2022 The leader of the rescue operation said he was optimistic the remaining five team members could be brought out of the cave on Tuesday.\u2022 New air tanks are being positioned along the escape route and guide ropes are being tightened.Rescuers pulled four more team members from a flooded cave complex in Thailand on Monday, in a daring rescue that continued to defy the odds, bringing to eight the number rescued so far.Five members of the group \u2014 which initially included 12 players and their coach \u2014 remained in the cavern where they took refuge from rising water. Narongsak Osottanakorn, the head of the search operation, said he hoped that they could all be brought out on Tuesday.The four survivors rescued on Monday have all been hospitalized in Chiang Rai, the nearest large city, Mr. Narongsak said.\u201cAll of them are safe and conscious,\u201d he said.Those rescues bring the total to eight, after two days of pulling team members from the cave. Twelve players of the Wild Boars soccer team and their coach were trapped in the flooded cave complex on June 23.\u201c2 days, 8 Boars,\u201d said a message on the Thai Navy SEALS Facebook page.Officials have declined to identify any of the people who have been rescued or those who remain in the cave.One good sign for the next stage of the operation is that the pace of the rescue was considerably quicker on the second day. On Sunday, it took 11 hours to bring out four people. But on Monday, it took only nine hours to bring out the next four, he said.He said that was in part because the divers had become more skilled in maneuvering through the cave\u2019s flooded passageways while holding the boys below them. It also helped that more than 100 people participated in the operation, more than on the first day, he said.Mr. Narongsak said he was optimistic about the chances of bringing out all of the remaining five on Tuesday.\u201cWe think we will do it better and the success will be 100 percent,\u201d he said.Officials said that a new weir, or low dam, built outside the cave was helping to keep water levels relatively stable within. The weather was cooperating, too: After a day of torrential downpours on Sunday, things cleared up on Monday.At the hospital in Chiang Rai Province, relatives of the rescued boys were not able to visit them in their rooms because of concerns about infection, Mr. Narongsak said.Mongkol Boonpiam, one of the boys who was listed among the rescued on a Facebook messenger group used by some of the parents, was considered to have been the weakest of those trapped.\u201cWe will be waiting for more good news,\u201d said Rattana Maksuk, an administrator and teacher at the Mae Sai Prasitsart School, which is attended by six of the boys who were trapped in the cave complex.\u2014 Hannah Beech, Muktita Suhartono and Richard C. Paddock, near Tham Luang CaveIn the town of Mae Sai, where the trapped boys\u2019 soccer team is based, residents and family members were cheering the sound of every helicopter and ambulance they heard, in an uproar of celebration at the news that four boys had been taken out of the cave on Sunday.\u201cI am so happy!\u201d said Kamon Chanthapun, an adviser to the team. \u201cI was so worried because they are just children, stuck for so long in the dark.\u201dYoung men rode in the back of flatbed trucks, cruising the streets and cheering.Mae Sai is a town that thrives on border commerce. Some residents have relatives across the border in Myanmar, and thousands cross over from that country each day to work, trade or attend school in Thailand.One of the boys in the cave, Adul Sam-on, is a student at the Ban Wiang Phan school here. Inside, students had written messages on heart-shaped sticky notes placed up in a big heart shape on a bulletin board with optimistic messages. \u201cHopefully our friend can come out safely,\u201d read one.The head coach for the soccer team, Nopparat Khanthawong, who did not enter the cave with the others two weeks ago, said: \u201cI\u2019m happy that children are coming out. All I can do is to send my prayers and support to the children and rescuers.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the physical condition of the boys. Please keep them coming!\u201d\u2014 Hannah Beech and Muktita Suhartono, in Mae SaiThat may surprise people from countries where swim lessons are a rite of passage for most children. But in Southeast Asia, not knowing how to swim is normal.Dr. Linnan said it was not uncommon to see rates of swimming in low- and middle-income countries that are \u201cwell below\u201d 20 percent, even among sailors, fishermen and others who earn their living on the water.Dr. Linnan, a former medical epidemiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said Thailand has made \u201cenormous strides\u201d in the last decade toward preventing child injury and morbidity. For example, he said, the government established a national day care program, a move that helped to prevent drownings among very young children.But he said he hoped recent events at Tham Luang Cave would be a \u201cteachable moment,\u201d highlighting a need on a national scale for further efforts to prevent drowning.\u201cI hope that will be the silver lining in this cloud,\u201d he said.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong KongOne boy promised to do his chores when he gets home. Another asked for barbecued pork.In letters home, written on water-stained paper and posted Saturday on the Thai Navy SEALs\u2019 Facebook page, the trapped boys and their soccer coach sought to reassure their families that they were in good hands and in good spirits.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d wrote Ekkarat \u201cBew\u201d Wongsookchan, 13. \u201cI\u2019ve been away for two weeks. I\u2019ll help mom every day. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy in here,\u201d wrote Panumat \u201cMix\u201d Saengdee, 14. \u201cThe SEAL team takes very good care of us.\u201dThe boys\u2019 parents had written to them earlier. The letters, carried by divers making six-hour trips in each direction, are the first direct communication between the parents and their sons. Attempts to establish a phone line to the cavern where the boys are trapped have not yet been successful.\u201cMom, Dad, I love you guys, and little sister Toi,\u201d wrote Pipat \u201cNick\u201d Poti, 15. \u201cIf I get out please take me to a pork barbecue place. I love you Dad, Mom.\u201dThe boys\u2019 coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, wrote to the parents as a group, promising to take care of them as best as he could. The parents had written to him earlier, assuring him that they did not blame him for the situation.\u201cThank you all for the support,\u201d the coach wrote. \u201cI deeply apologize to the parents.\u201dHe also wrote to his own family members \u2014 an aunt and his grandmother \u2014 asking them not to worry too much about him. \u201cAunty, can you please tell granny to prepare vegetable juice and pork snacks?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll eat them when I get out. Love you all.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono, at the Tham Luang CaveOn Friday, a Thai Navy SEAL commander said the oxygen level in the boys\u2019 cavern was about 15 percent and falling. That is a concern because levels below 16 percent can cause oxygen depletion, a condition known as hypoxia.Under normal conditions, the air people breathe consists of about 21 percent oxygen, 78 percent nitrogen and one percent argon and other gases, including carbon dioxide. When the mix changes, humans can feel a range of health effects, subtle and otherwise.But Mr. Novosel said an oxygen concentration of 15 percent or less in the Tham Luang Cave network would be \u201creally problematic\u201d for anyone trapped inside. It would allow them to survive, but make even basic activities difficult, he said.But strenuous activity in such a low-oxygen environment could cause severe problems, especially for anyone with a pre-existing heart or lung condition, he said.On Saturday, Mr. Narongsak, the official leading the rescue operation, said that at one point the oxygen level had been so low in a chamber where many rescuers were working that nonessential personnel were sent out of it.He also said that rescuers were concerned about the level of carbon dioxide in the cavern where the boys are trapped.People naturally release carbon dioxide when they exhale. Professor Cheung said that the carbon-dioxide concentration in air was generally no more than about 0.2 percent, and that a concentration of more than about 5 percent would cause a person to feel breathless. At about 10 percent, he said, a person would become unresponsive.\u2014 Mike Ives in Hong Kong, and Richard C. Paddock at the Tham Luang CaveA retired Thai Navy SEAL diver died in Tham Luang Cave when he ran out of air while underwater, the Thai authorities said on Friday.The diver, a volunteer identified as Saman Gunan, 38, ran out of air while placing spare air tanks along the route to the cavern where the boys are trapped.Mr. Saman ran into trouble at about 1 a.m. on Friday, and efforts to revive him were not successful, said Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew, the Thai Navy SEAL commander.The operation to rescue the boys is now focused on delivering air and running a communications line to the group\u2019s location from a nearby cavern known as Chamber Three. The distance from there to the group is about 1,700 meters, officials say, and one part of the effort now is to run a hose across that distance to pump air into the team\u2019s chamber.For now, the only way to communicate between officials coordinating the rescue effort and the group in the cave is by messenger, a journey of about six hours one way.Installing a communications line would facilitate any rescue operation and allow the boys to talk to their families.Four Thai Navy SEALs, including a doctor, are with the boys, ages 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old soccer coach.\u201cWe are praying for each of you, for each of the families and for these children,\u201d said Mario Sepulveda, who was the second of more than 30 miners pulled to safety in a specially built capsule after being trapped for more than two months, in a rescue televised around the world.Mr. Sepulveda, who was nicknamed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d for his exuberant exit from the rescue capsule, became a motivational speaker after the incident.In the video released Wednesday, he said he wanted to send \u201ca lot of strength to the authorities and the families of these 12 children who are underground.\u201dHis message was echoed by others who went through the ordeal in Chile.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be ashamed to be scared,\u201d Omar Reygadas, another miner, told The Associated Press earlier this week. \u201cBecause we were scared, too. Our tears also ran. Even as adult men, we cried.\u201d\u2014 Palko KaraszMae Bua Chaicheun, a rice farmer who lives near Tham Luang Cave, wanted to help in the search for the missing boys. So last week, she volunteered for five days at the rescue center, delivering drinking water to soldiers and helping clean up.When she returned home to her village in the flatlands a few miles from the cave, she found that her fields were flooded with water that had been pumped from the caves in the effort to reach the 12 boys and their soccer coach.She had already prepared the soil on her five acres and was about to plant rice. Now she has to start over.But she is not concerned about that. Most importantly, the boys were found alive.When she saw the news that the boys were found, she said she put her hands together in front of the TV and thanked Buddha.\u201cI had goose bumps,\u201d she said.She is one of dozens of farmers downstream from Tham Luang Cave whose fields have been flooded by the surplus water pumped out to reduce flood levels in the cavern.The government is offering compensation to farmers whose land was flooded. In her case, that would have come to about $430, plus seed and fertilizer. But she said she didn\u2019t want to add to the government\u2019s burden in the midst of the search, and did not register.\u201cI am more than willing to have my rice fields flooded as long as the children are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys are like my children.\u201d\u2014 Richard C. Paddock, in Nong Oo Village\u201cI was very surprised,\u201d he told a reporter after the award was announced in 2012. \u201cPeople would say in jest that I should have got an M.B.E.,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something I have really thought about.\u201d\u2014 Mike IvesVideo clips taken by a Thai Navy SEAL member show the 12 boys and their soccer coach in the cave, looking skinny but seemingly healthy and in good spirits.Divers reached them on Monday night and have been taking them food, medicine and other supplies as officials and diving experts try to figure out how to extract them from the Tham Luang Cave.Dr. Phak mentions the rigor of that training and, holding the disinfectant, tells the boys: \u201cI had wounds all over my body. I couldn\u2019t take a bath. To heal the wounds, I had to apply this all over.\u201dThe diver taking the video says to a boy who appears to be one of the youngest, \u201cShow me your smile.\u201dThe boy smiles shyly and holds up two fingers.\u201cWhat do the 13 of you want to say to your fans?\u201d the doctor asks. \u201cEverybody in this world has been following your news.\u201d\u2014 Muktita Suhartono and Richard C.

{"Headline": "Military Spending Is Up, but Aerospace and Defense Workers Are Scarce", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sunny Sunday in March, 29 new United States Air Force recruits took an oath to support and defend the Constitution.This was not just any swearing-in because the man turning civilians into airmen was an Air Force Thunderbird pilot. When Maj. Eric Gorney finished the ceremony on the tarmac at Florida\u2019s Orlando Melbourne International Airport, he climbed into an F-16 and along with five other Thunderbird pilots proceeded to dazzle the tens of thousands of spectators who minutes earlier had applauded the Air Force\u2019s newest members.At a time when all four branches of American\u2019s armed forces are actively recruiting to meet new personnel goals, high-profile performance teams like the Thunderbirds and the Navy\u2019s Blue Angels are powerful tools. Similar recruitment efforts are deployed around the world by the Snowbirds in Canada, the Red Arrows in Britain, and other teams as far-flung as Finland and Jordan. Maj. Ray Geoffroy, a spokesman for the Thunderbirds, said the team\u2019s goal was to \u201crecruit, retain and inspire\u201d the next generation.\u201cThe U.S. defense budget is the big dog in global military spending,\u201d John H. Schmidt, global managing director for aerospace and defense at the consulting firm Accenture, said of the $700 billion spending plan. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased investments in existing programs around the world,\u201d he said.Searching for people to do the work funded by these budgets puts the defense and aerospace industries in competition with companies like Google, Alibaba and Facebook, names that are more familiar and more firmly rooted in the minds of the digital generation.In this environment, companies are trying to be more creative to get the attention of younger workers. \u201cWhile competition for skills is fierce, we continue to attract and recruit incredible talent globally,\u201d the Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said in a statement.\u201cIn the past, if you wanted to do cool high-tech stuff, there wasn\u2019t anything else\u201d but the military, Mr. Schmidt said. Now, he added, the military has to address the impression among many young people that it is \u201cold and slow.\u201dThe adrenaline-fueled military air show teams are one way of changing that impression. When show season begins, the Thunderbirds arrive with their F-16 fighter jets. They give journalists and celebrities an opportunity to ride along on a gravity-defying flight, challenging them not to pass out or throw up.But the pilots also work on the ground, officiating as Major Gorney did at enlistment ceremonies. Last year, they also visited 55 schools and 25 hospitals. They met with scout troops and civic organizations, spreading the message that military service can help people \u201cbecome the best version of themselves,\u201d Major Geoffroy said.Thirty-one thousand new enlistees joined the Air Force in 2017, down about 500 from 2016 but higher than the previous six years. More than 1,000 people enlisted in the Air Force at Thunderbird events last year, with 4,000 more expressing interest in the service, according to Brooke L. Brzozowske of the Air Force Public Affairs Office.The public fascination with military performers can be seen around the world. In Finland, which has one-year military or civil conscription for all men at the age of 18, the Midnight Hawks demonstration team flies four BAE System Hawks at air shows and roars over the country\u2019s two annual military parades on Independence Day and Defense Forces Day.\u201cPeople are quite keen about the military,\u201d said Capt. Marc Fuss, a pilot and the team leader. \u201cStill, we need to keep the spirit up and keep them aware of the air force and defense forces and that is the role our display team plays.\u201dThe Royal Jordanian Falcons team promotes tourism through its summer appearances at European air shows and encourages young people to join the air force and learn to fly, according to the retired colonel Ghazi Sadoun, a pilot and team operations leader.England\u2019s Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, known as the Red Arrows, shows off the British-made Hawk T1 jets it flies and the Rolls-Royce engines that power them, also a British product. Watching the Red Arrows turns some spectators into performers, according to the team\u2019s website: \u201cMany of the pilots and other members of the Squadron joined the Royal Air Force as a direct result of seeing the Red Arrows perform as children.\u201dFinding more people to design, create and maintain the systems is critical. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much is in the plane beyond the wow factor of how fast it goes,\u201d Mr. DeLaney said. \u201cIn the F-35, the helmet that the pilot wears is a half-million-dollar piece of equipment and technology. That\u2019s the more enticing thing.\u201dAccording to Mr. Schmidt: \u201cAerospace is on the cutting edge of many technologies.\u201d If in the past the armed forces and the companies that do business with them didn\u2019t make effective use of that argument, that appears to be less the case now with a personnel crisis on the horizon. Whiz-bang displays, however, may not be enough to counter an unwillingness among some tech workers to create software with lethal applications.In April, more than 3,100 Google employees signed a letter to the company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, asking that the company not participate in a Pentagon program to create artificial intelligence for targeting drone attacks.Mr. DeLaney experienced something similar in his business, which provides candidates to companies with military contracts. \u201cSome individuals I recruit have shot me down,\u201d he said, when he approached them about defense-related jobs. Mr. DeLaney said the candidates told him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things that blow up or put people in harm\u2019s way or are a threat to people.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no single big red \u2018easy\u2019 button to be pushed\u201d to overcome these hurdles, said Maj. Gen. Mark Smith, the national commander and chief executive of the Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air Force.\u201cYoung people have to have the opportunity to get hands-on experience and explore potential career opportunities that are aviation-related or of interest to the air force, like cyber security or maintenance or logistics, robotics and unmanned vehicles,\u201d said Brent Wolfe, secretary general of the Canada-based cadet exchange.As part of the 2018 United States defense budget, a small amount has been set aside to help pay for flight training for cadets who otherwise would not be able to afford it. It is part of the Civil Air Patrol\u2019s mission to promote aviation and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). General Smith said helping the cadets get a private pilot\u2019s license could \u201cprime the pump\u201d and motivate some to fly for the military and maybe even become the kind of pilots who will inspire the next generation.\u201cThere are a lot of kids that think the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels are amazing and really cool,\u201d General Smith said. \u201cThey give kids an appreciation for what the military is doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giddy Up, Girlfriend!", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLoving horses might insulate you from all the manure on the internet.LEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 In an intimate afternoon ceremony on a sunny Friday in July, a dappled gray gelding and his bay bride, swathed in a gown of artificial hydrangea petals, were wed by a steer wearing clerical vestments. Those present for the vows exchange included a chestnut ring bearer, a \u201cflower filly\u201d and friends Bella Bernaiche of Marshall, Mich., and Georgia Padgett of Saluda, S.C., both 14, who coordinated the ceremony together. The most striking part of the tableau wasn\u2019t that the bride, groom and officiant were inhuman, but that they were inanimate: made of plastic, measuring roughly six inches high from hoof to wither.Welcome to Breyerfest, a treasured summer rite for those deliriously in love with horses to indulge their obsession alongside approximately 30,000 (mostly teenage, mostly female) kindred spirits: \u201chorse girls,\u201d as they are sometimes called. While cultural reference points have changed over the decades \u2014 from 1944\u2019s \u201cNational Velvet\u201d to two versions of \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d to 2002\u2019s \u201cSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\u201d \u2014 the Breyer horse has remained a constant, at the center of the horse girl universe for most of its nearly 70-year-history. If one were to assemble a ready-made Horse Girl Starter Kit, it would almost certainly include at least one standard Breyer, which typically costs between $40 and $70. Originating in Chicago but now owned by Reeves International in New Jersey with manufacture in China, the company has hosted Breyerfest at the Kentucky Horse Park here every year since 1989.Breyerfest is, simply, revelry in a shared obsession. Many attendees are also there to shop: for more model horses, but also for tiny fabric horse blankets ($9), leather saddles ($50) and custom wooden barns ($500) \u2014 tiny surrogates through which to live out a painstakingly detailed fantasy, rendered exquisitely in 1:9 scale. One does not have to own a flesh-and-blood horse in order to be a horse girl, and in fact, for many, a Breyer may be the closest she\u2019ll ever get. She is not defined by her proximity to horses, but by manifesting her interest in a way that outsiders may not understand \u2014 may even mock. Horse girls gallop and neigh on the playground. They doodle \u201cSecretariat\u201d in the margins of their algebra homework. They arrange toy horse marriages. And they chat, post, heart and dream.Attendance of Breyerfest has more than doubled over the past decade, according to Rick Rekedal, Breyer\u2019s executive vice president, who attributes this in part to \u2014 what else? \u2014 social media. \u201cPeople have always loved Breyer, but now they have more tools to share it,\u201d Mr. Rekedal said. If Breyerfest is the horse girl\u2019s bacchanal, the nearby Clarion Hotel is its open bar, from which the ecstasy of material excess flows like wine. Throughout Breyerfest, the hotel transforms into a kind of Kowloon Walled City, in which dealers cram their rooms floor to ceiling with shelves of model horses and open their doors to the madding crowd. This informal bazaar began unfurling on a Thursday. By Friday evening, nearly every interior wall had been shellacked in \u201cwanted\u201d signs and advertisements trumpeting special-edition Breyers, handmade tack and a few tangential items and services, like shoulder massages and an herbal sciatica remedy. Lee Ann Masters of Waco, Ky., has sold inside the hotel for the past decade. Ms. Masters, 52, has attended Breyerfest annually since 2002, moving to this state from California in order to be closer to the event. \u201cAll my friends meet here every year, so at least once a year I get to see everybody I know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all get together, and we eat, drink, sell and buy.\u201dMs. Masters, who works in retail for FedEx, bought her first Breyer horse at age 12 after saving up spare change she earned by trading in glass Coke bottles. She estimates she has bought and sold more than 3,000 model horses over the years, some fetching prices as high as $2,800, though she still has her original Man o\u2019 War from her Coke bottle days, tearing up when she talks about him. \u201cThey\u2019re that good childhood feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just pretty.\u201d Woe betide those who interfere with her enthusiasm. \u201cWhen my ex-husband said, \u2018It\u2019s me or the horses,\u2019 I said, \u2018Have a nice day!\u2019\u201dAt the park the next morning, lines at the gates were forming by 7 a.m., two hours before opening. One group of adults had camped out overnight in order to be first. Nearby, a little girl wearing a pink unicorn horn cantered in tight circle, pawed at the concrete with a Teva-clad toe and whinnied shrilly.Among the waiting were Ann Braun and her daughter Sophia, 12, who drove 541 miles to Breyerfest from Laurel, Md. Sophia, who wore a \u201cKeep Calm and Canter On\u201d T-shirt, works at a barn in exchange for free riding lessons and saved her money to cover the $70 three-day admission. Shortly before 9, the crowd perked up at an unmistakable drumbeat: hooves on concrete. A row of mounted police lined up at the entrance to welcome the attendees into the park. The gates opened. The horde heaved forward past Fluffy, Breyer\u2019s giant inflatable horse. Day 2 of Breyerfest had begun.Beyond the gates, there were blank model horses to paint in the crafting tent. There were rides on real ponies. There were long lines to meet actual, live celebrity horses. The air was redolent of Coppertone, wood shavings and manure. In the covered arena, throngs of people shuffled past vendors selling T-shirts (\u201cAll women are created equal, but only the best ride horses\u201d) and Lilliputian halters made out of strips of ribbon no wider than a toothpick. Spectators watched from the bleachers as a cavalcade of exhibitors performed.Among the latter was Liz Skelton, 62, of Harrodsburg, Ky., who was demonstrating sidesaddle: an antiquated style of riding she says is experiencing a resurgence, thanks in part to the popularity of \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d In the ring, she wore a scarlet gown; her quarter horse, Mr. Darcy, had a jaunty fedora affixed to his bridle and a dusting of red glitter on his rump. Back at the stables, Ms. Skelton smiled as a gaggle of young girls in pigtails and hair bows crowded Mr. Darcy\u2019s stall to feed him treats and take selfies. \u201cI think the nicest thing about Breyerfest for little girls is getting to meet the horses,\u201d she said, her dangling horseshoe earrings glinting in the sun. \u201cThe look in their eyes \u2026 you can tell the ones who don\u2019t have horses and really want one.\u201dIndeed, inside Alltech Arena, about a hundred children had been frenetically unpacking and arranging their models since dawn for an all-day competition that replicates the entire horse show experience in miniature. (Except for the prize ribbons, which are full-sized.) Eleanor Harvey, the manager for today\u2019s show and a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, has participated in such demonstrations since her childhood. \u201cSome of these kids grow up with real horses, and this is an extension of what they do,\u201d Ms. Harvey said. \u201cSome of us, this is vicariously what we would\u2019ve liked to have done.\u201dA few entries vividly depicted models clearing a fence or maneuvering around a barrel (for \u201cPerformance\u201d classes); others were presented sans accessories, judged on their condition and their appropriateness for the class\u2019s designated breed. Nearby, a young girl used a fluffy pink makeup brush to dust off her Saddlebred\u2019s flanks before judges descended.Throughout the space, parents were draped in folding chairs, stranded without Wi-Fi or electrical outlets for up to eight hours. Among them was Brian Martin, 45, of Montclair, N.J., chaperoning his daughter, Ella, 13, and her friend, Cate Bates, 15. Back home, the girls share a leased pony named Leo, but in the world of Breyer they have entire stables of horses to themselves. Ella has around a hundred Breyers; Cate estimated she has about 250.Here in the exhibition hall, their \u201cshow strings\u201d were fanned out neatly before them on towels and Bubble Wrap. \u201cThis is one of our favorite weekends of the year,\u201d said Mr. Martin, remarkably serene for someone who had been sealed inside a convention center full of young equine enthusiasts since sunrise. He told me that Ella saved her allowance all year for Breyerfest, toting a wad of crumpled $5 and $10 bills in an envelope along for the journey.Cate and Ella are intimately familiar with the horse-obsessed corners of the internet. Cate has her own Breyer-specific Instagram account, and Ella is an avid viewer of model horse YouTube channels. (Facebook, Cate explained, is more for \u201cthe older people\u201d \u2014 she only joined when she had to create an account for school, after which she made a beeline for the many model horse enthusiast groups scattered throughout the platform.) Both told me that, thanks to social media, they feel as though they\u2019ve found their tribe of people who \u201cget it\u201d \u2014 not like in school, where Cate says her classmates sometimes \u201clook at me like I\u2019m strange\u201d when she tries to explain her hobby.\u201cHorse internet\u201d is familiar territory for Maddy Stover, Breyer\u2019s social media manager. Ms. Stover, 25, competed on Southern Methodist University\u2019s equestrian team and continued show-jumping after graduating. She recalled feeling floored when she first encountered the array of Breyer fan accounts on social media. \u201cIt was unbelievable to me, these girls who would photograph them and love them and take care of them like real horses,\u201d Ms. Stover said.Here there are neither nervous bathing suit selfies nor brows on fleek. In fact, there are barely any selfies at all \u2014 just toy horses, often seeming to serve as vessels to re-enact the struggles in their young owners\u2019 lives, accompanied with diarylike captions. The horse girl has also pivoted to video. There are more than 300,000 Breyer-related ones on YouTube, according to Mr. Rekedal. Many are reviews and unboxing vlogs. But amateur filmmakers like Emma Davis, Megan Mixon and Renee Bouchard also write, shoot and edit scripted series in which Breyer horses experience high-stakes drama and dialogue as fully formed characters (aided by human voice-over and hands). \u201cI think it lets us find our people,\u201d Ms. Davis, 19, said of the model horse community on social media. She frequently voice-acts for her friends\u2019 Breyer YouTube series, and drives 10 hours every year from her hometown, Middletown, Del., to attend Breyerfest. Ms. Mixon, of Union, Ky., is currently raising funds for her scripted drama, \u201cNecrosis,\u201d while Ms. Bouchard, of North Chittenden, Vt., will soon release Season 2 of \u201cBlood Moon,\u201d a medieval saga of samuraiesque horses jockeying for power and defeating an evil force. Each of them budgeted around $1,000 to spend on new models at Breyerfest. Georgia Padgett and Bella Bernaiche, who dreamed up Friday afternoon\u2019s horse nuptials, also found each other through the internet. Georgia is a barrel racer who works as a stablehand and Bella owns a former cutting horse that she is training to jump. Both girls agreed that one must love horses unconditionally, of course \u2014 and, Georgia chimed in, \u201cto have posters of them all over your walls.\u201d (Her bedroom prominently features the champion barrel racing horse Scamper.) It\u2019s also about \u201cknowing your stuff,\u201d Bella said. In the last year, the two girls, who live 760 miles apart, have spent hours on FaceTime talking about their model horses, constructing fleece \u201cpony pouches\u201d in which to safely transport their Breyers, and planning the aforementioned wedding of two of their models, Quill and Sangria. When Georgia tells peers about her model horse-collecting hobby, \u201cthey look at me with crazy eyes,\u201d she said with a laugh. As soon as she turned 13, she set up a social-media profile. \u201cI was like, \u2018Breyer Instagram, I\u2019m coming.\u2019\u201d Heather Bernaiche, Bella\u2019s mother, remembers seeing Breyer horses at her local Tractor Supply store, but otherwise, \u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this existed at all,\u201d she said. When Bella\u2019s interest in Breyers began to usurp her American Girl doll collection, Ms. Bernaiche was initially skeptical. But after attending Bella\u2019s first model competition last year, she was impressed by her daughter's commitment and handiwork. Other children Bella\u2019s age, Ms. Bernaiche said, tend to hang out on their phones all night or traipse around the mall, \u201cwhich I won\u2019t let her do by herself.\u201d As a parent, she sees the hobby as a wholesome alternative, and a positive way to connect with peers (though she does monitor Bella\u2019s Instagram interactions).Besides, it\u2019s educational. The encyclopedic knowledge that the average horse girl possesses is astonishing. A dedicated Breyer fan can identify genetically distinct coat color patterns \u2014 roan, piebald, cremello \u2014 and name the original mold itself. They can eyeball a model\u2019s breed based on its physique. They rattle off names of real horses whose Breyer likenesses they collect like baseball cards: renowned dressage competitors, prolific Arabian broodmares, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s favorite Fell pony. All identify as horse girls. Unanimously. Unequivocally. All of them are acutely aware of the perceptions some outsiders have of their kind. None of them appeared to be fazed.Long may they rein.Advertisement"}

That message came through loud and clear in recent days during the public comment period on the administration\u2019s proposed tariffs on imported cars and parts. The global auto industry relies on supply chains that were built on the free movement of parts and goods. Suppliers, dealers and car manufacturers in the United States and other countries are petrified by the damage that the tariffs could do to their businesses.General Motors, which warned that the tariffs could lead to job losses in the United States, said in its comments that the new levies could end up \u201cisolating U.S. businesses like G.M. from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home.\u201dVolvo, which recently opened a plant in South Carolina, said that jobs there depended on customers outside the United States. \u201cThus, half of the 4,000 direct jobs at the factory that we aim to create are related to exports, and if we cannot trade freely, those U.S. jobs may not be created at all,\u201d Volvo said.To be sure, this industry is quick to warn of job losses from policies it doesn\u2019t like but is slow to reward workers when times are good. The auto industry has not gone out of its way to use its recent corporate tax breaks to benefit workers.The prospect of tariff-induced job losses, however, is not just hypothetical. Harley-Davidson, the Wisconsin-based motorcycle maker, could be a bellwether.Harley sales have been in decline in the United States for years. Its bikes are big, fat, noisy and technologically backward, and the company has been too slow to make the lighter, more modern motorcycles that appeal to younger, more technically sophisticated American buyers. Japanese and European motorcycle makers have excelled at this. Nothing the motorcycle maker has done \u2014 including importing many key components from abroad \u2014 is different from the business practices of any other corporation, including its competitors, which the president claims he is now trying to lure to invest in the United States. One of Harley\u2019s rivals, the Iowa-based Polaris, is also considering moving some production to Poland in response to the retaliatory European levies.Tariffs are like a long train of boxcars; each one is filled with unintended consequences that can knock into the next with devastating consequences. The names on the factories may be foreign, but the workers who stand to lose their jobs are right here in America.Jamie Lincoln Kitman is the New York bureau chief for Automobile magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Growing Uproar, Poland to Remove 27 Supreme Court Justices", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week, it is forcing her to step down as Poland\u2019s top Supreme Court judge.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I am terrified,\u201d the judge, Malgorzata Gersdorf, said days before the government forced her out of her job. \u201cBut without a doubt this is not a direction I would like to go in, nor support, as I think it destroys what has been built over the last 25 years.\u201dMajor protests against the changes took place on Tuesday, and Justice Gersdorf showed up for work Wednesday morning, setting the stage for a possible confrontation with the authorities.But many of the changes have already taken hold. In a step-by-step process, the Law and Justice party has established control over the Consitutional Tribunal; taken over the selection of judges; and expanded the powers of the justice minister, threatening prosecutorial independence.For now, many of the country\u2019s 10,000 judges remain united in their opposition to the changes, including Justice Gersdorf, who said she would refuse to retire. And counter-pressures are building in the country\u2019s vibrant civil society.Lech Walesa, the leader of the Solidarity movement that ended Communist rule in Poland, joined the fray on Sunday, vowing to lead a campaign of civil disobedience if Justice Gersdorf and other judges were forcefully removed.\u201cI am saying a definite \u2018enough\u2019 to this,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cIf they raise their paws against the Supreme Court, then I am going to Warsaw.\u201dHe went on to warn that he would fight to defend himself and his country.\u201cI would like to remind everyone that I possess a firearm and am authorized to use self-defense,\u201d he wrote.Judges who have spoken out publicly against the purge have reported being threatened, harassed and intimidated.Waldemar Zurek, a former spokesman for the National Council of the Judiciary and a district court judge in the southern city of Krakow, has been openly critical of the changes and of Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro. In response, both he and his family have been subject to intense pressure and abuse, including death threats.Judge Zurek said he was dismissed as a spokesman for the court, threatened with disciplinary sanctions over fabricated allegations, and harassed by government agents, including at his home. His financial records have been publicly disclosed, and he has faced investigations about a long-ago real estate transaction and by the tax authorities. \u201cThere were even attempts to present me as not paying child support,\u201d he said.Judge Zurek said that he had received scores of threatening emails and letters, and that he feared he would eventually run into someone on the street who would \u201cdo what they have threatened to do.\u201dHe added that judges who had supported him have also come under attack.\u201cMy mother calls me crying and asking that I stop\u201d the criticism, he said. \u201cShe says, \u2018I have never been so scared as I am now, and I\u2019ve lived some years in the world.\u2019 She was a member of Solidarity.\u201dHe said that the government viewed him and other judges defending the rule of law as enemies of the state. \u201cAll those who stand in the way of the minister become public enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are spat on.\u201dIn the drafting of the Polish Constitution, great care was taken to ensure Soviet-era abuses of the courts would never recur. That is why, among other protections, the document explicitly states that Supreme Court judges serve six-year terms.Justice Gersdorf, 65, whose title is first president of the Supreme Court, said she thought that the mandatory retirement age was set with her in mind. Backed by 63 other judges on the court, who voted unanimously last week that she should stay in office until the end of her term, she said that she would continue to show up for work.\u201cI have no intention of resigning, since my term of office is six years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are throwing me out of office. Please write that the first president of the Supreme Court is thrown out of office.\u201dHer defiance is the latest and most high-profile development in a confrontation that has been building for months.In December, the Venice Commission, which is responsible for monitoring the rule of law for the European Union, expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that the judicial overhaul effort \u201cputs at serious risk the independence of all parts of the Polish judiciary.\u201dPoland was given until the end of June to make changes that would satisfy those concerns. But no agreement was reached in meetings last week in Luxembourg, and Polish leaders vowed to press ahead.That critics see a reversion to Soviet-style jurisprudence is not without irony.Mr. Kaczynski, a fierce ideologue who controls most of the levers of power in Poland, has sought to portray the changes as a battle against former Communists, \u201cred spiders\u201d who were never properly purged after the transition to democracy in 1989.It is a belief that was reinforced when Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s Law and Justice party first held power, from 2005 to 2007, and he found many of his efforts stymied by the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal.Mr. Kaczynski has not hidden his intentions.\u201cIn a democracy, the sovereign is the people, their representative in Parliament and, in the Polish case, the elected president,\u201d he said in a 2016 speech. \u201cIf we are to have a democratic state of law, no state authority, including the Constitutional Tribunal, can disregard legislation.\u201dSince the governing party does not have the required two-thirds majority to change the Constitution, Justice Gersdorf said, they needed control over the tribunal so they could pass laws that she said were clearly unconstitutional, like most of the changes they have made in the courts.\u201cThe rationale from the authorities was very intelligent from their point of view,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s disarm the Constitutional Tribunal. It\u2019s ours.\u2019\u201dThe Law and Justice party used a variety of means to stack the court in its favor \u2014 including refusing to print the rulings of the court itself when it was not composed of judges appointed by the party and claiming, therefore, that its decisions did not have the force of law.The next step was to gain control of the common courts. The Minister of Justice assumed the role of prosecutor general, which had previously been independent.Then the party took over the National Council of the Judiciary, which is responsible for appointing judges.In addition to lowering the mandatory retirement age, the judiciary changes also create a new disciplinary chamber within the court that Justice Gersdorf said would be used to attack judges who displeased the party.\u201cJudges in this disciplinary chamber will be earning 40 percent more than the justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to be emphasized that this is political bribery.\u201dJustice Gersdorf said that one of the great accomplishments of the Polish state in its transition to democracy was restoring public faith in the courts.\u201cUndermining the authority of the justice system and the judges will require years of rebuilding,\u201d she said. \u201cThis beautiful attitude of our society toward the justice system was crushed by the ruling party in just two years for no reason really. This is the blame they will have to bear.\u201dShe planned to report for work on Wednesday, but did not expect to be let into the building.She shrugged off concerns that she might have to pay a high price for her defiance.\u201cThey are not putting people in jail, yet,\u201d she said.Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.Yet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.Facebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.Facial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201dBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.Rochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.At the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.European regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.Nikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201dFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.People could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.But Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.One patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.Another Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.But legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.The case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.If the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Understanding the Risks of Lead Paint", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this tad-bit-cooler Thursday.We have a lot of questions and concerns about lead paint, so we turned to Corinne Schiff, the deputy commissioner of environmental health for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Her responses have been condensed.How do I know if my building has lead paint?City law presumes that any building built before 1960 has lead paint. And the reason for that presumption is that it was in 1960 that the New York City Board of Health prohibited lead paint for interior use.Why is the lead paint situation in public housing units so bad?That\u2019s actually not true. Looking at the city over all, the rates of elevated blood lead levels are actually higher for children in private housing than those in public housing.Is my landlord required to fix lead paint hazards?What the law says is that for any building before 1960, the landlord has to do an annual survey to find out if there is a child under age 6 in the apartment. If there is, then the landlord has to make an inspection to see if there is peeling paint. Throughout the year, tenants can tell their landlord or call 311 if they have peeling, chipped or cracked paint.If you have a young child under age 6, make sure that you\u2019re getting their blood tested for lead. New York State requires blood lead testing at ages 1 and 2, and requires doctors to assess for risk up to age 6.The next thing New Yorkers should do is fill out that annual notice that comes from landlords.If you do not have a child under the age of 6 and if your paint is intact, then there is not really a risk for hazards from lead paint. But if people are still concerned, they should talk to their health care provider.Here\u2019s what else is happening:The heat is backing off a little.Tonight, temperatures will cool to a low of 67.The United States Open is almost here \u2014 matches begin on Aug. 27.The New York Times is planning a special section in celebration of two large milestones for the tennis tournament: the 50th anniversary of the competition in the Open era and the 40th year that the tournament will be at the U.S.T.A.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Syrians Pioneered Digital Tools to Stand Up to Authorities", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Anne Barnard, The Times\u2019s bureau chief in Beirut, Lebanon, who covers Syria and the Middle East, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You\u2019ve spent much of your time covering the Syrian war. What have been your most important tech tools for doing your job?Covering Syria has transformed the way I use technology at work. Not that I use especially high-tech tools \u2014 I don\u2019t. But the particular journalistic and logistical challenges of covering this conflict have prodded everyone to use basic technology in new and different ways. That means not just me and my colleagues, but also the Syrians whose experiences we are covering.The most important of those tools is the ubiquity of smartphone video and the ease of sharing it. Also critical are social media networks, which have helped connect journalists to a wide variety of sources. There are too many apps and devices to mention, but they include the familiar list: Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Twitter and Skype.Methods that Syrians helped pioneer and develop, using these simple tools, have been adopted all over the world by people struggling against authority, including in the United States with witnesses recording police brutality or Black Lives Matter activists sharing those videos.The Syrian government has long kept tight control on international journalists\u2019 access to Syria and their movements inside. So when the protest movement began in 2011, Syrian activists knew they had to film their own actions \u2014 and the government\u2019s crackdown \u2014 if they wanted the outside world to know.This began with individual witnesses and activists narrating the date and location as they used phones to film protests, then security forces attacking protesters, then opposition fighters taking over neighborhoods, then government helicopters \u2014 and, later, fighter planes \u2014 bombing those neighborhoods. As the war dragged on, opposition areas became just as difficult to reach as government ones; they were blocked by sieges, or journalists there were threatened by extremist kidnappers, by airstrikes or by both. So these tools became important for covering all sides and areas, although we\u2019ve never stopped traveling to any areas we can get to.Seven years later, the use of such digital media tools has become far more systematic. The rescue group the White Helmets, working in opposition-held areas, routinely takes video from cameras mounted on volunteers\u2019 helmets as they try to pull survivors from rubble. The conflict has become partly an information war, and all sides record videos they hope will go viral to spread their point of view.What are some of the biggest challenges of using these tech tools?The number-one challenge is the security of witnesses and sources. Whether in the United States or in Syria, electronic communications cut two ways: They provide an avenue for a government\u2019s surveillance to identify and/or locate the people struggling against it.In Syria, the government chose not to block Facebook and other platforms; it used those networks to track activists and the relationships among them. People have been arrested and tortured for their social media posts, or even a \u201clike\u201d on someone else\u2019s comment, and private messages are often hacked and tapped. So we are constantly looking for safer means of communication.How do you use technology differently in Beirut than you did in the United States?Technology is more of a lifeline here as I communicate with family, friends, colleagues and sources around the world, with video and audio apps a cheaper and clearer alternative to subpar cellphone connections. And Facebook and WhatsApp groups are an easy way to share photos and feel more in touch.But it\u2019s also frustrating, limited by slow internet speeds. I work with colleagues on amazing visual multimedia projects that I and many residents in the region are unable to view fully because we literally don\u2019t have the bandwidth to load and run them efficiently.I also have become a devotee of podcasts during my time here, since they\u2019re the best way to get the radio broadcasts I like to listen to back home. It\u2019s also invaluable to catch up on the global and Mideast news in the morning without looking at a screen \u2014 while walking, or working out.What is Beirut\u2019s tech scene like? What are some of the most popular homegrown apps there?There are some tech start-up incubators in Beirut. Lebanon has terrible communications infrastructure, except for a small area in downtown Beirut that has better internet speeds. But it has lots of creative human capital with an incentive to work on tech ideas that bypass the corruption that is prohibitive for many brick-and-mortar businesses.It\u2019s still in development. The idea is a reinvention of building sets like Lego and going to a more creative and sustainable mind-set. It\u2019s a combination of physical and online tools that allow kids and adults to connect pieces of existing modular building sets they already own to one another. (You could combine Lego and other toys, for instance.) The online part lets people share and collaborate on designs as in Minecraft.The idea is to let people design toys locally and for the company to make money not by selling plastic but by letting people share their designs. So kids can design their own toys and sell the designs to others. Or they can pay small fees for designs they can then build themselves with stuff they have \u2014 kind of like paying for a recipe \u2014 plus the \u201cbranes,\u201d which are small and sent for free.Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?Books! Enjoying reading offscreen is increasingly important for everyone in an over-digitalized world where email and other digital communications encroach on the boundaries between night and day, home and work.My kids, 10 and 7, spend hours reading books every day; we don\u2019t have cable or satellite TV except in our home office for me and my husband, who is also a journalist and a researcher, to very occasionally watch breaking news on Arabic regional channels. Kid screen time is restricted to a few hours on the weekend.The biggest challenge in trying to fit our stuff back into the smaller apartment we\u2019ll be moving home to in New York soon is not clothes or even beautiful Middle Eastern textiles and woodwork. It\u2019s our shelves and shelves of books. One of the biggest consolations we\u2019ve offered the kids for leaving Lebanon, where they\u2019ve grown up, is a promise that a few blocks from our apartment, there will be a public library.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Know About the Trapped Thai Boys", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen 12 soccer players and their coach went missing in the Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand on June 23, many feared they would never emerge alive from the flooded depths of the geological complex.With the soccer team\u2019s plight approaching the two-week mark, here\u2019s what is known.The 12 trapped boys are from the Moo Pa Academy (the name means \u201cWild Boars\u201d), a soccer team in the Mae Sai district of Chiang Rai, and range in age from 11 to 16. Many attend the Mae Sai Prasitsart School, and their classmates have held prayer vigils for them since they disappeared. All were in decent health when rescuers found them on Monday, according to officials.One of the boys, Adul Sam-On, was born in Myanmar, where his parents live. He had been taken in by a church to study in Thailand. He speaks four languages \u2014 English, Burmese, Thai and Chinese \u2014 and was able to communicate with the British divers who first found the group.The boys had set off after soccer practice on June 23 and biked to the cave along with their coach. When they didn\u2019t return home on Saturday evening, their families reported them missing. Family members have held a vigil outside the complex since then. The cave flooded while they were inside.Ekkapol Chantawong, 25, is the assistant coach of the Wild Boars soccer team, and was hiking with the players through the cave complex when they became stranded.Mr. Chantawong\u2019s family said he spent years as a Buddhist monk. His aunt, Amporn Sriwichai, said that both of his parents had died and that he lives with his ailing grandmother.\u201cHe is a really good boy,\u201d she said last week. \u201cHe is very helpful. He loves soccer.\u201d\u201cHe could meditate up to an hour,\u201d she told the news agency. \u201cIt has definitely helped him and probably helps the boys to stay calm.\u201dBut the boys and their coach ventured in, and then got trapped by rising floodwaters driven by rain. During the search effort, rescuers looking for the group pumped water out of the cave system, but it was not possible to drain enough to make a difference.Because of the flooding, it took 10 days to find them. The cave complex has never been fully mapped and is full of different waterways that don\u2019t appear to be directly linked.After the boys and their coach were found, officials said they might be stranded for months inside the complex, waiting for floodwaters to recede. But declining oxygen levels have put their health and survival at risk and added new urgency to the rescue.\u201cAt first we thought that we could sustain the kids\u2019 lives for a long time where they are now, but now, many things have changed,\u201d Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew, the Thai Navy SEAL commander, told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe have a limited amount of time.\u201dThe focus of the operation has now turned to delivering air to their pocket of the cave and to running a communications line to them from the command center in a dry portion called Chamber Three. By Friday, 140 divers were stationed there, about a mile from the boys.The stranded team and coach may have to be evacuated by divers, though some members of the group can\u2019t swim and have never been scuba diving. Officials have yet to provide details about whether this may happen, and if so, when.\u201cThere are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote.Thai officials have not said whether Mr. Musk\u2019s employees would be involved in rescue efforts.The worst-case possibilities involve the group\u2019s running out of air or even being swept away by rushing waters.Oxygen levels have plummeted, making the situation inside the chamber dire.His funeral will be sponsored by Thailand\u2019s royal family.Megan Specia, Richard C.

This light, brothy take brims with full-flavored summer vegetables for a colorful minestrone that can be put together in a mere half-hour or so. If you don\u2019t have a vegetable garden \u2014 or access to a friend\u2019s bounty \u2014 it\u2019s worth going to the farmers\u2019 market for the freshest, sweetest produce, because this soup is all about vegetables.With a handful of green beans, a few tomatoes, some just-picked zucchini or pattypan squash, you\u2019ll be well on your way to a quick pot of soup. Feel free to include other vegetables, like peas, favas or shelling beans. Up the number of tomatoes, too, if you wish, but I prefer this soup with a hint of tomato, to let the other components\u2019 flavors shine.The rest is easy. Add water (or broth, if you have it, but that\u2019s really unnecessary) and chopped vegetables, then simmer briskly and briefly.While the soup is cooking, make a quick pesto with garlic, basil, olive oil and a little Parmesan. I find pleasure in pounding the pesto the old-fashioned way with a mortar and pestle, but you can always make it in a food processor or with a sharp knife. To finish, some small pasta shapes, like pennette or orecchiette, can be cooked directly in the soup, or prepared in a separate pot and added to each bowl. Spoon a bit of pesto into each serving and pass grated Parmesan at the table. For a warm-weather lunch or supper, the simplicity of this soup is very appealing and, even though it\u2019s served warm, it\u2019s still quite refreshing.Advertisement"}

You can read his behavior either way, though as the former C.I.A. director John Brennan has noted, \u201cpeople who go along a treasonous path do not know they are on a treasonous path until it is too late.\u201d I think we need to use the word \u201ctreason\u201d very advisedly, but what we heard on Monday from an American president should be cause for profound disquiet. In some ways, this worries me a lot more than whatever Putin and his cyber-armies might be trying to do to us. Putin is a former KGB agent, so at least he\u2019s playing to type. It\u2019s the trashing of democratic values from the inside that concerns me even more. I guess that, as horrific as I find the stories about those poor kids being tormented at the border, I\u2019m even more disturbed by the way our president is trying to promote this kind of ideology around the world. Take immigration, Europe really has had problems integrating and assimilating immigrants, and a succession of center-left and center-right governments never seemed to get a handle on the problem. When the refugee crisis of 2015 hit, it just created an impression that European governments had lost the means and the will to control their own borders. It was certain to stir a backlash.That\u2019s why I think calls in the United States to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d are so dangerous: They create the impression that Democrats want unregulated migration, as opposed to a generous but lawful immigration policy. And that just helps Trump and the Bannonites. Oh God, that reminds me of the fact that our government representatives attacked an international group for endorsing the idea of encouraging mothers in developing countries to breast feed. On behalf of the formula makers. But back to the election. What\u2019s your fallen-away Republican recommendation to us Democrats?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside the World of Racist Science Fiction", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand why white supremacists back the president, we have to understand the books that define their worldview.Mr. Allen is a playwright.As I watched the televised 2016 presidential debates, listening to the then-candidate Donald Trump arguing various points with Hillary Clinton, a chill went down my spine. I was in the middle of writing a new play, a comic parody of white supremacist fiction. With his hyperbolic attacks on immigrants and minorities \u2014 African-Americans \u201cliving in hell,\u201d Latino \u201cgangs roaming the street\u201d and insinuations that a long list of Jewish philanthropists and politicians was conspiring against him \u2014 Mr. Trump sounded like a character straight out of my research.Trump\u2019s habit of echoing the racist far right is now well-known, but back then, everyone was unsure of what was even happening, let alone what to call it. Two years later \u2014 after Richard Spencer, after Charlottesville \u2014 the public has heard a lot about white supremacist culture. But I\u2019d argue that we haven\u2019t quite heard enough. To understand their ideologies and why they support this president so strongly, we need to examine their literature. The books act as a kind of binding agent, a Bible-like codification of basic principles that underpin the various denominations. And yet, for understandable reasons, they remain largely unknown. Journalists are inclined to avoid name-checking the books publicly, for fear of inadvertently promoting them. This is no longer a winning strategy. Heidi Beirich, who tracks far-right hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, agrees. \u201cWe needed to have been talking about these books for decades,\u201d she asserts. \u201cThey\u2019re very influential, they\u2019re reaching the highest levels of power, they\u2019re having an impact on terrorism, on policy, and so on. Not talking about them is just wrong.\u201d So, let\u2019s talk.Most of the books are self-published. Others are distributed by small, activist imprints or the publishing arms of white nationalist organizations. They are sold online, at gun shows or person to person. This scattershot distribution system makes it hard to track sales, but the more popular titles are estimated to have sold hundreds of thousands of copies. I acquired some out-of-print titles from rare book dealers. They are dog-eared, annotated and often inscribed. The genre ranges broadly in tone and topic, from dark, foreboding dramas to broad, slapstick comedies; from neo-Confederate romances to futuristic dystopian nightmares. They\u2019re dangerous and disgusting, for sure, but they\u2019re also absurdly stupid and, on the whole, very badly written. As a playwright who specializes in edgy humor, I find them endlessly fascinating. Their vocabulary of broad stereotypes, paranoid fantasies and preposterous global-takeover schemes is the stuff comedy is made of. I have a particular affinity for the sci-fi books. One of the most popular is Ward Kendall\u2019s 2001 \u201cHold Back This Day,\u201d which imagines a future in which the evil all-powerful \u201cWorld Gov\u201d has forcibly united the population of Earth under one religion and, by way of enforced race-mixing, one uniformly brown-skinned population. Jeff Huxton is a \u201cskoolplex\u201d administrator and one of the world\u2019s few remaining white people. He slowly learns to cherish his white skin, becomes radicalized and joins a terrorist group called \u201cNayra\u201d (\u201cAryan\u201d spelled backwards!). They hijack a spaceship and travel to Avalon, a secret all-white colony on Mars, which has been transformed into a paradisiacal homeland.In \u201cBedford: A World Vision,\u201d another futuristic novel, abortion is encouraged, old people are euthanized and legally regimented political correctness has cowed Caucasians into submission. Written by a former Alabama public-school teacher named Ellen Williams and first published in 2000, the book\u2019s obsessions are rooted in \u201cChristian Identity\u201d paranoia, channeling its racist ideologies through fears of a perceived threat to white Christians. Its two protagonists, Horace and Virginia Pruitt, are on trial after having been accused by their 13-year-old son, Adam, of taking him to church against his will \u2014 a criminal act in Ms. Williams\u2019s dystopia. The plot, as it were, thickens when it is revealed that he has been swayed by a sexual relationship with his male gym teacher, whom he is dating. In Ms. Williams\u2019 reckoning of the future, pedophilia is not only tolerated, it\u2019s sanctioned. Thus poor Virginia and Horace are left helpless to save their son from the jaws of debauchery. The author bio on the dust jacket claims that Ms. Williams has also written \u201cseveral dramatic monologues,\u201d which she presents to various \u201cSouthern heritage groups and historical societies\u201d (read: neo-Confederate rallies). My copy of the book is inscribed \u201cTo Bettye,\u201d with a handwritten quotation (usually attributed to Edmund Burke) that is often cited in the movement: \u201cAll that is required for evil to prevail is that good men do nothing.\u201dand in so doing he helped greatly to assure that his race would survive and prosper, that the Organization would achieve its worldwide political and military goals, and that the Order would spread its wise and benevolent rule over the earth for all time to come. Sitting beside \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d at the top of the white supremacist best-seller list is Jean Raspail\u2019s 1973 novel, \u201cThe Camp of the Saints.\u201d It is a brooding parable that warns of the dangers of immigration and is something of a standout for being relatively well written, even in translation from the original French. Mr. Raspail\u2019s caustic, often-humorous, ellipses-littered prose is reminiscent of that of his fellow countryman Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, whose own history as a Nazi sympathizer cast a shadow over his otherwise brilliant work.The book\u2019s central \u201cproblem\u201d begins in Belgium, where priests are encouraging the adoption of Indian children as a form of charity. In an early scene, a roiling sea of desperate Indian mothers \u2014 \u201cwretched creatures\u201d \u2014 storms the gates of the Belgian embassy in Kolkata, each with a child in her outstretched arms. The country is soon swamped with these adoptions, and authorities announce an end to the policy.But it\u2019s too late; the mob gains strength as the Indians are joined by Arabs and other nonwhites. They eventually grow to one million strong, board a flotilla and set sail for France. The country\u2019s liberal government hesitates to defend against the onslaught, and as it stammers and acquiesces, the immigrants begin to enter the country. France\u2019s whites retreat northward, but are eventually absorbed by the demographic shift, and the trend spreads throughout Europe, as indigenous populations and other \u201choards\u201d are inspired to rise up. They eventually take over the world, erasing the white race from existence.White supremacists seem convinced that the novels\u2019 \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is coming to life, and are petitioning Mr. Trump for help. This past spring, Andrew Anglin, the deeply sinister and darkly clever force behind Daily Stormer, the most Millennial-y neo-Nazi site on the web, started to spread the news of a \u201cmigrant caravan\u201d that was moving through Central America, toward the United States-Mexico border. It was a protest march, organized by the Central American pro-immigration activist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras. The march has taken place every year since 2010 without ever getting much traction in the press.But Mr. Anglin saw an opportunity in the implication of a literal enactment of \u201cThe Camp of the Saints.\u201d He rallied his troll army to petition Mr. Trump to use the word \u201ccaravans\u201d publicly, and on April 1, he did. In fact, he and Vice President Mike Pence used the word multiple times, then issued an order to send the National Guard to the border. The story dominated the news cycle for days, and Mr. Anglin took a well-deserved victory lap, bragging that \u201cthe media was not talking about this, only the alt-right was, and Trump is posting about it \u2014 so he does hear us.\u201dIt is unlikely that Mr. Trump has read any of these books. But members of his staff undoubtedly have. His former aide Steve Bannon is a fan of \u201cThe Camp of the Saints\u201d and refers to it often \u2014 in knowing, offhand ways that betray both his familiarity with racist literature and his awareness of his target audience\u2019s reading habits. Another administration official, Julie Kirchner, was named ombudsman at the Customs and Border Protection after spending 10 years as the executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. That organization, which Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a hate group, was founded by John Tanton, who runs The Social Contract Press, which is the current publisher of \u201cThe Camp of the Saints.\u201dThe point is not that there is a direct line between, say, \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d and the Oval Office. Rather, it\u2019s that the tropes that define the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and policies \u2014 apocalyptic xenophobia, anti-Semitic conspiracies, racist fear-mongering \u2014 are also the tropes that define white-supremacist literature. To the hundreds of thousands of fans of Mr. Kendall, Ms. Williams and other writers, Mr. Trump must seem like a character out of racist central casting: a rule-breaking white knight who will stop at nothing to root out the conspiracies and take on their race\u2019s enemies. No wonder the bond between Mr. Trump and the far right is so strong: Not only is he a hero out of their novels, but in supporting him, they have become heroes themselves.Advertisement"}

Trey Hegar, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, got into an impassioned argument on his Facebook page.\u201cThe Bible doesn\u2019t promote helping criminals!!!!\u201d a Trump supporter wrote.Mr. Hegar answered with Leviticus: \u201cWhen a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.\u201dThe Trump supporter came back with the passage in the Gospel of Mark about rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and added for good measure: \u201cImmigration laws are good and Godly! We elected our leaders and God allowed it.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has been promoted with biblical righteousness by senior members of his administration, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And in heartland communities where the president is popular, the crackdown is often debated \u2014 by supporters and critics alike \u2014 through the lens of Christian morality.In Mount Pleasant, a town of 8,500 in rural southeast Iowa that voted heavily for Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s immigration policies created a sharp, unexpected fracture in the days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents descended, on May 9. Fault lines appeared among public officials, businesses and, especially, the town\u2019s many churches.\u201cThis whole immigration thing has been an abstraction,\u201d said State Representative Dave Heaton, a Republican from Mount Pleasant. \u201cIt\u2019s been on TV and in the newspapers. And all of a sudden it\u2019s here in our town. Relationships and everything are all of a sudden up for grabs.\u201dMr. Hegar, a Texan who served four years in the Marines before attending a Presbyterian seminary, finally asked the Trump supporter he was debating on Facebook: \u201cWhich Scripture do we obey?\u201dHe answered himself: \u201cThe one from Jesus to \u2018Do unto others\u2019 is what we choose.\u201dMr. Hegar\u2019s church on Walnut Street is across from the site of Mount Pleasant\u2019s most popular event, a Labor Day festival of steam-powered tractors and other farm machinery. In the days and weeks after the raid, the church became a hectic crossroads for family members of the detained men and their supporters. Parishioners in a group called Iowa Welcomes Immigrant Neighbors raised $80,000 to help detainees\u2019 families pay rent, utilities and legal fees.Other mainline Protestant churches, including the Lutherans, contributed to the fund, as did the Catholics at St. Alphonsus, where a Spanish Mass is held once a month. Notably absent from the donor roll, though, were Mount Pleasant\u2019s evangelical churches.Mr. Hegar said he heard relatives of a detained man say that the pastor of the evangelical church they have attended for years had not called to ask if he could help them. \u201cMy heart breaks for that,\u201d Mr. Hegar said.The town\u2019s evangelical pastors, whom he knows, are compassionate individuals, he said, \u201cbut to see nothing, after something like this in their backyards \u2014 I\u2019m shocked.\u201d\u201cThe nationalistic politics and theology goes hand in hand now,\u201d Mr. Hegar said. \u201cIt drives me crazy when we don\u2019t practice what Jesus preaches because of the mix of religion and national politics.\u201dPastors of three leading evangelical churches in Mount Pleasant declined repeated requests over several weeks seeking comment for this article.One evangelical pastor who did agree to an interview in the days after the raid was Jim Erwin, the head of Wellspring Evangelical Free Church. He said no one from the mainline churches had suggested he raise money; if they had, he said, he might have chipped in.But Mr. Erwin added that he believed the detentions were justified: \u201cBecause they\u2019re breaking the law, I recognize the authorities do need to come in and do that.\u201dOn a day in mid-May when the president referred to immigrants who join gangs as \u201canimals,\u201d more than 100 people crowded into the fellowship hall of the First Presbyterian Church, including about 25 wives and children of the detained men.Walfred Urizar-Lopez, 15, said that he and his father, Elmer Urizar-Lopez, 41, fled Guatemala for their lives after a gang tried to recruit Walfred as a drug courier. His father had gone to the police, but their advice was to cooperate with the drug-runners; his father refused.\u201cThe gang told my dad he has no idea what kind of problems he will have,\u201d Walfred said at the church, speaking through a translator.The arrest of his father in the factory raid left Walfred, a high school sophomore, alone in Mount Pleasant. In jeans and a flannel shirt, he thrust his hands into his pockets and fought back tears.\u201cHis situation right now, it\u2019s very bad,\u201d said Eneida Carillo, whose family, also from Guatemala, had taken Walfred in. She said a lawyer had told them that day that Walfred\u2019s father would probably be deported. Ms. Carillo began to cry.\u201cAs soon as his dad gets back, they will probably kill him,\u2019\u2019 she said.When Mr. Hegar spoke at the church meeting, he paused after each line to let Dina Saunders, who teaches English as a second language at the middle school, translate into Spanish.\u201cI am tired,\u201d the pastor said.\u201cEstoy cansado.\u201d\u201cI am tired of people talking about my neighbors breaking the law, when our country is breaking our own laws. By dividing up families. Separating women from children. Treating people seeking a better life like criminals.\u201cMy church \u2014 \u201d\u201cMi iglesia.\u201d\u201c\u2014 is your church.\u201d\u201cEs su iglesia.\u201dNo charges have been filed against the owners of the Midwest Precast Concrete plant in Mount Pleasant that was raided. An ICE spokesman declined to comment, citing a continuing investigation.According to Robin Clark-Bennett of the Center for Worker Justice of Eastern Iowa, 23 of the 32 arrested men have been released on bond, three have been deported and five remain in jail facing criminal charges.While emotions ran high at the meeting in the fellowship hall, not everyone in Mount Pleasant, nor even at First Presbyterian, sided with Mr. Hegar.\u201cI agree with our president: our borders, we can\u2019t open it to everybody,\u201d said Rusty King, the church\u2019s custodian, the following day.\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough poor people here in Iowa that need help,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cI work three jobs and still live paycheck to paycheck.\u201dAfter an initial conversation with a reporter about immigration, he seemed to avoid follow-up calls and texts. But he had a granddaughter, Angel King, pass along a Facebook post written by a young man from Mount Pleasant that echoed Mr. King\u2019s own views.\u201cI can\u2019t hold my tongue any longer,\u201d Garrett Carlston wrote in the post on May 10, when supporters of the detainees were rallying at the Henry County Courthouse. \u201cI feel bad for the families that are going to be torn apart by this but it\u2019s hard for me to sit here and act like it isn\u2019t the fault of the people who brought them across the border.\u201dHe wrote that the vigil-keepers lacked sympathy for American citizens. \u201cWhat about the ones living in Mount Pleasant who couldn\u2019t find a job because they were employing illegal immigrants instead?\u201dThe view that immigrants take jobs from citizens or depress wages was a common one, but it was disputed by local business owners. The unemployment rate in Henry County is 2.9 percent, and many factories display \u201cHiring\u201d signs.Gary Crawford, who owns Mt. Pleasant Tire (\u201cWe keep you rolling\u201d), said he paid tire installers $16 to $24 an hour, with full benefits. \u201cI know most of the people who run the factories,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just can\u2019t find help.\u201dMr. Crawford belongs to St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, and on the Sunday after the ICE raid, he heard Father Paul Connolly, with the detained men in mind, devote his homily to the Good Samaritan, the exemplar of caring for strangers. \u201cAll of us were immigrants at one time,\u201d the priest said.A few days after the church meeting, Angel King, the custodian\u2019s 17-year-old granddaughter, who also helps with the church cleaning, was Windexing the glass doors to the sanctuary.She said classmates had started calling her \u201ca mini-Donald Trump\u201d for taking the side of the ICE agents in the raid. The law is the law, she said, and undocumented workers had broken it. \u201cThey should go back, and if they really want to come back bad enough, they should go through the process legally,\u201d she said.Nor did she have much sympathy for families separated by the raids. \u201cFamilies are torn apart every day,\u201d Angel said. She spoke from experience: When she was a young girl, her father went to prison on a drug charge, she said.She will study criminal justice in the fall at Southeastern Community College, hoping to become a probation officer. One of her classmates at the college will be Juana Barrios, 19, whose father, Oscar Barrios, was detained at the concrete plant.Ms. Barrios said her parents brought her to Iowa illegally from Mexico when she was 3. She is enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the Trump administration has rescinded, and is studying to be a nurse.\u201cThey say go back and come here legally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. Most of us don\u2019t have money. Most of us are denied.\u201dMs. Barrios recalled how she had once made a speech at the Catholic Church, naming her father as her inspiration: \u201cI told him, Dad, I\u2019m going to be the best nurse. I\u2019m going to graduate with the best grades. That\u2019s the only way I can think of to repay everything they\u2019ve done for me \u2014 to be successful, and make their dream in my future.\u201dHer father was released on bond in early June to await a deportation hearing in immigration court, which has a five-year backlog of such cases, according to Bram Elias, a law professor at the University of Iowa. \u201cBy doing this raid,\u201d he said, \u201cthe federal government has turned two dozen folks who were undocumented and living in the shadows into people definitely safe from deportation for five years, and possibly able to work lawfully.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a man who criticized undocumented immigrants and their supporters in a Facebook post. He is Garrett Carlston, not Garret.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stuff That Helps Leeches Get Their Fill of Blood", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers examined the arsenal of anticoagulants used by marine leeches to feed on turtles, fish and even sharks.You might think you know leeches: Go for a swim in the wrong shallow lake, and you\u2019ll emerge covered in sleek black bloodsuckers that have decided you\u2019re their next meal.But inside a leech, fascinating things are happening. The slimy creatures manufacture a wide portfolio of substances that help keep blood flowing once they\u2019ve attached themselves to a host. They don\u2019t just latch on to you \u2014 they pump out anticoagulants that prevent the wounds they create from clotting too quickly. How else are they going to get their fill?And once they\u2019ve sucked your blood \u2014 they can consume many times their own body weight in one sitting, or rather, sucking \u2014 they\u2019re not done. Leeches must also keep the blood from solidifying in their own digestive tract long after they\u2019ve let go of their host. The researchers collected the leeches\u2019 salivary organs and looked to see what genes were active, and compared the sequences to a database of known anticoagulants to make their identifications. In each of the species they looked at, they found an average of 43 different genes for anticoagulant substances at work. They were surprised to find that despite the leeches\u2019 differing taste in hosts, they made many of the same anticoagulants. The team had thought that perhaps leeches feeding on turtles and sharks would be very different, Dr. Tessler said, but that was not the case.One substance, called destabilase, particularly intrigued the researchers because it is also common in the jawed leeches, which are a more recently evolved group. \u201cWhen they bite you, they kind of saw at you,\u201d explained Dr. Tessler. \u201cBut the marine leeches feed with a proboscis.\u201d The fact that both of these branches have the substance helps support the idea that eating blood is an ancient feature of leeches rather than a new development. This is a more controversial point than you might think. Many leech species do not suck blood, but instead live on the bodily fluids of snails or other invertebrates. Others eat earthworms, swallowing them whole. Whether these groups lost the ability to eat blood, or others gained it, is a subject of continuing research, on which tracing anticoagulants may shed new light. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the National \u2018Mood\u2019 the One in Polls or the One Online?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIn psychological terms, \u201cmood\u201d is a weather report for your personal emotions, a measure of balmy good cheer or dreary storms. But our emotions, naturally, are influenced by the same winds of change that blow on every other person\u2019s. Certain clouds gather over all our heads \u2014 the hardships of a war, or a sudden economic downturn \u2014 and dump the same cold rain on everyone. Other days we bear witness to an unexpected act of heroism or a rousing international sports triumph and bask in the same sun. Psychologists have suggested for years that moods are actually contagious, meaning yours are just one part of a vast, dynamic system: We take in what those around us say, absorb the sentiments behind those words and slowly begin mirroring those feelings with our own.The idea of scientifically measuring such moods traces back at least as far as the 1930s, when George Gallup, the man who would one day be described by Time magazine as the \u201cBabe Ruth of the polling profession,\u201d founded the American Institute of Public Opinion and committed himself to collecting accurate data on the whole nation\u2019s sensibilities, unskewed by the ulterior motives of political parties or interest groups. The institute correctly predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would defeat the Republican challenger Alfred Landon in the 1936 presidential election; just two years after that, it had already begun conducting market research for studios in Hollywood. A new industry \u2014 public-opinion data as a valuable commodity, an advance warning of which way the country\u2019s emotional winds were blowing \u2014 was off and running.It\u2019s the job of politicians and the media\u2019s pundit class to utilize such numbers in the service of advocating and implementing public policy. A Quinnipiac poll in June showed that the family separations stemming from President Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy were so resoundingly opposed that, according to NBC News, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take a political scientist to read the current public mood on the topic.\u201d Sometimes hard numbers aren\u2019t even necessary; sheer political instinct will do. John Podhoretz of Commentary, assessing whether Republicans have a chance of holding their congressional advantages in the coming midterms, concluded, without citing any polling data, that voters \u201cwill probably be in a much better mood than previous midterm electorates\u201d because of the improving economy.Whether based on data or on intuition, all these divinations of the national mood are rooted in the idea that the most important parts of our emotional weather are happening outside us as individuals, over our collective heads. We\u2019ll act and think as a kind of hive mind, driving markets and electing officials and erupting in anger en masse, always gathering up into some kind of aggregate emotional register.In January, Ryan Cummings, then an eighth grader in North Carolina, participated in a cheerleading competition with a group called Cheer Extreme Allstars. At the beginning of her group\u2019s routine, she struck a defiant pose: Her head was cocked, her steely eyes stared unblinkingly forward and her lips were tightly pursed, forming an expression set somewhere between a smirk and a sneer \u2014 the sort of withering glare that adults secretly fear whenever walking past a pack of contemptuous teenagers on the street. (\u201cWhen I made that face,\u201d Cummings would later tell BuzzFeed, \u201cI was just thinking, I really want my team to kill it.\u201d) It\u2019s very unlikely that anyone outside Cheer Extreme Allstars\u2019 immediate sphere would be aware of that face were it not for a single Twitter account, which plucked, from a nearly six-minute YouTube video of the routine, a five-second clip of Cummings and captioned it with two simple words: \u201cbig mood.\u201d The resulting tweet has since been liked more than 164,000 times.It\u2019s that viral tweet about the young cheerleader, though, that has been credited by internet-culture sites like The Daily Dot with finally bringing \u201cbig mood\u201d to its mainstream saturation point, making the phrase fair game for use by established media, moderately hip parents and corporate brands. Cummings is a big reason you may have noticed a lot more things being categorized as big moods lately: Blake Lively\u2019s testy encounter with photographers at the Met Gala (as described by E! News), or a Japanese animated series on Netflix (as described by Elle), or a video of two lynxes yelling at each other (as described by Vice), or an important win by the Boston Red Sox (as described by the Boston Red Sox). Nothing is so small or inconsequential that it can\u2019t inspire the internet\u2019s outsize passions.We would rather our moods be big in this figurative sense (rich, vibrant, specific, intensely personal) than the literal one (collective, shared, part of a system that acts upon us). Social media emboldens this feeling of specialness. Who else but you would think to sum up a personal mood with, say, a photo of an exhausted squirrel, splayed out on a railing outside an office window? But of course hundreds of people recently favorited a tweet doing exactly that, offering replies like \u201csame\u201d and \u201cshe is me and I is her.\u201dThere\u2019s no avoiding these emotional contagions. Being inundated with so many moods can affect how we see everything around us, unleashing complex waves of uplift or tumult. If you scan social media these days, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the overriding sentiments \u2014 the inescapable moods that hang over all our heads like stagnant humidity \u2014 are those of annoyance, consternation and abstract misery. Not just about the day\u2019s news or the latest grand controversy, but about everything, in general. These feelings can feed into one another, influencing the collective mood as profoundly, and maybe as adversely, as world-historic news events and natural disasters and national humiliations. Take a step back, and you see something like a rat-king of feeling, the biggest mood of all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A President With No Shame and a Party With No Guts", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s become a huge source of power for Trump and trouble for the rest of us.Opinion ColumnistIf your puppy makes a mess on your carpet and you shout \u201cBad dog,\u201d there is a good chance that that puppy\u2019s ears will droop, his head will bow and he may even whimper. In other words, even a puppy acts ashamed when caught misbehaving. That is not true of Donald Trump. Day in and day out, he proves to us that he has no shame. We\u2019ve never had a president with no shame \u2014 and it\u2019s become a huge source of power for him and trouble for us.When a president with no shame is backed by a party with no spine and a network with no integrity, you have two big problems. First, there is no one inside his party or base who is going to sustainably stop Trump from being himself and doing whatever he bloody pleases. The Republican Party has completely lost its way. Don\u2019t be fooled by the last-second tut-tutting of G.O.P. senators about Trump\u2019s kowtowing to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and spurning of our intelligence agencies. Until and unless the G.O.P.-led Congress passes legislation that protects special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by Trump or enacts into law specific, deeper sanctions on Russia if it is ever again caught trying to tilt our elections \u2014 or secures Trump\u2019s tax returns or the transcript of his two hours and 10 minutes of private conversation with Putin \u2014 it\u2019s all just talk to cover the G.O.P.\u2019s behind. Let the Republicans in Congress do something hard and concrete that shows they love our country more than they fear Trump\u2019s base and I will believe their words. The fact that Trump\u2019s party and his network always look for ways to excuse him has been hugely liberating for Trump. He can actually deny he said things that were recorded \u2014 like his trashing of the British prime minister. He can take one side of any issue (like trashing key NATO allies to satisfy his base) and, when he gets blowback, take the other side (claim to love the Atlantic alliance). And he can declare that he really meant to ask why \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d Russia be the one hacking us instead of why \u201cwould\u201d it, as he did say. If you believe that last one, I have a bridge near the Kremlin I\u2019d love to sell you.For instance, Trump is right: We do need to confront China on its trade restrictions, forced technology transfers and nonreciprocal trade arrangements. But then, look at the madness to his methods. How would you try to influence China on trade if you were thinking strategically?For starters, you\u2019d sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, creating a free-trade alliance around American values, standards and interests, with 11 other Pacific economies, creating a trade agreement covering 40 percent of global G.D.P. Then you\u2019d forgo ridiculous steel and aluminum tariffs on our European Union allies and sign them all up instead to join us in our efforts to curb China\u2019s trade abuses, which the E.U. suffers from just as much as we do.  Then you\u2019d go to the Chinese and say: \u201cLet\u2019s have secret negotiations \u2014 no one will lose face, we will present it publicly as win-win \u2014 but, just so you know, we will be coming at you with a Euro-Pacific coalition of all your major trading partners and we will be focused on eliminating all your cheating on W.T.O. rules and nonreciprocal trade shenanigans once and for all.\u201dNow that would get the attention of China \u2014 not a foolish trade war based on bilateral trade deficits. But what did Trump do with his method? Blow up TPP, blow up relations with the E.U. and confront China alone \u2014 an utterly mad method that I do not believe will produce the meaningful, sustainable trade realignment with China that we need.And then there is the sheer madness. Threatening the U.K. that if it doesn\u2019t do a full Brexit it will not get preferential trade treatment from Trump, calling the bloc a \u201cfoe\u201d on trade, and sneering at the number of refugees it has admitted.Where do you start? The E.U. is the United States of Europe \u2014 the other great center in the world of free markets, free people, liberty and democracy. It has kept the peace in Europe after a century of strife there \u2014 that dragged us into two world wars \u2014 and its economic growth as a trading partner has made both America and the E.U. steadily richer and more stable. It is sheer madness to believe that it is in U.S. interests to see the European Union fracture! Ask any senior U.S. military officer and you\u2019ll be told that our greatest strategic competitive advantage is that we have a network of allies, like the E.U., and the Russians and Chinese do not. They only have customers and vassals. Why would we give that up for closer ties to Putin?Also, speaking of sheer madness, so much of the immigration that has swamped Europe of late has come from migrants from Syria and sub-Saharan Africa. Both migrations are the product of political turmoil fed by climate change, the collapse of small-scale agriculture and rapid population growth in the Middle East and Africa. (Ditto Central America.) And what is Trump\u2019s policy? Trash all global efforts to mitigate climate change, ban all U.S. government support for family planning overseas \u2014 and get out of Syria, rather than use our leverage there to try to stabilize its refugee flow. The only way to change this situation is not by hoping that the president develops some shame or that this version of the G.O.P. develops some spine. It is by Democrats winning the House, the Senate or both in the midterm elections. Only by dealing an electoral defeat to this version of the G.O.P. in the midterms will we possibly get a healthy conservative party again (which we need) and curb Trump\u2019s power. Everything else is just words \u2014 and words without power change nothing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is a \u2018Shadow Ban,\u2019 and Is Twitter Doing It to Republican Accounts? ", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn accusation that Twitter was suppressing conservative political views drew the attention of President Trump. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on.When President Trump accused Twitter of \u201cshadow banning\u201d Republicans in a tweet on Thursday morning, it was the latest salvo in a long-running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views. Twitter \u201cSHADOW BANNING\u201d prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.When a person is shadow banned, their posts on a platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves. Their experience using a site may not change \u2014 they feel like they are still posting normally \u2014 but other people cannot see the material they produce, said Monica Stephens, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies social media.\u201cShadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down, and that often has to do with, particularly, the content that you are posting,\u201d Ms. Stephens said. \u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t violate the terms of service, but they make it so other people can\u2019t see that content.\u201dNo, it is not. Vice claimed that Twitter was shadow banning some Republicans because their accounts \u201cno longer appear in the auto-populated drop-down search box.\u201d The profiles appear when conducting a full search, the article noted, but not in the \u201cmore convenient and visible drop-down bar.\u201dBasically, you could still search for the accounts, but Twitter would not automatically suggest them. But that is not what shadow banning means \u2014 or meant before this week \u2014 and on Wednesday and Thursday, the internet engaged in a real-time debate over its definition. In a statement, Twitter flatly rejected the claim made by Vice: \u201cAs we have said before, we do not \u2018shadowban.\u2019\u201dKevin Collier, a tech writer at BuzzFeed News, marveled at the misuse of the phrase by both Vice News and the president. A spokesman for Vice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Thursday.The Republicans mentioned by Vice News included Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican Party; Representatives Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz; and Andrew Surabian, a spokesman for Donald Trump Jr., who does not hold a position within the party. After the story was published, many Republicans said they felt vindicated by its claims.In short, their Twitter accounts remain highly visible. \u201cThat is not at all shadow banning,\u201d Ms. Stephens said. \u201cThis all goes back to a lot of people not understanding how the social media they interact with works.\u201dThat is the evergreen question of life on the internet. It is true that the names of some Republican officials are not auto-generating in Twitter\u2019s drop-down search bar. Twitter has said it is aware of this situation and it trying to fix it.\u201cThe profiles, Tweets and discussions about these accounts do appear when you search for them,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTo be clear, our behavioral ranking doesn\u2019t make judgments based on political views or the substance of Tweets.\u201dWhat does that mean? Well, as even the most casual Twitter user may be aware, the site has a problem with people on it saying and doing terrible things, from Russian election hackers to the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. And on Thursday morning, Vice News updated its original story and headline with a statement saying, \u201cTwitter appears to have adjusted its platform overnight to no longer limit the visibility of some prominent Republicans in its search results.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sting", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Ohio man who had expressed support for Al Qaeda and a desire to kill American soldiers and told an undercover agent that he wanted to attack a Fourth of July parade in Cleveland was arrested on Sunday, the authorities said.F.B.I. agents began investigating the man, Demetrius N. Pitts, 48, more than a year ago, after they discovered messages he sent on Facebook espousing anti-American views and a belief that Muslims \u201cshould always be prepared to fight.\u201d But his desire for an attack became more clear during conversations in recent weeks with the undercover agent, federal officials said in an announcement on Monday.Mr. Pitts told the agent, who was posing as an Al Qaeda sympathizer, that he wanted to set off bombs and launch attacks in multiple cities across the United States, starting with Cleveland on Independence Day, the authorities said. It\u2019s unclear, however, if he had the capability of acting on his plans, the F.B.I. added.\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out something that would shake them up on the Fourth of July,\u201d Mr. Pitts said at a June 22 meeting with the undercover agent, according to a copy of a federal criminal complaint.Mr. Pitts was arrested Sunday morning when he met again with the agent in hopes of planning for a car-bomb attack in Cleveland with help from Al Qaeda. He was charged with one count of attempting to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, which carries a 20-year prison sentence if convicted.Stephen Anthony, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s Cleveland field office, praised the work of the local police and federal agents in the investigation.\u201cLaw enforcement cannot sit back and wait for Mr. Pitts to commit a violent attack,\u201d Mr. Anthony said at a news conference Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of hoping an individual decides not to harm someone or get others to act.\u201dMr. Anthony said that the investigation into Mr. Pitts, a United States citizen who also used the names Abdur Raheem Rahfeeq and Salahadeen Osama Waleed, started with the bureau\u2019s office in Cincinnati, where Mr. Pitts used to live. Federal agents in Cleveland took over the case recently when Mr. Pitts moved to the nearby city of Maple Heights.The F.B.I. first became aware of Mr. Pitts in December 2015 when, the authorities said, he sent a message on Facebook using the name Abdur Raheem Rahfeeq to an obscure California talk show, saying, \u201cThe USA will be destroy. Allahu Akbar.\u201dThe undercover F.B.I. agent was introduced to Mr. Pitts this year after he \u201cexpressed a desire to meet with an Al Qaeda \u2018brother,\u2019\u201d according to the criminal complaint. The agent and Mr. Pitts first met on June 15, and they discussed possible attacks and methods in a series of meetings that followed.\u201cPut bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb \u2014 anywhere you want around here, and level stuff around here,\u201d Mr. Pitts said while discussing a hypothetical attack on military bases with the agent, according to court records. \u201cI mean, just like how the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor.\u201dIt was not clear whether Mr. Pitt was being represented by a lawyer. Relatives for Mr. Pitt could not be reached for comment.While Mr. Pitts expressed a desire to launch an attack, according to the F.B.I., it was not clear whether he had the ability, resources or expertise to carry one out. In his conversations with the undercover officer, Mr. Pitts rambled, often incoherently, about seemingly improbable ways that he could hurt people, according to transcripts included in the criminal complaint.He said he could chop up people with a machete and send their parts to a hog farm for pigs to eat. He said he could behead soldiers and toss their heads in front of military bases, forcing every base in America to shut down until the \u201cheads stop spinning.\u201dMr. Pitts also mentioned the possibility of hiding explosives in pipes under homes, placing explosives in chicken eggs for an attack in Philadelphia, and strapping bombs to toy cars that could be given as gifts to the children of military members at the Independence Day parade in Cleveland.But Mr. Pitts also said he had limitations. According to court records, he told the undercover agent that he would have difficulty buying vehicles for a car-bomb attack because he would need to show a driver\u2019s license.Mr. Anthony said that the F.B.I. had \u201cno information\u201d that Mr. Pitts had traveled overseas to meet with Al Qaeda or that he had access to explosives or weapons. \u201cHis precise ability to do specific things, again, we may never know,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fires in Greece", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScores of people dying needlessly on the outskirts of Athens looks more like carelessness than fate. Mr. Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.MATI, Greece \u2014 Four days after the wildfire that raced down from the mountains, incinerating all before it, cars were once again tangled up in traffic jams in this seaside resort\u2019s narrow streets. Search parties combed ruined homes for bodies; volunteers sought out injured and frightened pets. The nation was in mourning, shocked by the magnitude of the disaster, shaken by the stories of victims and the missing. In a V-shaped bend where on Monday desperate residents and visitors found themselves trapped, unable to escape the heat that melted even the metal of their cars, vehicles carrying survivors who had returned to salvage some possessions, volunteers, journalists and the simply curious edged carefully past one another as they sought a way out of Mati. The only reason they did not run the risk of being burned alive was that pretty much anything in the vicinity that could burn had already burned \u2014 pine trees, houses, people, pets and cars \u2014 even a wooden umbrella on a beach where people had fled into the water. Black dust and liquefied aluminum lay on the road when the incinerated hulks were removed.By Friday, the death toll had reached 87, with scores still missing. It was unclear how many of the bodies had been identified, a daunting task because of the intense heat most had been exposed to. The high death toll could be attributed to reasons ranging from the labyrinthine roads to the hurricane-force gusts of wind. The fire department tried to contain the blaze when it broke out on Mount Pentelikon, famed for its pure white marble and pine forests. Thirty-nine firefighting vehicles and four water-dumping aircraft were deployed at the start, on a day on which 47 forest fires broke out. But less than 90 minutes later, Mati (which translates as \u201cEye\u201d) had been all but wiped out. The swift wind had spared some buildings while gutting others.Officials claim, justifiably, that the ferocity of the fire made their task impossible, laying waste to any civil defense planning. What they do not explain, however, is why there did not seem to be any credible plan to deal with Mati\u2019s specific difficulties. People were not warned to evacuate, nor were they informed which way they ought to head; paths leading to the sea were not clearly marked. Why was the chaotic street plan not corrected in the past, especially as Mati is a popular resort about 25 miles from Athens and has experienced a building boom in recent years? Unlike the government civil defense authorities, Athens Municipality carried out the successful evacuation of 620 children from a summer camp at Agios Andreas, next to Mati, after learning that a fire had broken out on Mount Pentelikon. The flames were barely out when the magnitude of the disaster began to emerge, with the number of fatalities rising daily, passing even the record of major fires in the Peloponnese peninsula in August 2007. After each disaster, opposition parties accuse governments of incompetence, something that today\u2019s ruling party, the radical left Syriza, did at the expense of the conservative New Democracy party in 2007. Now New Democracy officials are calling for government resignations, prompting heated clashes in the news media and on social media. What neither government nor opposition parties acknowledge, however, is that many communities across the country may be death traps, wherever homes are built without permits, with town planners trying to catch up later. Instead of being demolished, illegal buildings are usually accommodated by law, as politicians fear losing votes by destroying people\u2019s homes. This, though, was not the case in 2007, when most victims died on forest roads, not in an urban maze, as they tried to escape fires near their villages. Some suggest that the past eight years of austerity have undermined Greece\u2019s firefighting capacity, yet firefighters and pilots of water-dumping planes carry out heroic missions each summer. The problem lies in the lack of effective planning. Mati is not a community of illegal buildings \u2014 it is an established, up-market area with a vibrant volunteer ethos. The resort\u2019s safety could have been a priority if government officials had pushed for this rather than letting problems fester. Among the ashes on street corners, there is fresh water and food for dogs and cats. I saw a young man and woman walking with a bag of food and a cat basket; I offered some money to help them buy more food. \u201cNo, thanks, we have more than enough,\u201d the man said. Veterinary surgeons were treating stray and wounded animals for free, he added. Cyprus, Spain and Bulgaria immediately offered aircraft, firefighters, medics and vehicles through the European Union\u2019s Civil Protection Mechanism. Several foreign leaders called their Greek counterparts to express sympathy. Friends and colleagues who had not been in touch for months or years sent messages of concern to their Greek friends. Clearly, with climate change and with urban areas expanding into dangerous terrain \u2014 in forests and on coastlines \u2014 more and more people will find themselves in harm\u2019s way. But scores of people dying needlessly on the outskirts of a European capital looks more like carelessness than fate. It was here that Lord Byron, who was to die in Greece\u2019s war of independence, looked on the nearby plain of Marathon and dreamed that \u201cGreece might still be free.\u201d Neither sorrow, nor solidarity, nor political bickering should obscure the need to free people from the fear of their homes, roads and beach resorts becoming death traps. At Mati, something better will be built on the ashes. It is imperative that this is done wherever necessary, before Greece is again plunged into mourning. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Please Take My Son\u2019s Wallet", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA life cut short is revealed through reward cards, drink coupons and arcade passes.I know what\u2019s inside: three $100 bills and another $140 in twenties and tens. I sometimes got on his case for carrying so much money. He thought my concerns were overblown, even when one of the bar-based poker games he frequented in Madison, Wis., got held up at gunpoint. (He was thankfully not playing that night.)My wife and I agreed that he had the risk profile of a teenager \u2014 that his frontal cortex wiring was only slowly catching up with his 26 years.Inside with the cash is his first and only credit card, a Visa from our local bank. I have already sent in a request to have it canceled. Underneath the credit card is his insurance card from work, probably still marked with the fingerprints of the emergency room staffer who needed it.Underneath are four expired insurance cards along with his Delta Dental card. We never did convince him that flossing was a good idea, and our strident advice about being able to keep his teeth into old age now just echoes cruelly.In the front pocket is a multipass from Geeks Mania Arcade, where the owners recently shifted from plugging quarters to a 24-hour, play-as-much-as-you-want $15 admission. Zach was not a fan. For $15 in quarters he could play his favorite pinball machines for weeks. He was something of a pinball wizard, traveling for tournaments. On family pizza outings he often would leave behind machines racked with free games.Behind the arcade pass is a free cocktail card from the local bowling alley. He regularly won such prizes at the monthly pinball tournament held there. A nondrinker, he would give them to me to pass along to his old high school tennis coach, who loves to sip cocktails at the bowling alley bar.As a lifelong tennis player and a former club professional, I thought tennis was one of the gifts I could competently pass to my two boys. Like a lot of younger brothers, Zach would tag along when I tutored his older brother. Eager to prove himself worthy of similar attention, Zach would take a hopper of balls to the next court and patiently drop and hit them over the net, retrieve and repeat, for the entire hour.When his brother started playing tennis in local tournaments, Zach was all over me for permission to do likewise. He was tiny for his age and deeply unathletic in a traditional sense, outpaced by his peers in soccer and towered over in basketball. When he was 8, I told him he could enter tournaments when he could reliably serve, a task that seemed to ensure at least a two-year deferral.He dragged a bucket to the local courts and worked endlessly until I had to admit he had met the mark. He played his first 10-and-under tournament an hour south of Madison in Janesville. He didn\u2019t win a game but was ecstatic. There is now a shelf full of tennis trophies in his bedroom, which I guess we\u2019ll leave there. What else would we do with them?Behind the free cocktail card is a gift card to the local movie theater, given by his mother on his birthday months earlier, which he had yet to exhaust. Like most young men, he preferred action movies to slice-of-life dramas. He liked to quote from movies and expected you to immediately recognize the tag lines.Then there\u2019s the AAA membership card we had bought for him, never imagining that the only towing his car would undergo was courtesy of the local police department, who impounded it in accord with the procedural requirements of a fatal accident. He looks so young in his Wisconsin license picture, taken in 2010, when he was 19. Blue eyes, blond hair (thanks, Mom) and 5 feet 4 inches tall (sorry, Dad).The membership was set to expire in December. On my calendar, I still have a reminder to renew. An even younger picture appears on his scratched University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Blugold Visa debit card, which I can\u2019t imagine ever having had a balance since he graduated with an economics degree in 2014. Next to this is a worn BART transit card from the week he flew to San Francisco to visit his brother. (He missed the stop and ended up in Oakland, but they soon connected and we chalked it up to life experience.)On the left side of the wallet is a series of reward cards: a Magical Movie Rewards card I imagine to be some sort of frequent user benefit and a Fire Keeper\u2019s Club card from the Potawatomi Hotel and Casino in Milwaukee. He would occasionally drive there for a Saturday session or for tournaments; he played enough to get free nights.After Zach graduated from college, the local, slots-only casino opened an electronic poker room and he became a regular. I dropped in once to see what this was all about, and the poker room manager chatted me up after I introduced myself.\u201cOh, Zach is one of the big winners,\u201d he said, punching up his balance. He couldn\u2019t share the data with me but added with a sly smile: \u201cIf he needs a new car, he\u2019s good.\u201dMy wife and I were relieved when that poker room shut down and Zach began to apply himself to career planning, passing the first two four-hour actuary tests. The only personal object his work supervisor returned to us after his accident was his study binder for the third actuary test. Perhaps this math reminded him of school, because he went through the screening and became a regular volunteer math tutor at his former high school.Next in the wallet is a Total Rewards World Series of Poker card from Caesars Palace and a similar one from Boyd and MGM. Last summer he and his brother went to Las Vegas and played one of the side events in the World Series of Poker.Zach had been an inveterate game player since his endless demands for another round of Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders. At 5 (with the stature of a 3-year-old), he once dazzled a group of adult spectators by zipping through levels of the Oregon Trail at the demo station at our local Best Buy.It was early in the morning of Sunday, April 22, that my wife and I received Zach\u2019s wallet from the emergency room at University Hospital in a plastic bag along with a pocketful of change and the clicker to his car. We had arranged for him to begin driving my 2009 Mazda after a long battle to persuade him that the 1997 Camry, which had belonged to his grandmother, was no longer safe or reliable.We were convinced he would be better off with roof airbags and side curtains. He protested, claiming he could drive the old Camry for another 100,000 miles, and he was probably right. We arranged for him to pay me $4,000 for the car, something of a bargain in Blue Book terms.I didn\u2019t reveal how I had simply sent this money into a Roth I.R.A. in his name, also the destination for the monthly rent he had been paying us since college, when he moved back home to live with us. We wanted him to have a head start on a fruitful retirement.He had been driving my Mazda for about a month and maybe wasn\u2019t comfortable with it yet. Maybe my obsession with avoiding scratches and door dings had permeated his subconscious. Late on Saturday night, after playing in a poker tournament at one of the local bowling alleys, he had stopped and stepped out of the running car to get directions from a friend to another game.For some reason \u2014 for some stupid, sloppy moment \u2014 he left the car in neutral instead of park, and it began to roll down the slope toward the back wall of the bowling alley. With quickness that belied him on the tennis court, he dashed behind the car to try to stop its momentum, to keep my pristine car scratch free.Instead, the car backed him against the wall and crushed him.In my occasional thoughts about my own mortality, I have envisioned scenarios of my sons going through my things: tossing my files into the recycling bin, sending my books to a bookseller, laughing at my lifetime habit of stuffing receipts into drawers.Now, for me, that order has been perversely inverted. I\u2019m looking at my son\u2019s wallet. I know what\u2019s inside. I hope someone will come and take it away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andy Murray Pulls Out of Wimbledon", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 The two-time champion Andy Murray withdrew from Wimbledon on Sunday, the eve of this year\u2019s tournament, citing a persistent hip injury.The daunting nature of best-of-five matches, which the men play at Grand Slam events, probably has been a factor in the greater number of withdrawals from the men\u2019s side of recent major tournaments. (Also a factor: a new rule that allows injured players to earn 50 percent of the first-round prize money at Grand Slam tournaments if they withdraw before their first match.)His comeback has had several false starts. Murray traveled to New York and Melbourne, Australia, in the hopes of playing Grand Slam events there, but did not compete in either.Murray then took a wild card into another grass court tournament the following week in Eastbourne, England. He handily won his first match over Stan Wawrinka before losing to No. 18 Kyle Edmund, now the highest-ranked British man, 6-4, 6-4.Murray had been scheduled to face 48th-ranked Beno\u00eet Paire in the first round of Wimbledon on Tuesday.Paire was the last player Murray beat before his extended absence, in the fourth round of Wimbledon last year.\u201cI\u2019m sad for him, because he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Paire said. \u201cI hope for him his recovery will be good for the next tournaments. For me, he\u2019s one of the most important players on the tour.\u201dMurray had sounded a generally positive note about his participation at Wimbledon at a news conference on Saturday, saying he planned to play unless \u201cI wake up and don\u2019t feel good.\u201d Still, he said, returning so soon to the most taxing level of competition was not ideal.\u201cIn other sports when you come back, you don\u2019t tend to come back and be competing against the best in the world immediately, like, for five sets or three sets, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would build up a little bit, play 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and so on.\u201dMurray said he would start practicing on hard courts on Monday. His next scheduled tournament is the Citi Open in Washington, which begins July 30.The wave of withdrawals in men\u2019s tennis has led to a spate of records involving so-called lucky losers, players who lose in the final round of qualifying but still earn a spot in the main draw. Peter Polansky will set an Open era record by making his third consecutive Grand Slam appearance as a lucky loser; Simone Bolelli will set the record for most career lucky loser appearances at a major, with five.Murray\u2019s spot in the first round against Paire went to 154th-ranked Jason Jung, who is in the main draw of a Grand Slam event for the first time. Jung, a 29-year-old Californian, played for the University of Michigan and now represents Taiwan.Jung, who lost in the final round of qualifying on Thursday, said that he had his hopes of reaching the main draw buoyed by the unusual number of withdrawals from the French Open.\u201cSince I was already in London, I thought I might as well stick around in case anything happens,\u201d Jung said. \u201cJust give myself a chance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren\u2019t interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration \u2014 Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks \u2014 might not be doomed, but it isn\u2019t exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn\u2019t the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they\u2019re at war with one another.Mr. Mangieri is a purist\u2019s purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza.He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered.Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue.The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don\u2019t remember the imported buffalo mozzarella\u2019s giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce \u2014 pulp, really \u2014 always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it\u2019s almost hypnotic.The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it\u2019s great.The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri\u2019s strict principles. It\u2019s a personal creed that achieves transcendence \u2014 his \u201cMy Way,\u201d to put it in New Jersey terms.I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt.Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it\u2019s hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri\u2019s pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn\u2019t. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it\u2019s not the point of view of a pizzeria.Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you\u2019re getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable.What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you.There\u2019s a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment.The other desserts I tried \u2014 a bittersweet tiramis\u00f9 with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed \u2014 won me over from the beginning.None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form \u2014 a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo \u2014 that can\u2019t help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard.The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can\u2019t tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server\u2019s offer of assistance, you\u2019ll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine.Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I\u2019ve never met them and if I do, I\u2019m sending them off to be deprogrammed.Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don\u2019t taste especially good with any pizza) \u2014 all this slows down the pace, which isn\u2019t especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town.Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren\u2019t doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they\u2019re doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn\u2019t need to be predictable. But it could be more intuitive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Online Hobbyists Can Reaffirm Your Faith in the Internet", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTo me, a serial hobbyist who has been looking for a saner balance with tech, all this sounded wonderful. In January, I began taking a weekly pottery class at a local arts school. I\u2019m still a novice ceramist at best, but every week, bowl by bowl, I get a little better.There\u2019s something else that has been magical about the experience. Although I took up pottery to go offline, it has driven something surprising for me online: It helped restore my faith in the possibilities and the basic humanity of the internet. Pottery has helped me find a saner, friendlier corner of the internet than the social-networking feeds we are addicted to, one that isn\u2019t completely obsessed with Donald J. Trump, where you get ahead not through pointed, viral quips but through collaboration, persistence and shared ingenuity.I speak of the hobbyist internet. These days, any pastime worth pursuing \u2014 pottery, cooking, gardening, quilting, woodworking and beyond \u2014 attracts a constellation of blogs, message boards, Facebook groups, Amazon reviewers, Instagram and Etsy influencers, and many hundreds of YouTube stars. Collectively, they form the online social structure around any hobby, a group of folks who are only too happy to help you learn whatever you are trying to master.But on the hobbyist internet, the opposite applies.Consider how one gets started with pottery. To make a pot on a potter\u2019s wheel, you must first manipulate your ball of clay so that its center of mass matches the rotational center of the spinning wheel. This goal \u2014 \u201ccentering,\u201d in the jargon \u2014 sounds simple, but figuring out how to do it is a subtle process of trial and error, and there is really only one way to get it right: to try again and again until it clicks.Three months ago, I was stuck in centering hell. I would spend most of my time at the wheel trying to center, but with only two hours a week in class, I was not making much progress. Then I discovered a way to supercharge my training: YouTube, where thousands of ceramists from around the world post videos of themselves making pots.They were revelatory. From the videos, I learned there was no one way to center \u2014 that different potters had developed different techniques and that, by watching closely, I could ape the styles that worked best for me. The videos were no substitute for actual practice, but they were a kind of catalyst. One night a few weeks ago, I spent an hour watching dozens of centering videos. Later, at the wheel, I had a breakthrough; because I had absorbed the online potters\u2019 tricks, centering had clicked for me.While much of this is not new, the way the internet can help steer us toward something useful bears mentioning in a time of growing digital skepticism. It is a reminder that the internet\u2019s most effective trick is connecting disparate individuals into a coherent whole. There are only a small number of potters in any given city, but online there is a whole ceramics metropolis willing to help.This sort of hobbyist collective builds on itself. It lets people new to the hobby pick up the basics \u2014 but by creating new markets for content and equipment, and connecting every hobbyist who has discovered something new to an audience eager to learn every trick, it heightens the experience for people at every level.\u201cThere\u2019s no way anyone would have published that in print,\u201d he said.Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt said the internet still played a key part in expanding his cooking skills. If he is working on a dish from another country, especially one he has not visited, he will often hit YouTube first.\u201cI watch lots of videos of people cooking with their grandmother,\u201d he said.And not just cooking. After moving into a new house that needed remodeling, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt spent the last few months teaching himself a new skill, woodworking, almost entirely from watching YouTube videos. He and his wife have since altered much of their home, raising walls, putting up crown molding and building a laundry room and bathroom from scratch \u2014 including a linen closet with drawers.In some respects, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s experience with woodworking sounds unsurprising: Of course, if you put your mind to it, you can learn something new online.Yet it is rare to hear about the internet\u2019s leading to productive ends anymore. In this era of fakery and propaganda, where everything you encounter online comes to you through a partisan fog, it can sometimes seem as if all that\u2019s connected to the internet turns sour. The beauty of the hobbyist internet is not that it is free of partisan fighting, but that the fighting rarely takes center stage, because everyone is there to get something else done.\u201cI often find it\u2019s a more productive conversation when we\u2019re doing art,\u201d said Leah Kohlenberg, a painter and art teacher who lives in Portland, Ore., and has a thriving business teaching drawing to adults and teenagers around the world over Skype.Ms. Kohlenberg is a liberal who does not support Mr. Trump. \u201cI do have Trump supporters I teach, but when we\u2019re making something, because you\u2019re in the middle of doing it, we\u2019re all focused on something else,\u201d she said.And when people reach artistic breakthroughs together, differences begin to feel minor.\u201cArt is an empowering thing,\u201d Ms. Kohlenberg said. \u201cMost people think they can\u2019t do it, and when they realize they can, it\u2019s amazing \u2014 it opens up a whole new world, and that world doesn\u2019t really have time for a lot of fighting and fussing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But such a narrow examination poses a fundamental problem: These wines are not distributed widely enough. I can\u2019t find three Michigan rieslings in New York \u2014 good ones, at least \u2014 while few Finger Lakes rieslings are available in, say, California.One option might be to look at several mass-marketed American rieslings. But again, too few of these wines would bear up under close examination. So I have chosen good American rieslings from three different states (California, New York and Oregon) with the hope that readers will be able to find at least one of these, or good alternatives.The three bottles I suggest are:If you have difficulty finding these bottles, which I expect may be the case, good options are available. Tatomer makes other cuv\u00e9es, which will be fine, even though one or two might have a bit more residual sugar than the dry Kick-on Ranch bottle.Beyond these producers, look for California rieslings from Smith-Madrone, Stony Hill, Navarro and Trefethen; Finger Lakes dry rieslings from Hermann J. Wiemer, Dr. Konstantin Frank, Forge Cellars, N. Kendall, Red Tail Ridge, Red Newt, Eminence Road Farm and Bloomer Creek; and Oregon rieslings from Brooks, Trisaetum, Lemelson and Love & Squalor.And if you find rieslings from Michigan, Washington, Idaho or anywhere else, why not see what you think?Serve these rieslings cool to chilled, but not icy, lest the nuances be overwhelmed by cold.An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the Tatomer Kick-on Ranch riesling wine. It is $35, not $50.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Politics Comes to the County Fair", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "As agricultural life is celebrated at county fairs nationwide, this year offers a new variable: President Trump\u2019s global face-off over tariffs.Supported byFew things in life are more reliable than the county fair. Evoking decades past, they appear every year \u2014 hot and sticky, an emporium of pop-up rides in cartoon colors, fried foods on sticks and contests that bring blue ribbons.Long ripe for political debates, fairs are also places to contemplate the variables of farm and ranch life. Beyond rain, drought and finicky machinery, this year offers a new subject: a global face-off over tariffs.To get a glimpse at a summer of uncertainly, we visited three weekend fairs: one near Indianapolis, another in an Ohio county of about 65,000 people, and still another southeast of San Francisco.MARION, Ohio \u2014 Terry Ackerman wore his \u201cspecial occasion\u201d boots, the ones made of sheepskin, to the Marion County Fair.\u201cI live for the fair,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. \u201cI always feel better about the future of our country after the fair.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not opposed at all,\u201d said Mr. Ackerman, 58, who has farmed since his teenage years and now has about 800 acres of soybeans, corn and wheat, the leading crops around here. \u201cIt would certainly be better if we could progress without tariffs \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that \u2014 but I guess I would say it\u2019s short-term pain for long-term gain.\u201dMarion County, about an hour north of Columbus, does not treat its fair as a summertime rite of a bygone era. Drive around the county seat, where Warren G. Harding staged his \u201cReturn to Normalcy\u201d campaign from his front porch in 1920, and you\u2019ll see signs posted by businesses and civic institutions beckoning visitors to the fenced-in fairgrounds. The fair book for this year\u2019s event, the 168th iteration, ran 92 pages.And on sale day, it seemed no sound \u2014 no midway ride, no crackling caldron of frying oil, no turkey\u2019s gobble \u2014 rose above the cries and pleas of a short-sleeved auctioneer.You could hear him from the parking lot. You could hear him at the stand with $3 chocolate milkshakes. And, of course, you could hear him while you sidestepped hogs and the kids with pig whips.Mr. Ackerman, whose children used to show cattle, has been coming to the fair for decades. In that time, he has become increasingly wary of the trade imbalance between the United States and China. He does not expect, or even necessarily want, a perfect trade balance with Beijing; instead, he talks about a more \u201clevel playing field.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re smart, shrewd people,\u201d Mr. Ackerman says of Chinese importers, \u201cand I tip my hat to them. If I was buying a bunch of grain, I\u2019d be trying to buy it as cheap as I could, too.\u201dMr. Ackerman said he voted for President Trump and credits him with recognizing the trade issue\u2019s urgency. \u201cThere\u2019s enough win-wins that can be had in trade, and I think the United States in the past has not pressed for more of that win-win situation,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said.He hopes that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in recent weeks will inspire what he perceives as a crucially needed shift. But they could convulse Marion County, which, because of its farms and a Whirlpool factory that can make about 20,000 dryers a day, has a larger stake in the trade war than many places. Mr. Ackerman knows he is \u201cnot bulletproof,\u201d but with some hedging and a generational advantage over younger farmers with more debts and fewer savings, he figures he can handle a two-year trade battle.\u201cI spend time figuring out how to manage it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable, but don\u2019t misunderstand: It\u2019s not without concern, but I really think this is going to get worked out.\u201dOn Saturday especially, he did not fret.He bought a turkey at the auction. He lifted the price of a dairy feeder he thought was fetching too little of someone else\u2019s money. And with silence and a series of quick nods, he won a goat raised by his electrician\u2019s daughter.His successful day at the auction left him optimistic. \u201cI plan on doing it until I can\u2019t get up,\u201d he said.PLEASANTON, Calif. \u2014 Hog prices have never been higher at the Alameda County Fair.Garrett Post, 18, got more than $2,000 for his 265-pound pig, Kanan. You could easily get a half-dozen pigs for that price at a commercial auction.But at this fair, overpaying for hogs raised by hobbyist farmers is the point. Unlike hog farmers elsewhere in the country, who are already fearing the impact of new tariffs that China imposed last week on American pork, fairgoers in Alameda County this weekend were more concerned about the trade war\u2019s potential impact on Northern California\u2019s wine industry and the nearby ports.Mr. Trump is already unpopular in this part of the country. The trade war has done little to affect that.The buyer of Mr. Post\u2019s pig, a man in a cowboy hat and black shirt embroidered with horseshoes and a large silver and gold \u201cswine leader\u201d belt buckle, was not a disinterested party.He\u2019s an engineer at Chevron, the oil company, who lives in the Oakland hills with a view of the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge. He is also Garrett\u2019s father. Ron Post bought his son\u2019s pig on behalf of his neighbors, who each paid a share to get fresh cuts of meat from a pig that went on regular walks on the fire trail in the open space behind their homes.And that\u2019s the point of the youth auction at the Alameda County Fair. Local companies, family members, a local politician \u2014 everyone who buys hogs, cattle and lambs at the livestock auction knows they are paying way above market price.\u201cIt\u2019s a great program for the kids,\u201d said Lou Seever, the owner of a tire and auto repair shop who bought more than $20,000 worth of livestock at the youth auction on Sunday.Scott Hagerty, a member of the Alameda County board of supervisors, attends every year, buys pigs and then donates the meat to homeless shelters.Land is so scarce and expensive in the Bay Area that raising pigs here doesn\u2019t make much economic sense.\u201cYou can\u2019t buy a house in this town for under a million bucks \u2014 and that\u2019s a 40-year-old house,\u201d said Mr. Seever, who grew up in South San Francisco.Promoters say raising farm animals keeps the kids out of trouble. And in a part of the country best known for giving birth to Google, Apple and Facebook, raising pigs is a decidedly offline experience.Among the hobby farmers at the auction on Sunday, the trade war with China was not a topic of conversation. But Mr. Hagerty, the supervisor, said local vintners would likely be impacted by China placing tariffs on American wine. Also potentially affected would be the Port of Oakland, which is in Alameda County, and which ships much of the Northern California wines that go overseas.Laura Post, Garrett\u2019s mother and a school psychologist in Palo Alto, said she views the trade war from the standpoint of a consumer.\u201cI\u2019m personally not a fan of all the tariffs that will penalize buyers,\u201d Ms. Post said. As a Democrat, she\u2019s also not a fan of Mr. Trump, whom she describes as a self-centered bully.\u201cI\u2019m not super excited about the political situation right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I live in the Bay Area, and who is?\u201dSHELBYVILLE, Ind. \u2014 The payoff of a tractor pull happens in less than a minute: Your engine roars, smoke billows, and your tractor barrels forward, often flipping up into a wheelie, dragging an impossibly heavy sled along a dirt track until it can go no farther.The rest of the time is spent tending to that tractor, hauling it around inside a huge truck and devoting untold hours to readying it for the next competition.\u201cOnce the sport gets in your blood, it\u2019s just there,\u201d said Ron Mitchell, a farmer who spends his off hours wearing a fireproof suit and helmet, participating in tractor pulls like the one on Saturday evening on the final night of the Shelby County Fair.\u201cYou\u2019ll work a week for one 20-second pull,\u201d he said.Like tractor pulls, farming takes patience. Mr. Mitchell, 53, has a lot of that. He has watched the corn on his fields and on fields around Shelby County, southeast of Indianapolis, grow tall and sturdy this season; old hopes for \u201cknee high by the Fourth of July\u201d have been wildly and happily surpassed.All the while, Mr. Mitchell has also watched reports of a growing trade war with a sense of concern, but also with his trademark patience.Long term, he says, the Trump administration\u2019s conflict with other countries over tariffs will probably end well, with more fair markets. He says that would be good and has long been needed.\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be hard on the farmer here for a bit,\u201d said Mr. Mitchell, who said he usually votes but chose not to in 2016; he wasn\u2019t comfortable with either Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump.Mr. Mitchell\u2019s soybeans have taken off in the last few weeks. The price, meanwhile, has been sinking in recent weeks amid speculation about the trade dispute\u2019s impact. So Mr. Mitchell has been thinking about small ways to cut costs.Hold off on a new combine? Search for lower fertilizer costs?\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait this out,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump won Indiana, and more than 70 percent of Shelby County voters chose him. Still, some at this county fair were more pointedly critical of the administration\u2019s trade fight. Why not remove people from welfare rather than punish farmers who were already making narrow profits, asked one farmer, who declined to be quoted by name.The last night of the Shelby County Fair \u2014 a clear, warm evening with a pinkish sky \u2014 drew a slightly subdued crowd. The Hot Mess, a concoction of French fries, pork, nacho cheese and barbecue sauce, wasn\u2019t going as fast as it does on some nights, nor were the burgers cradled inside doughnuts, burgers inside pancakes, burgers inside French toast.At a \u201cFool the Guesser\u201d booth, the tanned, tattooed host who guesses ages, weights or birthdays for $5, abandoned his subtler pitches for customers, calling out on his microphone at one point: \u201cHelp me out. I\u2019m trying to get a little gas money to get out of town.\u201dAll the same, the truck and tractor pull drew a loud, enthusiastic crowd.Mr. Mitchell spent years searching for the tractor he uses in pulls \u2014 a late 1960s-model Allis-Chalmers 180, the very one that a family friend had used in tractor pulls when Mr. Mitchell was growing up. He spends about 50 summer nights at these pulls, all over Indiana and Kentucky.Could the trade fight cause him to cut back on his hobby?It\u2019s a thought, he said. Maybe he doesn\u2019t buy new tires as often. \u201cOr the night that you really want to beat your buddy, maybe you don\u2019t turn the boost up,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you keep it back and just make a nice pass and hope to beat them without tearing your engine up.\u201dThis night, Mr. Mitchell\u2019s orange tractor whirred and rumbled as the weighted sled was hitched behind it. \u201cGive it up for the hometown boy!\u201d the announcer called out as the tractor\u2019s immense tires began spewing dirt.A few seconds later, his tractor had gone 301.26 feet \u2014 good enough for third place \u2014 and it was all over.Alan Blinder reported from Marion, Ohio; Thomas Fuller from Pleasanton, Calif.; and Monica Davey from Shelbyville, Ind.

Mr. Adler is a professor of law and director of the Center for Business Law and Regulation at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law.Given President Trump\u2019s concerns about the federal administrative state, his nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is entirely fitting. For years, Judge Kavanaugh has toiled in the vineyards of administrative law, writing highly influential opinions on regulatory matters and demonstrating a willingness to discipline federal agencies when they go astray.For the past 12 years, Judge Kavanaugh has sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court (where I once clerked) hears many legal challenges to major federal regulations. As a consequence, it is the arguably the most influential court on matters of administrative law, and judges there are fed a steady diet of these often complex and demanding cases. Of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nearly 300 opinions as a federal judge, over one-third concern administrative law \u2014 and they are quite revealing.In conducting judicial review, Judge Kavanaugh does not grade on a curve. As much as any District of Columbia Circuit judge, he questions whether federal agencies have followed the relevant requirements and acted within the scope of their delegated authority. Where agencies come up short, he is not one to give them a pass.In Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump may not have found a justice to \u201cdeconstruct the administrative state\u201d \u2014 in Steve Bannon\u2019s formulation \u2014 but he has found one who will help bring it to heel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Takes a Bullet", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Trump\u2019s personal lawyer really puts family and country first, he could earn a sliver of redemption. Opinion ColumnistHere\u2019s to Michael Cohen. He\u2019s finally getting something right.He thought himself a tough guy, Trump\u2019s muscle collecting the crumbs of Trump\u2019s money. According to that reporter, Cohen erroneously \u2014 and outrageously \u2014 claimed, \u201cYou cannot rape your spouse,\u201d before launching into this tirade:\u201cYou write a story that has Mr. Trump\u2019s name in it, with the word \u2018rape,\u2019 and I\u2019m going to mess your life up \u2026 for as long as you\u2019re on this frickin\u2019 planet \u2026 you\u2019re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you\u2019ll never know how to get out from underneath it.\u201dThis is not a likable man, nor one deserving of sympathy.Ever since the F.B.I. raided Cohen\u2019s office, home and hotel room in April, seizing thousands of documents as well as digital devices, it has been clear that Cohen was in very real trouble, and that that peril may well extend to Donald Trump and his family.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s advisers have concluded that a wide-ranging corruption investigation into his personal lawyer poses a greater and more imminent threat to the president than even the special counsel\u2019s investigation, according to several people close to Mr. Trump.\u201dCohen was going down. The only question was how he would manage the descent.Would he remain loyal to a president who doesn\u2019t seem to understand that loyalty should be reciprocal, or would he succumb to pressure and the very real prospect of a stint in prison, and cooperate with investigators?According to the report: \u201cCohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians\u2019 offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen\u2019s account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.\u201dThat revelation would be damning if true, not only because Trump and his associates have repeatedly lied about the nature of that meeting, but also because it would go more directly to the heart of collusion and conspiracy.That\u2019s the thing about Cohen: He was so often in the room. He undoubtedly knows things about all the issues that plague this president: those around the women who have made allegations against him, his murky financial entanglements and the Russian attempts to connect with his campaign.Not only are there documents, but also Cohen has secret recordings, including of the president, as we found out last week.  Cohen is a valuable asset and he knows it. Now he\u2019s attempting to convert himself from parasite to patriot. Now, Trump\u2019s new fix-it man, the rambling, incoherent Rudy Giuliani, is on a mission to discredit Cohen.  Trump seems to always surround himself with lap dogs and lackeys, people who will do and say anything to defend and protect him, praise and promote him. Trump is the sun at the center of his own universe. \u201cWhy is Giuliani out falsely disparaging Michael Cohen \u2014 because they fear him.\u201d Davis continued:\u201cWhat do they fear, Chris? Why am I representing him? They fear that he has the truth about Donald Trump. He will someday speak the truth about Donald Trump.\u201dBut, if Cohen indeed becomes a cooperating witness for the Robert Mueller Russia investigation, he will salvage a tiny bit of honor from a life of dishonor. He will purchase a sliver of redemption.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: The Many Costs and Confusions of Chronic Illness", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I got the idea in 2011 and 2012, when people were writing to me after reading my Facebook posts, wanting some sort of guidance or help in their own illness journey. I had a lot of people with Lyme who were watching me suffer publicly. A lot of people who had read my other work asked: Why don\u2019t you write about this? I never intended to write an illness memoir, or any full-length memoir. I never thought it would be appropriate for me. To be honest, I didn\u2019t want to fall into it too deeply.There were some people, and especially women of color, who seemed to need a voice in this area. I understood what they were talking about. There weren\u2019t a lot of people like myself \u2014 a woman of color, a woman of Muslim culture, an Iranian \u2014 who had told this story. I could see how this could help others, and that got me started on it.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I\u2019ve learned that you can write personal essays for years and years but nothing is harder than writing a book like this. Full-length memoir is one of the most challenging things, especially when you\u2019re still living the story. At different times, I felt like I was out of it. When I first sold the book, I felt like I was in remission from Lyme. A few months later, I had a traumatic brain injury from a car accident \u2014 I was hit by an 18-wheeler driving home from work. It exacerbated my Lyme symptoms dramatically and made me very ill. It\u2019s hard enough to write about yourself in this context, but it\u2019s hard to pick up the pieces of your life and write them into a narrative when you\u2019re also somewhat in pieces yourself.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I stripped back a lot of the research. Initially I thought I would be writing something very heavy with sociological, anthropological and cultural stuff to couch my account. I was very happy to be rid of that stuff and leave it to be my own account as plainly as possible.I set out to write more influenced by a desire to have a happy ending, and have it read something like: You can get well, too! I wanted to write a book that would let people know that maybe it will get better. But in the process of writing it, I didn\u2019t experience that. It was humbling in that sense. It\u2019s magical thinking that you\u2019ll write about something and then you won\u2019t have to deal with it again. You\u2019ll move past it and into a new chapter. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how trauma works. Trauma\u2019s a big component of illness, of being diagnosed and being treated.It ended up being a more intimate and honest book, and maybe a more spiraling and confusing book, a bit more raw. I\u2019ve always thought of myself, in my fiction, as a stylist. Language has always been so important to me. This book is a really different instinct. I wanted to write something as direct as possible, without too many bells and whistles. I wanted it to be a slender book, and I wanted people who were compromised mentally \u2014 as I often was while writing it \u2014 to be able to pick it up and digest it without a lot of the interference that concern about art can bring with it.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?I\u2019ve been fascinated by athletes. After my brain injury, I was obsessed with watching surf videos. It was the only thing that seemed calming to me. Tennis is one of the only sports I know anything about. Reading about people like Serena Williams or Roger Federer and how they approach things \u2014 hearing how they\u2019ve dealt with the body and the mind \u2014 has been really inspiring to me. The way I teach writing, I talk about how the brain is our tool and it\u2019s how we process things. Unlike athletes, we don\u2019t have a separation there with our medium.And with Lyme, there\u2019s a whole constellation of celebrities who have gone through it. That can be inspiring \u2014 seeing them in their public profile struggling with something.Persuade someone to read \u201cSick\u201d in 50 words or less.Fairly everyone in America these days seems to have something that\u2019s off, on a physical or mental level, at least in my age group. \u201cSick\u201d isn\u2019t going to offer them solutions, but it will let them know that they\u2019re not crazy, and they\u2019re not alone.This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Largest King Penguin Colony in the World Drops by 90%", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers hadn\u2019t visited the remote island in 30 years when there were 500,000 breeding pairs. Satellite images now indicate perhaps as few as 60,000 pairs. After three decades out of the public eye, a giant colony of king penguins has lost 90 percent of its population, according to a new study.But the penguins haven\u2019t been counted in person since 1982 when researchers last visited. In late 2016, researchers flew over it by helicopter and saw noticeably fewer penguins than expected. Researchers plan to do a head count on the island but they can\u2019t get there until late fall 2019 at the earliest, because of the cost and timing issues, said Dr. Weimerskirch, research director of the Chiz\u00e9 Centre for Biological Studies at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. A protected nature preserve, Pig Island isn\u2019t easy to reach, and the animals can\u2019t be seen from the water, because the colony is situated inland, he said.If the count from the satellite images proves accurate, it would significantly reduce the global population of king penguins, estimated at 1.5 million to 1.7 million breeding pairs worldwide with this loss. They had not been considered endangered before, but might be, Dr. Weimerskirch said. King penguins are second-largest in size after emperor penguins. They don\u2019t nest, but lay one egg and parents take turns incubating the egg with an abdominal layer called a brood patch for two months. King penguins leave their young and swim south to forage for fish and squid in the waters of the Antarctic polar front, where cold, deep water mixes with more temperate seas. If they can\u2019t reach this polar front and can\u2019t swim back within about a week, their chicks will starve to death.All the king penguin colonies in the South Indian Ocean suffered that year, but populations on nearby Possession Island quickly rebounded, counts there showed, so researchers assumed that the colony had rebounded on Pig Island as well, Dr. Weimerskirch said. The satellite images show they did not. It\u2019s not clear why the colony did not recover. Dr. Weimerskirch said the possibilities include some kind of infection or parasite affecting only animals on this island; predators like feral cats devastating nests; or, perhaps there was so much competition for resources in the giant colony that only the hardiest creatures could survive.He said the team spotted a small colony on a nearby island that didn\u2019t exist in the 1980s. But it only includes a few tens of thousands of breeding pairs \u2014 not anywhere near as many as were lost \u2014 and relocation isn\u2019t easy for the penguins, which naturally return to where they were born.Emiliano Trucchi, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Ferrara in Italy, who also studies king penguins in the Crozet archipelago, said he was disturbed by the report. A local problem like what is happening on Pig Island could hasten their decline, Dr. Trucchi said. \u201cIt deserves further investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very peculiar process and we need to understand how to fit this into the big picture.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a comparison between king penguins and emperor penguins. King penguins are second-largest in body size after emperor penguins, not in population.Advertisement"}

The Social Network Cannot Answer", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtFacebook was once the most nimble company of its generation. The speed at which it adapted to every challenge was legendary. It needed only about a decade to go from a dorm-room start-up to the largest and most influential communications platform in the world.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments fit a larger pattern. Presented with straightforward queries about real-world harm caused by misinformation on their service, Facebook\u2019s executives express their pain, ask for patience, proclaim their unwavering commitment to political neutrality and insist they are as surprised as anyone that they are even in the position of having to come up with speech rules for billions of people.Testifying before Congress in the spring, Mr. Zuckerberg vowed to address lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the site. Even though his business has continued to prosper, he repeatedly warned investors that he would take actions to address Facebook\u2019s social impact that could negatively impact its bottom line.The company\u2019s rules help to show how it distinguishes between free speech and hate speech. Judge for yourself.\u201cI think Facebook is trying to thread this needle of trying to claim they\u2019re not a publisher with responsibilities here, when they clearly are,\u201d said Sarah Szalavitz, chief executive of the design agency 7 Robot, who has closely followed social media companies\u2019 efforts to address their shortcomings. \u201cBut they need to have a perspective.\u201dIn Mr. Darcy\u2019s telling, Facebook officials seemed taken aback by the question. John Hegeman, Facebook\u2019s head of News Feed, stumbled through an answer about how \u201cjust being false doesn\u2019t violate the community standards,\u201d and how Infowars was a publisher with a \u201cdifferent point of view.\u201dLater, the social network argued that banning organizations that repeatedly peddle misinformation would be \u201ccontrary to the basic principles of free speech.\u201d The company insisted that even if Infowars and other sites that push misinformation are not banned, they might still be penalized. Facebook has contracted with dozens of fact-checking organizations around the world; if its fact checkers determined that a specific Infowars story was false, people would be allowed to share it with their friends, but Facebook would push it so far down in everyone\u2019s feeds that most of them would not see it.Part of the reason Facebook defended Infowars seemed to become evident this week on Capitol Hill. That was when Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy management, showed up at a congressional hearing along with other social media executives to answer questions about whether they may be biased against conservatives. In the hearing, Ms. Bickert apologized to Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.Then came Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments to Ms. Swisher on Wednesday about Holocaust denialism \u2014 and the question about what Facebook would or would not allow on its site became even more confusing.Even setting aside Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s bizarre idea that there are good-faith Holocaust deniers who are merely misinformed about the past, his argument raised several other issues, including hate speech. Facebook\u2019s code of conduct prohibits hate speech, which it defines as attacks on people based on \u201cprotected characteristics\u201d like race, ethnicity, or religion. Wouldn\u2019t Holocaust denialism fall into that category?A Facebook spokeswoman explained that it would be possible, theoretically, to deny the Holocaust without triggering Facebook\u2019s hate-speech clause.So to recap: Facebook is deeply committed to free expression and will allow people to post just about anything, including even denying the Holocaust. Unless, that is, if a Holocaust denial constitutes hate speech, in which case the company may take it down. But if a post contains a factual inaccuracy, it would not be removed, but it may be shown to very few people, reducing its impact.All of this fails a basic test: It\u2019s not even coherent. It is a hodgepodge of declarations and exceptions and exceptions to the exceptions.\u201cPersonally, I think you can have straightforward boundaries around hateful content that don\u2019t have to be this complicated,\u201d Ms. Szalavitz said. \u201cHolocaust denial is hate. That\u2019s not hard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You should send these to someone who can use them,\u2019 \u201d she remembered saying.Several weeks earlier, in response to teacher strikes in Oklahoma and Arizona, The Times\u2019s Reader Center put out a message through social media asking teachers to tell The Times about life in their classrooms. Using an online submission form, 4,200 teachers from around the country, including Ms. Vaughn, told reporters what their lives were like, sent photos of their schools, shared their salaries and helped to document a crisis in American education.Reporters collected these responses, fact checked them \u2014 including verifying the identities of online contributors \u2014 and published them in the article, \u201c25-Year-Old Textbooks and Holes in the Ceiling: Inside America\u2019s Public Schools.\u201d\u201cWe were able to, with the technology, reach teachers, hear from them, and then we could look through the responses and find trends,\u201d said Hanna Ingber, the editorial director of the Reader Center.\u201cIt\u2019s the power of the crowd,\u201d she said.Photos, videos and digitally submitted accounts from citizens are known as U.G.C., or user-generated content. It\u2019s a staple of journalism that dates back to a time before the internet: In 1963, Abraham Zapruder, a private citizen, captured President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination on grainy color film; in 1991, George Holliday, a Los Angeles plumber, taped the beating of Rodney G.

Ms. Vaughn, the art teacher, received donations through DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding website for classroom projects, and contributions from her Amazon wish list, in addition to the Durfees\u2019 care package.\u201cThe second I opened the box, the kids had the stencils.

One comes from a conversation where I\u2019m speaking with Mark about my own process. And the other has other people writing about you. I\u2019m present through the photographs, but it\u2019s their reflection on my work.How does it feel to be discussed and analyzed in an academic or curatorial manner, particularly for someone who\u2019s more than capable of talking for herself?Honestly, the more you are in conversation, you think about your own process, and that\u2019s a way to grow.I\u2019m working from within, for the most part, from what might draw me and what might dwell in me, what might sustain me or my interest. I\u2019m trying to make sense of each work, and sometimes when you go back you make sense better than in the midst of some project.Why is it important to have that kind of examination, whether through someone else\u2019s eyes or your own?It contributes insights that I feel give me self-knowledge.I didn\u2019t seek to do this show. Marta Gili at the Jeu de Paume called me a couple of years ago and asked. It\u2019s a big endeavor and it takes time and work, not just for myself but also my assistants. I\u2019ve done psychological digging; they\u2019re doing archaeological digging in my archive.It\u2019s been a valuable process. Pia Viewing wrote a piece in \u201cMediations,\u201d she was looking at the work and she said, \u201cI see place in so much of your work.\u201d Of course I can see it, too, but I\u2019ve never said that. It might be the guiding principle that I begin with, but I now see how I have always found some sense of boundaries to a place that\u2019s enabled my work to feel focused.Even though Nicaragua is a relatively small country that I could drive across in several hours, it\u2019s a place that I can come to know, even with all the turmoil. And to some degree you could even make that case about Kurdistan, where there is a much more complex psychological, social historical set of forces, especially with the archiving of a hundred years of history. But still, it\u2019s place. It\u2019s all about wanting and believing that they need and should have a homeland.So when you start doing your projects, and you\u2019re 25, you\u2019re not setting out with an idea of a career or overarching themes.I didn\u2019t even have a self-defined notion that I\u2019m a photographer at that time. It evolves. I was teaching at an elementary school in the South Bronx that was unusual because the superintendent was very progressive and wanted to experiment; these were kids that were coming from many different cultures.I had studied childhood education at Sarah Lawrence, and this was the day of Marshall McLuhan, in which people were thinking about how cameras can engage kids in learning. I did that for 3 to 4 years, first in the South Bronx, and then in the South. So my migration to becoming a photographer began with being engaged by photography through teaching.The carnival strippers changed all that because suddenly I am being the photographer. In the early \u201970s I\u2019m wandering around the streets, looking at people and trying to figure out what to make photographs of, but I don\u2019t really have a centering point for my own work until \u201cCarnival Strippers.\u201d Suddenly, there\u2019s a reason for me to be there. I understand what I\u2019m connecting to. It\u2019s integrating all of the ideas of being a young woman in that period of early feminist thinking.Well, I know what I wouldn\u2019t be doing: I\u2019m not as obsessed with self as much of the culture is. So I don\u2019t think that fundamentally would have changed.I\u2019ve taught with the Magnum Foundation social justice program with Fred (Ritchin) and with other programs, and I\u2019ve helped answer that question for other 25-year-olds more than for myself.In terms of training \u2014 which I didn\u2019t have the opportunity for when I was that age \u2014 I think a program like the Interactive Telecommunications Program at N.Y.U. is exciting. If I were to go on as a graduate student, that\u2019s where I think I would have found the edge in thinking that changes us or challenges us to think about new ways of relating through the photographic image, or connecting inward in maybe even more surprising ways.I didn\u2019t choose to join the Peace Corps when I was 25. I placed myself in the South Bronx. So I was not inclined to just go as far away as most people would think. So I might be even more immersed in a community.What is interesting to me is that your impulses probably would have been the same.When I\u2019m working with young people, I think of how much more they have, yet they often feel they have so much less than we had. As I became part of the Magnum community, I was more exposed to the myths of Capa and the real life of Cartier-Bresson and realized I was in a community that I knew nothing about before I entered it. They had a very different set of opportunities than we had at that time, in the mid to late \u201970s. Maybe every generation feels that.What are the opportunities that this generation has?Well, I think they\u2019re not as confined by gatekeepers. That\u2019s a huge difference. The web is challenging because you still have to be distinctive on it. You have to figure that out, but people have.People have created sharing platforms that are collectively driven and may not have monetary value, so they have to have alternative strategies for the economic transactions that they need to also benefit from. This is a whole open landscape for imagination.Even the look-and-listen app with the last Nicaragua book was an attempt to try and shift the way we experience subjects in photographs and create the channel for their voice to bridge this terrible distance that can still exist in photographs.When did you join Magnum?I had a very small assignment from Harper\u2019s to photograph women at the 1976 Democratic convention. If you\u2019re major media, you get a pass, or multiple passes, and you can move freely. But if you\u2019re a small international or national publication, you only get a rotating pass for 15 minutes. You barely can get on the floor and do any work before you have to give up that pass. I was agonizing because it was one of my first assignments and I was failing. I just couldn\u2019t make the photographs I was hoping to because of the system. I went up to the guy running this and said: \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t working for all of us on the line and we\u2019ve got to change the system. Even if we only had a half-hour we could produce something.\u201d Gilles Peres happened to be near and asked if I wanted to borrow one of the passes he had. I said, \u201cNo, I want to change the system.\u201d So he loved that.I wasn\u2019t on the path of becoming a professional photographer. I didn\u2019t really have at the time a sense of Magnum, its history or what it would mean to join a cooperative. He asked me what I was doing and I had this portfolio of work that I brought up to Magnum and they asked if they could propose me in their upcoming meeting.Well, you\u2019ve always been a troublemaker. Ah, thanks a lot, I don\u2019t think of myself as a troublemaker, I just think of myself as trying to think out of the box a bit. Sometimes getting boxed in kills the spirit.You grow by breaching those boundaries and by not being constrained by what other people think you are or should be. You have to sustain that within yourself because very often you don\u2019t get the support, the external support.A lot of the work of Magnum Foundation, for me, is helping to create a supportive community. And helping young, emerging and diverse voices feel that they can find others and create networks with other possibilities through us and with us but beyond us.You seem fascinated by collaboration. You brought the carnival strippers\u2019 voices into the story from the beginning.The women saw the contact sheets every week. I wanted them to see how I was seeing them, and they influenced to some degree the images I made. I made portraits really for them, not because I wanted to make portraits, per se. Some of them saw my final transcript that I was editing, commented and actually changed some of it. That\u2019s an ideal process.Using audio and collaborating with the strippers, as well as your later collages, are strategies that are current in documentary photography. The Magnum Foundation has, in workshops and programs, focused on these kinds of actions, haven\u2019t they?So one has to resist, and respond to, one\u2019s own instincts. Part of my thinking is trying to build the foundation for new thinkers, which involves community opportunities with new tools like VR360 and augmented reality.Why is it important today that photographers innovate?I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s important for everyone. It may not be.But it shifts the way you see the work. So I think all of these are avenues of shifting and re-engaging us in work. And it doesn\u2019t have to be about technology. People have done this with text. I happen to have been more drawn to sound and voice. It\u2019s just building a broader vocabulary to give a viewer a richer experience.Which is an exciting thing, but it\u2019s also necessary because it can be very hard to effectively communicate and engage an audience today.That\u2019s the biggest challenge, and we can\u2019t just assume that a photograph we\u2019ve made does that inherently. We may hope it will. But I\u2019ve always said that the work for a photographer is not just making photographs, it\u2019s making the space for their photographs to be seen and experienced.When you were starting out, there were fewer women doing the kind of photojournalism you were doing in Nicaragua.The next year Cindy Karp came, and then Donna DeCesare, and Corinne Dufka followed her. I think we all encouraged each other. In the early \u201980s there were Europeans and the Nicaraguan women photographers Margarita Montealegre and Claudia Gordillo.I\u2019m excited now as I collaborate with women in Magnum, and there are so many more women doing work, not necessarily the same kind of work I do, but that\u2019s the exciting thing, they\u2019re taking their own visions in different directions.The Magnum Foundation has been effective in fostering and promoting a diversity of voices from all over the world.That\u2019s been the priority. That\u2019s exactly its intention. I just had someone who came from Saudi Arabia and told me how stunned they were to see Tasneem Alsultan\u2019s work in The New York Times.Well, she was a wedding photographer, in an open submission process, when we brought her through the Arab documentary program and she had six months of mentoring before you see her in The New York Times.We also know this isn\u2019t just about careers. This is about keeping a set of values coherent.What do you mean? We can point to more diverse voices, but we also are living in a society that has more separated cultures that don\u2019t intersect as well. We believe that photography is a means by which that can happen. It has to do with intention, collaborative relationships and acknowledgment of differences.The person who is your subject is not your object.I think this is a very important idea for people to think about. Do we objectify aesthetically or formally? How do we give appropriate presence and dignity to that subject? They are not there just for the lens of the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Russia: One Mystery, Three Theories ", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn agnostic's guide to our president\u2019s strange conduct. Opinion ColumnistSo maybe this is a good time to step back and sketch out the three main ways to understand Trump\u2019s relationship to Russia and Putin and the 2016 hacking of his Democratic rivals, the three major theories that make sense of our president\u2019s strange conduct before and since. I\u2019m not going to formally choose among them, but for people interested in betting I will offer odds for each.In this theory of the case, you can explain all of Trump\u2019s Russia-related behavior simply by finding him guilty of being the person we always knew him to be \u2014 vain, mendacious, self-serving, sleazy and absurdly stubborn, with a purely personalized understanding of allies and adversaries, a not-so-sneaking admiration for strongmen and the information filter of an old man who prefers his own reality to the discomforts of contrary information.If Trump seems to have a more intense affinity for Putin than for other autocrats, two further explanations may suffice. First, his history of doing business deals with Russians makes him particularly inclined to seek geopolitical deals with Russia \u2014 an inclination that\u2019s essentially a shadier version of the affinity that the Bush family and other Arabists had with the Saudis and the Gulf States, cross-pollinated with the sleazy campaign-finance relationships that the Chinese cultivated with the Clinton White House. At the same time, his vanity and amour propre, joined to his rage against his doubters, makes it impossible for Trump to admit that anyone else helped him win the White House \u2014 so he cannot bring himself to fully acknowledge and criticize Russian election meddling because to do so might call into question not only his legitimacy but his self-conception as a political grandmaster. And what about the election-season contacts with suspicious Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, the Don Jr. meeting and the Roger Stone forays? In this theory they\u2019re indicators that Trump, a shady guy surrounded by shady guys and professional morons, might well have colluded given the opportunity \u2014 but they don\u2019t prove that any such opportunity presented itself. After all, neither the hacking nor the leaking of emails required his campaign\u2019s cooperation, so there was no reason for the Russian side to advance beyond a deniable low-level meeting and WikiLeaks D.M.s, and thus no real opportunity for the Trump team to be a true accessory to the underlying crime.This narrative does not exonerate Trump; indeed, it provides various grounds to condemn him. But those grounds are the same grounds that were obvious during the campaign: We watched him blow kisses to dictators then, complain about our allies then, promise a d\u00e9tente with Russia while exploiting the D.N.C. hacking then, double and triple down on falsehoods and bogus narratives then, cling to self-destructive feuds (the Khans, Alicia Machado) in the same way that he clings to public flattery for Putin \u2026 and after all this, he was still elected president. So be appalled when he behaves appallingly, but do not be surprised, do not confuse Trump being Trump with Trump being treasonous \u2014 and recognize that he isn\u2019t leaving office until you beat him at the polls.Because Trump is Trump, I think it\u2019s more reasonable to see this behavior as of a piece with all his other irrational-seeming, self-destructive behavior on questions unrelated to l\u2019affaire Russe. But there\u2019s always the possibility that this characterological analysis is a form of overthinking, and that when the truth comes out we\u2019ll look back and say that his guilt should have been obvious all along.And what kind of guilt would it be? There are various possibilities, but the latest Mueller filing supplies one possible answer: In addition to the email leaks, we now know that the Russian hackers also accessed Democratic campaign analytics, a prize that (far more than the emails) would have been hard to fully weaponize if they weren\u2019t shared directly with the Trump campaign. That leaves 10 percent for the most dramatic theory, which is that any collusion wasn\u2019t just something Trump\u2019s team stumbled into during the campaign but something connected to a much longer-running Russian intelligence operation, and that Trump\u2019s relationship to the Russian state is not just a personal or ideological affinity or a campaign-season alliance but a partnership forged through blackmail or bribery or both.There is a great deal of enthusiasm for this kind of theory, on social media especially, and on many days I think it\u2019s embarrassing or risible \u2014 a birtherism of the center-left, an exculpatory fantasy from an establishment thrashing about to evade its own responsibility for the rise of populism, a \u201cbrown scare\u201d about an omnicompetent Putin and a fascist international that mirrors similar paranoias on the right. The first two narratives I\u2019ve offered seem far more parsimonious, Trump seems like too brazen a sinner to be effectively blackmailed, and his worldview seems very palpably his own. Meanwhile, the Trump administration\u2019s actual Russia policy, with its combination of the public bromance with Putin and more hawkish policies behind the scenes, would be a pretty strange way for a Kremlin stooge to play his part.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Yatala Pies in Yatala, Australia", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare10 PhotosYATALA, Australia \u2014 Many family vacations are defined by their rituals: piling into a car overstuffed with camping or surfing or fishing gear, setting off on a familiar voyage, to a familiar destination, with familiar pit stops along the way. Food is integral \u2014 for some American children, a meal at Howard Johnson\u2019s was perhaps more memorable than the seaside or lakeside vacation that followed.It makes sense that pies would be integral to the holidays of Australians. If there is a national dish here, it is the meat pie. Many liken it to the American hamburger, but the hot dog is probably a better comparison. You can buy a pie at petrol stations, in school canteens and in any small-town bakery or cafe. Like the hot dog, pies are portable and were made ubiquitous and culturally indispensable thanks to the sports arena.Yatala is one of the oldest pie shops in Australia, and it has changed hands many times over the course of its life span. Oral history along with old photographs are all that the current owners, the Porter family, have to go on.When the old road was replaced by the modern M1 highway in 1999, Yatala moved to its current location, which is very large and has a drive-through and enough parking for tour busses. It also has a giant pie sculpture on a pole to attract visitors \u2014 a pie in the sky, if you will.The counter at Yatala \u2014 stuffed with pies and other baked goods \u2014 is long and hectic. It\u2019s staffed by a gaggle of maroon-clad workers who run back and forth taking orders and retrieving pies from the ovens in back. The shop is beloved for its many varieties, for the old-fashioned ceramic ovens they\u2019re cooked in and for the ritual of standing in line to order one pie to stay, and one family-size pie to take with you as a thoughtful hostess gift or easy midweek meal.The basic wood-paneled dining room has plastic tables and a wall covered in historical photos of different iterations of the shop over the years. A veranda with seating wraps all the way around the building.The pies here are vastly better than the mass-produced kind that dominate the Australian market. That holds true for other options \u2014 the sausage rolls are big, their pastry wrapping buttery. You can get a plate of chips covered in deep brown gravy that is almost glassy in its weird, warm viscosity, tasting like fat and bouillon and what you might imagine beef to be like if you\u2019d heard beef described but had never actually tried it. As my American-raised son put it: \u201cThis might be the wrongest thing I\u2019ve ever eaten. I love it.\u201dThere is much to recommend in the coconut lamb curry pie, or the steak, tomato and onion. If you go for any of the many steak versions, I highly recommend ordering peas as an add-on; they are a mash of vibrant green, placed lovingly underneath the pie\u2019s lid before heating. And of course, there must be tomato sauce on top. (My New York editors prefer the term \u201cketchup.\u201d In this case, I have resisted.)Yatala serves a plethora of sweet pies \u2014 apple, custard, berry \u2014 but that\u2019s not really why you\u2019re here. I\u2019ve never quite figured out the sweet and savory divide between America and Australia. Apple and fruit pies are ubiquitous in America, but scarce in Australia, and the opposite is true of meat pies.The obvious exceptions to this rule are chicken potpie on the American side and apricot pies on the Australian. My Nana used to buy frozen apricot pies and serve them hot with whipped cream for dessert, and Yatala serves a version that\u2019s intensely nostalgic for me. The crust is like stiff shortbread, the filling painfully sweet.For most people, the nostalgia of Yatala will lie elsewhere. It will be in seeing that giant pie in the sky, in pulling off the road on the way to the beach for the all-Australian satisfaction of a warm personal meal of meat encased in pastry. It will be in the ritual of familiarity, topped with sauce.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Won Re-election in 2020", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by A sneak peek at the Times\u2019s news analysis from Nov. 4, 2020.Opinion ColumnistNov. 4, 2020In the end, a bitterly fought election came down to the old political aphorism, popularized during Bill Clinton\u2019s successful 1992 run against George H.W. Bush: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism.Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president\u2019s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida.In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. \u201cWhat part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?\u201d Kevin O\u2019Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers.Yet both Democrats are also skeptics of trade agreements such as Nafta, which served to mute their differences with the president. And their signature proposals \u2014 Medicare for all and free college tuition for most American families \u2014 would have been expensive and would require tax increases on families making more than $200,000. Mr. Trump and other Republicans charged they would \u201cbankrupt you and bankrupt the country.\u201dMeanwhile, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the last quarter, the third consecutive quarter in which growth has exceeded 3 percent. Unemployment remains low at 4.1 percent.With neither a recession nor a major war to run against, Democrats sought instead to cast the election in starkly moral terms. Yet by Election Day, the charge that Mr. Trump is morally or intellectually unfit for office had been made so often that it had lost most of its former edge among swing voters.\u201cI don\u2019t care if he lies or exaggerates in his tweets or breaks his vows to his wife, so long as he keeps his promises to me,\u201d Leah Rownan, a self-described social conservative from Henderson, Nev., told The Times, citing the economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominations as decisive for her vote. \u201cAnd he has.\u201dMany of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters also said they felt vindicated by the conclusions of Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. While the former F.B.I. director painted a damning portrait of a campaign that was riddled with Kremlin sympathizers and a candidate whose real-estate ventures were beholden to Russian investors, no clear evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump and Moscow ever emerged and the president was never indicted.\u201cIt was always a red herring, just like Trump said,\u201d said Bernard Schwartz, a gun store owner from Houston, Tex. \u201cDemocrats wasted a lot of ammo on that one.\u201dDemocrats also failed to capitalize on, and may have been damaged by, winning back control of the House of Representatives, but not the Senate, in the 2018 midterms. Mr. Trump proved effective, if characteristically vitriolic, in making a foil of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Efforts to impeach the president mainly served to energize his base. Polling surveys suggested that wavering voters saw a Democratic Party more invested in humiliating the president than in helping them.As is often the case in losing presidential campaigns, it did not take long for campaign aides to Senator Warren to offer damning appraisals of her performance as a candidate. Historical references abounded: The Children\u2019s Crusade; Pickett\u2019s Charge; the McGovern campaign of 1972. The common thread was that the campaign\u2019s moral fervor repeatedly got the better of its message focus.\u201cTrump succeeded,\u201d lamented one moderate former Democratic lawmaker who asked to speak on background. \u201cHe got my party to lose its marbles.\u201d The lawmaker cited calls by party activists to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 calls the Warren campaign did not formally endorse but did little to refute \u2014 as emblematic of the party\u2019s broader problems.\u201cWhat do Democrats stand for?\u201d he asked. \u201cLawlessness or liberality? Policymaking or virtue signaling? Gender-neutral pronouns and bathrooms or good jobs and higher wages?\u201d As is his way, Mr. Trump wasted little time rubbing salt into Democratic wounds. \u201cDemocrats used to stand with the Working Man,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cNow it\u2019s the party of Abortion and Amnesty.

{"Headline": "Man Who Harassed Woman Over Puerto Rican Flag Shirt Is Charged With Hate Crimes", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Chicago man who was caught on video harassing a woman over a Puerto Rican flag shirt was charged with felony hate crimes on Thursday, just hours after a police officer who ignored the woman\u2019s pleas for help resigned, the authorities said.The man, Timothy Trybus, 62, already faced disorderly conduct and assault charges in connection with the episode last month at a park in northern Chicago. In an email on Thursday, the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office said Mr. Trybus had now also been charged with two counts of felony hate crime and is to appear in court for a bail hearing on Friday afternoon.\u201cI am sincerely sorry this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the video, and I am outraged that this would happen anywhere, but especially sad it happened in our Forest Preserves.\u201dSome aspects of their investigation are continuing, he said, noting that Officer Connor\u2019s personnel file would reflect that he \u201cdid not resign in good standing.\u201dRepeated attempts to reach Mr. Trybus and Officer Connor for comment have been unsuccessful.The episode took place last month in the northern Chicago park Caldwell Woods. The recording, taken by Ms. Irizarry, shows Mr. Trybus demanding to know why she has a Puerto Rican flag shirt on and whether she is a United States citizen. While Mr. Trybus shouts at Ms. Irizarry, points at her face and follows her around part of the park, Officer Connor can be seen standing about 20 feet away with his hands against his chest.\u201cYou are not going to change us, you know that, right?\u201d Mr. Trybus says to Ms. Irizarry as he walks up to her. \u201cAre you a United States citizen? Then you should not be wearing that.\u201dMs. Irizarry, who was at the park with friends for a birthday party, can be heard on the video telling Mr. Trybus that she is indeed an American citizen. Her friends can be heard telling him that Puerto Rico is part of the United States.At one point in the video, Ms. Irizarry tries to move away from Mr. Trybus and walks out from under a pavilion, but he follows her as Officer Connor appears not to approach them.\u201cOfficer, officer, I feel highly uncomfortable,\u201d Ms. Irizarry tells Officer Connor, who does not appear to respond to her as he is addressed, and can be seen turning his back and walking toward his police car.The video shows Mr. Trybus continuing to confront Ms. Irizarry and her friends for about 10 minutes before additional police officers arrive and eventually arrest him, leading to the initial charges.Ms. Irizarry has not responded to multiple requests for an interview.\u201cThat officer did absolutely nothing \u2014 he did absolutely zero,\u201d Ms. Irizarry said in the video, which was streamed from her Facebook profile on June 14, but gained a wider audience this week. \u201cI told him I was uncomfortable multiple times.

{"Headline": "How to Make a Crossword Puzzle", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bypuzzle makingIn Part 4 of the series, the constructors Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber clue us in.But you can\u2019t fill anything in without clues, can you? Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber, two well-known New York Times Crossword constructors, take us through that final part of the process in Part 4. The article would go on forever if they took us through the process for every single clue in the puzzle, so they will talk about a selection of clues, starting with the theme entries, and the rest of the puzzle clues \u2014 as well as the puzzle itself for you to solve \u2014 are at the end.One thing to watch for: Ms. Weintraub and Mr. Wilber place their clues in brackets because that\u2019s how clues are often presented to editors in queries or when discussing them with other constructors. In the daily Wordplay column and other articles, clues have historically been presented in quotation marks.And we\u2019re not done yet: Part 5, running in August, will wrap things up with a list of the resources mentioned in this series, as well as a look at the puzzle by the crossword editors Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, who will give us insight into how they take a submitted puzzle from raw manuscript to published puzzle.The other side of the coin is learning how the clue vibe differs at various publishing venues, and then it\u2019s a matter of adapting your style to each \u201ceditorial happy place.\u201d How one clues a New York Times puzzle, for example, may be very different from how one clues a puzzle for USA Today or the American Values Club crossword. But I digress \u2026 this puzzle\u2019s theme is clever but straightforward. It feels like a Tuesday to me. WEINTRAUB: Our theme plays on synonyms for \u201csong,\u201d providing four amusing musical entries:Although MACBOOK AIR is the first theme entry in the puzzle, I\u2019m going to skip to PUZZLE PIECE \u2014 it seems like an easier place to begin. Going down that road, some ideas for PUZZLE PIECE are [Song about an enigma?] or [Song about a conundrum?]. I\u2019d probably opt for the latter simply because \u201cconundrum\u201d is more fun to say than \u201cenigma.\u201dBut circling back to one of the earlier ideas, we can try [Song about a crossword?]. That\u2019s nice, but I think it can be stronger. How about [Song for a crossword enthusiast?]? I really like that, because we\u2019ve added complexity without making it any harder. We\u2019re not just defining the music, we\u2019ve also identified the audience for the music. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that ideally our four theme entry clues should maintain a similar structure, and if this format doesn\u2019t work for the others, we\u2019ll need a new plan. No way to know until we keep going. \u2026All four clues are amusing, have parallel structure and stay true to the theme. I\u2019m good. Theme entries done. WILBER: Now for the remaining puzzle fill. Earlier we decided the theme was Tuesday material, but an editor could eventually see it slightly differently \u2014 say, as either a Monday or a Wednesday. I edit the weekly puzzle for The Chronicle of Higher Education, which aims for fairly consistent midweek difficulty each time, not a daily progression. Even so, in my experience, a clue author afraid of not hitting the imagined target is better off going slightly harder rather than slightly easier. Why? If editors need to make clues gentler, they can often keep the essence of your original suggestion but add a hint. If you\u2019ve written very easy clues that need to be toughened up, the editor may have to scrap your idea and reach for entirely new material. On the other hand, the New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz feels that every puzzle has a natural level of difficulty, based on its theme and vocabulary. He believes the constructor should figure out what the difficulty level is (or ask the editor for guidance) and write clues accordingly.Even though we expect editors will make changes, it\u2019s poor etiquette to slack on the clues and presume that they will get fixed in postproduction. Remember, editors will notice you \u2014 and love you \u2014 if you are clearly setting a high bar for your clues.So, let\u2019s get started on the nontheme fill. Here\u2019s the grid that Kevin Der and Paolo Pasco constructed in Part 3:So use the databases only as a springboard. This is your creation. Go in new directions, or put your own spin on something clever that was used two years ago. Editors will relish and respect a unique voice and try to preserve its flavor. You may find when the puzzle is published that some of your favorites have been discarded or retooled into a more conventional mold. Don\u2019t take it personally! Any number of craftsmanship constraints may be at work. Cluing expertise is about more than just getting the difficulty right and brandishing puns. It\u2019s about a host of style issues, many of which will surface as we discuss a sampling of entries.WEINTRAUB: One stylistic side note, before we continue: As Deb said, it\u2019s common practice among constructors to put clues in brackets, [Like so]. We prefer to avoid quotation marks as they can be confusing; quotation marks are often used within clues themselves \u2014 in titles, or when indicating a spoken phrase. We used brackets earlier when discussing the clues for the theme entries and will continue using them for the fill clues. Also, to keep this article from becoming longer than the O.E.D, we won\u2019t address all 72 clues here. Instead, we will highlight ones that lend themselves to discussing rules and tips for good clue construction. The full clue list is at the end.WEINTRAUB and WILBER: Before we really dive into the cluing, there are some things that all constructors need to know. They are helpful for solvers, too, because knowing these rules may help you get your answers right.Singular entries get singular clues, noun entries get noun clues and plural entries get plural clues. We need to make sure we don\u2019t accidentally clue the plural FILMS at 34 Across as the singular [Movie], because that would be unfair to the solver; in some clues, we want to misdirect solvers, but we always play fair! Sometimes entries can act as more than one part of speech. It\u2019s your puzzle, and it\u2019s up to you to decide how you want to clue it, as long as your clue is good for the day of the week the puzzle is meant to run on. But the clue and the entry have to be consistent. For example, [College person with a \u201clist\u201d] is a good clue for DEAN, because both [College person] and DEAN are nouns.Are you confused yet? Here\u2019s one handy way to clear this up:For example, to clue CLIP (7 Down) as a verb, you would not typically say [Cut a coupon out] but rather [Cut out, as a coupon], since the coupon is not part of the definition. [Cut out of] also lacks some precision and wouldn\u2019t pass the substitution test. EACH (5 Across) could be clued with either [Per] or [Per person] \u2014 test it yourself! \u2014 or [A pop], but definitely not just [Pop].Every puzzle maker is pleased to find a factoid that could revitalize a common entry, but don\u2019t do that everywhere. Solvers will balk: \u201cToo much like an episode of \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019\u201d Yes, we want puzzles to draw from current events, pop culture and some subject knowledge, but a certain timelessness and an unfussy celebration of vocabulary are also important. Allow a way into each section of the puzzle. Be judicious about sprinkling in the real head scratchers. If, by chance, someone has never heard of either of the actress OLIVIA MUNN and the character DANA SCULLY in the upper right of our grid, be gentle when cluing the Across entries, like where MUNN crosses NYE.So, let\u2019s get this party started. Time to pull out a few clues to discuss.WEINTRAUB: 1 Across is as good a place as any to begin. CELT is either a sports reference or historically a person from Britain. A crossword constructor who is a sports fan might opt for a clue about the N.B.A. team. I am definitely not said constructor, so I go with [Early Brit]. No great insight into clue construction here, just a basic example of how each constructor brings a different point of view to the cluing process.WEINTRAUB: Interesting. That may be because Hoover was once used more ubiquitously as a synonym for a vacuum cleaner (\u00e0 la Xerox and Kleenex) and not just a brand of vacuum.WEINTRAUB: Brad raises an important point: You can\u2019t create a FITB clue to elicit part of a word. It\u2019s good only for whole words. EMU, at 37 Across, might be part of \u201cemulate,\u201d but you can\u2019t clue it [ ___late].WEINTRAUB: This is a plural entry, so make sure the clue matches: [Serfs] is good, but [Serf] is not. Because the word PEONS has a negative connotation, though, I\u2019m going to try to lighten it up. I land on [They\u2019re hardly muckety-mucks]. \u201cMuckety-muck\u201d is a silly term for a person of great importance. \u201cHardly\u201d here signals an opposite. This might be difficult for a Tuesday, but I\u2019d rather take a chance on an interesting and amusing clue rather than settle for something boring and overused. Of course, this version raises a different issue, because the word HARD (as part of HARD LENS) appears in the puzzle grid. Do I need to stay away from using \u201chardly\u201d? I personally am not bothered by the repetition because I think the two uses are sufficiently different, but for our purposes here I will err on the side of caution and flip it to [Muckety-mucks they\u2019re not]. Your thoughts, Brad?WEINTRAUB: So many options with this word. Is \u201cseat\u201d a noun or a verb? Is it a chair? Someone\u2019s rear end? A government position? Something an usher does? Because there are so many different angles to take, you can have fun with it. Challenge yourself to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before. I\u2019m thinking about an airline seat. I like [Cabin assignment], which is fairly obvious if you immediately pick up that I\u2019m talking about an airplane, but trickier if you don\u2019t.WILBER: Nice, nice, and if you wanted to make it a trifle easier still, you could say [Crisp square at a Seder].WEINTRAUB: As mentioned earlier, this puzzle contains many proper names. So I\u2019m looking for ways to clue a person\u2019s name as something other than a person. For GARY, I\u2019ll veer into geography, but still try to keep it lively. In fact, I feel a song coming on \u2026 [\u201c___, Indiana\u201d (\u201cThe Music Man\u201d)].WEINTRAUB: So there you have it, a sampling of suggestions and strategies for cluing theme and fill entries. At the end of this article, you can see the complete list of clues for the puzzle. One final technique that we haven\u2019t mentioned, but that plays an important role (for me, at least), is patience. Sometimes, despite all your talent and tools, the clues just don\u2019t come. I can feel there\u2019s a different approach to an entry out there, but I can\u2019t quite latch on to it. Often it needs to percolate in the brain for a while. And then suddenly while I\u2019m driving, or in the shower, or at the checkout line at the supermarket, that nugget of brilliance will come to me. I\u2019ve also said many times that invariably I come up with my very best clues right after I submit my puzzle to an editor. Once it\u2019s out of my hands and I no longer have the option to tinker with it, suddenly multiple light bulbs are flashing above my head and I am the most ingenious clue writer of all time.WEINTRAUB and WILBER: The best way to learn and improve over time is to practice. A lot. The more clues you write, the better you\u2019ll get at internalizing the rules, knowing what editors are looking for, and finding your individual style. Happy puzzle making! AMLEN: We finally have a completed crossword puzzle manuscript. A big thank you to our eight constructors \u2014 Ben Tausig, Finn Vigeland, Natan Last, David Steinberg, Paolo Pasco, Kevin Der, Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber \u2014 for all their hard work!PDFProofread your puzzle carefully, watching out for duplicate entries in the grid, and making sure there are no typos or duplicate words in the clues. The cleaner your work is, the more likely you are to make a good first impression on the editor.No. Puzzle editors are nice people, and they will give you a fair assessment of your puzzle.In fact, in the final part of this series, which will run August 8, we will listen in on a discussion between crossword puzzle editors Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano as they review the puzzle that our constructors have made. Mr. Shortz and Mr. Fagliano will also talk about the process they go through in deciding which puzzles make it to the pages of The New York Times, as well as the teamwork that makes up the editing process.

{"Headline": "Trump in Space", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s plans for a new military force could spur an extraterrestrial arms race and make combat in orbit more likely. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Unsatisfied with mere terrestrial disruption, or maybe just eager to change the subject yet again, President Trump recently seized on outer space, blindsiding the Pentagon with a directive to create a sixth branch of the military called the Space Force.Since then, space has become increasingly contested, jeopardizing the security of thousands of satellites that enable the Pentagon to locate enemies on the battlefield, verify arms control treaties and ensure an early warning if an adversary targets the country with an intercontinental ballistic missile. They guide aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, drones in the skies over Yemen and fighter jets over Syria. Many nations have valuable assets in orbit, but America has long dominated space and is most at risk if an adversary decides to knock out those satellites. Everything from the control of nuclear weapons to weather forecasting to cellphones could be affected, and officials admit that the United States is not adequately prepared for such a fight. Rather than leaping to a vast new military bureaucracy, Mr. Trump might consider starting with a precise understanding of what is needed for improved space defense. Does the Pentagon need to do a better job of buying satellites and harmonizing the assets among the military services? Of building satellites that are more resilient? Is space truly the future of American power projection, even warfare, and does that mean we need new weapons and forces? Regardless, one major element clearly missing from Mr. Trump\u2019s initiative is diplomacy that can make star wars less likely. China and Russia have proposed a legally binding treaty that would ban the use of force or weapons in space. But many experts consider such a pact unverifiable or even na\u00efve, given how aggressively both countries are developing their own capabilities.A more plausible course would be for China and Russia to work with the United States and the European Union to establish norms for responsible behavior in space, including not to test antisatellite weapons. The Obama administration left the Europeans in charge of drafting such standards, but that effort, while helpful, came to naught. For any truly constructive result, the United States must lead, regardless of Mr. Trump\u2019s disdain for multilateral negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tennis Players Get Ready to Be Put on the Clock (Visibly)", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 The Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt can complete a 200 meters in the time it takes the Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal to start some of his points.Nadal will often take 20 seconds or more to deliver his first serves, owing to a ritual that includes bouncing the ball a few times, tugging at his shorts, pinching the fabric on his left shoulder, then his right shoulder, bouncing the ball, swiping at his nose, his left ear, his nose, then his right ear, tucking his hair behind his left ear, then his right ear, and bouncing the ball a few more times.Nadal squeezes the clock the way he does the lines with his heavy topspin forehand. If he were a tennis writer, Nadal would check his Twitter feed, his email and his Facebook page between each paragraph of his deadline story, making his editors squirm as much as fans do in their seats at his matches, waiting for him to deliver.Nadal received two time-violation warnings during Wimbledon\u2019s first week, but that hasn\u2019t appreciably slowed him in his quest for a third title at the All England Club. It could be a different story next month at the United States Open, where a countdown clock between points will be introduced for the first time in the main draw of a Grand Slam event.Instead of officials\u2019 silently tracking time (and seeming to loosely enforce limits), the clock will tick off the seconds for all the fans to see \u2014 and count down out loud, if the alcoholic spirits move them. After the chair umpire announces the score, a server will have 25 seconds to start the next point.The United States Tennis Association, the ATP Tour and the WTA Tour announced Wednesday that the clock would be instituted at events leading up to the U.S. Open, including the Citi Open in Washington; the Mubadala Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose, Calif.; the Rogers Cup in Montreal and Toronto; and the Western & Southern Open outside Cincinnati.For most of the top players at Wimbledon, that means their next tournament will feature the serve clock, which is intended to improve the pace of play, an issue that has vexed many sports.Nadal, a 17-time major winner, isn\u2019t happy about the change.\u201cAll the matches that have been important in the history of our sport have been four hours, five hours,\u201d he said last week. \u201cTo play these kind of matches, you need time between points because you cannot play points in a row with long rallies, with emotional points, having only 25 seconds between.\u201dNadal\u2019s time-consuming ways have been an issue for years. In 2012, Roger Federer said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can go through a four-hour match with Rafa, and he never gets a time violation.\u201d Federer added, \u201cThere are times when they could be more firm because at the end of the day I don\u2019t know if fans are getting frustrated to watch five points that are going to take us five minutes.\u201dBut Nadal isn\u2019t alone in taking his time between points. Pacing the baseline and constantly using a towel to dry off are common stalling tactics in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game.Nadal also isn\u2019t alone in arguing that time is relative. Johanna Konta, the top British woman, suggested that allowances should be made for men playing a fifth set or for women stretched to a third. In a match in its third or fourth hour, Konta said, she hopes the chair umpires will show \u201csome humane judgment,\u201d and she added, \u201cI think there\u2019s got to be a bit of give and take there.\u201dBut Konta acknowledged that tennis can end up the big loser when a scintillating rally is followed by the server bouncing the ball two dozen times. While a player catches his breath, are fans tuning out?\u201cI think the way society is now, people are quite impatient,\u201d Konta said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to wait for things. I think everyone\u2019s looking for instant gratification. So I think it just speeds things up in that manner.\u201dNovak Djokovic, a 12-time major winner who during his service games often bounces the ball more than a point guard, said he appreciated the shot clock as an attempt to modernize what he called \u201ca very traditional sport.\u201dDjokovic said he was \u201cnot much against it,\u201d and added, \u201cEverybody is trying to get this new generation of people, young people, that are very, so to say, connected to the digital world, and the attention span is not maybe as it used to be.\u201dHis objection is with how the change was carried out \u2014 without seeking input from the players.\u201cPrior to making this kind of big decisions that are going to affect the play, they\u2019re going to affect the rhythm of a player, it\u2019s just important to have these conversations,\u201d he said.A member of the ATP Player Council, Djokovic added, \u201cWe are not participating in the conversation or decision making, and that\u2019s something that is really frustrating.\u201dSome of the Centre Court fans here could barely contain their grumbling at Djokovic\u2019s ball bouncing during his third-round victory against Kyle Edmund. And that was before Djokovic received a warning for excessive time after seeming to bounce the fuzz off the ball.One player standing above the shot-clock fray is Federer, who consistently puts the ball in play in less than 10 seconds. During his run to the quarterfinals here, he won a few of his service games in under a minute, proving his Swiss timing is impeccable.Advertisement"}

He didn\u2019t like the job, but he did like the town. When his old friend Will Hearst got in touch about editing a new California publication, Mr. Potts agreed on the condition he could stay put.The name Alta California has a bunch of connotations. It was the Spanish name for the Southwest. It was also the name of the first daily newspaper in California, whose most famous correspondent was Mark Twain.The new Alta\u2019s fourth issue is now out. It\u2019s a throwback to the sort of publication that flourished in the predigital age: an oversized, well-designed, copiously illustrated general interest magazine aimed at 40 million potential readers.The new issue features a piece by Reveal/The Center for Investigative Reporting about the devastating Wine Country fires last fall; a Q. and A. by Mr. Hearst with the state\u2019s first lady, Anne Gust Brown; a pictorial on artists at Burning Man; a helpful review of earthquake survival kits; and, perhaps most unexpectedly, an enthusiastic article on hunting.California magazines have had a tough time since the days of the original Alta. For all the trends started here and the good writing produced locally, the state has had trouble keeping major publications. Rolling Stone quickly fled for New York. New West began in a burst of enthusiasm in 1976, but went through various owners, and sputtered to an end as California magazine in 1991.Mr. Hearst, whose family owns The San Francisco Chronicle and many other media properties, is bankrolling Alta.\u201cThis is more of a philanthropic activity than a start-up that is going to put Facebook in trouble,\u201d he said. The magazine has a press run of 25,000 copies, which are sold in bookstores, newsstands and grocers and by subscription. There are only three full-time employees, including Mr. Potts.\u201cIn a lot of ways it\u2019s cheaper to do a print magazine now than hire a lot of people for a website where you\u2019re running around in circles trying to come up with something new to publish for Thursday, and then for Friday, and then for Saturday,\u201d Mr. Hearst said.Publishing only four times a year means Alta must forsake a topic preoccupying many other publications: President Trump.\u201cEveryone is obsessed by the news,\u201d Mr. Hearst said. \u201cI think that leaves a hole in the marketplace.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Nextdoor, a localized social media site founded in 2010, says it is now active in 175,000 neighborhoods.

{"Headline": "What Doesn\u2019t Kill Him Makes Him Stronger", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe more Trump lies, the more he is empowered to lie. Opinion ColumnistFacts don\u2019t matter to millions of Americans anymore. That is just the truth. Republicans bewitched by Donald Trump have devalued the import of truth. It is a sad truth and a dangerous one. What is the operational framework of a society when the truth ceases to be accepted as true?There may be precedents in other countries, but one would be hard pressed to find a precedent here. It is becoming clich\u00e9 now to say that we are in uncharted territory with Trump and his regime, but that is precisely where we are.There is tremendous possibility for peril, but luckily for Trump and the country, we have so far avoided all-out catastrophe. There is no guarantee that our lucky streak will be extended.Every day there is no catastrophe, every day yet another never-before-seen, outrageous scandal emerges from this administration and Trump is not destroyed by it, it strengthens him and numbs us and steels his supporters.The more he lies without paying a price for it, the more he weakens the power of the truth to defend right and condemn wrong. And he expands his latitude to lie more. Trump is experiencing something of a Superman Syndrome: Having survived so many episodes that would have destroyed another presidency, he has become ever more emboldened in his offenses because he comes to see himself as invincible. What doesn\u2019t kill him makes him stronger.\u201cWhen we first started this project for the president\u2019s first 100 days, he averaged 4.9 claims a day. But the average number of claims per day keeps climbing as the president nears the 500-day mark of his presidency. In the month of May, the president made about eight claims a day \u2014 including an astonishing 35 claims in his rally in Nashville on May 29.\u201dTrump has gone from making 4.9 false claims a day to now making 6.5 a day.It\u2019s not that this behavior is being normalized as much as it is becoming ritualized. There was applause and cheering from the crowd.Rather than the presidency imposing some sense of propriety on Trump, he has used the power of the position to project a sort of hypnotic disregard and amnesiac self-delusion upon the people who follow him. So much of what Republicans once said they believed has now been betrayed.Furthermore, Trump plays to a duality, a contradiction within his supporters: tough guy with a tender ego. He boasts about being strong while simultaneously whining about being assailed. His griping, in a weird way, is what fuels his gasconade. He insists to his supporters that he is being treated unfairly and their reflexive defense of him prevents them from even entertaining the fairest of criticisms. Indeed, the more Trump is rebuked by his opponents, the more his base rallies. That alleged affair happened soon after Melania Trump had given birth to the couple\u2019s son, and allegedly during the period that Trump is accused of having a sexual encounter with the porn star Stormy Daniels.This would have been a lethal revelation for any other president, but in these maddening Trump days, it becomes just another breach of faith, protocol, custom and possibly the law to toss on top of the ever-growing mound.Rather than cowering in shame at his deception and his unseemliness, Trump simply goes on the attack, tweeting outrage and indignation:\u201cWhat kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped \u2014 can this be so? Too bad!\u201dWe are all trapped, for the time being, held hostage by an empowered president, a self-neutered Congress, and a cultish horde of Trump voters.But it is the vote that is the most likely way to curb this rolling tragedy. The midterm elections are only a little more than 100 days away.Advertisement"}

In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it\u2019s purgatorial.The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn\u2019t try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It\u2019s a room for people who have outgrown illusions.That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I\u2019ve been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did.In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it\u2019s full of dishes worth planning a night around.Some of them don\u2019t look wildly impressive unless you know how they\u2019re made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs.Calf\u2019s liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that\u2019s not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell\u2019s flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter.The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it\u2019s that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties.The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they\u2019re classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs\u2019 fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn\u2019t quite hide.So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu\u2019s spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it\u2019s perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs.Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller \u201camuses\u201d often seem more tentative than the main courses.Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they\u2019re available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a cr\u00e8me-fra\u00eeche ranch dressing called \u201cFranchette\u201d didn\u2019t taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt.One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz.You\u2019d have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I\u2019ve seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn\u2019t held the other\u2019s head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it\u2019s probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn\u2019t scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Feminists Can Do for Boys", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe fought for young women in the patriarchy first. But budding patriarchs could use some help too.Ms. Valenti is the author of six books on feminism.Though feminists have always recognized the anguish that boys face in a patriarchal system, we haven\u2019t built the same structures of support for boys that we have for girls. If we want to stop young men from being taken in by sexism, that has to change. One of feminism\u2019s biggest successes was creating an alternative culture for girls and women seeking respite from mainstream constraints. Girls worried about unrealistic beauty standards, for example, can turn to the body positivity movement. Those of us who find traditional media\u2019s treatment of women unappealing can read feminist blogs and magazines; female college students who have critical questions about how gender shapes their lives can take women\u2019s studies classes. From social media campaigns to after-school equality clubs, feminism has birthed dozens of online and real-life spaces where girls can find alternatives to the sexist status quo. This gap has made boys susceptible to misogynist hucksters peddling get-manly-quick platitudes and dangerous online extremist communities.Online misogynist communities offer similarly dangerous advice to young men distressed over sexual rejection. Instead of teaching them that their value has nothing to do with their sexual experience \u2014 or that they are simply not entitled to sexual attention no matter how badly they want it \u2014 \u201cincel\u201d forums tell boys that the real problem is women\u2019s freedom. If women didn\u2019t have a choice, they say, then any man could have sex with whomever he liked. Feminist ideas can help men \u2014 be it the rejection of expectations that men be strong and stoic or ending the silence around male victims of sexual violence. But boys also need the same kind of culture we created for girls. There is an understandable feminist skepticism of claims that the culture is failing boys. White male leaders in government, corporations and institutions vastly outnumber women. Men have more cultural and economic power than women. And more often than not, assertions that young men are under siege are more about reinforcing traditional gender power dynamics than helping to see how those norms harm boys.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Truth About Cardinal McCarrick", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Catholic Church needs an inquest into what the pederast cardinal's colleagues knew, and when.Opinion ColumnistOne of the best things that the bishops of the American Catholic Church did during the great wave of sex abuse revelations 16 years ago \u2014 and yes, there\u2019s a low bar for \u201cbest\u201d \u2014 was to establish a National Review Board, staffed by prominent layman, with the authority to commission an independent report on what exactly had happened in the church. What happened to that young man happened to numerous seminarians and young priests as Father McCarrick became Bishop and then Archbishop McCarrick. The first written accusation (that we know of) was filed by one of his priests in 1994, addressed to McCarrick\u2019s successor as the Bishop of Metuchen; the priest who complained was transferred to another diocese while his abuser\u2019s rise continued. By the end of that decade, McCarrick\u2019s sexual misbehavior (if perhaps not its full scope) was known by enough people that a group of American laypeople went to Rome to petition against his appointment as archbishop of Washington, D.C., and at least one New York priest, Father Boniface Ramsey, sent a letter to the Vatican offering a similar warning.These petitions were in vain; McCarrick became Washington\u2019s archbishop and then a cardinal. At this point the sex abuse scandal broke in Boston, and elsewhere \u2014 and the Washington archbishop became the avuncular, reassuring media point person for his fellow bishops, issuing statements of concern and condemnation that if he really feared the punishments of hell would have turned to ashes in his mouth. In 2013, when Pope Benedict XVI resigned, McCarrick was too old to vote in the conclave but was active in the politicking. When Pope Francis was elected, he became an eminence grise, whose lobbying helped elevate several of the new pope\u2019s choices for high office in the American church \u2014 including the new cardinal archbishop of Newark, Joseph Tobin, and the head of the Vatican dicastery for family life, Kevin Farrell, both of whom considered McCarrick a mentor. In other words, two decades after McCarrick should have been removed from his offices, defrocked and handed over to the civil authorities, he was instead wielding remarkable influence in the church \u2026 right up until the moment when a lifetime\u2019s worth of crimes were finally dragged into the light.I think this long and sickening narrative should clarify why the McCarrick case, though \u201conly\u201d about one abuser, merits an expansive and public accounting of the facts. Over the course of multiple decades, across a period in which not just crimes but cover-ups devastated the moral credibility of the church\u2019s hierarchy, many important figures in Rome and the United States must have known that a man who embodied the official response to the scandal was as guilty as any of the priests whose conduct he pretended to deplore. Someone, or indeed many someones, needs to be held accountable for this disaster. And that accountability requires more than self-exculpating statements from the cardinals involved. It requires judgment \u2014 which requires more certain knowledge \u2014 which requires investigation \u2014 which probably requires an investigator with a mandate from the pope himself.Moreover, notwithstanding the cardinal\u2019s distinctive prominence and sins, the sex abuse scandal is probably of less interest to investigative reporters than it was in the early 2000s. There are several reasons for this \u2014 fatigue from the church\u2019s scandals and so many non-Catholic sex abuse stories since, the fact that Pope Francis is more popular with the press than his predecessors and thus a less inviting target, a discomfort with stories that might involve the outing of prominent clerics, the oxygen-devouring impact of the Trump presidency.But a crucial reason, and one whose ironies the leaders of the church should meditate upon, is that because of secularization and polarization and the bonfire they have made of their own moral authority, the Catholic bishops are now somewhat protected from media scrutiny by virtue of their increasing unimportance. There are a few American bishops still with media platforms, a few with intellectual chops. But many of the notional leaders of the church are important only within the bureaucracies they manage and as invisible to the average churchgoer as a Target regional vice president would be to the average weekend shopper at the superstore. The lukewarm in their flock simply ignore them; the zealous build new institutions specifically designed to evade their oversight. Their political interventions go unheeded by Catholic Democrats and Catholic Republicans alike. In far too many cases an office that once bestrode entire cities now belongs to invisible company men, embarrassed phantoms materializing via videotape for the annual appeal. Thus the great irony of the McCarrick moment \u2014 that the kind of crimes once covered up because of the power and influence of bishops might now be swept under quickly because of the episcopacy\u2019s obscurity and irrelevance.If they are happy enough with the world as it is, then we will have more empty statements of concern, more promises of a new process for accusations against bishops, more professions of innocence and ignorance. If they are not, if they can imagine a church with its moral authority restored, then we will have an independent investigation, an invitation for testimony and in the end the church\u2019s own imprimatur on the hard and heavy truth.An earlier version of this column gave incorrect biographical information about Joseph Tobin. He did not served as an auxiliary bishop under Cardinal McCarrick.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Fined in U.K. Over Cambridge Analytica Leak", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook was hit with the maximum possible fine in Britain for allowing the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the information of millions of people without their consent, in what amounts to the social network\u2019s first financial penalty since the data leak was revealed.The fine of 500,000 pounds, or about $660,000, represents a tiny sum for Facebook, which brings in billions of dollars in revenue every year. But it is the largest fine that can be levied by the British Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, an independent government agency that enforces the country\u2019s data-protection laws.In an initial report of its investigation on Tuesday, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it had concluded that \u201cFacebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people\u2019s information. It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how people\u2019s data was harvested by others.\u201dFacebook will have a chance to respond to the Information Commissioner Office\u2019s initial report. A full version of the report, thought to be coming on Wednesday, is expected to detail the ways in which data gleaned from social media companies is increasingly being used to target voters by political campaigns.Facebook did not answer a request for comment, and sent a written statement. In it, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said the Silicon Valley company was working with the British agency on its investigation and was reviewing the report.\u201cAs we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,\u201d Ms. Egan said in the statement.The report from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was the result of the closely fought campaign in Britain to leave the European Union. The report faulted both sides of the Brexit campaign for misusing online data to reach highly categorized segments of voters, and called for stricter policies to ensure the internet is not misused in future elections.With its findings, British authorities also took aim at Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate, the SCL Group. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said it was pursuing a criminal prosecution of SCL Elections Ltd., the company from which Cambridge Analytica was spun out, for not properly dealing with the agency\u2019s enforcement actions. Another company linked to Cambridge Analytica, Aggregate IQ, also faces punishment for its involvement.The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said the investigation was continuing, and the agency said it was waiting for responses from Facebook. The agency said it also sent out \u201cwarning letters\u201d to 11 political parties, compelling them to agree to audits of their own data practices.The chairman of a British parliamentary committee that is also investigating Facebook praised the findings of the data commissioner.\u201cFacebook users will be rightly concerned that the company left their data far too vulnerable to being collected without their consent by developers working on behalf of companies like Cambridge Analytica,\u201d said Damian Collins, the chairman of the panel conducting the investigation in the House of Commons. \u201cThe number of Facebook users affected by this kind of data scraping may be far greater than has currently been acknowledged.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from London, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rhino Embryos Made in Lab to Save Nearly Extinct Subspecies", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you had asked Thomas Hildebrandt a decade ago whether the northern white rhinoceros could be saved, his answer would have been grim. The rhino\u2019s numbers had dwindled to single digits, and the few remaining individuals all had severe reproductive issues.But on Wednesday, Dr. Hildebrandt and a team of colleagues reported in the journal Nature Communications that the story of the northern white rhino is not, in fact, over.This lab achievement is a very early step toward the much longer-term goal of resurrecting a population of full-blooded northern white rhinos, said Jan Stejskal, director of international projects at the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic and an author of the paper, in a press briefing on Tuesday.Multiple teams around the world are now working collaboratively on high-tech options for bringing back the northern white rhino, which is now functionally extinct. Only two females, a mother-daughter pair named Najin and Fatu, are still alive at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.One avenue is in vitro fertilization with northern white rhino eggs and sperm. This would involve producing early embryos in petri dishes that could then be transferred to develop in surrogate southern white rhinos, another subspecies.Dr. Hildebrandt and his collaborators started to investigate this possibility. They had frozen sperm samples from four northern white males, and successfully used one sample to fertilize eggs from two southern white females, creating four hybrid embryos in total. Additionally, they created three full southern white rhino embryos.If that succeeds, the researchers will appeal to Kenyan authorities to let them harvest eggs from Najin and Fatu, then fertilize the females\u2019 eggs with stored northern white rhino sperm. The team hopes to see the first purebred northern white rhino born to a surrogate through this method in three years, Dr. Hildebrandt said.The trade-off is that the iPS cell technology will take longer to develop \u2014 perhaps a decade or so, Dr. Hildebrandt estimated.In the meantime, it\u2019s important to pursue the more immediate possibility of in vitro fertilization with Najin and Fatu\u2019s eggs, he said, particularly if potential calves are to be raised around or socialized by the two northern white females in their lifetimes.Conservation scientists widely applauded the technical sophistication of the new study, but several expressed concerns about relying too much on high-tech solutions.Terri Roth, director of the Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife at the Cincinnati Zoo, said that saving the northern white rhino \u2014 or any species \u2014 will ultimately require multiple facets.\u201cWe should all be working on as many strategies as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not throw any one out, because you just can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen.

{"Headline": "U.S.-Funded Broadcaster Directed Ads to Americans", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA broadcasting organization backed by the federal government has used Facebook to target ads at United States citizens, in potential violation of longstanding laws meant to protect Americans from domestic propaganda.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which typically broadcasts to audiences in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, bought several ads on Facebook in recent days that were targeted at users in the United States. The ads included several human-interest stories about Russia and a graphic about NATO\u2019s popularity. As with other state-funded media organizations, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is mostly restricted by law from promoting its content in the United States except on request.The ads that ran on the organization\u2019s Facebook page were uncovered by a Syracuse University researcher, Jennifer M. Grygiel, who was able to view them because of a recent policy change by Facebook. In May, the social network began displaying more information about ads on its platform, including about where the ads were targeted and the buyers.It is unclear how many people saw the advertisements, or for how long the broadcaster has been directing them to Americans. The organization, which is overseen by a person appointed during the Obama administration, said in a statement that it had purchased the ads, as well as ads in 14 other countries, to reach Facebook users who spoke specific languages.After being contacted by The New York Times, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty pulled down the ads.Nasserie Carew, a spokeswoman for the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the agency that oversees state-funded media organizations, said in a statement that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty had \u201cceased the practice\u201d of targeting ads at people in the United States after her group\u2019s management had discussions with the broadcaster.\u201cNone of the B.B.G. networks should be distributing or promoting our content domestically in order to develop or grow domestic audiences,\u201d Ms. Carew said. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, she said, tries to target English speakers. Some citizens in repressive countries use tools that route their internet traffic through United States servers to view foreign content, she said, which can make them appear to be Americans. But she said that the ads should not have been targeted at people in the United States.She added that the B.B.G. recently appointed a chief technology officer \u201cdue to the complexity of working on different social media platforms.\u201dOne post promoted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s Facebook page showed a graphic with approval numbers for NATO around the world. It included the caption: \u201cThe majority of people surveyed in Greece and Turkey have unfavorable views of NATO.\u201d The ad ran on July 13, just after President Trump criticized numerous NATO members at a summit meeting in Brussels.A third ad, which ran on the broadcaster\u2019s Facebook page in early July, showed Russian soccer fans celebrating the country\u2019s World Cup victory over Spain.None of these posts was labeled a political ad by Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Because they were not categorized as political ads, the amount spent on them was not disclosed, and they do not appear in Facebook\u2019s ad archive.\u201cState-funded media is inherently political \u2014 it should all be documented in Facebook\u2019s political ad database,\u201d said Professor Grygiel, who discovered the broadcaster\u2019s domestic ads. \u201cI hope that Congress will review this, and I hope Facebook will change their policies and product.\u201dRob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management for ads, said that the company was looking at offering more details about pages that run ads, including country information.Two ads that ran on the broadcaster\u2019s page were labeled political ads. One, a post about an anti-tank missile system given to Ukraine by the United States, was targeted mainly at users in Britain and the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The other, a sponsored story about a Russian lawmaker who warned World Cup attendees against having sex with tourists during the tournament, was targeted at users in Europe.Both ads were taken down by Facebook because they did not come from an account that had gone through an authorization process to post political ads.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of government efforts to try to influence public opinion in the United States through the B.B.G. and its affiliate entities,\u201d Mr. Sager said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to read a tweet by Donald Trump. It\u2019s another to receive a very polished news story from an organization that holds itself out as objective and fact-based.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Fighting Injustice to Facing Death Row: The Bizarre Case of Pastor Glasgow", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe local media in Dothan, a small, unprepossessing city in Alabama\u2019s Wiregrass region, have long followed his story of reinvention from felon to do-gooder who hand-delivered meals, organized unity marches and \u2014 in a place where few were willing to speak out \u2014 crusaded against brutality and racism.Nowadays, though, one thing tops the search results: a mug shot, his eyes hooded, his white goatee jutting out at a defiant angle.In March, Mr. Glasgow was charged with capital murder.And then there is the fact that he did not actually kill anyone.The police say that a passenger in a car that Mr. Glasgow was driving got out and fatally shot another motorist. Under Alabama\u2019s complicity law, also known as the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d statute, an accomplice to a crime is just as guilty as the main actor. To make their case against Mr. Glasgow, prosecutors must prove that he knew, or reasonably should have known, that violence was going to occur. He says he had no idea.\u201cI don\u2019t do violence,\u201d he said when I went down to Dothan to hear the story firsthand. \u201cTo know that I\u2019m the cause, or involved in, a black woman\u2019s death? It\u2019s like the death of me, really.\u201dMr. Stokes and Mr. Glasgow have a history that is Dothanesque. They have been adversaries \u2014 Mr. Glasgow, who is black, once protested when Mr. Stokes, who is white, chained two African-American bail-bond clients to the courthouse doors. Mr. Stokes was convicted of misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment, and complained that Mr. Glasgow had unduly made a racial issue out of it.But it all turned out to be nothing personal: Mr. Glasgow has now requested Mr. Stokes\u2019s investigative services on his very bizarre case.Here\u2019s what happened: On Sunday, March 25, Mr. Glasgow was in the Bottom, the poor neighborhood where he does much of his work, with a friend known as Little John. A young man, Jamie Townes, who Mr. Glasgow says was an acquaintance, approached and reported that his car was missing. Mr. Glasgow believed he had seen the car, a Monte Carlo, a few blocks away.Mr. Townes, a woman named Choyce Bush, Little John and Mr. Glasgow got into the car Mr. Glasgow was driving that day, a borrowed brand-new Toyota Camry, to go look for it.The Monte Carlo had gone on a wild ride, careening through church grounds, fields and ditches, knocking over a street sign and ramming into a tree in someone\u2019s front yard. Finally, with its hood popped open, blocking the driver\u2019s view, it plowed into the front of the Camry on the driver\u2019s side.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find the car,\u201d Mr. Glasgow said. \u201cThe car found us.\u201dAfter the collision, Mr. Townes got out of the back seat of the Camry and, the police say, began firing at the driver of the Monte Carlo, who everyone assumed was a man.It turned out to be Breunia Jennings, a young woman with a long history of mental illness, who in the preceding hours had cut her hair short, fled from a motel barefoot and barely dressed, donned men\u2019s clothing and, apparently, found Mr. Townes\u2019s car with the motor running. The police now believe that she was driving so erratically because she was being chased.There\u2019s more to the story. Mr. Glasgow says that not only did the Monte Carlo hit the Camry from the front, but another vehicle hit the Camry from behind. (Ms. Bush also told the police about a rear-end collision, and Mr. Townes said he was \u201cpunch drunk\u201d from \u201cmultiple collisions,\u201d according to police testimony.) The Camry did suffer some rear damage, but no third vehicle was ever found.Thinking there was some sort of ambush in progress, Mr. Glasgow says, he ducked, and did not see the shooting. Nor, he says, was he aware that Mr. Townes had gotten out of the car.Dothan is a city where judgment is swift and punishment can be harsh. It is the seat of Houston County, which ranks among the top 10 in the nation for death row convictions. It has a relatively new district attorney; the previous one was known for striking African-Americans from juries.But at Mr. Glasgow\u2019s preliminary hearing, where he appeared in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, Judge Benjamin Lewis seemed dubious that criminal charges were warranted.Judge Lewis took the rare step in a capital murder case of allowing Mr. Glasgow to post bond. A grand jury will decide whether to indict him.While he waits, the police, some local news coverage and the Dothan rumor mill have portrayed him as callous and indifferent. Much has been made of the fact that he did not call the police to report the Monte Carlo missing, nor did he call 911 after the accident.To the first point, Mr. Glasgow says, he and his passengers believed the car had been taken by a friend. To the second, the police arrived at the scene moments after the shooting, so he says there was no need to call them.There has been surprisingly little controversy over what may be the most unflattering part of the episode: Mr. Glasgow spent the minutes after the accident trying to commit insurance fraud. The Camry\u2019s owner was concerned that her insurance would not cover the accident, so she hurried to the scene in order to stand in as the driver.At the time, Mr. Glasgow says, he did not know that anyone had died.When Mr. Glasgow learned, hours later at the police station, that the situation was far more serious than just a car wreck, he says he promptly confessed to having been the driver.Mr. Glasgow, 53, says he did not know that Mr. Townes, 27, had a gun. Even so, prosecutors may try to argue that it was reasonable to expect that Mr. Townes, who the police say is a drug dealer, would commit violence. Mr. Townes had previous state charges for theft and drug possession, but not for violent offenses.Mr. Townes\u2019s lawyer, James Parkman III, says his client fired in self-defense, pointing to a Facebook post in which Ms. Jennings said she was going to \u201cstab and shoot\u201d and \u201ccatch a murder case.\u201dIn the eyes of the police, Mr. Glasgow\u2019s association with Mr. Townes is suspicious. But helping people with unsavory pasts is Mr. Glasgow\u2019s calling. It was some two decades ago, during Mr. Glasgow\u2019s most recent of several stints in prison, that he and a friend conceived of a ministry focused on addiction, poverty and life after incarceration. They called it The Ordinary People Society.\u201cThe real story of what happens in America happens in these small towns, and in these small towns there are people whose rights have been completely upended,\u201d said Asha Bandele, until recently a senior director at the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped finance Mr. Glasgow\u2019s work for years.Dothan\u2019s population is about one-third African-American, but the city has an entrenched white power structure: It has never had a black mayor, police chief, circuit judge, county sheriff or school superintendent. It is the type of place where, if you call the police chief or the district attorney with a complaint, he may offer to pray with you right there on the line. In part through the common ground of Christianity, Mr. Glasgow has been able to forge some relationships with white businessmen who help pay for his work.But where some see an advocate, many others \u2014 particularly white people in town \u2014 see a charlatan. The murder charge complicated matters. Though his hearing was packed with supporters, some African-American residents have turned against Mr. Glasgow as well.The city was teeming with unfounded rumors: That Mr. Townes was actually Mr. Glasgow\u2019s son. That they were in cahoots as drug kingpins. That Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Townes had terrorized and raped Ms. Jennings, then hunted her down. I heard that one from Ms. Jennings\u2019 mother, Lakesia Reeves, who said she heard it from an anonymous caller.In that environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Glasgow, too, would believe he is being deliberately targeted. For his opponents, he says, restoring voting rights to felons was bad enough, he says, but the victory of Mr. Jones, a Democrat, in the Senate race was the final straw. \u201cThey want me dead,\u201d he insisted.Accustomed to being an activist for others, Mr. Glasgow now finds himself without a champion of his own. But as he awaits the grand jury\u2019s decision, he has found a new crusade: changing the accomplice law.\u201cI did my time for what I did,\u201d he said, speaking of previous armed robbery and drug convictions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My host took me at sunrise to a farm near Istanbul, where we picked the flowers while they were still open and ready to be stuffed. (Later on in the day, the hot sun causes them to close up again.) The unbelievable glut of flowers was filled with rice, minced lamb and herbs and then piled up in a pot and cooked for over an hour.

Mr. Kennedy is a law professor at Harvard.In the gym at Paul Junior High School in Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1968, not that long before the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I asked a buddy whether he was interested in a certain girl. He told me that he was not because she was too dark. He and I were African-American. (Then we would have called ourselves Negro.) So was she. All of us supported the Civil Rights Movement and idolized Dr. King, yet I did not hold my friend\u2019s color-struck judgment against him. And he did not state his opinion with embarrassment. We had both internalized our society\u2019s derogation of blackness. Indeed, we luxuriated in the denigration, spending hours trading silly, recycled but revealing insults: \u201cYo mama so black, she blend in with the chalkboard.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, yo mama so black, she sweats chocolate.\u201dIt was precisely because of widespread colorism that James Brown\u2019s anthem \u201cSay It Loud, I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud\u201d posed a challenge, felt so exhilarating, and resonated so powerfully.It still does. Much has changed over the past half century. But, alas, the need to defend blackness against derision continues. The song, written with Mr. Brown\u2019s bandleader, Alfred Ellis, was released in August 1968, several months after the assassination of Dr. King. It shot to the top of the Billboard magazine rhythm and blues singles chart, where it remained for six weeks. I still remember the thrill of singing along with Soul Brother Number One that first summer. I have done so hundreds of times since. Various musicians in the 1960s tapped into yearnings for black assertiveness, autonomy and solidarity. Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions sang \u201cWe\u2019re a Winner.\u201d Sly and the Family Stone offered \u201cStand.\u201d Sam Cooke (and Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding) performed \u201cA Change is Gonna Come.\u201d But no entertainer equaled Brown\u2019s vocalization of African-Americans\u2019 newly triumphal sense of self-acceptance.That Brown created the song most popularly associated with the Black is Beautiful movement is ironic. He generally stayed away from protest, endorsed the presidential re-election of Richard Nixon, lavishly praised Ronald Reagan, and consistently lauded Strom Thurmond. At the very time that in \u201cSay It Loud,\u201d Brown seemed to be affirming Negritude, he also sported a \u201cconk\u201d \u2014 a distinctive hairdo that involved chemically removing kinkiness on the way to creating a bouffant of straightened hair. Many African-American political activists, especially those with a black nationalist orientation, decried the conk as an illustration of racial self-hatred. For a brief period, Brown abandoned the conk and adopted an Afro, but that was only temporary. The conk was part of the characteristic look of \u201cThe Godfather of Soul.\u201dHow would it end? Ain\u2019t got a friendMy only sin is in my skinWhat did I do to be so black and blue?Even though by 1968 uprisings against white supremacism had been erupting for a decade with great intensity and success \u2014 the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Childrens\u2019 Crusade in Birmingham, the protest against disfranchisement in Selma \u2014 prejudice against blackness remained prevalent, including among African-Americans. In my neighborhood, calling someone \u201cblack\u201d was an insult, often the trigger to a fight. Our disparagement of \u201cblack\u201d derived from a centuries-long development that Winthrop D. Jordan describes in \u201cWhite Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro 1550-1812.\u201d He shows, in excruciating detail, how blackness \u201cserved as an easily grasped symbol of the Negro\u2019s baseness and wickedness.\u201d Wielded ferociously by whites, this symbol inflicted hidden injuries that scarred every strata of African-American society. In his memoir, \u201cSoul on Ice,\u201d published in 1968, Eldridge Cleaver recounts a fellow prison inmate\u2019s scornful dismissal of African-American women: \u201cI don\u2019t want nothing black but a Cadillac.\u201d He remembers another one remarking, that if \u201cmoney was black, I wouldn\u2019t want none of it.\u201d For purposes of collective self-identification, African-Americans took to calling themselves \u201cblack\u201d as opposed to \u201cNegro\u201d or \u201ccolored.\u201d Negro Digest was renamed Black World. Negro History Week was superseded by Black History Month. Students demanded the establishment of black studies programs. In his final book, \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here?,\u201d Dr. King also embraced the reclamation of blackness. One \u201cmust not overlook,\u201d he insisted, \u201cthe positive value in calling the Negro to a new sense of manhood, to a deep feeling of racial pride and to an audacious appreciation of his heritage.\u201d He went on to say that a black man \u201cmust stand up amid a system that still oppresses him and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of his own value. He must no longer be ashamed of being black.\u201dThe reclamation of blackness in the sixties made tremendous headway quickly. By 1970 my friend would not have dared to repeat out loud what he had told me unapologetically two years before. Here, as elsewhere, however, changes wrought by the black liberation movement, though impressive, were only partial. Nearly four decades after the release of \u201cSay It Loud,\u201d Professors Jennifer Hochschild and Vesla Weaver, having synthesized the pertinent academic literature, declared authoritatively that compared to their lighter-skinned counterparts, dark-skinned blacks continue to be burdened by lower levels of education, income, and job status. They receive longer prison sentences and are less likely to own homes or to marry. Filmmakers, advertisers, modeling agencies, dating websites and other key gatekeepers demonstrate repeatedly the ongoing pertinence of the old saw: If you\u2019re black get backIf you\u2019re brown, stick aroundIf you\u2019re white you\u2019re all rightIntra-racial colorism in Black America is often seen as a topic that should, if possible, be avoided, especially in \u201cmixed company.\u201d That sense of embarrassment three decades ago prompted officials at Morehouse College to demand that Spike Lee cease filming on campus once they learned that his movie was exposing, among other things, black collegiate colorism. The impulse toward avoidance remains strong. With racial prejudice against all African-Americans still a potent force, many would just as soon ditch the discussion of \u201cblack on black\u201d complexional bias. Colorism, however, remains a baleful reality. The urgency with which it needs to be confronted is evident in moving speeches from the actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o about learning to appreciate her dark skin. It is evident, too, in Kendrick Lamar\u2019s insistence that dark-skinned women also be featured in videos showcasing his music. Half a century after James Brown\u2019s proclamation, it remains imperative to assert what should have been assumed and uncontroversial all along: that black is beautiful and as worthy of pride and care and consideration as any other hue.Advertisement"}

Some said they left their husbands to be with him after he said he loved them. Now they could be together, the women told him.\u201cThey\u2019re handing me a letter, you know, \u2018Here\u2019s the divorce papers. I\u2019ve left so and so,\u2019\u201d Mr. Moore, 38, said. \u201cIf I check my inbox right now, I\u2019d have hundreds of these messages. But I try not to check it, because it disheartens me.\u201dThe sheer volume of social media impostors poses a challenge to even the wealthiest celebrities. In a video last year, Oprah Winfrey warned her Twitter followers that \u201csomebody out there is trying to scam you using my name and my avatar on social media, asking for money.\u201dIt was an unusual step. Harriet Seitler, chief marketing officer for the Oprah Winfrey Network, said her team only reports Ms. Winfrey\u2019s social media impersonators that try to sell tickets to shows or to solicit donations when they gain traction.\u201cThere\u2019s way too many to try to actively police them day in and day out,\u201d Ms. Seitler said.Brazilian soccer player Neymar was the subject of the most fake accounts, 1,676. Pop star Selena Gomez was second, with 1,389, according to the analysis, which was completed in April and did not count explicit parody or fan pages. Beyonc\u00e9 had 714 impersonators; Ms. Swift had 233, the least among the group.\u201cIt\u2019s just a Band-Aid,\u201d Mr. Moore said.Facebook and its Instagram unit said they were cracking down on fake accounts. The social network said it had recently added software that automatically detected impostors and frauds, which it used to remove more than one million accounts since March.\u201cFacebook and Instagram are really powerful ways to connect, and because of that, you have no shortage of people trying to use those systems in nefarious ways,\u201d said Scott Dickens, a Facebook product manager who develops tools to fight hoaxes. \u201cThose sets of people will continue to get smarter to evade detection capabilities that we put in place.\u201dHow easy is it to impersonate someone online? To find out, I created my own impostors.For those at home: I do not recommend doing this. Making fake social media accounts, even of yourself, is forbidden by the companies\u2019 terms of service. After I made the accounts, I also informed the companies so that the profiles could be removed.On the fifth account, Facebook blocked me from using my name. I thought the jig was up. Then I added a middle initial, and the profile was approved. Later, I deleted the middle initial. After I had created eight fake accounts, Facebook began requiring a phone number. So I waited a few days and then created three more.The fake accounts were live for five days before I reported them via Facebook\u2019s site. The company removed them all within minutes.I then reported the 10 accounts to Instagram. The photo-sharing site removed five after a day. The other five were still active more than four days later.Twitter was better. After I successfully created one impostor, the company blocked me from using my actual profile photo on a second phony account. The company quickly removed the impersonator when I reported it.I could have created many more accounts if I was willing to pay to do so. Dozens of websites reviewed by The Times sell bulk Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. Scam artists can pick from detailed menus: accounts with friends, attached to phone numbers or with unique profile photos. Fake accounts that look more established and were typically created years ago, known as aged accounts, fetch $5 to $40 each.And if you are ready to buy? The vendors accept Bitcoin.For many celebrities, the flood of fake social media accounts can cause real-life headaches.Trace Adkins, the country music singer, said he had encountered people at nearly every show who claimed that in online messages, he had promised them free tickets and a backstage tour.\u201cIt\u2019s just exasperating, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything anybody can \u2026 \u201d he said in an interview on Thursday before a concert in Fayetteville, Ga., his voice trailing off. \u201cMy tour manager just walked on the bus and said it just happened.\u201dWomen regularly tell Mr. Adkins he had proposed to them online. \u201cI mean it\u2019s off-the-charts crazy, man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people believe this stuff and we have to deal with it.\u201dWhen I messaged an Instagram account pretending to belong to Mr. Adkins, the impostor directed me to a profile impersonating the singer\u2019s daughter. The account, which had posted numerous photos of the college-age Ms. Adkins, said she had started a charity and sent me a photo of a man in a hospital bed.Whoever was behind the fake account then asked for a donation \u201cto pay a dying man\u2019s hospital bill.\u201d The sum? $14,700. When I demurred, the impostor wrote snippily, \u201cAre you willing to help us with money or what?\u201dMr. Adkins said of the account posing as his daughter: \u201cI would like to hunt that guy down and give him a beating.\u201d He said his team had contacted the F.B.I. and the social media companies, to no avail.\u201cIt falls on deaf ears,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know there are hundreds of fake accounts and they don\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dMr. Moore said the fake accounts had weighed on him. He recently got a message from a man who said his wife was leaving him for Mr. Moore after she had started a relationship with the singer online. When he clicked on the woman\u2019s profile, he found a 60-year-old mother of five.\u201cHow can it not bother me?\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cI have people like, \u2018You\u2019re the biggest scumbag ever. You were doing this, messaging my mom or whatever.\u2019 It\u2019s a disheartening thing, when you\u2019re viewed a certain way by people that has nothing to do with your character in real life.\u201dJames Martin, a Jesuit priest and author with 571,000 followers on Facebook, said imitators sent messages to his followers soliciting donations or \u201cthey\u2019ll start posting horrible things in my name,\u201d like criticism of Catholic charities.\u201cThere is a special place in hell reserved for people like that,\u201d he said.\u201cKatt Williams starts saying things to the fake Dave Chappelle that\u2019s hurting the real Dave Chappelle\u2019s feelings,\u201d Mr. Chappelle recounted on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 2014.Mr. Chappelle said he was worried when he later encountered Mr. Williams at an event. Mr. Chappelle said he told Mr. Williams he did not have a Twitter account. \u201cSo?,\u201d Mr. Williams replied. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual. I don\u2019t have a Twitter page either.\u201dOne of the social media companies\u2019 main defenses against fake accounts is users, whom they ask to report suspicious activity. Facebook recently added an option to report profiles as impostors.To conclude my experiment, I reported more than 30 celebrity impostor accounts to the companies \u2014 including all the examples cited in this article \u2014 to see what would happen.I received responses to only six of those reports, all from Instagram. They included two Mr. Moore impersonators and a phony Ms. Winfrey, with 727 followers, which had posted images of sick and poor children and had asked for donations. Instagram said the accounts did not violate its policies. There was no option to appeal.Instagram removed one account that I flagged, which impersonated Ms. Swift, although the company did not notify me.\u201cWe take the reports really seriously,\u201d said Pete Voss, a Facebook and Instagram spokesman, adding that the company would remove the other accounts I had reported. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get it 100 percent right every time obviously.\u201dIan Plunkett, a Twitter spokesman, said the company had \u201cstrict policies and enforcement procedures\u201d regarding impersonation, and he directed me to the company\u2019s rules.Mr. Dickens, the Facebook product manager, said the company was trying to stamp out every pretender but that the task was complicated by the social network\u2019s size; the nuance of separating imitators from fan pages; and the sophistication of some of the impostors.\u201cIt\u2019s the arms race,\u201d he said.Facebook is fighting much of this arms race against people in West Africa. People who report bogus accounts said they had tracked many of the internet protocol addresses connected to them to Nigeria or Ghana, where those behind the fake accounts call themselves Yahoo Boys.One Nigerian man who advertises training for Yahoo Boys said in a phone interview that Facebook had gotten better at removing impostors but that Instagram had not. The man, who declined to be identified because his activity could be criminal, said he had run romance schemes by impersonating young female celebrities like Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice.Those schemes were not as lucrative as pretending to be another kind of celebrity, though. \u201cPorn star is better,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blood Pressure Medicine Is Recalled", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree companies that sell the generic drug, valsartan, in the United States agreed to recall it after the F.D.A. said it might be tainted by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), considered a probable human carcinogen. The agency is still investigating, but said the contamination was believed to be related to changes in the way that valsartan was manufactured.All of the valsartan that is being recalled was made in China by the same company, Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. It is distributed in the United States by three companies: Major Pharmaceuticals; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.; and Solco Healthcare. Solco, which is owned by Huahai Pharmaceutical, had about 45 percent of the market in 2017, according to John Brito, of Fore Pharma, the market research firm.\u201cWe have carefully assessed the valsartan-containing medications sold in the United States, and we\u2019ve found that the valsartan sold by these specific companies does not meet our safety standards,\u201d said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \u201cThat is why we\u2019ve asked these companies to take immediate action to protect patients.\u201dThe agency advised patients taking the drug to look at the manufacturer\u2019s name on the label of their prescription bottle to determine if it is part of the recall. If the information is not there, patients should contact the pharmacy where they got it, the F.D.A. said.The agency also said that patients taking valsartan, or medicines that use it as an ingredient, should continue taking it until they have a substitute. Their health care provider should be able to offer other treatment options, among them, another valsartan product that is not part of the recall. Other companies that market the drug, not subject to the recall, are Sun Pharma, Mylan, Jubiliant, Aurobindo and Hetero, according to Fore Pharma.\u201cThe recall is huge, based on the volume and the large number of patients it could have impacted,\u201d said Mr. Brito, \u201cbut we believe this could get offset by other players stocking up in short term. Switch options are available for a hypertension patient.\u201dThe safety of imported drugs has long been debated. The F.D.A. said it would continue to investigate the levels of NDMA in the recalled products, determine the possible effect on patients who have been taking them, and assess what measures can be taken to reduce or eliminate the impurity from future batches.Solco declined to comment, but in a news release, acknowledged that the recall stemmed from detection of a trace amount of NDMA. A spokesman for Major Pharmaceuticals said they were recalling several lots and referred other questions to Teva, which supplies valsartan that they package and sell. Teva did not return calls for comment.Dr. Harry Lever, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said he was concerned about quality control of generic medicines, like valsartan, made in China and India. He believes that manufacturers should be more transparent about where their active ingredients are made.\u201cIt\u2019s not just valsartan,\u201d Dr. Lever said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming very difficult for me to write prescriptions at all. There are so many drugs that are coming in from India and China and companies are buying and selling each other and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s what.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why Is Transport Such a Nightmare?", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York City Council considers a package of bills to freeze the number of Uber-type cars on city streets. But that\u2019s at best a partial answer to a systemic crisis. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The legislation before the City Council aims to address the problems in the taxi and for-hire car business \u2014 the part of the transportation breakdown that the city can fix without the help of state lawmakers, who control the subway and bus system through the M.T.A. Two bills stand out: one to impose a yearlong limit on new for-hire cars, the category of vehicles that includes Uber, Lyft, Via and other app-based companies, and another to authorize the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission to establish a minimum wage for drivers who work for those businesses. In reality, this cap would do little on its own to reduce congestion or improve the lives of drivers. There are already so many for-hire vehicles in the city that merely reducing the number of new cars that come onto the roads temporarily would not change much. If anything, it could encourage some drivers to spend even more time in Manhattan where they are more likely to get fares and less time in mass transit-starved parts of the city. In addition, people who want to start driving for Uber and Lyft would find other ways to do so, like renting licensed cars from other drivers or fleet owners \u2014 a practice that is already common with yellow taxis. Uber cars that currently spend seven or eight hours on the road could be used twice as long if new licenses become hard to get. The city also ought to consider changes that would help yellow cabdrivers earn a living wage, too. The taxi commission, for example, can increase metered fares, which it last raised in 2012. By many measures \u2014 population growth, jobs, tourism, property values \u2014 New York is booming. Yet, it lacks an efficient and fair transportation system. City and state officials have for too long neglected that failure and blamed each other for not doing enough. They need to work together to set things right. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maggie Haberman: Why I Needed to Pull Back From Twitter", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisThe viciousness, toxic partisan anger and intellectual dishonesty are at all-time highs. Ms. Haberman has covered Donald Trump for The New York Times since 2015.WASHINGTON \u2014 I woke up last Sunday morning feeling anxiety in my chest as I checked the Twitter app on my phone, scrolling down to refresh, refresh, refresh. There was a comment I started to engage with \u2014 I opened a new post, tapped out some words, then thought better of it and deleted the tweet. The same thing happened repeatedly for the next two hours. The evening before, I had complained to a close friend that I hated being on Twitter. It was distorting discourse, I said. I couldn\u2019t turn off the noise. She asked what was the worst that could happen if I stepped away from it. There was nothing I could think of. And so just after 6 p.m. last Sunday, I did.After nearly nine years and 187,000 tweets, I have used Twitter enough to know that it no longer works well for me. I will re-engage eventually, but in a different way. With exception of breaking news and my own stories, taking a break from this platform. No reason or prompt other than that it\u2019s not really helping the discourse.Twitter has stopped being a place where I could learn things I didn\u2019t know, glean information that was free from errors about a breaking news story or engage in a discussion and be reasonably confident that people\u2019s criticisms were in good faith.The viciousness, toxic partisan anger, intellectual dishonesty, motive-questioning and sexism are at all-time highs, with no end in sight. It is a place where people who are understandably upset about any number of things go to feed their anger, where the underbelly of free speech is at its most bilious.Twitter is now an anger video game for many users. It is the only platform on which people feel free to say things they\u2019d never say to someone\u2019s face. For me, it had become an enormous and pointless drain on my time and mental energy.I wasn\u2019t always a Twitter devotee. During the 2012 campaign, the first during which Twitter was widely used by journalists and campaign aides, I became something of a scold to younger reporters who I thought misused the medium.But Twitter has a staccato allure for those of us who need frequent inputs and have grown accustomed to them in the Trump era, with news cycles that last roughly three hours.And so I tried it. And kept trying it. I got to promote my own stories. I got to provide context. Eventually I started adding more of my voice, dipping my toes in the water to see if I could stand the temperature. I got to defend my reporting and defend my colleagues. I received instant feedback. I met people through Twitter whom I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Readers sent me story tips over direct message. Many pointed out errors, but most did it respectfully, and I was appreciative. There was an art to this medium, and I thought I\u2019d figured it out. But the medium has changed. Everyone I follow on the site seems to be tweeting more frequently, so I had to check in more frequently. No matter the time of day or night, I felt like I had to plug back into the Matrix, only to be overwhelmed by the amount of content.More recently, instead of engaging in thoughtful debates, I found myself spending an increasing amount of time explaining an errant word or a poorly phrased tweet, and coming off defensive as I did it. At other times, I watched as an offhand comment became tinder for a divisive national conversation.On Twitter, everything is shrunk down to the same size, making it harder to discern what is a big deal and what is not. Tone often overshadows the actual news. All outrages appear equal. And that makes it harder for significant events \u2014 like Mr. Trump\u2019s extraordinarily pliant performance with President Vladimir Putin of Russia \u2014 to break through.But here\u2019s the thing: Most of us don\u2019t want to be part of the story. To be clear, Twitter is a useful and important platform. It\u2019s a good aggregator for breaking news. I still check my feed to see breaking news developments, and I will continue to. And it is democratic \u2014 everyone gets to have a voice, whether they work for a local paper, a small TV station or one of the biggest newspapers in the world, or are not in the media business at all. The downside is that everyone is treated as equally expert on various topics. Across Twitter, there\u2019s a raging debate about the role that journalists should be playing in the current moment. It is mostly waged by partisans who want to accuse journalists of malpractice or who want us to be the \u201copposition party,\u201d as Mr. Trump has claimed. There is an important discussion about journalism that must take place, including about how all of us performed during the 2016 campaign, but Twitter is not where a nuanced or thoughtful discussion can happen.In the more than 20 months since President Trump was elected, I have gained close to 700,000 Twitter followers. I consider myself fortunate to have had such a broad audience. I mostly enjoyed being able to interact with readers and suspect I will again someday.It just won\u2019t be soon.Advertisement"}

He had lived in Asmara, Eritrea\u2019s capital, for five years and would tell her about the good food, the clean streets and the friendly people.\u201cI used to think, \u2018Wow, this is a place I want to see once in my life,\u2019 and this couldn\u2019t happen for the past 20 years because of the war,\u201d Ms. Gomeju said.When she heard the news that a peace agreement had been reached, she was eager to share her excitement with Eritreans.\u201cIt was like a dream come true, and when I saw that the land line was working, I said, O.K., who should I call?\u201d Ms. Gomeju said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone there, and I\u2019m not from that area. I don\u2019t know the language, but I felt I should call someone.\u201dSo she searched online for hotels in Asmara and dialed one of the numbers.The woman on the other end of the line spoke another language \u2014 Tigrinya, a language spoken by many in Eritrea \u2014 but Ms. Gomeju handed the phone to a friend who translated. The woman at the hotel in Asmara said that she, too, was excited and happy to be speaking with someone in Ethiopia.\u201cWhen someone answered my call, I couldn\u2019t believe it, did I really call Asmara?\u201d Ms. Gomeju said. \u201cIt is a moment I won\u2019t forget in my life.\u201dBut the desire to connect extends beyond Ms. Gomeju\u2019s social circle.\u201cI just called and said in Tigrinya, Hello I am calling from Ethiopia to say congratulations and I am very happy,\u201d wrote Frehiwot Negash, who also lives in Addis Ababa. She had looked up a telephone number for a hotel in Eritrea after a friend encouraged Ethiopians to call and suggested phrases in Tigrinya.Ms. Negash posted a message on Twitter about the experience of calling a neighboring nation that has been cut off from her own for decades.\u201cI made the call because I was extremely happy because of the new beginning of Ethiopia and Eritrea,\u201d Ms. Negash said. \u201cOur countries have seen each other as an enemy for so long, and many have lost their lives.

{"Headline": "Libertarians in the Age of Trump", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid our populist president crush the libertarian moment, or co-opt it?Opinion ColumnistA little over a week ago, in the brief historical entr\u2019acte between the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and our president\u2019s Helsinki rendezvous, I was in Las Vegas for the annual libertarian convention known as FreedomFest.So it was interesting to be among the libertarians in a time when, like other right-of-center faiths, they have seen their political ideals swallowed up by the rule of Donald Trump (whose own FreedomFest appearance, back in 2015, featured a question for him about Russian sanctions from a certain red-haired Russian spy).One answer is that the libertarian spirit was overextended and vulnerable to a backlash. Confident free-traders underestimated how much outsourcing had cost the Western working class. Entitlement reformers overestimated the political practicality of their proposals. Cultural laissez-faire weakened social solidarity, with opioid-driven disintegration the starkest symptom of decay. And the rise of ISIS transmuted the post-Iraq anti-interventionist impulse into a \u201craise the drawbridge\u201d style of politics, with the libertarian aspect drained away.In this account Trumpism, with its tariffs and walls and family-separating cruelties, is simply a rejection of the politics of liberty, an anti-libertarian moment. But there\u2019s also a different story, in which Trump didn\u2019t as much defeat Rand Paul\u2019s worldview as co-opt its more effective messages, while exploiting libertarianism\u2019s tendency to devolve into purely interest-based appeals.On foreign policy, for instance, Trump ran as hard against the Iraq War and neoconservatism as the Kentucky senator or his father. Trump\u2019s skepticism about international institutions and U.S. intelligence agencies is also in tune with common libertarian assumptions (and paranoias). It says something about the strange congruence between the libertarian moment and the politics of 2018 that the C.I.A. chief Paul filibustered five years ago, John Brennan, is now a furious Trump critic.Wandering and arguing at FreedomFest offered grist for both understandings of how libertarianism relates, or doesn\u2019t, to Trumpism. Plenty of attendees were fiercely #NeverTrump and regarded him as an enemy of their ideals. But there were also plenty of people, like one of my sparring partners, former Libertarian Party V.P. nominee Wayne Allyn Root, ready to defend Trump with a true believer\u2019s gusto.While that was happening, though, Rand Paul was taking a very different tack in the Senate \u2014 running interference for our Putin-besotted president, and defending his weird Russia diplomacy as the best alternative to war.Amash\u2019s approach is intellectually admirable; Paul\u2019s is probably more in tune with what a lot of self-described libertarian voters currently want. Which leaves libertarianism in much the same difficult position as other forms of conservatism under Trump.His ascent has a lot to teach ideological purists about the political limits of their theories, the need to temper dogma with more contingent wisdom. But learning those lessons without surrendering to Trumpian whims requires a discipline that even Ayn Rand\u2019s supermen might struggle to maintain. And libertarians, alas, are as fallen as the rest of us. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Leonard is the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS.The president is here to trumpet a $12 billion plan to aid American farmers. Why do they need aid? For Iowans, it\u2019s because 33 percent of our economy is tied, directly or indirectly, to agriculture, and Mr. Trump recklessly opened trade wars that will hit \u201cTrump country\u201d \u2014 rural America \u2014 hardest and that have already brought an avalanche of losses. Indeed, the impact of his tariffs will probably be felt by family farms and the area for generations. So perhaps visiting Dubuque is the least he could do.But the fallout will not just be tallied in statistics. In farm country, U.S.A., the Trump tariffs have poured gas on what has been a slow-burning conflagration. Rural America is about to undergo a major demographic shift. President Trump didn\u2019t start it, but he has accelerated a crisis that might have taken a generation or two to play out. Now it might take only a few years. Rural America is going to be hollowed out very quickly. Farms will become consolidated, and towns that are already in trouble will certainly die. A friend, a small-town Iowa banker who specializes in working with farmers, offered a local example. It\u2019s time for Mom and Dad to retire, get off the farm and move to town. Much of the time, if no heir is interested in continuing the operation, the farm is auctioned to the highest bidder. This time, one son wanted to take over the farm. But there were other children entitled to their share, so the farm went up for auction. But now they had to compete with larger farm operations. The son \u201cdid the best he could,\u201d said my friend, but a big operation \u201cbid it up more than it was worth, some guy from out of town no one knew \u2014 probably from one of the big operations up north. The kid didn\u2019t have a chance. It was heartbreaking.\u201dI use Iowa in my examples, but much of rural America will be affected in a similar way. In the worst possible outcome of this scenario, losses and farm consolidation accelerated by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs will make the devastating 1980s farm crisis look like a bump in the road as it drives a significant rural-to-city migration. Smaller operations don\u2019t have the capital to weather a trade war and will be forced to sell, most likely to larger operations. In my community, I learned this week that a hog operation I drive by every day is folding. The confinements are being dismantled, and anything portable can be found on Craigslist. A friend close to the family told me pork prices have been down for years, and with the tariffs it\u2019s just not worth it anymore.Another casualty: our community banks. As farms get larger, farm loans are less likely to be local. A big operation with farms in dozens of counties that maybe even cross state lines probably won\u2019t use local banks for credit. When our community banks are gone, one of the major economic engines of our small towns will be gone. At a certain point, populations won\u2019t be enough to support rural hospitals and clinics, and they, too, will be gone. Rural hospitals are one of the major employers in the community. Even if you have a good manufacturing company in town, if you lose the hospital, they won\u2019t be able to attract the employees they need. Those plants may be forced to leave as well \u2014 especially since the tariffs have hit them hard also. One friend who has a small manufacturing business says his costs have doubled since Mr. Trump announced tariffs on aluminum and steel, and that his business is down 40 percent.Some of the farmers I speak with are unwavering in support of the president; they\u2019d vote Republican even if Mr. Trump personally slapped the heck out of the preacher at the church potluck. But others are starting to recognize how the economic impact of the tariffs is hitting them personally. Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation, all Republican with the exception of Democrat Dave Loebsack in Iowa\u2019s Second Congressional District, have warned the administration. So has Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds. This is why, earlier this summer, Vice President Mike Pence came to the Midwest for a reassuring visit and why Sonny Perdue, Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of agriculture, offered his $12 billion band-aid of a handout Tuesday. Farmers take out lines of credit in the spring \u2014 usually due the following Jan. 1 \u2014 to pay for seed and other input costs, and then pay the loans back after harvest. Like any other loan, there are consequences to not paying, including losing the farm. Farmers are going to know before the midterm elections if they are going to be able to pay back loans. The larger farm operations and the larger agribusinesses will be hovering, looking for any weakness, and ready to purchase smaller farms. And rest assured, when the Trump payments are made to farmers, the larger operations will be the ones that gobble them up. Behind the lilies are hundred-acre fields of corn or beans, and if you park your car and wander the field behind the lilies, you will invariably find nails, broken crockery and remnants of life where a farmhouse once stood. The lilies are all that\u2019s left of the dreams of the optimistic family that planted the lilies and made a farm and a life on the land generations ago, only to see it lost.The destruction of a way of life cuts as deep now as it did back then, especially when it comes from this president. The only thing he knows about food is that it always comes served to him on a silver, or maybe gold, platter. Advertisement"}

What\u2019s more, that gaslighting is obscuring the need for a more nuanced debate about whether our intelligence surveillance authorities are in need of systemic reform. The question we should ask isn\u2019t whether the F.B.I. followed the laws in wiretapping Carter Page \u2014 they clearly did \u2014 but whether the laws they followed protect our privacy well enough.To regard this as deception, you must believe, first, that describing a source\u2019s work as opposition research is inadequate context absent the client\u2019s name (information Mr. Steele himself did not know), and second, that seasoned judges would be too dim to infer that Democrats were the likeliest funders of such research.That, however, would not be a problem of F.B.I. abusing the system; it would be a problem with the system itself. Once we recognize claims about the F.B.I. misleading the court as nonsense, there are only two possibilities: Either the F.B.I. had compelling evidence that Mr. Page was an agent of a foreign power, or four different judges signed off on wiretapping him without such evidence. The reality is more complex than Mr. Trump\u2019s cartoon conspiracy, but no less disturbing. If the full, uncensored case against Carter Page holds up, then the F.B.I. had good reason to assert that a presidential adviser was working with a hostile foreign power to undermine the integrity of an American presidential election. If it does not, though, the implications are equally disconcerting: It would mean that an innocent American was subject to incredibly invasive surveillance, not because the F.B.I. broke the rules, but because the rules allowed it.Julian Sanchez is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.Advertisement"}

Ms. Stewart writes regularly about the political activities of evangelicals and other religious groups.The National Prayer Breakfast was initiated in 1953 by a Methodist minister, Abraham Vereide, who had been leading Congressional prayer groups for a decade. The annual breakfast now attracts close to 4,000 participants and is hosted by members of Congress. But the real force behind the event remains Mr. Vereide\u2019s Fellowship Foundation, also known as \u201cThe Family,\u201d whose fundamental mission is to create a ruling consortium of Christ-centered political and community leaders.Lobbyists and foreign governments look forward to the event as a way to meet powerful people without, as Mr. Sharlet has reported, having to go through the State Department and normal vetting processes.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the breakfast \u2014 The Family organizes a week of de facto lobbying events,\u201d Mr. Sharlet explained on Twitter. \u201c#MariaButina used them to maximize impact.\u201d  On Oct. 5, 2016, with one National Prayer Breakfast under her belt, Ms. Butina direct messaged a Russian official on Twitter: \u201cWe made our bet. I am following our game. I will be connecting the people from the prayer breakfast to this group.\u201dAfter the election, Ms. Butina informed someone the complaint called \u201cU.S. person number one\u201d that she would be bringing along some \u201cVERY influential\u201d Russians to the breakfast. After the event \u2014 which President Trump attended, just as previous presidents have \u2014 Ms. Butina emailed one of its organizers to thank him for \u201cthe gift\u201d of his \u201cprecious time during the National Prayer Breakfast week \u2014 and for the very private meeting that followed. A new relationship between two countries always begins better when it begins in faith.\u201dIt also should not be surprising that at least some in the breakfast crowd were positively disposed to the Russian visitors. The bond between America\u2019s Christian nationalists and the Russian government goes back a long way, long before anyone conceived of the possibility of a Trump administration.Paul Weyrich belongs on any shortlist of the individuals who created the religious right as we know it today. He was a central figure in the founding of numerous conservative organizations, including the Heritage Foundation, ALEC, the Moral Majority and the Council for National Policy. In the 1970s, Mr. Weyrich was one of the strategists who first conceived of outreach to evangelical churches in order to recruit activists to socially conservative causes. He was also among the first to grasp the potential for an alliance with religious conservatives in Russia and Eastern Europe.After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mr. Weyrich made dozens of trips to Russia, eventually becoming a strong supporter of closer relations. By the time of his death in 2008, Mr. Weyrich was writing and speaking frequently in defense of Russia and facilitating visits between American conservatives and Russian political leaders.Joining the National Organization for Marriage in the budding alliance were a number of other religious right groups, including the activist groups International Organization of the Family, also directed by Mr. Brown, and Family Watch International, an Arizona-based group that promotes an anti-LGBT and anti-abortion agenda around the world. In 2016, the World Congress of Families, a group that formed in Russia in 1997, held an event in Tbilisi, capital of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Participants cast President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and the Orthodox Church as defenders of \u201cChristian civilization\u201d against a secular, decadent West.The attraction appears to be mutual \u2014 even if it is almost certainly not symmetrical. More than 50 Russians attended the most recent National Prayer Breakfast in February. At the same time that it has been infiltrating the political system of the United States, the Russian government has sought to cultivate and influence far-right groups in Europe. It turns out that anti-L.G.B.T. politics are an effective tool in mobilizing religious nationalists everywhere, which is in turn an excellent way to destabilize the Western alliance and advance Russia\u2019s geopolitical interests. Anti-L.G.B.T. politics are in this respect no different from the \u201cgun rights\u201d advocacy that Ms. Butina is accused of using to build a bridge between Russian and American leaders via the National Rifle Association. No serious observer believes that Mr. Putin cares a fig about our Second Amendment (or the rest of the Constitution). For him, America\u2019s fabled gun culture is just a weakness to be exploited for the sake of Russia\u2019s national interest.Which really ought to give pause to those who imagine that Russia is sincere in its supposed desire to unite with America\u2019s religious conservatives over a putatively shared variety of Christian values. Why would anyone assume that Mr. Putin means what he says about spiritual matters? The religious right thinks that it\u2019s using Mr. Putin to advance its aims. But a far more plausible interpretation is that he is using the religious right \u2014 to infiltrate, divide and weaken our country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sorry, NATO. Trump Doesn\u2019t Believe in Allies.", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEurope has to understand that in the American president\u2019s twisted worldview, there are only fans and enemies. Mr. Krastev is the author, most recently, of \u201cAfter Europe\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.How wrong we were to believe them. It was the tweets that really mattered in the end.Within hours of the religiously anticipated NATO summit in Brussels today, President Trump was castigating Germany, historically one of America\u2019s closest allies, claiming, ridiculously, that it is \u201ccaptive\u201d to Russia and calling NATO countries \u201cdelinquent.\u201d Europeans are now finally being forced to realize that Mr. Trump\u2019s world is one shorn of allies. Europe\u2019s reaction to this new reality brings to mind Stevie, the heroine from Edward Albee\u2019s play \u201cThe Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?\u201d when she learns that her husband has fallen in love with a goat. The shock is so great that she simply refuses to understand. That\u2019s basically what Europe is doing right now. In the lead-up to the NATO summit, presidents and prime ministers reiterated familiar lines about trans-Atlantic relations as though nothing had changed with Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Here\u2019s why the European leaders are so surprised: It\u2019s not difficult to imagine a mainstream political leader campaigning with promises to build a wall on the border, move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and punish the Chinese government for its economic policies. Mainstream politicians might easily pledge all of these, but upon assuming power they would never act on them. Like today\u2019s other populist leaders, Mr. Trump knows that his standing with voters hinges on making good on his most radical promises. For a populist leader to succeed, he or she doesn\u2019t need to solve problems, nor outdo his or her predecessor. All the populist leader has to do is be different from the mainstream \u2014 to do what mainstream politicians would never do. For example, insult Germany.What makes Europeans particularly vulnerable in the Trump era is that they view themselves as America\u2019s allies. (That\u2019s for good reason: They have been, after all, America\u2019s allies for the past 70 years.) But in Mr. Trump\u2019s world, there no longer is any concept of alliances. It is not that he is displeased with European military spending or with Europe\u2019s position on Iran. Rather, it is that in a world where America is a disrupter and not a force for stability, allies are now a burden. They have expectations and claims that constrain America\u2019s policies, whether that is a preferential trade agreement or a commitment to joint military exercises. Worse, they insist on predictability and reciprocity, which are completely out of sync with Mr. Trump\u2019s view of the world. Peering through Mr. Trump\u2019s twisted prism, one finds not friends and enemies, but fans and enemies. Fans are those who are loyal to you no matter what; they never expect reciprocity. Enemies are also valuable because they help you solve problems; you can assert your power by breaking them or befriending them. The Trump administration\u2019s approach to the North Korean enemy is a perfect example of this. Its relationship with Russia \u2014 Mr. Trump is meeting with Vladimir Putin next week \u2014 could be the next example.Europeans are doomed if they think the issue now is how to salvage their alliance with the United States. The time for that has passed, as the events in Brussels this week will make clear. The challenge now for the leaders of Europe is learn to live in a world where America has no allies. For a start, they can start by showing that they take seriously the need to provide for their own security, investing in autonomous European defense capacity, rather than relying so much on the United States. The Europeans must also discover that while their unity is important, it can also help to be a little unpredictable themselves. They also can give up their posture of learned helplessness when it comes to Russia. The logic of the post-Cold War world has been that the United States exercises its global influence by preserving and expanding its alliances. This logic no longer holds. The gravest risk the European Union faces is to be the guardian of a status quo that has ceased to exist.Advertisement"}

Ms. Giering is a theater composer. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t just turn the car around and go home. Perhaps I didn\u2019t want to face failure again, unable to complete even the simplest of mom tasks \u2014 driving my son to his hockey game. Whatever was happening, this high-gloss, Technicolor world was not something of my own design. I couldn\u2019t focus on the road or my son\u2019s voice chiming in from the back seat. My mind bucked every effort to corral it by backing itself into rooms deep in my consciousness. I had no idea what was happening, but I kept driving.That first spell lasted seven hours. The hospital treated me for a migraine and sent me home with a diagnosis of fatigue. After that, the spells came every day, sometimes more than once. If they happened while I was sleeping, I would wake up, chest burning, hearing dogs walking around the bed or a chorus of tropical birds. I watched the ceiling liquefy. Purple henna designs scrolled across my vision like a news crawl on TV. I stopped driving. I stopped leaving the house. We tried to identify the cause, but the spells refused to conform to a pattern. And nothing helped.For weeks, I toggled between these dissociative hallucinatory states and blinding, raging head pain. I spent three days in a neurological unit in Boston, hoping for answers. But the test results followed a familiar pattern: My brain was fine, but clearly I was not.In the end, my doctors gave me an enormous stress dose of steroids to break the migraine cycle. But the night the headache broke, I had the strongest spell of all. My mind cleaved. I saw my thoughts pour out in a scrambled, encrypted wave that crested just beyond the back of my head. I was convinced that if I could decipher their code, I would unlock an artistic secret, a creative message.I want to talk to her.Before I got sick, I was a productive theater composer. I was a mom and a wife, a multitasker and an overachiever. I wrung every bit of usable time from my days. Anything I accomplish now gets done through a haze of illness. There are fleeting moments when inspiration converges with a stretch of good days or when, through sheer force of will, I can make myself focus long enough to bring a song into the world. Those are rare days. I wonder what Hildegard would tell me. Somehow, she turned her mystical visions into transcendent madrigals. What alchemy did she use to marry her debility to inspiration? A couple of months before the incident with my son in the car, Social Security had declared me disabled, after a three-year battle with an autoimmune syndrome born from a toxic reaction to the silicone implant I had received during a mastectomy. Sometimes my symptoms are tolerable. Other times, I careen into crisis, the consequence of a hair-trigger immune system: the loss of more than a third of my body weight; the persistent infection that took seven rounds of antibiotics to clear; the bout of norovirus so severe my husband had to carry me into the emergency room. Every cough, every twinge of nausea can tip over into bad health from which I take months to recover. Like a masked marauder, my illness creeps into different bodily systems, wreaking havoc. I never know what\u2019s next.I asked my husband this as I lay hallucinating in bed next to him. Gently, he demurred, saying he didn\u2019t know. A year into my illness, I started writing songs about my experience. Like live tweets of a tragedy, they are real-time snapshots of a life gone off the rails \u2014 a woman constantly redefined into smaller and smaller boxes. What I want this piece of theater to communicate has morphed radically since I lived through these months of altered consciousness. I just don\u2019t know what it is yet.These days, the spells are less dramatic, but ever-present, like my own personal background radiation, punctuated by deafening tinnitus, pressure, pain and heat, like a fire behind the door of my eyes. My six doctors are uncertain of the cause, leaving me wondering if this is forever.Disability has forced me to master the art of changing expectations. I have to live in the constantly shifting landscape of my illness. Every plan, every dinner date, every trip comes with the proviso that I may not be up to the task. Sometimes all I can do is let go. One thing, however, is definite: These spells have given me a renewed sense of purpose. I am acutely aware that I need to get as much music out of my pen while I am able. I know that the next medical crisis will come. When it does, I know it will set me back weeks, if not months. Illness is baked into me now. Perhaps this is what Hildegard knew: Say what you can, as well as you can, for as long as you can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Years of Education Influenced by Genetic Makeup, Enormous Study Finds", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterMore than a thousand variations in DNA were involved in how long people stayed in school, but the effect of each gene was weak, and the data did not predict educational attainment for individuals. Educational attainment has attracted great interest from researchers in recent years, because it is linked to many other aspects of people\u2019s lives, including their income as adults, overall health and even life span. The newly discovered gene variants account for just a fraction of the differences in education observed between groups of people. Environmental influences, which may include family wealth or parental education, together play a bigger role. Still, scientists have long known that genetic makeup explains some of the differences in time spent in school. Their hope is that the data can be used to gain a better understanding of what educators must do to keep children in school longer.With a fuller understanding of the influences exerted by genes, scientists think they will be able to better measure what happens when they try to improve a child\u2019s learning environment. The new study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, finds that many of the genetic variations implicated in educational attainment are involved in how neurons communicate in the brain. A striking number are involved in relaying signals out of neurons and into neighboring ones through connections called synapses. The findings are based on genetic sequencing of more than 1.1 million people. But the subjects were all white people of European descent. In order to maximize the odds of discovering genetic links, the scientists say they needed a very large, homogeneous sample. When the team tried to use these genetic variants to explain differences in schooling time among African-Americans, the predictions failed. The researchers also found that genes don\u2019t have a uniform effect: The influences of the genes varied from country to country. The researchers could not pinpoint the cause of these differences. But if educators in one country emphasize memory over problem-solving in math classes, for example, then some gene variants may provide a bigger benefit to some students than others, the scientists speculated. A truly global understanding of these genetic influences will require similarly huge studies of people of other ancestries, the researchers said.The data cannot be used to predict educational attainment in any particular schoolchild. The researchers cautioned that the genetic patterns are seen only in large groups; in each child, genetics will play only a small role in how long she stays in school.\u201cIt\u2019s not really meaningful for individuals,\u201d said Aysu Okbay, a geneticist at Vrije University in Amsterdam and a co-author of the new study. In the early 2000s, a few social scientists tried to confirm links between particular genes and schooling, but their efforts largely failed. One of the most important reasons was the small size of their studies.The researchers piggybacked their educational research on medical research. When people volunteer for a genetic study on, say, blood pressure, they often fill out questionnaires about various aspects of their lives. One of the most common questions is how much education they\u2019ve had. By 2016, Dr. Benjamin and his colleagues had studied nearly 300,000 people and had linked 71 gene variants to education. But then two major developments in DNA testing helped the team greatly expand their research. Recently, a genetic database called UK Biobank was launched in Britain. Some 442,183 of those genetic profiles were added to the consortium\u2019s study. And after 23andMe scientists began sharing information about customers who volunteer to be part of scientific research, the team included 365,538 of those profiles. Studying the DNA of these people, Dr. Benjamin and his colleagues found a number of genetic variations that were unusually common in people who finished a lot of school, and others that were more common in people who left school early. Often, the scientists weren\u2019t able to rule out chance as the explanation. But 1,271 of these variants were linked so tightly to schooling that they could not be dismissed. Still, the association between each gene variant and education was very weak. When the researchers compared groups of people with or without a particular variant, their average time in school differed only by days. The researchers scanned the DNA surrounding these influential variants and found an intriguing pattern. \u201cThey\u2019re not just randomly scattered around the genome,\u201d said James J. Lee, a behavioral geneticist at the University of Minnesota and co-author of the new study. The variants are linked to genes active in the brain, helping neurons to form connections. A key to educational attainment may not be how quickly information is acquired, but how quickly it can be shared between various regions.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not about how fast a signal can zip along a cable,\u201d Dr. Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the complexity of the connections between point A and B.\u201dBut the genetic links suggest another, perhaps stranger possibility: Some variants linked to education work not in the brains of students, but in the people they inherited the variants from \u2014 their parents. By somehow shaping the behavior of parents, these variants may alter the environments in which children grow up in a way that helps or impinges on time spent in school.Based on their findings, Dr. Benjamin and his colleagues figured out how to calculate a genetic \u201cscore\u201d for educational success. The more variants linked to staying in school longer, the higher an individual\u2019s score.The researchers calculated a score for a group of 4,775 Americans, ranking them into five groups. The researchers found that 12 percent of people in the lowest fifth finished college. Among people in the top fifth, 57 percent finished college.A similar result emerged when the scientists looked at how many people in each group had to repeat a grade in school. In the lowest fifth, 29 percent did, while in the top fifth, only 8 percent did. But when Dr. Benjamin and his colleagues calculated scores for African-Americans, it failed to predict how well different groups had done in school. One likely reason is that genetic markers aren\u2019t reliable guides to how genes influence traits in different populations. Dr. Benjamin and his colleagues hope to grow their study to 2 million people or more, and expect to find thousands more genes linked to education. He and other researchers plan to carry out other studies on behavior based on gene profiles of one million people or more. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to happen really fast,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin.Advertisement"}

Fitzpatrick, a historian and the author of \u201cWorld War I New York: A Guide to the City\u2019s Enduring Ties to The Great War.\u201d\u201cYou have to remember that at this time, two-thirds of New York City was foreign born,\u201d he added.With anti-German sentiment in the city boiling, Mr. Mitchel banned the waving of foreign flags to ease tensions. \u201cHe deserves a lot of credit for how much he kept New York City together during World War I,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.He was also an uncompromising reformer at a time when reform was not popular.\u201cHis four years did a lot to change the laws that we enjoy today \u2014 labor laws, safety laws \u2014 and he was big into helping immigrants and the working class and their safety,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.A lifelong foe of Tammany Hall, Mr. Mitchel pushed for maternity leave for schoolteachers, subway construction jobs for the unemployed and he appointed an African-American member to the Board of Education \u2014 all moves that inspired a generation of future progressives, like Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia.Mr. Fitzpatrick said he was not a popular mayor because \u201che was really bad at public relations.\u201d His snazzy suits and hobnobbing with the wealthy didn\u2019t win him fans among poor New Yorkers. When he ran again in 1917, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, \u201che lost soundly; he was destroyed.\u201dWithin two weeks of leaving City Hall, Mr. Mitchel had signed up to serve in the Army Air Service as an air cadet. On July 6, 1918, he fell out of the aircraft he was flying in, during training in Louisiana, and died. He was a consummate daredevil and wasn\u2019t wearing his seatbelt.Even though he served only one term, Mr. Mitchel is one of the most memorialized politicians in the city. He is remembered at the flagstaffs at the Stephen A.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Has Endangered Species in His Sights", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Zinke\u2019s Interior Department proposes to significantly weaken the landmark law that saved the bald eagle, the gray wolf and other species from extinction. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The act\u2019s three main purposes are simply stated: identifying species that need to be listed as endangered (headed toward extinction) or threatened (likely to become endangered); designating habitat necessary for the species\u2019 survival; and nurturing the process until the species have not just survived but recovered in sustainable numbers.A second proposal would weaken safeguards for threatened species, which now enjoy the same blanket protections against harm (hunting, shooting, trapping and so on) that apply to endangered species. Threatened species would now be judged on a case-by-case basis.A third proposal could make it harder for some species to gain a foothold on the threatened list to begin with. The statute defines a threatened species as one \u201cthat is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\u201d The Obama administration defined \u201cforeseeable future\u201d liberally \u2014 for instance, listing the Arctic bearded seal as threatened because the ice sheets the seal relies on would almost certainly disappear by the end of the century because of global warming. That\u2019s too speculative for the Trump people, whose scientists and policymakers would henceforth be required to \u201cavoid speculating as to what is hypothetically possible.\u201d To Mr. Carper, that\u2019s a clear invitation to limit protections for species threatened by climate change, of which there are many.Individual species aside, the act\u2019s habitat requirements have also produced great gains for ecosystems as a whole. A succession of inconspicuous birds listed as endangered or threatened \u2014 the spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, the coastal California gnatcatcher \u2014 has saved millions of acres of old growth forest and open space along the Pacific Coast from logging and commercial development. Efforts to save the wood stork and Florida panther have helped nourish the Everglades.An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the Endangered Species Act must be applied \"without reference to possible economic or other impacts\" of such decisions. That language appears in the law's implementing regulations, not in the act itself. The article also said the California condor had been removed from the endangered species list; the bird is still classified as endangered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Was the Real Lorax? Seeking the Inspiration for Dr. Seuss", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "TrilobitesA new essay explores the possible real-life examples for the Lorax character and Truffula trees. Supported byIn 1970, millions of people observed Earth Day for the first time, and the Environmental Protection Agency was born. Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d topped the charts. And in La Jolla, Calif., Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, was fighting to keep a suburban development project from clearing the Eucalyptus trees around his home. But when he tried to write a book about conservation for children that wasn\u2019t preachy or boring, he got writer\u2019s block.In it, the Lorax, who \u201cspeaks for the trees,\u201d pops up from a chopped-down tree stump and angrily demands that a businessman called the Once-ler stop cutting down Truffula trees to knit \u201cthneeds.\u201d But the Once-ler doesn\u2019t listen and eventually is left alone in a crumbling, empty factory on a barren landscape. Dr. Dominy, also a father, raised the topic of \u201cThe Lorax,\u201d suggesting that the fuzzy, mustachioed protagonist of the book resembled the patas monkey, a fluffy, orange, real-life creature with a raspy alarm call that he had observed while working in Kenya. The monkey gets most of its nutrients from a gnarly tree called the whistling thorn acacia, in a type of interaction called commensalism, wherein one organism benefits from another without harming it. The tree also looks like barren trees in the story. \u201cIf Dr. Seuss would ever make a monkey,\u201d he told Dr. Pease, \u201cthat would be the one.\u201d Dr. Pease questioned the notion that a creative master like Dr. Seuss would ever use a real life reference, but became convinced after considering how the Lorax appeared from that chopped-down tree stump, suggesting, in a way, that the Lorax was part of it. This made the character\u2019s use of \u201cmy trees\u201d more reasonable. \u201cThe Lorax no longer sounded like an eco-policeman,\u201d said Dr. Pease, \u201cbut instead was a creature that could be understood as the spirit in place for the entire ecosystem.\u201d To him, Dr. Dominy\u2019s otherwise silly conversation topic deserved attention because it enriched previous understanding of the work and addressed critical concerns. In what became their passion project, they searched for clues to support Dr. Dominy\u2019s hypothesis.After scouring the literature and talking with Audrey Geisel, the author\u2019s wife, they determined that Dr. Seuss likely had devised his story after observing the relationship between the patas monkey and whistling thorn acacia during his Kenyan vacation. \u201cWe\u2019re taking real tools from biology and applying them in super serious way,\u201d Dr. Dominy said. \u201cI hope people find the humor in this.\u201d Years pass, and a regretful Once-ler finally understands these words when a visitor asks what happened to the Lorax. He throws the last Truffula tree seed to the child, and says \u201cUNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201dReal monkey-tree connection or not, by simply acknowledging this comparison, Dr. Pease said, we learn about important ecological concepts and environmental interactions \u2014 like how removal of a keystone species, like the Truffula tree, can lead to ecosystem collapse.We\u2019ll never know for certain the inspiration of this cautionary tale, but it doesn\u2019t really matter, Dr. Dominy said. \u201cEcosystems are communities, they\u2019re assemblages of species that are interacting, and if you affect one, you affect all of them.

But how?Robert M. Hertzberg\u2019s hatred of bots is personal.Mr. Hertzberg is a state Senator from California and last year, after he introduced a bail reform bill, he noticed that automated accounts on Twitter and Facebook were attacking him and his position. He is currently seeking re-election, and one of his opponents in the Democratic primary was a bail agent.For example, he said, one account rapidly responded to tweets about the bill in real time with the message: \u201cUnconstitutional bail reform doesn\u2019t work and is racist.\u201d So Mr. Hertzberg introduced another bill this year, the first of its kind in the United States, that would compel automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots \u2014 in other words, to disclose their non-personhood. Because bots are only effective if they seem convincingly human. Right? Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them.

When that\u2019s done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201dBut \u201cyou don\u2019t want to measure twice, regulate once,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\u201d \u201cNot only will it not fix the thing you\u2019re trying to fix,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019ll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\u201d But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab. Ms. Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \u201cinfluencing a vote in an election\u201d ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.Mr. Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.\u201cEmbarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I\u2019ve ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\u201d Mr. Calo said.With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.\u201cPolitical commentary comes in different forms,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticize a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\u201d he said, noting that he was not an expert on American political discourse. \u201cGiven that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to \u2018let\u2019s get something because its such an emergency.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\u201d he said. \u201cInventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019 Firing Prompts Pushback in Hollywood", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gunn\u2019s tweets \u2014 mostly written between 2009 and 2012 \u2014 contained jokes about pedophilia, AIDS, rape and the Sept. 11 attacks. Two far-right provocateurs, Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec, threw a spotlight on the tweets two weeks ago after Mr. Gunn harshly criticized President Trump on Twitter, prompting calls for Mr. Gunn\u2019s ouster.But Disney was quickly condemned in some quarters for reacting to a social media shaming that appeared to have been undertaken as political payback. Mr. Gunn\u2019s firing has also stirred debate about how Hollywood should handle transgressions made during a more anything-goes era. As the movie industry seeks to clean up its culture, how retroactively should new standards be applied?\u201cThere is little due process in the court of public opinion,\u201d Mr. Pratt and eight of his co-stars, including Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, wrote in the open letter. \u201cJames is likely not the last good person to be put on trial.\u201dThe actors continued, \u201cWe hope Americans from across the political spectrum can ease up on the character assassinations and stop weaponizing mob mentality.\u201dNoting that Mr. Gunn had repeatedly apologized, the cast members also said: \u201cIn casting each of us to help him tell the story of misfits who find redemption, he changed our lives forever. We believe the theme of redemption has never been more relevant than now.\u201dDespite that history, Disney hired him to write and direct the first \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d movie, which was marketed as family entertainment and took in $773 million worldwide in 2014. A sequel, also written and directed by Mr. Gunn, collected about $864 million last year. Mr. Gunn has lately been consulting on a \u201cGuardians\u201d-themed addition to Epcot at Walt Disney World.The letter released by Mr. Pratt and his co-stars did not join the fan petitions in demanding that Mr. Gunn be rehired as director of \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\u201d which is set to begin shooting in the coming months. None of the actors threatened to quit. (The other signees were Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Pom Klementieff, Karen Gillan and Sean Gunn, who is Mr. Gunn\u2019s brother.)But the actors did say in the letter that Mr. Gunn had their \u201cfull support\u201d and that they were \u201cshocked\u201d by his abrupt ouster by Disney, especially since the offending tweets were written \u201cmany years ago.\u201d \u201cEach of us looks forward to working with James in the future,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHis story isn\u2019t over \u2014 not by a long shot.\u201dDisney declined to comment.Working for Disney, which primarily focuses on family entertainment, is also not the same as working for another Hollywood studio.Still, the movie industry has long tolerated vulgar comments and behavior \u2014 particularly from its creative ranks. As the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements have taken hold over the past year, and as studios have moved to an aggressive zero-tolerance behavioral policy as a result, some people are starting to contemplate what constitutes a proper response.\u201cI do not believe that it is my place to question the accounts put forth by the women,\u201d Ms. Press wrote, \u201cbut I do find myself asking that if we are examining the industry as it existed decades before through the lens of 2018 should we also discuss a path to learning, reconciliation and forgiveness?\u201dLike the \u201cGuardians\u201d cast members, Ms. Press called for attention to be paid to the \u201ccomplicated nuances of context\u201d over \u201cthe easier path of absolutes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesser Known Wine of Sicily Benefits From Globalization", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolHere at Wine School, as you may have noticed, we frequently advocate the virtues of exploration and discovery.So much is new and different in wine that it seems a shame to pick a brand and stick with it, as people used to do with beer and cigarettes.It is, of course, important to know what you like. Who can be blamed for always ordering tikka masala at an Indian restaurant, much less the same glass of pinot grigio? We all have our favorites, yet with wine the opportunities for pleasure are so endless nowadays that we can\u2019t help but preach the joys of the world\u2019s vast wine buffet.As for nero d\u2019Avola, it became well known beyond Sicily in the 1990s, primarily because a few successful examples allowed Sicilian winemakers to focus on it rather than cabernet sauvignons and merlots designed to earn approval in the export market. While Sicilian nero d\u2019Avolas back then won praise, many of the wines were heavy, out-of-balance or just plain bad. Now, the reputation is mixed for varietal nero d\u2019Avola wines, though I have certainly had some excellent examples.Nonetheless, nero d\u2019Avola continues to be an important grape. In the southeast corner of Sicily around the city of Vittoria, it is often blended with frappato to produce what is now recognized as one of the island\u2019s best red wines, Cerasuolo di Vittoria.Did frappato and other newly anointed Sicilian red grapes like nerello mascalese simply pop into being through puffs of magic? Of course not.They, along with nero d\u2019Avola and many others, have long been grown on the island. For generations, they were made into bulk wines and shipped to northern Italy or France, where they were used to add color and power to local wines deemed too anemic on their own. They were also consumed locally in the communities where the grapes were grown.So what happened? The great wine story of the 21st century has been the arrival in the global marketplace of wines that, for one reason or another, were either marginal or unknown outside their birthplaces. Consumers today have benefited profoundly from these newly available selections, whether the wines are made from grapes like gr\u00fcner veltliner, teroldego or assyrtiko, or come from regions like the Jura and Ribeira Sacra.Why frappato rather than nero d\u2019Avola? Frappato has a lovely floral freshness to it that takes well to a light chill. It\u2019s a great summer red, and one to seek out year-round, if you value the freshness that comes from great acidity over power. Nero d\u2019Avola is fuller-bodied and darker colored, with little of the lift or refreshing crunchiness that I love in frappato.I have found a few varietal nero d\u2019Avolas worth drinking, most notably, Arianna Occhipinti\u2019s excellent Siccagno, in which the grape\u2019s signature concentrated fruit flavor is tempered with energy and minerality. But I have found nero d\u2019Avola works best in combination with frappatto in Cerasuolo di Vittoria: Nero d\u2019Avola must account for at least 60 percent of the blend.Frappato, the other component, makes an attractive varietal wine, though very few seem to be widely available. Still, the three wines I proposed suggest the frappato\u2019s stylistic range.The easygoing $20 Valle dell\u2019Acate was both the least expensive and the simplest of the three, with plenty of bright, earthy cherry fruit, though maybe with a slightly confected note. It\u2019s fresh \u2014 as it should be \u2014 and refreshing, easy to enjoy with grilled fish or pizza.The other two are different; more expensive but with more to offer. The $28 COS was bright and fresh as well, and though it was just as airy, it seemed more substantial. The aroma was like inhaling a bunch of fresh flowers, with the life force and the ever-so-slight fetid quality often found in flowers and perfume. The result was a complexity that required repeated, pleasurable tastes to explore.The third wine, the $40 2015 Occhipinti, seemed even more complex than the COS, while remaining fresh and elegant. It was stony, floral and lip-smacking, with a hint of bitterness and a dusty mineral touch to it that seemed to speak directly of where the grapes were grown. Superb.Aside from the different vineyard sites, two significant differences set the Valle dell\u2019Acate apart from the other two wines. First, it\u2019s a year younger. Perhaps more important, it was fermented and aged in steel tanks, while the other two were fermented in concrete tanks.Concrete tanks act very much like oak vats. They are porous like oak, allowing a micro-exchange of air, but, like older oak vessels, they do not impart flavors or aromas.While the COS was fermented and aged in concrete, the Occhipinti was moved after fermentation to big barrels of Slavonian oak, just one of several variables that collectively account for differences in the wines. Clearly these two have more in common with each other than they did with the Valle dell\u2019Acate.On the other hand, he said, his wife described the wine as \u201cspicy and somewhat dirty,\u201d which made me think that they have an excellent partnership, or at least a future in comedy.\u201cIt was that dustiness, that slight grounding element that makes a wine a bit more serious than just light and bright,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange and fascinating because isn\u2019t Sicily often like that? Beautiful, bright sights, people and food, but with a deep history that doesn\u2019t allow that brightness to lack seriousness.\u201dSo much in a glass of wine, though I saw it in the other bottles more than in the Valle dell\u2019Acate. It\u2019s worth opening another bottle to explore further.More than any other beverage, wine has this ability to express culture. It\u2019s what I love more than anything, and it is exactly why I find wine so exciting. This is more true now \u2014 with options like frappato and so many others newly available \u2014 than it has ever been before.Advertisement"}

Mr. Hoffman asked him to take a look at a new building along the Washington Channel, about 1,000 yards from the National Mall. Mr. Thrasher wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cPX is great for the ego,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s so tiny, it doesn\u2019t really make any money.\u201dWhen Mr. Hoffman asked if he\u2019d rather open a distillery, Mr. Thrasher demurred. What did he know about distilling?\u201cI left that meeting and called my wife. She said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you want to do a distillery? You could make things taste good. You can make money while you\u2019re sleeping.\u2019\u201d He called the developer back. (Mr. Thrasher and his wife, Maria Chicas, are the sole owners of Potomac Distilling.)By choosing rum as his flagship product, Mr. Thrasher joins a growing, but still small, craft rum distilling movement in the United States. But he\u2019s no bandwagoner. Mr. Thrasher, who made a name as an early creator of homemade tonic syrup and smoked cocktails, prefers rum and Coke. \u201cIt\u2019s the first thing I ever drank in my life, in college,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked rum.\u201d\u201cI love gin and tonics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also love rum and tonics. So I\u2019m trying to marry the two. Green Spice Rum really acts like gin, but for rum lovers.\u201d The botanicals for the Green Spice Rum will be grown on the roof of the distillery.Potomac will make three other rums as well: white, gold and spiced, which is flavored with star anise, clove, allspice, cinnamon and vanilla bean. (The rums will cost $27 to $29 a bottle.) Every week Mr. Thrasher will hold back a barrel of rum, with an eye toward selling some aged rum in the future.Mr. Thrasher is among a small number of bartenders who have found their next career step at a distillery \u2014 though few have taken such a from-the-ground-up approach.Mr. Thrasher visited several distilleries, attended the distilling school at Moonshine University in Louisville, Ky., and practiced his art on two stills \u2014 a 10-gallon copper pot still and a three-liter glass still \u2014 in his home. (One of the cocktails to be served at the distillery is called When I Go to Bed There Is a Rum Still In My Head.)Mr. Thrasher said he will probably hold onto PX, but spend less time at his other interests. \u201cI\u2019d like to concentrate on the distillery, because I know how to run restaurants and bars,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to run a distillery.\u201d There\u2019s a smokestack now that says otherwise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Italian Town Once Welcomed Migrants. Now, It\u2019s a Symbol for Right-Wing Politics", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "Macerata once had a reputation for tolerance. But the killing of a woman and a revenge shooting made the Italian town a symbol of rising right-wing politics.Supported byMACERATA, Italy \u2014 At the end of his shooting rampage as the police closed in, Luca Traini climbed the steps of a Fascist-era monument, wrapped himself in an Italian flag and straightened his arm in a Fascist salute.But to Italian leaders, liberals and anti-fascist groups, Mr. Traini was a terrifying omen.National elections were weeks away and the Feb. 3 shootings came during a hate-laced campaign marred by anti-migrant language, rising intolerance and hints of a Fascist revival.At the height of the migrant crisis, Italy had been a progressive bastion and a staunch supporter of European unity. But now, the national mood had hardened. Mr. Traini\u2019s rage crystallized, in grotesque form, the growing backlash against migrants and the rise of right-wing politics.\u201cWithin one year, we will see if united Europe still exists,\u201d Matteo Salvini, the country\u2019s new interior minister, said recently.Mr. Salvini is now Italy\u2019s most turbulent and powerful force. More than anyone, he understood and harnessed the rage unleashed in Macerata.Often scoffed at for its wobbly governments and disregarded as a mere pleasuredome, Italy has long been Europe\u2019s laboratory for political change. The birthplace of Fascism, Italy gave the world Mussolini, flirted seriously with communism, and, in electing Silvio Berlusconi, provided a playbook for billionaires seeking power the world over.Now, as liberal democracies across Europe are under strain, new threads of populism are transforming Italy\u2019s politics, and fast. Mr. Salvini\u2019s nationalist party, the League, has increased its support in Macerata from 0.6 percent in 2013 to 21 percent in March.Macerata was not always that way.It had a reputation for tolerance and, in 2013, won national recognition for its integration efforts. The former bishop once boasted about the \u201cwelcoming spirit\u201d encoded \u201cin the DNA of the city.\u201dHumanitarian groups such as the Catholic charity Caritas set up in the city to work with migrants. Inside the Caritas reception center, Ibrahim Diallo, 18, from Senegal, spent a recent afternoon practicing conjugation of the verb \u201cto be\u201d with a young Italian woman, Luigina.But that version of Macerata seemed more in the past tense.Macerata\u2019s new bishop, handpicked by Pope Francis, observed recently that \u201call the tensions rising in the country are now visible in this city.\u201dIn the university, founded in 1290, left-wing students warned that a group of hard-right students in the humanities department were espousing the works of Julius Evola, the spiritual and intellectual godfather of Italian Fascists and Italy\u2019s post-Fascist terrorists.They said students were attempting to form chapters for hard-right groups such as CasaPound, which is doing better in municipal elections around the country, and Forza Nuova, which in October attempted to re-enact Mussolini\u2019s 1922 March on Rome.Martina Borra, a local leader of Forza Nuova, is a friend of Mr. Traini, who has been charged with racially motivated attempted murder. He has admitted to the shootings but claimed temporary insanity and is currently on trial. Ms. Borra said he had many local supporters.\u201cIf you ask most people about Luca Traini, they will tell you, \u2018He did well, but he should have killed them.\u2019\u201d She added that Italy owed him a debt of gratitude for \u201chaving revealed a problem\u201d \u2014 and she seemed unbothered that none of the victims were thought to be drug dealers.On a drive outside the city, she indicated a housing project that she said had become a hub for drug dealers. Police helicopters whirled overhead as she pointed out a small house where women used to buy eggs and where addicts now bought drugs \u2014 the police had found human remains nearby.For her and for others who share her extremist views, this was proof of the migrants\u2019 noxious influence on her country and her city.On the road back to Macerata and the Fascist-era monument where Mr. Traini had been arrested, she responded to a question about what she was doing for the national holiday the following day, marking Italy\u2019s liberation from Fascism.\u201cIt\u2019s not a holiday for us,\u201d she said.Like many Italian cities, Macerata suffered in the aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis. A devastating 2016 earthquake brought another setback. But city leaders hoped this year would be a turning point.Romano Carancini, the city\u2019s affable mayor from the center-left Democratic Party, spent the winter preparing a dossier called \u201cFriendly Macerata\u201d as part of a campaign to become Italy\u2019s 2020 capital of culture. It was a designation that would make the city a major tourist destination.There was much to include.A college town of 42,000, it offered opera at the outdoor Sferisterio theater and baroque luxury at the indoor Lauro Rossi Theater. Its Palazzo Buonaccorsi had frescoed ceilings, Futurist masterpieces and a world-class collection of horse-drawn carriages.At certain hours, children craned their necks up at the astronomical clock tower in the main square to see sculptures of the three magi emerging on a carousel. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Italy\u2019s founding father, had represented Macerata in Rome.But it was the area\u2019s tranquillity that attracted Pamela Mastropietro, an 18-year-old from a working-class section of Rome. As a young teenager, she had started dating a Romanian drug dealer and gotten hooked on drugs.Her mother, a hairdresser, finally persuaded her to enroll in a drug-treatment center overlooking vineyards in the hills near Macerata. She stayed for several weeks.But on Jan. 29, as Macerata was named a finalist in the capital of culture contest, Ms. Mastropietro left the rehab center to buy drugs at Diaz Gardens, a park outside Macerata\u2019s city walls.The winding park had become a warren for drug dealers, many of them migrants. Those demanding the expulsion of migrants pointed to the conditions of Diaz Gardens as part of their case. Mr. Carancini, the mayor, worried they had a point.In his airy office, the mayor said he had little power to address crime because the Interior Ministry has jurisdiction over the police. Law enforcement was scant in many towns across Italy, including Macerata, handing a powerful talking point to Mr. Salvini who promised zero tolerance for crime when he took charge.At the gardens, Ms. Mastropietro is believed to have been led to a 29-year-old Nigerian named Innocent Oseghale who had arrived in Italy on Aug. 26, 2014, around the height of the migrant landings. He had dropped out of his asylum program and turned to crime.Soon after Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s dismembered body was discovered, the police found her bloody clothes inside Mr. Oseghale\u2019s apartment. Italian prosecutors charged him in June with murder, drug dealing and the desecration of a body.The circumstances surrounding Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s death are still unknown.Her mutilation horrified the country and immediately became an issue in the national elections. On the campaign trail, Mr. Salvini had already depicted a world in which migrant drug dealers preyed on wayward teenagers in an increasingly drug-addled country. Now, he pounced.\u201cWhat was this worm still doing in Italy? He wasn\u2019t fleeing a war. He brought the war to Italy,\u201d Mr. Salvini said in a statement posted on Facebook after Mr. Oseghale\u2019s arrest. \u201cThe left has its hands dirty with blood. Another state killing. Expulsions, expulsions, monitoring and still expulsions!\u201dMany Italians were already worried that their young belonged to a lost generation. Police reports of drug use, especially among the young, increased 40 percent in the last two years, according to a report presented in June in the Italian Senate.Heroin and cocaine are making comebacks. And despite some improvements, youth unemployment still hovered above 30 percent, among the worst in Europe.Frustrated young voters had fueled the rise of the Five Star Movement, Mr. Salvini\u2019s anti-establishment coalition partner. The party remained purposely vague during the campaign to attract votes on the left and right, but Mr. Salvini did the opposite.He accused undocumented migrants of taking jobs from young Italians and advocated extreme measures, including \u201ca mass cleansing, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood.\u201dIn Macerata, Mr. Traini, who once described Mr. Salvini as his \u201ccaptain,\u201d held a similar view.A chubby kid who grew up to be a weight lifter with the word \u201coutcast\u201d tattooed across his knuckles, Mr. Traini at first seemed like so many other members of Italy\u2019s wayward youth. He was failing to find steady work and living at the age of 28 with his mother and grandmother.But signs of Mr. Traini\u2019s extremism were scattered around his room. He kept a copy of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d; a black flag with a Celtic cross, used by the European neo-Nazi movement; and the cover of \u201cFascist Youth,\u201d a magazine published during the rule of Mussolini.After winning zero votes as the League\u2019s candidate for local office in Corridonia, the town where Ms. Mastropietro had entered a drug clinic, he drifted further right, toward Forza Nuova.Ms. Borra, the Forza Nuova activist, said that Mr. Traini\u2019s nickname was \u201cthe wolf\u201d but that he was a bit more like a \u201cstray dog.\u201d Having started in the League, she said, \u201che got close to CasaPound, all of the movements on the right.\u201dOn the morning of Feb. 3, Mr. Traini went to the gym, heard a news report about Ms. Mastropietro on the radio and, according to his lawyer, went insane with a desire to kill drug dealers. He returned to his mother\u2019s house and retrieved his Glock handgun. Armed with 50 bullets, he took off in his Alfa Romeo 147, music blasting.\u201cMaybe it was the Flight of the Valkyries,\u201d joked Giancarlo Giulianelli, Mr. Traini\u2019s lawyer.Outside Diaz Gardens and below a statue of Garibaldi, Mr. Traini shot at men sitting inside the glass gazebo of a bar. He fired into the local headquarters of the Democratic Party and rode out to the country road where the police had found Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s remains.Mourners had left flowers and candles wrapped in rosaries. Mr. Traini said a prayer over a candle with a sticker of Mussolini on it, his lawyer said.As he returned to town, he stopped in front of a pub called H7, where he had worked until October when he was fired as a bouncer for insulting the clients at a techno concert. He fired three shots, sending Roberto Tartabini, the manager, scurrying into an adjacent room.\u201cIt was a personal vendetta,\u201d Mr. Tartabini said, adding that he intended to turn the bullet holes in the door into a smiley face to promote tolerance.All six of Mr. Traini\u2019s victims were black. Omagbon Festus, 33, was walking to the grocery store when Mr. Traini pulled up next to him. Mr. Festus said he saw \u201ca pure white Italian man\u201d pointing a pistol before he felt the bullet that shattered the bone in his left forearm.In the hours after the shooting rampage, the news media and much of Italy\u2019s political leadership descended on Macerata. Mr. Salvini offered a perfunctory condemnation of the violence on Twitter, but he also argued that \u201cunchecked immigration brings chaos, anger\u201d and \u201cdrug dealing, thefts, rapes and violence.\u201dMr. Carancini, the mayor, scrambled to respond, and to his critics, seemed overwhelmed. But he said that the damage had already been done \u2014 to the image that the Democratic Party was effectively managing the migration crisis, to the party\u2019s electoral prospects, and to Macerata\u2019s chances of becoming a major tourist attraction.Two days after the shootings, Mr. Carancini traveled to Rome to make his best pitch to the Culture Ministry.\u201cMacerata, in that moment, almost required it,\u201d the mayor said bitterly. \u201cWe were in a centrifuge.\u201dThe commission selected Parma, a town in northern Italy already famous for prosciutto and cheese, as the 2020 capital of culture.Only a few years ago, Mr. Salvini, the interior minister, seemed like an old blemish on Italy\u2019s fresh new skin.But roughly 620,000 migrants, many of them Africans, have arrived in Italy since the migration crisis began in 2014. They resided in government centers and local parishes, but many also loitered at train stations or outside supermarkets and bars.And some have inflated the ranks of the dangerous Nigerian mafia that traffics in drugs, prostitution and sex slavery.By 2016, Mr. Salvini was on the rise.He walked through a market in Milan, receiving the warm regards of Italian fruit vendors and pointing disapprovingly at the foreigners selling cloves of garlic. He stopped into a bar and talked about whether he wanted to leave the euro (\u201cDefinitely yes, tomorrow morning\u201d) or whether Russia had paid for his support (\u201cIt\u2019s geopolitical and free\u201d).Several times, people interrupted to encourage him. \u201cDo what you say you\u2019ll do,\u201d one woman said.\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he responded.He transformed his Northern League party from a regional separatist movement into a national \u2014 and nationalist \u2014 movement. He had once disparaged southern Italians as lazy and reeking; now he courted their votes by dropping \u201cNorthern\u201d from the party\u2019s name.Cribbing from an international populist playbook, he railed against the elite and against the mainstream media, even as he dominated its news cycles. With southerners welcomed to the fold, he needed a common, external enemy for Italians to rally around.He had once disparaged evil bureaucrats in Rome. Now he turned his ire on Brussels. The southern threat became invading African migrants.Last winter, as the campaign entered its full swing, Mr. Salvini posted a video to his Facebook account contrasting poor, elderly Italians digging through the garbage for food with African migrants criticizing Italian rice.\u201cOn the TV news they don\u2019t show this, I wonder why \u2026 At least SHARE it on the web,\u201d Mr. Salvini wrote. The post was shared 294,000 times with 10 million views.By then, Mr. Salvini\u2019s appeal was spreading to places like Macerata.On a recent evening, Tullio Patassini, a League member who now represents Macerata in Parliament, explained why the party fit so well, touching on topics such as law and order and the Russian sanctions. He said that Macerata, a traditional center of the Italian shoe industry, opposed sanctions against Russia because \u201cthe Russians love Italian shoes and we lost the market.\u201dMr. Salvini openly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his populist government has already opposed the European Union sanctions. But the decisive issue seemed to be migration.Mr. Patassini said frustration over illegal migration had really turned up the temperature.\u201cIt\u2019s like a pot that boils, boils, boils until the top shoots off,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we Italians are a welcoming people, generous, good, available \u2014 and so the case of Pamela posed a problem for everyone. It\u2019s an Italy problem.\u201dWeeks later, Mr. Patassini attended a funeral in Rome for Ms. Mastropietro, now known throughout Italy simply as Pamela. \u201cHow could I not be here?\u201d he said.At the onset of the migration crisis, towns and politicians in Sicily sometimes held funerals for unknown migrants who had drowned at sea in a sign of solidarity and respect. But at Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s funeral, parishioners in the back of the church whispered \u201cNo, no, no\u201d when a delegation of Nigerian officials came to pay their respects.Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s portrait and candles sat atop her white coffin. Mr. Carancini, the mayor, sat in the front row and listened as Ms. Mastropietro\u2019s mother gave an anguished speech.\u201cEven if they harmed you atrociously,\u201d she said in a trembling voice, \u201cyou are alive despite those people who massacred you.\u201dMs. Mastropietro was due to return from the drug treatment center on March 4, the day of the election that swept Mr. Salvini into power. It was also the day that Mr. Festus, one of the migrants shot by Mr. Traini, turned 33.He lives about 45 minutes outside Macerata in a sparsely furnished room a short walk from a soccer field that was an internment camp for 61 Jews in World War II. The first time he saw Macerata, he said, he was struck by how clean it was. He shopped for red palm oil and talked to friends in the African shops. Now he avoids it.\u201cI crossed the Sahara and the Mediterranean,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this happened to me in Europe?\u201dEurope\u2019s history is bloody and the idea of it as a haven is relatively new. But people forget.On April 25, the Italian holiday commemorating the end of Nazi occupation, a handful of army veterans saluted the fallen soldier at Macerata\u2019s crater-shaped Monument of the Resistance. Mr. Carancini, wearing a tricolor sash, urged the crowd not to forget Italy\u2019s Fascist past.\u201cThis territory in particular is living a moment of great difficulty, uncertainty and precariousness,\u201d he said.The ceremony ended, the crowd broke up, and some wandered past newsstands selling local papers headlined \u201cPamela: Torture and Crime, The Secrets of the Nigerians.\u201d At Piazza Vittorio Veneto, volunteers offered lunch for 200 residents and migrants. A priest handed out prayer cards quoting Pope Francis: \u201cWe are all migrants.\u201dMr. Diallo, the Senegalese man who had practiced his Italian verbs at the Caritas center, laughed with friends as they ate African and Italian specialties. Tiziana Manuale, who managed the center, sat nearby. Many people at the lunch would be forced to leave, she said.\u201cThere was the notion that Macerata is a welcoming city,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some parts of the population aren\u2019t ready.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Town Grieves for a Father and His Four Daughters", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEANECK, N.J. \u2014 The seats in the last pew at the Church of St. Anastasia here were empty during Sunday Mass.Two bouquets of flowers, five votive candles and two photos lined the bench where the Trinidad family usually sat, a memorial to a father and his four daughters who died in a car accident in Delaware on Friday while returning from a vacation in Maryland.The father, Audie Trinidad, 61, and his daughters Kaitlyn, 20, Danna, 17, and 14-year-old twins Allison and Melissa were killed when a Ford F-350 pickup truck veered out of its lane on State Route 1 and crossed the grassy median into oncoming traffic, striking the family\u2019s minivan. Mary Rose, the girls\u2019 mother, remained in the hospital in serious condition on Sunday. Delaware State Police are still investigating the crash.The tragedy has stunned this town of 40,000, where the family was tightly woven into the community. Mr. Trinidad was an usher at his church. His daughters were volleyball players. The family was active in the Filipino American Society of Teaneck.A mile and a half from the Roman Catholic parish, on a quiet residential street shaded by tall maple trees, a memorial of flowers, teddy bears and balloons fanned across the front lawn of the Trinidads home. A painting of the family depicted as angelic figures with halos sat on the porch.Daniel Trinidad, 59, Audie Trinidad\u2019s brother, stood on the porch on Sunday afternoon greeting a steady procession of visitors and well-wishers, many of them strangers, in a continuation of a community response that has left him awe-struck.\u201cHe\u2019s a family man,\u201d Mr. Trinidad said of his brother, and the outing to Ocean City, Md., was typical of the summer trips the Trinidads took.Audie Trinidad moved to the United States in 1986 and joined the Navy. After serving for seven years, he joined the U.S. Postal Service, where he still worked.\u201cI still have to call them to let them know,\u201d Mr. Trinidad said, before considering that the news, which he said has traveled as far as the Philippines, might have already reached his brother\u2019s colleagues.The twins had finished eighth grade at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, Mr. Trinidad said, and were preparing to attend Teaneck High School. Their sister Danna had one more year before graduation. The eldest, Kaitlyn, was studying nursing at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx, following the career path of her mother, an obstetrics nurse at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Manhattan.\u201cAll gone in the blink of an eye,\u201d Mr. Trinidad said.Larry DuHadaway, 43, a firefighter in Maryland and Delaware, was driving his family to the beach in Rehoboth, Del., when he saw a truck ahead of him suddenly crossing the median into oncoming traffic. After striking a white car, the truck was T-boned by the van carrying the Trinidads, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the fire service for 28 years, and that was the worst that I\u2019ve been on, let alone witnessed,\u201d he said.During the homily at the 11:30 a.m. Mass at St. Anastasia, the service the Trinidad family regularly attended, the congregation rose and each person passed by the family\u2019s pew, many with arms around one another, some in tears.\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d said Kevin Regan, a deacon at the church who delivered the homily. \u201cThey\u2019re having a very difficult time. We have a very large Philippine community. They all are active, very active. And as you can see from this 11:30 Mass, there are people honoring their family. It\u2019s going to be a tough, long week.\u201dThe memorial began with a prayer and song, as the aching chorus of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d mixed with sorrowful sobs as neighbors and friends of the children shared memories.\u201cThe twins were my bestest friends since preschool,\u201d said one young woman who didn\u2019t give her name as she spoke. \u201cWe used to hang out since we were 3 years old. And to see them leave without saying goodbye is the worst experience in my life.\u201dMr. Trinidad said the family\u2019s first priority is to help his sister-in-law. Family members were also preparing to travel to Delaware on Monday to make funeral arrangements.Another task, Mr. Trinidad said, will be to hire a lawyer to represent the family in connection with the crash.It was a very different future from the one that Mr. Trinidad said he and his siblings had imagined, which was to watch their nieces grow up and start families of their own.\u201cBut now that dream is crushed,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are going to be a lot of empty holidays,\u201d Mr. Trinidad said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same without them.\u201dOutside the family\u2019s home, the same photograph that was taped to their church pew was hanging outside the front door. Mr. Trinidad said it was the last picture taken of the family. They had stopped for lunch on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, enjoying crabs and French fries at a roadside stand, just before the crash.Ashley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

There she was, just casually whipping up whole fish on a Wednesday as if she were auditioning for \u201cIron Chef.\u201d To me, unfussy doesn\u2019t mean boring \u2014 it means approachable and accessible. It means getting dinner on the table with ingredients that are simultaneously inexpensive and interesting, treating them in a mix of new and familiar ways and doing it in less time than it takes to start a new series on Netflix. The recipes in this new column will follow suit, blurring the line between weeknight-friendly and weekend-worthy, because shouldn\u2019t a great dish be both?I think so, and this trout certainly is. There\u2019s the effortless, elegant presentation, combined with a dramatic proclamation: \u201cI cooked an entire fish for you! On a school night!\u201d But at its core, it\u2019s a simple sheet-pan dinner made with nine ingredients in under 30 minutes. There are also a few practical benefits from cooking trout in its butterflied form, rather than individual fillets. First, using the larger piece greatly reduces the risk of overcooking. Second, that larger piece buys you some time in the oven, which means you can throw something else on that sheet pan to cook alongside that trout. Thin, wispy stalks of broccolini are my personal favorite for the way their frilly ends get impossibly crisp, but other vegetables like boiled and crushed potatoes, stripped leaves of kale or halved cherry tomatoes, which will burst and get slightly saucy, are all excellent. Third, while there are the inevitable tiny bones, which you can easily maneuver around, there is no \u201ctableside filleting,\u201d a phrase that should never be said in one\u2019s own kitchen. (Remember: I am unfussy and want you to be, too.) From there, the possibilities are as simple or complicated as you feel like making them: Scatter a few slices of citrus over the fish, drizzle with some olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and you\u2019re in business.

They just move very slowly.\u201dIn late 2008, Mr. Busch was doing corporate assignments, a world that could not have been farther from his own background in art photography, when he noticed a row of plants in an office hallway. \u201cAnd they looked like sculptures,\u201d he said. Mr. Busch grew up an introverted child in a small village in Germany\u2019s Black Forest. His mother, a pharmacist by profession, also studied botany.  \u201cI had a dog and a cat, and we had a garden,\u201d he recalled. \u201cNext to the garden, there were just fields. So I was curious as a child and my mother told me all the names of the plants.\u201dEverything changed, though, when Mr. Busch was 10 years old. His grandmother died, his parents divorced, his sister moved out, and he ended up at a boarding school where he didn\u2019t want to be. He felt alone and homesick. A pet would have helped, but the school, of course, did not allow pets in the dormitories. Plants, however, were O.K. \u201cThat was the only living thing I could have as my own,\u201d Mr. Busch said. \u201cSo I put them on the windowsill and decided that they are my friends now. Ever since, I\u2019ve always had at least one plant wherever I\u2019ve lived.\u201dMr. Busch started the project in Rastatt, Germany, then moved on to Hamburg, Berlin and other cities and small towns throughout the country. He approached each office plant the same way, using the same camera with ambient light, and no tripod. Each plant remained in its found environment, much like August Sander\u2019s portraits. \u201cIf you look at them closely for a longer period of time you can actually see how the body of the plant develops in a way so they get what they really need,\u201d he said.In most cases, that\u2019s light, which leaves absorb using chlorophyll to synthesize, convert, and store sugars from water and carbon dioxide, producing oxygen as a result. Plants tend to lean toward light and if they\u2019re not continually turned, they will take on anthropomorphic gestures. \u201cThey basically have to or they die,\u201d Mr. Busch said. \u201cThey can\u2019t walk away, they can\u2019t quit their job. But they have to find a way of getting enough sun, water and nutrition.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He\u2019d been resettled in Chicago a few weeks earlier, and he was traveling with another Rohingya refugee from Manus and an Australian couple from Queensland who flew to the United States to see them after years of long-distance support.As a foursome, they were a case study in hope and trauma.Imran looked physically stronger. He told me his life in the United States, as part of the refugee resettlement deal first brokered by President Barack Obama, started with elation.\u201cIt was just incredible to be out of Manus,\u201d he said over a breakfast of coffee and eggs near Times Square. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to be a free man my whole life, and when the immigration officer said \u2018Welcome to America\u2019 \u2014 that was all I wanted to hear.\u201dBut the more we talked the more Imran revealed that he was still haunted by Manus and by Australia\u2019s policy of indefinite detention for asylum seekers trying to get to Australia by boat.He\u2019d seen people die in Manus, decline into depression, or become addicted to medication. Some were attacked. And he clearly felt conflicted about his departure.\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe lived together for the past five years. They become like family then suddenly you\u2019re leaving them behind.\u201dImran\u2019s own transition is moving slowly.He has only three months of government assistance. He still can\u2019t work as he waits for identification documents. He lives in a building with immigrants from all over the world, many of whom express frustration with a rising tide of American bigotry.Imran is tougher than he looks; he fled Myanmar by boat at 16 and is now 24. But he admitted struggling with the demands of American life.\u201cI\u2019m expected to function as if I\u2019ve been here for years,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are more interested in hearing about your happiness than your sadness.\u201dIsolation, depression, ambition \u2014 all three are blowing through his new life.Sandra and Len Fulham are what amounts to shelter.Imran calls them \u201cmy Australian mum and dad.\u201dThey first connected with Imran \u2014 and Faisal Mohammad, his traveling companion and roommate on Manus and in Chicago \u2014 through Facebook in 2015.Before long, Sandra and \u201cthe boys,\u201d as she calls them, developed a daily habit of messaging about their lives.Imran told me Sandra and Len sent him clothes, phone credit and books on Manus. The Fulhams also promised to visit wherever he ended up, prompting a sudden trip to Chicago and a road trip to New York and Washington, D.C.\u201cWe just thought we\u2019d give them the best experience we could,\u201d Sandra said.Lovers of stars and sky, the Fulhams usually travel only for astronomical events like eclipses. But for the boys, they made an exception, sharing an enthusiastic adventure tempered by thoughts of what might have been.Sandra was blunt: \u201cI\u2019m proud of them for how their coping but I\u2019m disappointed that it has to be in America.\u201dIn Australia, she said, helping the boys adjust would have been easier.Len said he still couldn\u2019t fathom Australia\u2019s tolerance for cruelty and waste.\u201cThey\u2019ve spent $2 million keeping Imran incarcerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could have gotten him a high school education, a college degree and started him in a good business.\u201dTogether, across great distances, they\u2019ve created a clear alternative to the fear-driven border policies spreading through the United States, Europe and Australia.

{"Headline": "How Andrew Wheeler, the New Acting E.P.A. Chief, Differs From Scott Pruitt", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut unlike Mr. Pruitt \u2014 who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending \u2014 Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules.For that reason, Mr. Wheeler\u2019s friends and critics alike say, he could ultimately prove to be more adept than his controversial former boss in the job.\u201cMany worry Wheeler will be more effective at implementing Trump\u2019s anti-environmental agenda than Pruitt was,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, in the wake of the departure.It is possible that Mr. Trump could nominate Mr. Wheeler to the top job. However, several other names have also been mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Pruitt, including Donald Van der Vaart, a former senior environmental official in North Carolina. Mr. Pruitt selected him to serve on an E.P.A. scientific advisory board.Mr. Wheeler will now step in as the acting chief of an agency that has been central to President Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise of stripping away regulations.During Mr. Pruitt\u2019s tenure, the former Oklahoma attorney general gained headlines for his aggressive push to roll back dozens of regulations governing clean air and water, and fighting against Obama-era rules focused on limiting carbon emissions. In recent months, however, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s policy efforts were overshadowed by a running stream of alleged ethics violations.Mr. Wheeler tends to eschew the limelight, his colleagues said. His career was built around quietly and incrementally advancing the interests of the fossil-fuel industry, chiefly by weakening or delaying federal regulations.Mr. Wheeler has worked in Washington for more than 20 years. He is a former chief of staff to Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, the conservative Republican who has become known as Washington\u2019s most prominent denialist of the established science of human-caused climate change.Mr. Wheeler also worked at the E.P.A. during the administration of the first President George Bush. More recently, he lobbied for the coal company Murray Energy, whose chief executive, Robert E. Murray, has been a supporter and adviser of Mr. Trump\u2019s.Environmentalists see in Mr. Wheeler a powerful ally of polluting industries and enemy of clean air and water. \u201cLike Pruitt, this veteran coal lobby lobbyist has shown only disdain for the E.P.A.\u2019s vital mission to protect Americans\u2019 health and our environment,\u201d said Ana Unruh Cohen, managing director for government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.\u201cWelcome, pulsating black sludge,\u201d Mr. Jackson responded. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to get the cleaning crews to come in more often.\u201dThis is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry.Washington insiders describe Mr. Wheeler as well positioned to pursue Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda as effectively as Mr. Pruitt, or even more so, by moving more slowly but in ways likelier to withstand legal challenge.\u201cAndrew is one of the most well-known, well-respected policy professionals in Washington on energy and environment \u2014 he knows everybody,\u201d said Matthew Dempsey, a former colleague of Mr. Wheeler\u2019s in Mr. Inhofe\u2019s office, who currently works for a consulting firm representing the oil and gas industry.\u201cHe will be similar to Pruitt in terms of the agenda \u2014 he understands the Trump administration and will carry out the agenda,\u201d said Mr. Dempsey. \u201cBut he\u2019s been around Washington a long time. He knows how D.C. works and he does things by the book.\u201dThe departure of Mr. Pruitt, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Inhofe\u2019s, and rise of Mr. Wheeler represents the powerful influence of Mr. Inhofe on the Trump administration\u2019s environment policy. Mr. Inhofe had long championed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s political career, and it was speculated that Mr. Pruitt would one day run for Mr. Inhofe\u2019s Senate seat in Oklahoma.Mr. Wheeler is one of a group of former Inhofe staff members, loosely known as the \u201cInhofe mafia,\u201d who now work in energy and environment policy positions across the Trump administration and in top Washington lobbying firms.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Mr. Inhofe cheered Mr. Wheeler\u2019s arrival at the E.P.A. earlier this year. \u201cAndy Wheeler is the most competent and qualified person for the job he\u2019s been asked to fulfill,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s rise also represents a victory of influence for another of his former bosses, the coal magnate and Trump adviser Robert Murray.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Inhofe and Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Wheeler has questioned the established science of human-caused climate change. In 2010, Mr. Wheeler criticized the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s leading scientific authority on global warming, writing in a blog post that it has \u201chas functioned more as a political body than a scientific body.\u201dHowever, some Democrats have offered at least modest praise of Mr. Wheeler \u2014 as he himself noted in another email exchange with Mr. Jackson.Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.After his November confirmation hearing, Mr. Wheeler emailed Mr. Jackson. \u201cEveryone seemed to think I did a really good job, including Inhofe, Capito and Mr. Murray. Carper and Cardin both said really nice things about me,\u201d he wrote.He was apparently referring to Democratic Senators Thomas Carper of Delaware and Ben Cardin of Maryland, both of whom are advocates of strong environmental regulations, and Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the Republican from West Virginia, who is one of Washington\u2019s strongest advocates for the coal industry.In a statement at Mr. Wheeler\u2019s confirmation hearing, Mr. Carper said, \u201cAs a longtime staffer for the senior senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Wheeler was someone with whom we didn\u2019t always agree on each and every policy, but he did prove to be one with whom we were able to work together on policies that we did agree on.\u201d However, Mr. Carper did eventually vote against Mr. Wheeler\u2019s confirmation to his position as deputy.While it is likely that Mr. Wheeler, as the acting E.P.A. chief, will be effective in implementing Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda, one potential obstacle to his being nominated by the president to fill the job permanently is his record of opposing Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. In a Facebook post on February 29, 2016, Mr. Wheeler penned a strong critique of Mr. Trump that has since been deleted.\u201cIf you are considering voting for Donald Trump please think about the following: 1) no one really knows what his political beliefs are, he has donated to both parties over the years and to people with completely different views. 2) he has demonstrated through the debates and interviews that he doesn\u2019t understand how government works,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Wheeler\u2019s post also suggested that, as a businessman, Mr. Trump \u201creally hasn\u2019t been that successful.\u201dNeither Mr. Wheeler nor two White House spokesmen responded to requests for comment about the Facebook post.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

My brother tells of drunk people in the street punching one-handed while holding their pita-wrapped meat protectively behind them. My sister claims to have seen a brawl in a Fitzroy cocktail bar that was prompted by a disagreement over the comparative quality of two dueling neighborhood souvlaki shops. There\u2019s a lot of passion in this country when it comes to Greek food.The oft-quoted factoid that there are more Greeks in Melbourne than any other city in the world outside Greece is somewhat debatable. It depends on what you mean by \u201cGreeks,\u201d what you mean by \u201ccity,\u201d and which statistics you trust. According to census numbers, the New York metropolitan area has a higher number of self-identified Greeks than Melbourne, but that area includes giant hunks of Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as all of Long Island and most of the Hudson Valley. It didn\u2019t occur to me then that this Australian style was actually Greek influence, passed over fences by neighbors, sold at the many Greek-owned greengrocers and picked up at neighborhood restaurants. Australia has a climate especially well-suited to the basic building blocks of Mediterranean cooking, and the backyards of Melbourne overflow with lemon trees and rosemary bushes. That restaurant moved in 2013 to a different space (still within the Herald Sun building) where its intimate dining room resembles a luxe disco insect hive, with curved cream leather booths and a ceiling of brass podlike ornamentation. The tasting menu served here, which runs from $125 to $170 per person, is as artfully plated and elegant as any fine-dining meal, and it is emphatically Greek. The old-school family restaurant is alive and well, too. At Jim\u2019s Greek Tavern in Melbourne, there are no menus, just a glass case with various meats and seafood on display.

{"Headline": "William McBride, Who Warned About Thalidomide, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam McBride, who was among the first doctors to sound an alarm about thalidomide, the sedative found to cause birth defects, but whose later career was marred by accusations of falsified research results and other misconduct, died on June 27 in Australia. He was 91.His son David announced the death on Facebook. The location and cause were not given.In the spring of 1961, at Crown Street Women\u2019s Hospital in Sydney, Australia, Dr. McBride, an obstetrician, delivered a baby who had malformed arms and other problems. Within a few weeks he had delivered two more. In a letter published in the medical journal The Lancet that December, he noted that what seemed to connect the patients was a drug he had prescribed for morning sickness, thalidomide (known in Australia as Distaval).Dr. McBride was hailed as a hero. But after he set up a research organization, Foundation 41, with prize money he had received from a French institute for his role in the thalidomide matter, he was bedeviled by controversy.In the 1980s his research into possible harmful effects of another drug, Bendectin, was called into question, and he became embroiled in a lengthy battle to defend his reputation. He and his supporters believed drug companies were trying to silence him; at one point he thought they might be monitoring his phone calls.\u201cThere are funny crackles whenever I talk on the phone, and it suddenly fades or boosts,\u201d he told The Sun-Herald of Sydney in 1988. \u201cIt might be nothing, but the drug companies have been known to resort to drastic methods to discredit those who appear in court against them.\u201dIn 1988 an investigative committee established by his own foundation concluded that he \u201cdid publish statements which he either knew were untrue or which he did not genuinely believe to be true, and in that respect was guilty of scientific fraud.\u201d He resigned as the foundation\u2019s medical director. (The foundation soon became inactive.)After receiving medical degrees at the University of Sydney, he served as resident medical officer at several hospitals in the early 1950s. He pursued additional medical studies in London before coming to the Crown Street hospital in 1955. The Sydney Morning Herald said in 1988 that he had delivered some 1,500 babies there before the hospital closed in 1983.In 1960 a representative of Distillers Company, which marketed thalidomide in Britain, came calling, and Dr. McBride agreed to try the drug on some patients. He was the only doctor using it at the hospital when the problems arose, which enabled the quick identification of its link to the birth defects.Among the many controversies surrounding Dr. McBride was whether he was actually the first to make the connection regarding his patients. In 1987, after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation medical journalist Norman Swan, himself a doctor, broadcast a segment questioning Dr. McBride\u2019s Bendectin research, news reports on the resulting uproar said that it was actually a nurse, Pat Sparrow, who had originally noted the thalidomide link. Dr. McBride was said to have initially resisted her suggestion that the drug was at fault but soon adopted that view.In any case, in long legal proceedings over thalidomide, which was eventually implicated in thousands of birth defects, Dr. McBride asserted that he had tried to bring his concerns to the attention of the drug company but was rebuffed.His efforts won him accolades of all sorts. They also brought him a thriving practice and a cash award from L\u2019Institut de la Vie in France. In 1971 he used that money to set up Foundation 41 \u2014 named for the 41 weeks between conception and birth \u2014 to study the causes of mental and physical problems in newborns.As a result of research Dr. McBride conducted about the possible risks of Bendectin (also known as Debendox), he became a sought-after expert witness in lawsuits against Merrell Dow, the manufacturer, that blamed the drug for birth defects.Dr. Swan\u2019s 1987 report and related news articles brought the matter back into the spotlight, challenging Dr. McBride\u2019s research, which was based on studies using rabbits. Throughout the resulting tussles, Dr. McBride maintained that he was a victim of a drug-company campaign to discredit him.\u201cWe are fighting over a few rabbits,\u201d he told The Sun-Herald. \u201cWhat is more important \u2014 a child\u2019s life or how much a rabbit drank in an experiment?\u201dDr. Swan, though, said Dr. McBride had been a victim of his own hubris and his desire to have another success like the early one involving thalidomide.\u201cDr. McBride belonged to an era where doctors were unconditionally revered,\u201d Dr. Swan said by email. \u201cThat was his downfall. He went unchallenged until there was no going back.\u201dDr. McBride won the right to practice medicine again in 1998, though with several conditions, including that he not conduct research.In addition to his son David and daughter Catherine, he is survived by his wife, Patricia Glover, also a doctor; another daughter, Louise; another son, John; and seven grandchildren.One reason Dr. McBride sought reinstatement in 1998, when he was in his 70s, was that he wanted to work in American Samoa, where, he said, his expertise in obstetrics and gynecology were in demand and where he had already done work on a provisional basis.\u201cI was delighted to see how well I could operate,\u201d he said. \u201cI did a cesarean in 20 minutes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was believed to have been taken hostage by the Nusra Front, which now calls itself Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, a group known to capture foreigners for ransom.Nippon News Network said it had obtained the video from a person connected to Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, whom it would not name, who told the network that it had been recorded by the group that captured Mr. Yasuda.

Mr. Forbes is chairman of Forbes Media.We were particularly heartened that Mr. Trump and the Europeans now have a handshake agreement to aim for zero tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.This is a winning strategy that we\u2019ve long endorsed with our friends at the White House because it is fully consistent with what Mr. Trump has often told us: his threat of tariffs is a negotiating tactic to get to lower trade barriers and a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dThe next step should be to extend this zero tariff offer to other key allies, including Britain, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.The alternative is higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and hundreds of products imported from other countries, particularly China. Those actions have led to retaliatory tariffs imposed on products grown or manufactured in America. This has hurt farmers, the stock market and economic growth. What Mr. Trump has proposed to our trading partners is similar: the United States will abolish all its tariffs, subsidies and other trade restraints on their exports if they do the same for American exports. This solution would be the economic equivalent to total trade disarmament. A no-tariffs trade strategy would also allow the United States to seize the moral high ground in the debate. Mr. Trump would be transformed from the evil disrupter of international commerce to a potential savior \u2014 just as 30 years ago Mr. Reagan\u2019s international image changed from superhawk to peacemaker almost overnight. \u200eFinally, if Mr. Trump can secure zero tariff deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, this will put America in a much stronger position as he negotiates with China. It greatly increases the odds that Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line stance with China will deliver long overdue concessions from Beijing that could enhance American economic and national security while averting a brutal escalation in the trade war that could hurt both our economies. Some of our friends in the administration question whether this policy would work because in China and other countries, nontariff barriers are the biggest deterrents to American exports. We agree that nontariff trade restraints \u2014 such as foreign companies stealing our patents with impunity, subsidies to state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation \u2014 are a problem. But reducing tariffs creates momentum for tearing down other trade restraints. We know lowering tariffs will be an uphill battle. Freer trade has always been an elusive pursuit because vested interests on both sides of the Atlantic, whether farmers or manufacturers, will fight to maintain tariffs that benefit their products. We can\u2019t predict how other nations would respond to this idea. But the European Union negotiations last week should provide Mr. Trump a clear signal that he can\u2019t win just by swinging the stick of higher tariffs. He also needs to offer the carrots of lower barriers. By putting zero tariffs on the table, Mr. Trump will also be able to determine which nations are genuinely committed to freer trade and which prefer to keep their protectionist barriers in place. We\u2019ve often reminded politicians that free trade is a pillar of prosperity and a win-win for trading partners. Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this policy, he could build a legacy as the president who expanded world commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whatever Happened to Moral Rigor?", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames Baldwin understood the difference between empathy and approval. Today, we would rather condemn than understand.Mr. Siegel is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Draw: A Memoir.\u201dIn his 1963 book the \u201cThe Fire Next Time,\u201d James Baldwin describes meeting Elijah Muhammad, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam. Baldwin felt alienated by Muhammad\u2019s black separatism and by his universal hatred of white people; at the same time, he admired Muhammad\u2019s acute understanding of the countless ways in which institutionalized white power continued to injure and suppress African-Americans.\u201cI felt very close to him,\u201d he writes about Muhammad, \u201cand really wished to be able to love and honor him as a witness, an ally and a father.\u201d Yet, reflecting on the moment when the two men said goodbye, Baldwin writes, \u201cwe would always be strangers, and possibly, one day, enemies.\u201d Baldwin was as committed as any writer has ever been. But the stuff of his commitment was a moral clarity steeped in intellectual difficulties and ethical complications \u2014 a labyrinthine clarity that he refused to sacrifice to prescribed attitudes. Today we still revere Baldwin, but by and large we no longer follow his lead as a thinker. There is little patience now for such a rigorous yet receptive moral and intellectual style; these days we prefer ringing moral indictment, the hallmarks of which are absolute certainty, predetermined ideas and conformity to collective sentiments.In the process of abandoning the type of complex moral clarity that Baldwin practiced, we have made behavior that is unacceptable the equivalent of behavior that is criminal. An equal amount of fury is directed toward actions as morally \u2014 and legally \u2014 distinct from each other as rape, harassment, rudeness, boorishness and incivility. The outrage over a police shooting of an unarmed black teenager unfolds at the same level of intensity as the outrage over what might or might not be a case of racial profiling by a sales clerk in a small Brooklyn boutique. This is intentional: The general feeling seems to be that distinguishing between degrees of morally repugnant conduct will lead to some sort of blanket pardon of all such conduct; that to understand is always to forgive. Such concern is understandable, but misplaced \u2014 it flattens and obfuscates, rather than clarifies.This aversion to suspending moral judgment is a new development in cultural life. We were once gripped by \u201cIn Cold Blood,\u201d Truman Capote\u2019s imaginative inhabiting of two convicted murderers, or by \u201cThe Executioner\u2019s Song,\u201d Norman Mailer\u2019s empathetic telling of the story of Gary Gilmore, who asked to be executed after he was convicted of killing two men. These were considered bold, even controversial, at the time, but no one pretended that Capote or Mailer were trying to make excuses for their subjects. Readers and critics understood them as efforts to expand and deepen our awareness of the forces, both inside and outside a person, that shape a human life. It\u2019s hard to imagine a similar work being produced in today\u2019s climate.Capote and Mailer didn\u2019t invent this method. You could tell the history of Western culture with such instances of skeptical rationalism and imaginative empathy, from Aeschylus\u2019 Clytemnestra and Euripides\u2019 Medea, to Shakespeare\u2019s Lady Macbeth and Richard III, Milton\u2019s Lucifer, Mary Shelley\u2019s Dr. Frankenstein, Balzac\u2019s master-criminal Vautrin, Dostoyevsky\u2019s amoral superman Raskolnikov, Joseph Conrad\u2019s terrorists, Thomas Mann\u2019s con man Felix Krull, Andre Gide\u2019s coldblooded murderer, Albert Camus\u2019s helpless murderer \u2014 to take a relative handful of examples. Closer to our own time and place, Richard Wright\u2019s Bigger Thomas accidentally kills a white woman in the novel \u201cNative Son,\u201d and then rapes and murders a black woman; Gore Vidal wrote with sympathy about Timothy McVeigh; and David Mamet composed \u201cOleanna,\u201d a prescient play about sexual harassment, accusation, guilt and innocence that, famously, had no clear resolution. Crucially, this tendency did not remain in the preserve of high art. The elevation of moral complexity over moral condemnation, once the special province of high culture, made its way over centuries into mainstream thinking about justice and tolerance, helping to bring us to the enlightened values of modern liberal democracy.Today, however, our dominant cultural style is very different. We thrill to a kind of pornography of exposing and shaming. We favor predetermined verdicts that have been arrived at by collective sentiment \u2014 a cultural style that accuses first, presents evidence often without questioning it, then makes a judicial finding and passes a sentence. The representative figure of our age is not the poet, the artist, the novelist, the scientist, the businessman, the actor, the athlete, the statesman. It is the prosecutor. There exists a kind of silent censoring of any attempt to understand a person\u2019s ugly behavior rather than seeking exclusively to punish it. Imagine the outcry if you went further and speculated about why Harvey Weinstein allegedly manipulated some actresses dependent on his power into watching him while he was naked. Could it be that Mr. Weinstein, who reportedly had often been mocked for his appearance, wanted to dehumanize these women as well, while at the same time turning himself into a person who is watched and admired, like a person of beauty? In matters of law and public morality, let justice take its course along the lines of due process and fair play. But in the realm of the free operation of intellect and imagination that is culture, let there bloom the suspension of moral judgment for the sake of a better understanding of our moral natures. It\u2019s not because we owe anything to the likes of Harvey Weinstein; it\u2019s because of what we owe ourselves.Lee Siegel is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Draw: A Memoir.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Searching for Missing Migrants in the Desert Near the Mexican Border", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.What would you do if your brother went missing in the California desert? For Rafael Luna, an immigrant from Mexico, the answer was simple: Find him.The organization was founded six years ago in San Diego by working people, mostly immigrants themselves, who saw a need to help families find some kind of closure. While illegal border crossings have plunged in recent years, the number of migrants dying along the border is climbing; more than 400 people were found dead in 2017.With the Border Patrol pushing border crossers into more remote areas, and with a heat wave punishing parts of the Southwest, forensic researchers say the number of migrants dying around the border may actually be much higher, providing the \u00c1guilas with many grisly reports of such tragedies.Sometimes the relatives of missing migrants accompany the \u00c1guilas on their grim task, as Mr. Luna did one recent Saturday, just an hour\u2019s drive from prosperous San Diego. He joined more than 20 volunteers who piled into aging 4x4s and then fanned out on a stretch of barren federal land.After trekking under the desert sun, using satellite images and intelligence gleaned from other migrants, they found the body of a man who seemed to have been trying to find shelter near a boulder in his last moments alive. Next to him, in bag of belongings, was a Mexican ID card with the name of Adrian Luna, who went missing two months ago while crossing the border.\u201cThat was my brother,\u201d Mr. Luna said after absorbing the shock of finding the remains, and thanking the \u00c1guilas for their help in finding the body. He and the volunteers placed a simple wooden cross where the remains were found. \u201cNow, maybe it\u2019s time to move on,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)I would not encourage Latino high school seniors to apply to Merced as a first choice. The greater opportunities to become acquainted with world class faculty weigh heavily in favor of Cal and UCLA as first choices. I believe that we need more diversity at these campuses where Latinos and African-Americans are woefully under-represented. I also take issue with the growing percentage of out-of-state students attending UC. State residents support the system through their taxes and should have a significant preference over non-state applicants.- Joanne NoganoI grew up in Merced, and while I chose to go to another UC for undergrad, many of my friends in the area stayed at home and attended UCM. They saved on living expenses and were able to enjoy many of the benefits of a smaller school (smaller class size, more resources for labs, etc.). Yes, Merced has yet to reach the higher tiers of its sister schools. But that only happens with funding, time, and a continued commitment from students to never let their potential be limited by the branding of their upbringing. Make no mistake, there are students at Merced right now who will someday change the world. As Californians, I pray we continue to help them and others find their path forward.- Josh SarmaUC Merced is a fantastic example of the type of public investment that this state, and this country, used to make in the middle of the 20th century, but doesn\u2019t anymore. It should be viewed as a beacon for how government ought to operate.

{"Headline": "Sacha Baron Cohen Is Duping Republicans. Is He the James O\u2019Keefe of the Left?", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019re referring to the newest series from Sacha Baron Cohen, a comedian known for foisting outlandish characters on unsuspecting victims.The show has been met with scorn from some corners, especially from some who were fooled like Ms. Palin, but others have taken the pranking in stride.\u201cWho Is America?\u201d has also prompted a conversation about the ethics of deception. And since Mr. Cohen\u2019s most biting sketches so far \u2014 including one about arming children with guns, and another on Sunday night that embarrassed a Georgia legislator \u2014 have been aimed at Republicans, more than a few people have called him a mirror version of Mr. O\u2019Keefe, who has delighted conservatives and infuriated liberals with his tactics.Mr. O\u2019Keefe himself has gleefully seized on the comparison.He said in an email, referring to the name of his operation, \u201cIt is hypocritical to deride Project Veritas\u2019s ethics using undercover techniques, and then gloss over the same exact tactic Cohen has repeatedly used to commercial success.\u201dHow similar are Mr. O\u2019Keefe and Mr. Cohen? We explore that question and more in our primer below.Christy Cones, of the Coast Gallery in Laguna Beach, Calif., sat down with Mr. Cohen as he played an ex-convict looking to start an art career. His \u201cart\u201d consisted of using body waste in prison to make portraits. At Mr. Cohen\u2019s urging, Ms. Cones did some, um, clipping to provide him some bodily materials for his brush.The highlight \u2014 or lowlight, depending on who is reacting \u2014 involved the Cohen character Col. Erran Morad, an Israeli \u201cantiterror expert\u201d who appears to be comfortable with growth hormones. He duped several politicians and gun rights activists into making public service announcements for an initiative that would arm children as young as 3. One, Philip Van Cleave, head of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, even taped an instructional video \u2014 complete with silly graphics \u2014 aimed to teach preschoolers to be \u201ckinderguardians.\u201dMr. Spencer, who had proposed a bill that would have banned Muslims from wearing veils in public, was fooled into taking part in what he believed was antiterrorism training. Mr. Cohen, playing the Morad character again, was able to persuade Mr. Spencer to shout a racial epithet repeatedly and drop his pants by telling him that doing so would help stop a terrorist attack. He also used a slur to refer to people from the Middle East.By Monday morning, leading Republicans in Georgia were distancing themselves from Mr. Spencer, and the speaker of the state House of Representatives urged him to resign.Others were less forgiving.In a statement last week, Mr. Spencer said that he was put in a \u201ckidnapping scenario\u201d and \u201crepeatedly asked to shout provocative language.\u201d He said Mr. Cohen had exploited his real fear of being attacked, as he had been receiving death threats over his proposed legislation. He also threatened legal action against Showtime \u2014 and said Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cdeceptive and fraudulent behavior is exactly why President Donald Trump was elected.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Spencer was more contrite, saying in a text message to The Washington Post: \u201cI apologize to my family, friends, and the people of my district for this ridiculously ugly episode.\u201d He was defeated in a primary election this year, and said on Monday that he would finish out the final five months of his term rather than resign.\u201cI sat through a long \u2018interview\u2019 full of Hollywoodism\u2019s disrespect and sarcasm \u2014 but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen\u2019s chagrin,\u201d Ms. Palin wrote.Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Walsh, of the \u201ckinderguardians\u201d segment, both described being approached by someone claiming to be from an Israeli television crew looking to interview supporters of Israel for a program about the 70th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding. Mr. Walsh provided emails to The Times that shed some light into Mr. Cohen\u2019s approach. Here\u2019s one:\u201cSubject: Media Request for Rep. Joe Walsh\u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201cMy name is Ashley and I am writing to you on behalf of First Liberty Pictures. We are currently producing a docu-style series that will air on the Israeli network YES and we\u2019d like to feature Rep. Joe Walsh as a \u201cFriend of Israel\u201d since he has consistently been a supporter for the security of the Israeli people. Our show\u2019s aim is to highlight the common security concerns that our countries share, learn from each other\u2019s perspective, and further illustrate the unshakeable bond between the U.S. and Israel.\u201cRep. Walsh understands that the post-9/11 security situation in the U.S. is similar to what Israel has faced since its creation, in the form of terrorist organizations like Hamas, the P.L.O., Hezbollah, and ISIS. He understands it\u2019s crucial that Americans are ready to defend themselves against radical Islamic extremists. Terrorism is no longer just in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem \u2026 it has spread to places like Orlando, San Bernardino, and Fort Hood, and it\u2019s threatening our shared values of freedom and democracy.\u201cFor the on camera appearance, he would meet with a gentleman from Israel who has seen the tactics used by these extremists up close and has developed unique anti-extremist techniques that very few in the world are privy to and he would like to share them with Rep. Walsh and our audience.\u201cWe\u2019d love to fly him out here to film with us in the L.A. area at the end of October or alternatively, we plan to be in the Washington D.C. area the first or second week of November. Would he be available then? Please let me know his level of interest in participating.\u201cLooking forward to speaking with you.\u201dMr. Walsh said in a phone interview that Mr. Cohen\u2019s team went as far as to charter a limousine for him, provide hair and makeup for the on-camera appearance, as well as present him with an actual award that lauded Mr. Walsh for \u201csignificant contributions to the state of Israel.\u201dIt depends on how you look at it, and like much in America today, the answer falls along party lines.Their tactics and aims are somewhat different. Mr. O\u2019Keefe often operates with undercover cameras, sending in people playing characters like a pregnant woman (to Planned Parenthood) or a prostitute (to Acorn), to try to entrap their workers into discussing improper or potentially illegal activities. His participants don\u2019t realize they are being filmed, which is not the case with Mr. Cohen\u2019s work.Mr. O\u2019Keefe also seems more interested in tearing down institutions than merely embarrassing them, as Mr. Koppel noted in a phone interview.\u201cOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as approving of what Mr. O\u2019Keefe has done but at least he\u2019s doing it for an ideological end,\u201d Mr. Koppel said. \u201cThere\u2019s a purpose to it other than getting a few giggles.\u201dMr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover assistants also tried to strike up conversations with several New York Times journalists (this reporter believes he was one). One employee who was secretly recorded criticizing President Trump is no longer at The Times.Both men have been criticized for using selective editing. Mr. O\u2019Keefe has been accused of making conversations appear more sinister than they really were. For Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201ckinderguardians\u201d sketch, Mr. Walsh said he was asked to read from a teleprompter a message in support of Israel, which ended with a few sentences about what he thought was an Israeli initiative to train children how to use firearms. Those few seconds were the only ones shown on camera. Mr. Rohrabacher, who is filmed saying that children ought to learn to defend themselves, noted that he had never actually discussed arming children. But the editing made it appear they supported training very young Americans to use firearms.\u201cThis was fraud, a sick fraud at that, and its intention was to deceive the American people for political purposes,\u201d Mr. Rohrabacher said in a statement, adding that he didn\u2019t actually support \u201ctraining toddlers in handling guns.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Walsh said it was a \u201cfair point\u201d to say that Mr. O\u2019Keefe engages in deceptive editing, much in the same way Mr. Walsh said Mr. Cohen has done.\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of any of them,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. He added, \u201cThis is the world we live in right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jerk, Authentically Jamaican and Unapologetically Hot", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis barbecue born of peppers, pimento, fire and Jamaican history carries a tradition worthy of celebration.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The chicken quarters meet the fire, igniting a chorus of hisses, pops and sizzles. Plumes of smoke rise above the treetops like a beacon signaling drivers to pull into the parking lot of Mr. Mack Island Grill.The aroma, thick with a peppery boldness, hangs heavy around the grill. Unmistakable for any other type of barbecue, this is jerk. Authentically Jamaican. Unapologetically hot.\u201cI started out jerking chicken in the club,\u201d said Craig McKenzie, the restaurant\u2019s owner and chef, as he flipped cuts of meat on a smoker grill the size of a small truck.Mr. McKenzie, 35, became known for cooking jerk meat on a trailer outside nightclubs, and in March opened Mr. Mack Island Grill, near this city\u2019s downtown business district. As his clientele became more diverse, he realized that the heat was too much for some of them. Mr. McKenzie, who is from Jamaica, began offering milder options, despite the popular belief that jerk needs to be hot. \u201cTo me,\u201d he said, \u201ccooking jerk means cooking on an open fire. That\u2019s jerk.\u201dOver the years, the definition of jerk has become open for interpretation. Is it a flavor? Is it the ingredients? Is it the way the meat is cooked? The truth lies somewhere in the middle.The method of grilling jerk slowly, at a low temperature and with smoke, is steeped in tradition. \u201cThe purist will tell you that\u2019s the purest form of jerk,\u201d Mr. Garbutt said. And although the appetite for jerk has spread far beyond Jamaica, he said its birthplace still does it best.\u201cThere\u2019s an element of authenticity that can\u2019t be lost in translation,\u201d Mr. Garbutt said. For him, Jamaican jerk means that the ingredients are born and bred on the island, especially its characteristic Scotch bonnet peppers and pimento berries, also known as allspice. The berries are frequently used to mimic the smoky flavor of pimento, a native wood that historically has been used to cook jerk. Other baseline ingredients include garlic, scallion and thyme. \u201cReal jerk comes from Jamaica,\u201d Mr. Garbutt said over the phone from his office in Kingston. On the island, farmers harvest the scallions, peppers and pimento berries that go into the Walkerswood seasonings.The early methods of jerk were created by maroons, escaped slaves who hid in the Blue Mountains and other rough terrain in the island\u2019s interior. The Africans had a unique approach to spicing the meat, which was cooked in the ground.Peppers, pimento, fire and freedom were the ingredients in the birth of jerk.Cooking methods began to change around the 1700s, when the British granted land in the mountains to the maroons, allowing them to come out of hiding. They moved the meat from the ground, which may have been easier to conceal, and onto racks made of pimento branches that were stretched across a fire pit. As the fat drippings hit the coals, they released an aromatic smoke for several hours.Today, this style of cooking continues in Boston Beach in Jamaica, where chefs grill pork, chicken and lobster in outdoor restaurants.\u201cThe people are spinning those wood racks,\u201d he said. \u201cThose woods get spun and turned to get the most flavor out of those woods.\u201d Oil from the pimento wood infused the meat, adding more flavor along with the smoke.At several points during the 20th century, Jamaicans left the island in large numbers. But the export of pimento wood was banned, and the richness of jerk flavor stayed behind.The craving, however, endured. So jerk took different directions in its new homes. Cooks looking for more accessible ways to make jerk often substitute premade wet or dry spice mixes, available in hot or mild varieties. They are best applied the night before grilling or baking to allow the flavor to penetrate the meat. At Mr. Mack Island Grill, Mr. McKenzie prefers to layer the flavor another way. He gently seasons the meat and lets the bulk of the kick be delivered by a choice of sauces: The barbecue is mild. The jerk is hot.Advertisement"}

When she got on the plane, the 26-year-old was not there, but an Afghan deportee in his 50s was with the Swedish authorities.\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit down until this person is off the plane,\u201d she says in the video, \u201cbecause he is most likely to get killed if he is on this plane when it goes up.\u201dAs Ms. Ersson narrates the video \u2014 which had 2.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon \u2014 a male voice with an English accent can be heard calling her \u201cfrightening\u201d and telling her to think of the children on the flight.\u201cI am doing what I can to save a person\u2019s life,\u201d she responds. \u201cAs long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.\u201dShe says that the long-running war in Afghanistan has made the security situation there not safe to send anyone back. The identity of the man in his 50s was not immediately released, nor were further details about his background or his deportation.Swedavia, the company that runs Sweden\u2019s main airports, said the flight had been delayed for about two hours. A representative for Turkish Airlines said that no one was immediately available for comment on Wednesday.In the end, both the Afghan man and Ms. Ersson left the plane. It\u2019s likely that the man\u2019s deportation will be carried out later.Hans Lippens, a spokesman for the Swedish Police in Gothenburg, said Ms. Ersson\u2019s refusal to sit down constituted a civil infraction but not a crime.\u201cIt is up to Turkish Airlines to sue the woman for the two- to three-hour delay,\u201d he said. \u201cThere can be costs associated with delays. She has not done anything punishable from a police perspective.\u201dThe video begins with Ms. Ersson, who is studying to become a social worker and is part of a broad network of people demonstrating against the deportation of Afghans denied asylum and residency in Sweden, walking up the aisle and explaining to perplexed passengers why she would not sit down.At times, a stern flight attendant can be heard asking her to turn off her phone and leave the plane. Someone in the background can be heard yelling at her to sit down. She explains that the man to be deported was sitting at the back of the plane, escorted by the Swedish authorities.\u201cThe people who have been trying to deport the old man actually pushed me and tried to forcibly move me,\u201d Ms. Ersson says. \u201cThe pilot has the right to say that he is not allowed to be on the plane,\u201d she adds, \u201cand as long as he is not on the plane, then I will comply. I\u2019m waiting for the pilot\u2019s decision.\u201dThe man with the English accent stands up, takes her phone and tells her to stop. A flight attendant returned it, Ms. Ersson said.\u201cI\u2019m trying to change my country\u2019s rules,\u201d she tells a seated passenger. \u201cHe is going to die \u2014 because it\u2019s Afghanistan.\u201dAbout six and a half minutes into the video, people start clapping in an apparent show of support. Then Ms. Ersson starts to cry.\u201cThere\u2019s a Turkish guy helping me out, telling me what I am doing is right,\u201d she says, flushed. \u201cSome people are really applauding all this what I am doing. There is a football team standing at the back. As long as they are standing, this plane is not allowed to go.\u201dA flight attendant says that according to the pilot, the plane was going to Istanbul, not Kabul, and that a decision would be made there. Ms. Ersson didn\u2019t budge.A few minutes later, a flight attendant says that the man will be removed from the plane. A child can be heard crying in the background.\u201cThey are taking his bags out,\u201d Ms. Ersson says, smiling. People can be heard clapping. \u201cWhen he\u2019s actually out, I will go out of the plane and comply with the rules,\u201d she says.She is met at the door by airport security, at which point she stops filming.The activists are protesting the deportation of Afghans who have been denied asylum and residency in Sweden. Advocates say there are many reasons the deportation of the migrants is problematic, not the least of which is that many of them came to Sweden via Iran and no longer had homes or families to go back to.Almost 42,000 people from Afghanistan applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015, according to the Swedish Migration Agency, plus another 4,700 over the next two years.A spokeswoman for the organization leading Ms. Ersson\u2019s intervention gave details by phone on Wednesday about the campaign.A similar protest took place this month at Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen, where Mohammad Simone, a 19-year-old Afghan man, was scheduled to be deported.Eva Marta Granqvist, 55, an artist from southern Sweden who said she and others were fighting \u201carbitrary\u201d deportation decisions by the Swedish Migration Agency, recalled that they had received information that a deportation of a young gay man who had converted to Christianity was to occur earlier this month from Sweden via Denmark. Within a day, they had raised nearly $1,500 for two tickets to Kabul.Ms. Granqvist and another woman boarded the plane.\u201cWe ignored the instructions to sit down in our seats,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we went farther back in the plane, we could hear how he was crying loudly and pleading to the other passengers for his life.\u201d\u201cI asked people in the plane to stand up,\u201d Ms. Granqvist said. \u201cI explained that this was about a human life and that we together could save a human life. Many stood up.\u201d\u201cThen the captain made the immediate decision not to fly and to take off the boy,\u201d she added.Mr. Simone is being held in a deportation center in Astorp, in southern Sweden, she said.Christina Anderson reported from Ostersund, and Palko Karasz from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mike Pence, Holy Terror", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre you sure you want to get rid of Donald Trump?Opinion ColumnistThere are problems with impeaching Donald Trump. A big one is the holy terror waiting in the wings. That would be Mike Pence, who mirrors the boss more than you realize. He\u2019s also self-infatuated. Also a bigot. Also a liar. Also cruel.To that brimming potpourri he adds two ingredients that Trump doesn\u2019t genuinely possess: the conviction that he\u2019s on a mission from God and a determination to mold the entire nation in the shape of his own faith, a regressive, repressive version of Christianity. Trade Trump for Pence and you go from kleptocracy to theocracy.I got an advance look at it, along with a first interview about it with D\u2019Antonio, and while it has a mostly measured tone, it presents an entirely damning portrait of Pence. You\u2019ve seen his colors before, but not so vividly and in this detail.In Pence\u2019s view, any bite marks in his tongue are divinely ordained. Trump wouldn\u2019t be president if God didn\u2019t want that; Pence wouldn\u2019t be vice president if he weren\u2019t supposed to sanctify Trump. And his obsequiousness is his own best route to the Oval Office, which may very well be God\u2019s grand plan.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand what Pence is,\u201d D\u2019Antonio told me. Which is? \u201cA religious zealot.\u201d And D\u2019Antonio said that Pence could end up in the White House sooner than you think. In addition to the prospect of Trump\u2019s impeachment, there\u2019s the chance that Trump just decides that he has had enough. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s as resilient, politically, as Bill Clinton was,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t relish a partisan fight in the same way. He loves to go to rallies where people adore him.\u201d There\u2019s no deeply felt policy vision or sense of duty to sustain him through the investigations and accusations. \u201cIf the pain is great enough,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said, \u201cI think he\u2019d be disposed not to run again.\u201dDuring the vice-presidential debate with Tim Kaine, Pence repeated the laughable, ludicrous assertion that Trump would release his tax returns \u201cwhen the audit is over\u201d and falsely insisted that Trump hadn\u2019t lavished praise on Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership \u2014 though the record proved otherwise. The book says that in a high-level briefing about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Pence was told that intelligence officials hadn\u2019t determined whether that interference had swayed the results. He then publicly claimed a finding of no effect.You can thank Pence for DeVos. They are longtime allies, going back decades, who bonded over such shared passions as making it O.K. for students to use government money, in the form of vouchers, at religious schools. Pence cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate to confirm her as education secretary. It was the first time in history that a vice president had done that for a cabinet nominee.\u201cHe is absolutely certain that his moral view should govern public policy,\u201d D\u2019Antonio told me.D\u2019Antonio then recounted two stories that he heard from college classmates of Pence\u2019s after the book had gone to bed, so they\u2019re not in there. One involved a woman in Pence\u2019s weekly college prayer group. When she couldn\u2019t describe a discrete \u201cborn again\u201d experience, \u201che lectured her on her deficiencies as a Christian and said that she really wasn\u2019t the sort of Christian that needed to be in this group,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said.Another involved a college friend of Pence\u2019s who later sought his counsel about coming out as gay. D\u2019Antonio said that Pence told the friend: \u201cYou have to stay closeted, you have to get help, you\u2019re sick and you\u2019re not my friend anymore.\u201dAccording to D\u2019Antonio\u2019s book, Pence sees himself and fellow Christian warriors as a blessed but oppressed group, and his \u201chope for the future resided in his faith that, as chosen people, conservative evangelicals would eventually be served by a leader whom God would enable to defeat their enemies and create a Christian nation.\u201dHeaven help us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Car Engineers Scoff at Enthusiasts\u2019 Modifications. But Not Always.", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen Aaron Otstott began researching a new car, he wanted to know something many buyers don\u2019t care about: How easily could he make it faster?\u201cI bought it from the beginning knowing that I would be doing modifications,\u201d he said.He settled on a 220-horsepower Volkswagen GTI, a vehicle beloved for its practicality and strong performance. And then he set to work joining the proud fraternity of enthusiasts who possess the kind of hubris that can make automotive engineers like Richard Parry-Jones shake their heads.\u201cI have no doubt in my mind they cannot do it better,\u201d said Mr. Parry-Jones, who from 1998 until his retirement at the end of 2007 was in charge of Ford\u2019s worldwide vehicle development, including models from Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover and Aston Martin.An owner might make a vehicle go around corners faster than when it came from the factory, he said, but it will come with a cost in comfort or even safety.\u201cThey can never achieve the finely balanced trade-off we have achieved,\u201d Mr. Parry-Jones said.Even so, the desire to make modifications demonstrates an owner\u2019s passion, he said. And that\u2019s not a bad thing \u2014 as long as the owners know what they\u2019re doing.\u201cIf you are a total ignoramus and you are just not really doing it carefully and getting advice and doing research and so on, you shouldn\u2019t touch anything but appearance items,\u201d Mr. Parry-Jones said. \u201cHowever, many enthusiasts are not stupid at all. They are quite knowledgeable.\u201dMr. Otstott, for sure, knew what he wanted. He bought the GTI knowing he\u2019d be trying to wring every ounce of performance out of every penny he spent.\u201cI had done the research and knew that for less than $1,000 I could get it above 300 horsepower,\u201d he said.Indeed, after buying the car in March 2016, he purchased an electronic upgrade that he estimated had raised the GTI\u2019s output to 300 horsepower. He has made other changes, both cosmetic and mechanical. Next up: altering the suspension to improve handling.Mr. Otstott, 44, a video game programmer and father of two from Austin, Tex., is far from alone in thinking he can improve on vehicles that automotive engineers spent years testing and creating.About $400 million in 2016 went for \u201cengine control and computer products,\u201d a category that includes the device purchased by Mr. Otstott, which tricks an engine into producing more power. Some $600 million was spent on superchargers or turbochargers. And about $2 billion was spent on suspension changes \u2014 alterations that range from making a vehicle lean less when cornering to increasing the ground clearance of a pickup.Drastic changes, however, do raise the possibility of making a vehicle less safe, said David McLellan, who was the Corvette chief engineer from 1975 to 1992.\u201cYou see this guy with his pickup truck another foot in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cHis rollover stability is greatly diminished. Is he smart? Is he better than the original equipment engineers? I would have to say absolutely not.\u201dWhen owners begin making changes, the results can go either way, said Thomas Gillespie, author of the textbook \u201cFundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics\u201d and a co-founder of Mechanical Simulation, a Michigan company that develops software to simulate vehicle performance.\u201cYou can pick parts that would make the vehicle behave better in the more extreme handling situations,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, you could also screw it up.\u201dIt\u2019s also possible to run afoul of federal safety regulations.Owners are permitted to modify their vehicles, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in an email. But aftermarket equipment makers may not do anything to \u201cmake inoperative\u201d federally required safety equipment.All members of the Specialty Equipment Market Association are encouraged to make sure suspension changes resulting from their products are not so drastic that they can overcome the electronic stability control, said Christopher Kersting, the president of the association.Testing costs about $15,000, and Link has found that the electronic stability control systems on most vehicles are flexible enough that they work despite suspension changes, Mr. Ledwidge said.\u201cThere is a lot of robustness built into the system on the production vehicle,\u201d he said.But one of the changes that can cause problems involves significantly increasing the ride height of a vehicle, like a pickup, because it raises the center of gravity \u2014 a change that can impair the vehicle\u2019s handling.\u201cIf you get too outrageous, you are going to run into problems there,\u201d Mr. Ledwidge said, although he added that test failures were rare.Mr. Kersting said that his association did not require its members to have such tests, but that they were aware that they had to be careful because there was \u201ca stout product liability tradition in this country.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be sued out of existence,\u201d he added.There are no federal safety regulations regarding increasing an engine\u2019s power, although doing so is almost certain to void the automaker\u2019s powertrain warranty. (Some enthusiasts theorize that if they have a major mechanical failure they can quietly remove the guilty gizmos and perhaps avoid being caught.)Getting more power now involves modifying the software, which is \u201cneither easy nor inexpensive, and maybe not even possible without some inside/leaked information,\u201d he wrote in an email.All challenges aside, Mr. Kersting expects continued growth in the aftermarket industry.\u201cThe reason the market grows the way it does is that the carmakers have a mass-production model and it does not leave a whole lot of room for people who want to improve or personalize or upgrade their cars and trucks,\u201d he said.Social media \u2014 like websites or Facebook pages for owners of specific models \u2014 is also playing an increasing role, Mr. Kersting said.\u201cNow people who have similar interests are able to find one another and share expertise and the passion they have for whatever segment of automotive lifestyle or hobby they enjoy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been very good for the market.\u201d\u201cCars go to a diverse audience and diverse customers, and people don\u2019t always agree with the balance or compromises, and you can\u2019t get upset with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get miffed.

El salvadore\u00f1o de 22 a\u00f1os estaba feliz de irse del lugar, donde los contrabandistas guardaban empaques de coca\u00edna y marihuana junto a las personas, pero tambi\u00e9n ansioso por lo que le esperaba en su camino.El conductor dej\u00f3 a Cruz en un punto ilegal de cruce en el r\u00edo Bravo. Un contrabandista le tom\u00f3 una fotograf\u00eda con un celular para confirmar su identidad y la envi\u00f3 por WhatsApp a otro conductor, que iba a recogerlo cuando cruzara. Si es que lo lograba.El viaje de alrededor de 3000 kil\u00f3metros le hab\u00eda costado a la familia de Cruz m\u00e1s de 6000 d\u00f3lares y lo llev\u00f3 hasta Brownsville, Texas. Los 800 kil\u00f3metros restantes hasta Houston \u2014donde merodean la Patrulla Fronteriza y las polic\u00edas local y estatal\u2014 les costar\u00edan otros 6500 d\u00f3lares.Era una cantidad de dinero pr\u00e1cticamente impensable para alguien que ganaba solo unos cuantos d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda recogiendo granos de caf\u00e9 en su pa\u00eds de origen. Pero Cruz no emprendi\u00f3 el trayecto en busca de un empleo mejor pagado: estaba escapando de la violencia y de lo que describi\u00f3 como una muerte casi segura a manos de pandillas locales en El Salvador.\u201cNo hay otra alternativa\u201d, dijo Cruz. \u201cLo primero que pens\u00e9 fue: \u2018Necesito irme de aqu\u00ed sin importar lo que cueste\u2019\u201d.El tramo de la frontera suroeste de Estados Unidos que buscaba cruzar se ha vuelto el epicentro de la batalla del gobierno de Donald Trump contra la inmigraci\u00f3n. El endurecimiento de la frontera y los crecientes peligros de llegar hasta esta han provocado que cada vez m\u00e1s familias desesperadas recurran a operaciones de contrabando bastante sofisticadas para que sus familiares puedan llegar a Estados Unidos.La historia de Cruz es un ejemplo detallado del precio de ese periplo. El dinero que fue pagado a una red de conductores que lo escondieron en semirremolques y en minibuses; la cantidad que fue desembolsada para costear su resguardo temporal en casas de paso; la suma que dieron a organizaciones criminales que coordinaron su cruce, y la que entregaron a oficiales de polic\u00eda mexicanos como soborno para que lo ignoraran en el camino.Tambi\u00e9n es una muestra de c\u00f3mo \u2014pese a esos pagos\u2014 los coyotes abandonan a migrantes cuando consideran que son demasiado lentos u otros son forzados a ser mulas de drogas. En momentos del trayecto, Cruz fue identificado por contrabandistas con un n\u00famero; en otros, con un nombre falso.

Los contrabandistas hab\u00edan reunido a todos ah\u00ed y les dieron tubos inflables a quienes no sab\u00edan nadar; dijeron que nadar era m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que usar una balsa. Cruz se quit\u00f3 los pantalones y la camiseta que llevaba, y nad\u00f3 al otro lado en calzoncillos.Cruz hab\u00eda escalado la mitad de la cerca cuando escuch\u00f3 un helic\u00f3ptero y vio patrullas que llegaban. Los agentes atraparon a los que estaban escalando la cerca.\u201cCuando los vi, me baj\u00e9 y corr\u00ed de regreso\u201d, record\u00f3 Cruz. Se meti\u00f3 de nuevo al r\u00edo Bravo, pensando que su \u00fanica esperanza era escapar de regreso a M\u00e9xico.Cruz creci\u00f3 en San Miguel, la cuarta ciudad m\u00e1s grande de El Salvador. La violencia de las pandillas es end\u00e9mica en el pa\u00eds, y Cruz dej\u00f3 la preparatoria cuando la MS-13 se volvi\u00f3 demasiado peligrosa. Su familia se mud\u00f3 a Berl\u00edn, a casi una hora en auto, donde hab\u00eda menos problemas de pandillas que en las grandes ciudades.La madre de Cruz viv\u00eda en Estados Unidos, aunque \u00e9l era mucho m\u00e1s cercano al hermano de esta que tambi\u00e9n estaba all\u00e1, un t\u00edo al que llama Papi. Cruz viv\u00eda con su abuela y su hermana menor. Tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda un hijo de 2 a\u00f1os al que mantener, aunque \u00e9l y la madre del ni\u00f1o se hab\u00edan separado.Una noche, Cruz y sus amigos caminaban a casa cuando se dieron cuenta de que un veh\u00edculo los segu\u00eda. Al intentar correr, el auto aceler\u00f3 y sigui\u00f3 a Cruz despu\u00e9s de que el grupo se separ\u00f3. Por encima de su hombro vio a miembros de la pandilla sacar armas mientras \u00e9l intentaba escapar atravesando una cancha de f\u00fatbol, antes de refugiarse en una cl\u00ednica de salud.El t\u00edo de Cruz, que ahora tiene estatus legal en Estados Unidos despu\u00e9s de haber llegado de manera ilegal hace a\u00f1os, contact\u00f3 a una mujer en M\u00e9xico que representa a una red de contrabando. La t\u00eda y el t\u00edo de Cruz ganaron lo suficiente para darle el dinero para el trayecto, con la condici\u00f3n de que les pagara todo despu\u00e9s. Para empezar, le enviaron 800 d\u00f3lares a El Salvador el d\u00eda que emprendi\u00f3 la fase inicial del viaje.Cruz ten\u00eda miedo. Su mejor amigo hab\u00eda tomado la misma ruta el a\u00f1o pasado, pero fue secuestrado cerca de la frontera y fue retenido por dos meses hasta que su familia pag\u00f3 20.000 d\u00f3lares para liberarlo; termin\u00f3 de regreso en El Salvador. Y una amiga de Cruz fue violada repetidamente por contrabandistas cuando ya hab\u00edan cruzado hacia Estados Unidos, antes de ser detenida por las autoridades y ser deportada.\u201cCualquier oportunidad que tengas de conectarte, me env\u00edas un mensaje de d\u00f3nde est\u00e1s\u201d, le dijo su t\u00edo.Su viaje comenz\u00f3 afuera de un centro comercial en Soyapango, en una camioneta que conduc\u00eda el contrabandista que lo acompa\u00f1ar\u00eda en su trayecto por El Salvador y Guatemala. Cruz pas\u00f3 a Guatemala legalmente en La Hachadura con su documento de identificaci\u00f3n nacional.El conductor dej\u00f3 la camioneta en El Salvador y lo acompa\u00f1\u00f3 en autob\u00fas hasta la ciudad de Guatemala. Tomaron otro autob\u00fas y viajaron a Huehuetenango, un punto de traslado a la frontera mexicana. Pasaron una noche en un hotel barato y al d\u00eda siguiente viajaron a La Mesilla, a lo largo de la frontera con M\u00e9xico.Debido a la mayor vigilancia de rutas tradicionales de contrabando, entre el 80 y el 95 por ciento de los migrantes que van hacia Estados Unidos han usado coyotes en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, en comparaci\u00f3n con menos de la mitad a principios de los a\u00f1os 70, seg\u00fan datos de la Patrulla Fronteriza obtenidos a partir de entrevistas a migrantes detenidos.M\u00c9X.GuatemalaHONDURASLa HachaduraGUATEMALASanSalvadorEL SALVADOROc\u00e9ano Pac\u00edficoAl llegar a La Mesilla, ubicada al lado de la frontera de Guatemala con M\u00e9xico, Cruz se convirti\u00f3 por primera vez en un inmigrante ilegal. Cruz\u00f3 hacia Chiapas escondido entre las maletas de otros viajeros de un autob\u00fas; el conductor chiflaba cuando ya era seguro para que saliera, as\u00ed evitaba toparse con criminales que quisieran secuestrarlo, polic\u00edas en busca de sobornos y de las medidas migratorias m\u00e1s restrictivas que han sido puestas en vigor.A tan solo dos d\u00edas de haber emprendido su viaje, la familia de Cruz tuvo que enviarle a la red de contrabandistas 1900 d\u00f3lares para ayudarlo a atravesar el sur de M\u00e9xico. Pas\u00f3 varios d\u00edas en una casa peque\u00f1a cerca de Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, la capital chiapaneca. Era bastante c\u00f3moda, pero se preguntaba a qu\u00e9 se deb\u00eda el retraso. \u201cEllos quieren que cruces m\u00e1s que t\u00fa\u201d, lo tranquiliz\u00f3 su t\u00edo, \u201cporque no les pago por d\u00eda extra\u201d.Cuando los contrabandistas finalmente continuaron el viaje, Cruz pas\u00f3 una noche en una hamaca en un lugar aislado cerca de la presa Nezahualc\u00f3yotol, tambi\u00e9n conocida como presa de Malpaso. Le escribi\u00f3 a su t\u00edo que iba camino a Puebla, pero pospusieron ese viaje porque otras dos personas que se hab\u00edan adelantado fueron detenidas por migraci\u00f3n.A la ma\u00f1ana siguiente, Cruz se subi\u00f3 como copiloto a un tractocami\u00f3n. En una zona de peaje, unos oficiales detuvieron el cami\u00f3n para realizar una revisi\u00f3n de rutina, y despu\u00e9s de ver la identificaci\u00f3n salvadore\u00f1a de Cruz, se dieron cuenta de que estaba en M\u00e9xico ilegalmente. Le exigieron dinero a cambio de no deportarlo, dijo Cruz. \u00c9l sac\u00f3 170 d\u00f3lares que ten\u00eda escondidos en sus zapatos y recuerda que uno de los oficiales le indic\u00f3 que hab\u00eda corrido con suerte.Golfo deM\u00e9xicoPueblaPUEBLAVERACRUZpresaNezahualc\u00f3yotlM\u00c9XICOTuxtla Guti\u00e9rrezOAXACAEl conductor tambi\u00e9n tuvo que pagar y, enfurecido, le dijo a Cruz que lo iba a dejar con narcotraficantes si no le repon\u00eda 600 d\u00f3lares. En medio del p\u00e1nico, Cruz le llam\u00f3 a su t\u00edo en Estados Unidos, aunque esa vez no contest\u00f3.Su t\u00edo vio la llamada poco despu\u00e9s y le marc\u00f3. Dijo que hab\u00eda conseguido otro conductor por medio de la mujer que organiz\u00f3 el trayecto e intent\u00f3 calmar a Cruz. \u201cQu\u00e9date tranquilo, qu\u00e9date tranquilo\u2026 todo mundo me dice lo mismo. Pero saben que yo nunca he estado lejos de la casa y que soy un gran miedoso. En una situaci\u00f3n as\u00ed no puedo estar tranquilo\u201d, respondi\u00f3 el joven.En los siguientes retenes de tr\u00e1nsito, el soborno para la polic\u00eda siempre fue el mismo: 1500 pesos mexicanos (unos 80 d\u00f3lares). Al principio Cruz intent\u00f3 mentir y dijo que no era migrante, pero al final dej\u00f3 de fingir. La cuarta vez que lo detuvieron para que pagara, el polic\u00eda simplemente dijo: \u201cYa sabes cu\u00e1nto es\u201d.Cruz lleg\u00f3 hasta Puebla, al sureste de Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, un punto fundamental del viaje. Su familia envi\u00f3 450 d\u00f3lares a los contrabandistas y la mujer con quien se qued\u00f3 en ese sitio lo ayud\u00f3 a comprar jab\u00f3n y zapatos nuevos (a\u00fan ten\u00eda unos Braco, marca salvadore\u00f1a que tem\u00eda que lo delatara).Despu\u00e9s de estar cuatro d\u00edas en Puebla, los contrabandistas intentaron llevarlo al norte, pero se corri\u00f3 el rumor de que hab\u00edan asesinado a unos migrantes cerca de Monterrey, su siguiente parada, as\u00ed que lo llevaron de regreso.Tras esperar tres d\u00edas m\u00e1s, Cruz se escondi\u00f3 en el compartimento de un tractocami\u00f3n para el viaje de noche hasta Monterrey. Al llegar ah\u00ed fue puesto en un sitio lejos del centro; la casa donde fueron retenidos estaba detr\u00e1s de un port\u00f3n de metal, y cerraron las ventanas y puertas. \u201cEra como una prisi\u00f3n\u201d, dijo Cruz.\u00c9l y otros migrantes les tuvieron que pagar a los contrabandistas para conseguir agua, pues la que sal\u00eda de la llave era de color caf\u00e9, y el sitio estaba lleno de basura y de cucarachas. Cruz estuvo ah\u00ed durante cuatro d\u00edas. Su t\u00edo envi\u00f3 2800 d\u00f3lares y lo llevaron hasta el estado mexicano de Tamaulipas, justo debajo del sur de Texas.EE. UU.TEXASM\u00c9XICOMcAllenMatamorosMonterreySu viaje lo llev\u00f3 primero a la ciudad Miguel Alem\u00e1n y de ah\u00ed tom\u00f3 un autob\u00fas a Matamoros, a dos horas y media, con el nombre falso de Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez en su boleto.Tamaulipas ha adquirido mala fama entre los migrantes por el control de varios caminos por parte de grupos criminales; en 2010 fue hallada una fosa com\u00fan con 72 migrantes en San Fernando. El mensaje es claro: intentar cruzar hacia Estados Unidos sin el permiso de los narcos que controlan ese territorio es letal.Rodolfo Casillas, experto en migraci\u00f3n ilegal de la Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, calcula que hasta 1000 d\u00f3lares del precio total del viaje fue para pagarles a los narcos el \u201cderecho de paso\u201d. Un migrante que testific\u00f3 en un caso de trata en Texas dijo que pag\u00f3 11.000 pesos, unos 600 d\u00f3lares, el a\u00f1o pasado para protecci\u00f3n contra el c\u00e1rtel de los Zetas, en comparaci\u00f3n con 1500 pesos para la ayuda con el cruce del r\u00edo.La casa en Matamoros donde estuvo Cruz estaba mejor conservada que la casucha en Monterrey. Algunos migrantes en la casa aceptaron transportar drogas. \u201cSi se te acaba el dinero, ah\u00ed es donde te ofrecen cruzarte, pero como mula\u201d, dijo Cruz. Record\u00f3 que algunos de esos migrantes no lograron cruzar y los contrabandistas estaban furiosos, no por la detenci\u00f3n de los que intentaron pasar, sino porque perd\u00edan su \u201cproducto\u201d.Cruz contrajo una infecci\u00f3n respiratoria. Estaba ansioso por irse de la casa en Matamoros, pero sus espasmos de tos le causaron problemas con los contrabandistas. No quer\u00edan que los delatara mientras un grupo intentaba pasar por donde estaban unos agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza.Para que no lo dejaran, su familia transfiri\u00f3 180 d\u00f3lares a los contrabandistas, que dijeron que la mitad iba a ser para medicina. Un jarabe para la tos y varios d\u00edas de descanso parecieron ser de ayuda. Ese s\u00e1bado por la noche, Cruz le escribi\u00f3 a su t\u00edo: \u201cHoy me dicen si me voy por la ma\u00f1ana\u201d. Poco despu\u00e9s confirm\u00f3 que lo iban a mover a las cuatro de la ma\u00f1ana.En esa regi\u00f3n del r\u00edo Bravo fueron detenidas 138.000 personas el a\u00f1o pasado. Los cruces ilegales bajaron dr\u00e1sticamente en los primeros meses del gobierno de Trump, pero volvieron a subir este a\u00f1o: de marzo a mayo la cantidad de migrantes arrestados a lo largo de la frontera suroeste de Estados Unidos fue tres veces el n\u00famero de 2017. Aunque la cifra es mucho menor a la de hace una d\u00e9cada, cuando fueron detenidas m\u00e1s de 1,6 millones de personas.M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del debate del muro, ya existe una barrera virtual: hay c\u00e1maras de videovigilancia con detectores t\u00e9rmicos y sensores s\u00edsmicos que los migrantes disparan sin darse cuenta. La cantidad de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza ha crecido: de 9000 en 2001 a 20.000 ahora, y el presupuesto dedicado a estos asuntos es cuatro veces mayor, pues tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 pensado para veh\u00edculos todoterreno, patrullajes a caballo, helic\u00f3pteros y drones.Temprano ese domingo, los contrabandistas reunieron a Cruz y a dos decenas de migrantes de dos casas de seguridad en un veh\u00edculo todoterreno. Cruz recuerda que hab\u00eda cinco mujeres, incluida una que parec\u00eda tener cinco meses de embarazo y una de alrededor de 60 a\u00f1os. Le preocup\u00f3 que no pudieran nadar o cruzar, aunque tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda presente la advertencia de su familia: \u201cNo pienses en los dem\u00e1s, preoc\u00fapate por cruzar t\u00fa\u201d. La mujer embarazada s\u00ed lo logr\u00f3, apenas, pero la mujer mayor batall\u00f3. Cruz recuerda que el coyote la dej\u00f3 ah\u00ed cuando llegaron a tierra firme y ella se cay\u00f3.Despu\u00e9s de cruzar el r\u00edo Bravo, los migrantes comenzaron a escalar la cerca fronteriza, pero fue cuando Cruz regres\u00f3 por la llegada de la Patrulla Fronteriza. \u201cNo hab\u00eda de otra\u201d, dijo.Se acostumbra que los contrabandistas den tres intentos para cruzar con seguridad. Cruz se dispuso a intentarlo de nuevo en un tramo distinto a lo largo del r\u00edo. El domingo a mediod\u00eda Cruz hizo su segundo intento de cruce. Fue incluso m\u00e1s breve que el primero.Los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza rodearon al grupo mientras llegaban a la orilla norte del r\u00edo. Un agente logr\u00f3 tomar a Cruz por la espalda, pero en vez de arrestarlo lo arroj\u00f3 al agua. Cruz dijo que apenas logr\u00f3 nadar de regreso a M\u00e9xico.El anochecer se estaba acercando para cuando los coyotes llevaron a los migrantes a su tercer punto de cruce. Los contrabandistas dijeron que el lugar, m\u00e1s aislado, generalmente estaba reservado para trasladar cargamentos de droga, m\u00e1s valiosos que los migrantes. Cruz tendr\u00eda que atravesar nadando el r\u00edo Bravo por quinta vez ese d\u00eda.En el lado estadounidense, el conductor del veh\u00edculo todoterreno que los esperaba toc\u00f3 la bocina para que los migrantes lo vieran. Estaba enojado, pues esperaba que solo fueran unos cuantos migrantes quienes salieran de un campo al sur de Texas y, en cambio, se top\u00f3 con diecis\u00e9is personas. En una zona llena de agentes fronterizos, era una carga muy riesgosa.Se trataba de un trayecto breve en auto hasta un estacionamiento, donde los contrabandistas separaron al grupo en diferentes veh\u00edculos. Cruz y cinco migrantes m\u00e1s se dirigieron a un lugar a una hora al noroeste, hasta McAllen, Texas.Los levantones son planeados de manera meticulosa para que los migrantes se suban al veh\u00edculo correspondiente en cuanto este llega. Los contrabandistas muchas veces usan cintas de color para marcar qui\u00e9n va a d\u00f3nde y en ocasiones hay veh\u00edculos que se quedan vac\u00edos y son usados para distraer a los oficiales.En McAllen los encargados de la casa les quitaron su celular a todos y hasta los zapatos para que no pudieran irse corriendo. No les dieron comida y ten\u00edan prohibido hablarse entre s\u00ed.Despu\u00e9s de estar un d\u00eda y medio en McAllen, Cruz se api\u00f1\u00f3 junto con otros cuatro migrantes en el compartimento de un tractocami\u00f3n que se dirig\u00eda a San Antonio. Unos agentes casi los descubren durante una revisi\u00f3n de rutina en un puesto de control en una autopista. Cruz se traslad\u00f3 a una miniv\u00e1n con un compartimiento oculto debajo de un asiento trasero.Llevaron a Cruz a una \u00faltima casa de contrabando, donde le quitaron la ropa, excepto los calzoncillos, en una habitaci\u00f3n \u201csin electricidad ni luz, sin ventanas, y una cama grande con cuatro hombres\u201d, seg\u00fan la describi\u00f3; b\u00e1sicamente era un reh\u00e9n hasta que se hicieran los \u00faltimos pagos. Pasaron dos d\u00edas.Su familia tuvo que transferir los 6500 d\u00f3lares restantes a la red de contrabandistas pero, debido a que las autoridades notifican transacciones sospechosas con regularidad, el t\u00edo de Cruz tuvo que separar la cantidad en transferencias m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as y menos evidentes.Cuando el pago final lleg\u00f3 a la mujer encargada de la operaci\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico, dijo Cruz, \u201cme dieron mi ropa y me taparon los ojos otra vez\u201d.Los contrabandistas lo llevaron a una gasolinera. Ah\u00ed vio el rostro familiar de su t\u00edo. Cruz comenz\u00f3 a llorar. Ahora estaba en un pa\u00eds desconocido, donde no hablaba el idioma y no pod\u00eda obtener un trabajo legalmente. Ten\u00eda una deuda de por lo menos 12.630 d\u00f3lares. Sin embargo, dijo que por lo menos ya no tem\u00eda por su vida. \u201cAqu\u00ed s\u00e9 que estoy a salvo\u201d, dijo.Feb. 17, 2017March 15, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Asbestos Cleanup Continues", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this stormy Monday.Fifth Avenue from 19th Street to 22nd Street is still closed to pedestrian traffic, and access to 20th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues is restricted. Bus service has been restored along Fifth Avenue.The entire cleanup could take a few more days, if not longer, said Nancy Silvestri, a spokeswoman for the department. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.As the cleanup efforts continue, we had a few questions about asbestos in our city\u2019s infrastructure.Which city pipes contain asbestos?\u201cWe would rationalize that most of the 104 miles of transmission pipe that make up our steam distribution system would contain asbestos,\u201d said Philip O\u2019Brien, a spokesman for Con Edison. But that system only operates in Manhattan below 96th Street to the Battery on the West Side and below 86th Street to downtown on the East Side, he added.Why is asbestos coating our city\u2019s pipes?It was used to keep them insulated \u201cback when people thought differently about asbestos,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. It\u2019s unclear when asbestos came into use (the first underground steam pipes were installed in 1882) but it was phased out \u201ccertainly by the early 1980s,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.Why don\u2019t we swap out the asbestos?\u201cBesides the cost,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, \u201cit\u2019s fine as it is.\u201d\u201cThe way the infrastructure is designed, it is underground in its own casing and not subject to much, if any, disturbance,\u201d he added. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to disturb the asbestos, once you know it\u2019s there, because it may be released into the air. So you leave it there so that it stays contained.\u201dWhy do steam pipes explode?Typically \u201cthere has to be a drastic change in temperature in order to break the pipe,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. That could mean a small rupture the size of a pinhole. You can tell when there\u2019s a small leak nearby because of \u201cthe vapor you see coming out of the ground in Manhattan,\u201d he said. But, he added, steam coming out of the ground could also be a water pipe dripping onto a hot steam pipe or \u201cguck or muck that could have dripped onto the pipe and now it\u2019s cooking.\u201dDoes every steam pipe explosion contain asbestos?\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. While there could be a rupture or break in a section that might not have asbestos, he said, most of the pipes are probably coated with asbestos.Here\u2019s what else is happening:The rain will not go away.Showers and thunderstorms are expected to dampen your morning commute and could continue throughout the day. Expect heavy rainfall at times.We interrupt your summer to bring you some dreary news.There\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll see rain every day this week, with some heavy downpours, and it will be uncomfortably humid.But don\u2019t let the rain put a damper on going out.

In the United States, Flint, Mich., still does not have clean drinking water, and the government appears to be preoccupied with kidnapping and then losing people\u2019s children.Luckily, for every new horror or outrage, there has been the respite of obsessively watching a sport in which 22 men sprint after a ball for an hour and a half \u2014 the game that can end with a score of 0-0, yet somehow consistently produce moments of ecstasy and tension. \u201cEgypt are in trouble here,\u201d a Fox commentator said gravely on the second day of the tournament, referring to nothing more than their inability to press Uruguay higher up the field. Egypt\u2019s political landscape remains volatile. And many images of young Arabs and North Africans in Western media are, to put it kindly, reductive. In mid-June, Donald Trump ended an inflammatory anti-immigration speech by hugging the American flag, a truly ridiculous and near-dystopian sight that would have haunted me for days had I not been numbed to the whole thing by Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s sublime hat trick against Spain and the mini-controversy that erupted around his awful goatee. On June 27, as the debate raged over whether White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders should have been asked to leave a little restaurant in Virginia, I was preoccupied by Germany\u2019s loss to South Korea, which in a wild turn of events simultaneously sent the defending champions home before the knockout round and put Mexico into knockouts despite having been routed by Sweden. Ignorance is bliss, but untenable. Temporary distraction, however, is quite nice. I am in no way an advocate of looking away. Not being angry, not being scared, not thinking about the barrage of bad news \u2014 even for a moment \u2014 is a luxury. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and YouTube Give Alex Jones a Wrist Slap", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe digital walls are closing in on Alex Jones, the social media shock jock whose penchant for right-wing conspiracy theories and viral misinformation set off a heated debate about the limits of free speech on internet platforms.Facebook said on Friday that it had suspended Mr. Jones from posting on the site for 30 days because he had repeatedly violated its policies. The social network also took down four videos posted by Mr. Jones and Infowars, the website he oversees.\u201cWe received reports related to four different videos on the pages that Infowars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe reviewed the content against our Community Standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook.\u201dThe 30-day ban applies only to Mr. Jones personally, not to Infowars or to any of the other administrators of his Facebook page, which has nearly 1.7 million followers. Those people will still be able to post to Mr. Jones\u2019s page as long as their posts don\u2019t violate the site\u2019s policies \u2014 meaning that Mr. Jones could still appear in videos and stories posted to the page as long as he does not post them personally.In fact, Mr. Jones appeared on a live-streamed Facebook video on his page on Friday, shortly after the suspension went into effect, in which he claimed that he was the victim of a media conspiracy to \u201cde-platform\u201d conservative voices.\u201cThis is war,\u201d Mr. Jones said in the video.On Tuesday, YouTube took down four videos uploaded to Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which has 2.4 million subscribers, for violating its policies on hate speech and child endangerment. The violation placed a first strike against Mr. Jones\u2019s account on YouTube, preventing the channel from streaming live video for 90 days. If Mr. Jones receives two more strikes during that period, YouTube will terminate his account.\u201cWe apply our policies consistently according to the content in the videos, regardless of the speaker or the channel,\u201d YouTube said in a statement.A request to Mr. Jones for comment was not immediately returned.Facebook and YouTube acted after weeks of controversy over Mr. Jones, who first gained notoriety by insisting that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were an \u201cinside job\u201d by the United States government. Since then, he has questioned whether the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax, promoted the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory and said fluoridated water was part of a government mind-control plot.Despite these unsupported views, social media platforms have allowed him to gain a wide audience. Conservatives have accused Facebook, YouTube and other platforms of censoring right-wing views in the past, and have rallied behind him before.As an example, Mr. Zuckerberg cited Holocaust denial as a message that he found personally offensive but was wary of removing from Facebook, in order to protect users\u2019 free-speech rights.Within Facebook, the free-speech issues raised by Infowars and Mr. Jones have become an especially contentious topic. Employees have used internal chat forums to question executives about the site\u2019s policies, according to one Facebook employee, who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of retribution. One group of Facebook workers, which included people of Jewish and Eastern European descent, raised Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s position on Holocaust denial with their superiors, saying they found it incomprehensible, according to the employee.At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Democratic lawmakers pressed Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s global head of policy management, about why Infowars was allowed to remain on Facebook. Several days later, two parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook shooting wrote an open letter to Mr. Zuckerberg, criticizing him for allowing Mr. Jones and his followers to use Facebook to harass and intimidate the families of victims.Daisuke Wakabayashi and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nextdoor Is Betting a Social Network Can Still Be a Platform for Politics", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Hala Hijazi wanted her friends to meet London Breed, then a candidate for mayor of San Francisco, she invited the whole neighborhood.Ms. Hijazi, a community organizer and consultant, lives in the city\u2019s Marina District and is a member of Nextdoor, the neighborhood social media site.She planned the meet-and-greet on the Marina\u2019s bustling Chestnut Street and posted it on Nextdoor. One neighbor said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Ms. Breed. She said another called the candidate \u201cthe worst.\u201d Still others decided to vote for Ms. Breed after meeting her in person.\u201cNextdoor is organic and, sometimes, it is going to be raw,\u201d Ms. Hijazi said.Ms. Breed won the mayoral election in June.\u201cPeople feel like only wealthy donors get access to politicians,\u201d Ms. Hijazi said, adding, \u201cI am doing this as a service to my community.\u201dBut, as the saying goes, all politics is local. And with political engagement at an all-time high, Nextdoor is gearing up for the 2018 political primaries and beyond, partnering with public agencies and local governments, and encouraging civil political discourse in an increasing partisan America.Fights between supporters of President Trump (and their nonsupporting neighbors) have driven some Nextdoor users away. To address those concerns, the San Francisco-based company is creating separate forums for neighbors who want to discuss national politics. Some cities, too, are frustrated with the service, saying there is no mechanism for local politicians to have a dialogue with constituents on the site.Nextdoor bills itself as a \u201cprivate social network\u201d that limits membership by address, making it difficult for people not in a neighborhood network or, in some cases, an adjoining area, to participate. (A neighborhood can be as small as a few blocks.)The company was founded in 2010 and said it is active in 175,000 neighborhoods, or about 85 percent nationwide. It is particularly prominent in San Francisco and, according to the company, especially popular with homeowners.With so many users, Nextdoor sees a big market in voter registration and education. In March, it teamed up with Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state, to provide voter information in five counties that adopted the California Voter\u2019s Choice Act, which makes it easier for citizens to vote. The company, too, recently partnered with the District of Columbia Board of Elections, one of about 3,000 public agencies that distribute voter and community information via Nextdoor.\u201cIt gives us an opportunity to communicate with real people, not bots or trolls,\u201d said Sam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, Calif., and an early advocate for the site. \u201cThat makes it a powerful tool.\u201dSteve Wymer, Nextdoor\u2019s vice president of policy, said the company has little interest in the political grandstanding that sometimes takes place on the site. \u201cThat is not what we think builds community,\u201d he said.Instead, Nextdoor wants to help public agencies reach their constituents. Agencies that partner with the company set up a special page, and access to information \u2014 like where to vote or when to register for a primary \u2014 is targeted to the relevant area where a person lives.Still, users are interested in more than polling places. After President Trump won the 2016 election, Nextdoor saw an increase in disputes about national politics. Isaac Gonzalez, a volunteer forum moderator for the Tahoe Park neighborhood in Sacramento, Calif., said he had to mediate virtual fisticuffs between liberal-minded neighbors and the Trump supporters who lived next door.\u201cAfter the election there were a lot of sobering posts about where the country was headed, and people felt emboldened to share their true beliefs,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cPeople learned their neighbors weren\u2019t as progressive as they thought they would be.\u201dHe said he has been approached by neighbors who told him they quit using Nextdoor because there was too much political talk. \u201cThey had to stop looking at it,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said.To address this, the company has begun testing a new service in 12 markets, including the Bay Area and Dallas, to offer users a political forum separate from their neighborhood feeds.\u201cThe idea was to create a place where people could share information without offending others who don\u2019t want to talk about politics,\u201d Mr. Wymer said. \u201cOur biggest concern is not to divide.\u201dAt the same time, Nextdoor wants to be ready for the flush of interest in the primaries later this year.\u201cWe know a big election cycle is coming up,\u201d Mr. Wymer said. That is why it is focused on helping public agencies educate and register voters.Rachel Coll, a spokeswoman for the District of Columbia Board of Elections, said her agency reached out to Nextdoor. \u201cWe definitely wanted to facilitate a line of information we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d she said.Kevin Lee, a spokesman for Long Beach, said it is impractical to open up posts on its city pages to comments. \u201cA lot of cities are having difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work with Nextdoor. But how do you have a dialogue when you have such an overwhelming response?\u201dMr. Gonzalez said he lets some political commentary slip by. Recently, though, he had to draw the line. One man kept asking his neighbors to meet him at a nearby Denny\u2019s to discuss the United States Constitution.\u201cEveryone was flagging it as inappropriate,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cHe was very aggressive about it.\u201dMr. Gonzalez said he took the post down. And he politely asked the man to stop pestering his neighbors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: It\u2019s Not the Heat, It\u2019s the Humidity", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this still-scorching Tuesday.The heat wave continues.Why is that?Well, there\u2019s a reason for the adage: It\u2019s not the heat, it\u2019s the humidity.\u201cIt\u2019s really the dew point that is the measure of how humans feel outside,\u201d said Carlie Buccola, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.And depending on your body type, you may feel even hotter.People with higher body fat and higher muscle mass typically generate more heat when active, requiring more sweat to cool off, said Dr. Andrew Marks, a professor of physiology at Columbia University. Older adults, children and those with certain types of disease may also not be optimal sweaters and will very likely feel more overheated.\u201cThere\u2019s also a psychological component,\u201d Dr. Marks said. \u201cHow hot you feel is really under the control of your central nervous system and the signals it receives, many from your skin, which is a big sensor. That\u2019s why you see some people looking very comfortable in high heat, and some people looking very uncomfortable.\u201dDr. Marks emphasized that, during a heat wave, your body type plays less of a role in how hot you feel than the choices you make to stay cool.Keep that in mind tomorrow, the Fourth of July, which looks only slightly cooler with a chance of showers, a high near 86 and a heat index of 92.Here\u2019s what else is happening:The \u201cdog days,\u201d named for the Dog Star, Sirius, are meant to be the hottest days of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. They were originally considered the roughly 40-day stretch just before or after the star began rising with the sun (though today, depending on how you look at it, dates might not line up).Most almanacs maintain that the dog days run from July 3 to Aug. 11, and we wondered whether that is the same for New York City.David Stark, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, told us that although the term \u201cdog days\u201d is not one the agency uses, those dates are \u201cvery close to when average temperature is at its highest\u201d in the city.The warmest temperatures in New York are typically from July 4 to Aug. 9, Mr. Stark said, when the average high is 84 degrees. So yes, this heat wave we\u2019re in is just the beginning.And it could be worse: The hottest temperature recorded in Central Park since 1869 was 106 degrees on July 9, 1936.There will be no New York Today on Wednesday, in observance of the Fourth of July. Enjoy the day off! We\u2019ll be back on Thursday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Don\u2019t We Always Vote in Our Own Self-Interest?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe backlash against the Civil Rights movement continues to confound us.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.One question that has troubled Democrats for decades is freshly relevant in the Trump-McConnell era: Why do so many voters support elected officials who are determined to cut programs that those same voters rely upon? Over the past half century, residents of Kentucky have become steadily more reliant on the federal government. In the 1970s, federal programs provided slightly under 10 percent of personal income for Kentucky residents; by 2015, money from programs ranging from welfare and Medicaid to Social Security and Medicare more than doubled to 23 percent as a share of Kentuckians\u2019 personal income.Twenty years ago, there was only one county (out of 120) in which residents counted on the federal government for at least 40 percent of their personal income. By 2014, 28 counties were at 40 percent or higher. But as their claims on federal dollars rose, the state\u2019s voters became increasingly conservative. In the 1990s, they began to elect hard right, anti-government politicians determined to cut the programs their constituents were coming to lean on.The accompanying graphic, based on Mettler\u2019s data, documents the steady rise in government dependency among Kentucky voters as their representatives in Congress moved to the right. In her book, Mettler gives the example of the Republican congressman Andy Barr, who represents the Sixth District, which includes Wolfe County, where \u201c52 percent of income \u2014 approximately $12,000 per resident \u2014 flows from federal social policies.\u201d In the adjoining Fourth District, Representative Thomas Massie, also a Republican, \u201cresides in Lewis County, in which 43 percent of income comes from federal government transfers.\u201d Massie, Mettler notes, \u201cstridently opposes social welfare spending, having been among the group of Republicans who forced the end of the long tradition of bipartisan cooperation on the farm bill in 2013 because they opposed its inclusion of the food stamp program.\u201dSo what\u2019s going on with Kentucky voters? There is, however, one thread that runs through all the explanations of the shift to the right in Kentucky and elsewhere. Race, the economists Alberto F. Alesina and Paola Giuliano writeLeonie Huddy, a political scientist at the State University of New York \u2014 Stony Brook, made a related point in an email:It\u2019s important to stress the role of negative racial and ethnic attitudes in this process. Those who hold Latinos and African-Americans in low esteem also believe that federal funds flow disproportionally to members of these groups. This belief that the federal government is more willing to help blacks and Latinos than whites fuels the white threat and resentment that boosted support for Donald Trump in 2016.How does race intersect with other factors contributing to the opposition toward redistributive policies found not only in Kentucky, but in many regions of the country?Among the findings of this group of researchers: people \u201cmaking just above the minimum wage are the most likely to oppose its increase.\u201d Applying last-place aversion theory to means-tested federal programs for the poor reveals that the group most likely to voice opposition is made up of relatively poor whites right above the cutoff level to qualify for such programs.\u201cAmericans believe that the poor are lazy; Europeans believe the poor are unfortunate,\u201d report Alesina and Glaeser.Individuals are more willing to vote for redistribution when they perceive the recipients as being deserving. By this I mean that the recipients are willing to work hard but were experiencing bad luck that left them in need of assistance.This distinction often translates into a differentiation between poor whites and poor minorities.\u201cDepictions of immigrants or minorities in discussions or media who seem to be gaming the system may lead to beliefs that recipients of government programs are undeserving of assistance,\u201d Lefgren pointed out, adding thatAmong white respondents, the differences in the responses were striking: More than half, 58 percent, said average Americans got less than they deserved; 28 percent, however, said that African Americans do not get what they deserve.The difference, Tesler wrote, grows out of a \u201cdouble standard in deservingness.\u201d He described the double standard as follows:different portraits have their origins in what social psychologists call \u201cultimate attribution error.\u201d This error means that when whites struggle, their troubles are generally attributed to situational forces (e.g., outsourcing); but when nonwhites struggle, their plight is more often attributed to dispositional traits (i.e., poor work ethic). Consequently, whites are considered \u2018more deserving\u2019 than blacks.For years, we\u2019ve focused on how we can help Americans receive taxpayer-funded assistance. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we\u2019re now looking at how we can respect both those who require assistance and the taxpayers who fund that support. For the first time in a long time, we\u2019re putting taxpayers first. Taking money from someone without an intention to pay it back is not debt. It is theft. This budget makes it clear that we will reverse this larceny.the folks who work hard and pay taxes. This budget is for you. It is your government\u2019s \u2014 your new government\u2019s \u2014 way of thanking those of you who are working two jobs, saving for your kids\u2019 education, or working to buy a home or start your own business. We cannot express our gratitude and respect enough for what you do to make your families, your communities, and this nation work. Americans are the hardest working people who have ever lived. We worked hard to build this country together and will work hard to restore this country together.In exploring the issue of race and deservingness, a key question comes up: Why would race play such a pivotal role in the growing conservatism of a state like Kentucky, which is, as I mentioned earlier, overwhelmingly white? Two reasons.non-disabled working-age adults made up the majority of adult recipients on Medicaid (61 percent), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (67 percent), and rental housing assistance programs (59 percent) as of December 2013.Existing safety-net programs have \u201ccontributed to a dramatic reduction in poverty,\u201d according to the report, but at the expense of \u201ca decline in self-sufficiency among non-disabled working-age adults.\u201dwill cause many low-income adults to lose health coverage, including people who are working or are unable to work due to mental illness, opioid or other substance use disorders, or serious chronic physical conditions, but who cannot overcome various bureaucratic hurdles to document that they either meet work requirements or qualify for an exemption from them.An earlier version of this column misstated the Congressional District in which McCreary County, Ky. is located; it is the Fifth Congressional District, not the Sixth.Advertisement"}

Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \u201cstrongly supports\u201d breast-feeding and says evidence of benefits \u201ccontinues to mount.\u201d Global health experts say that in poor countries in particular, breast-feeding reduces diarrheal diseases and saves babies\u2019 lives.\u201cMalnutrition and poverty are the precise settings where you absolutely do need to breast-feed, because that\u2019s the setting where access to safe and clean water for reconstituting powdered formula is often impossible to find,\u201d said Dr. Michele Barry, senior associate dean for global health and director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health in the Stanford School of Medicine, in response to the president\u2019s tweet. While some women are unable to breast-feed, cannot make enough milk, have medical conditions that prevent them from breast-feeding, or choose not to, the consensus of most mainstream medical organizations is that \u201cbreast is best\u201d when it comes to infant nutrition and health. Breast milk provides essential nutrients as well as hormones and antibodies that protect newborns against infectious disease.Breast-feeding is also associated with a lower risk for sudden infant death syndrome; allergies, including conditions like asthma and eczema; celiac disease and childhood inflammatory bowel disease. Babies aren\u2019t the only ones who appear to reap health benefits from breast-feeding; research has found that mothers who breast-feed also enjoy better long-term health. They are at lower risk for breast and ovarian cancers, Type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Breast-feeding may also promote heart health and healthy blood pressure. More recent studies have found that mothers who breast-feed are at lower risk for developing aggressive hormone receptor negative breast cancers and that those who had gestational diabetes during pregnancy are less likely to go on to develop diabetes later in life if they breast-feed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Front-Page Insult to People With Disabilities", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA New York Post cover story advances the harmful notion that if someone can walk, they must not have a disability.It is one of the distinct pleasures of urban life to be able to wake up on an otherwise fine summer morning, make yourself a cup of coffee, then choke on it at the sight of the front page of your local tabloid. But the cover of The New York Post on Thursday \u2014 the 28th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act \u2014 was more shocking than usual. It promoted a damaging misperception about people with disabilities, on a day better suited to celebrating their progress in one of the most neglected areas of American civil rights.The new photos of Mr. Matatov standing were evidence, readers were to believe, that he wasn\u2019t really disabled.That is an ill-informed and damaging misunderstanding of disability. An estimated four million people in the United States use wheelchairs, but many of them are able to walk or stand some of the time. Many have injuries or genetic conditions that are disabling, but that allow partial mobility \u2014 standing or walking or otherwise moving physically sometimes. Their wheelchairs are necessary to their lives and livelihoods, and they are without question legally disabled.Messages like the one sent by The Post\u2019s cover overlook and mislead the public on the complexities of disability, a category that is decidedly real but also fluid, hard to detect from appearances and often entirely invisible. Despite the progress in legislation and public awareness since the passage of the A.D.A., people with disabilities are still disproportionately subject to discrimination, unjust or illegal treatment, violence and abuse. By planting a seed in the minds of their readers that in every wheelchair is a possible faker or fraudster, the paper is advancing the sort of retrograde presumption and knee-jerk prejudice based on appearances that is the foundation of every form of public discrimination.Newspapers make mistakes. I know \u2014 I work at one. But The Post\u2019s decision to emblazon its cover with the image of an alleged disability fraud on a day when one of the nation\u2019s landmark civil rights legislations is being celebrated is a serious lapse in judgment.To laugh this off as a typical move of a politically conservative local tabloid would be wrong. The Post is one of the largest papers in the country and reaches millions of readers via the Web. People read it. It has influence.The Post may have had some legitimate journalistic intentions with this story \u2014 like exposing scams and fraudulent lawsuits that damage honest businesses. And Mr. Matatov may be just that sort of scammer. But if so, the paper could have exposed him while affording respect to the millions of other wheelchair users who are not frauds.

{"Headline": "Trump Is Being Manipulated by Putin. What Should We Do?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers must keep the American people informed of the current danger, writes a Republican congressman from Texas.Mr. Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer, is a congressman from the 23rd District of Texas. Over the course of my career as an undercover officer in the C.I.A., I saw Russian intelligence manipulate many people. I never thought I would see the day when an American president would be one of them. As a member of Congress, a coequal branch of government designed by our founders to provide checks and balances on the executive branch, I believe that lawmakers must fulfill our oversight duty as well as keep the American people informed of the current danger. Somehow many Americans have forgotten that Russia is our adversary, not our ally, and the reasons for today\u2019s tensions go back much farther than the 2016 election. For more than a decade, Russia has meddled in elections around the world, supported brutal dictators and invaded sovereign nations \u2014 all to the detriment of United States interests. Mitt Romney had it right in 2012 when he told President Barack Obama that Russia was \u201cwithout question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\u201d Our intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that President Putin personally ordered his security services to undertake an influence campaign aimed at undermining confidence in American democracy to sow chaos in our electoral system. Russia\u2019s efforts to hack political organizations and state election boards are well documented, as are the Russian disinformation campaigns on social media platforms. Russia is an adversary not just of the United States but of freedom-loving people everywhere. Disinformation and chaos is a Russian art form developed during the Soviet era that Russia has now updated using modern tools. The result has been Russian disinformation spreading like a virus throughout the Western world. From elections in Britain, France and Montenegro to invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at spreading disorder and expanding Russian influence in states formerly under the heel of Soviet Communism. These efforts weaken our allies and strengthen those who seek to undermine the democratic order that has helped prevent another world war in Europe since 1945.Moreover, the threat of Russian meddling in United States elections is not behind us. Just last week, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, cautioned that \u201cthe warning lights are blinking red\u201d that Russia and other adversaries will undertake further cyberattacks on our digital infrastructure. This includes many of the energy companies in my home district in South and West Texas. Make no mistake, Russian disinformation campaigns are working.Many of my constituents have asked what Congress can do to protect the American people from Russian threats and provide a check on the executive branch\u2019s demonstration in Helsinki. If necessary, Congress should take the lead on European security issues as it has in recent years. For example, during the Obama administration, Congress repeatedly pressed the president \u2014 using the power of the purse through appropriations bills \u2014\u00a0to send lethal weaponry to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed separatists. As a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I strongly believe in the importance of Congress\u2019s oversight responsibilities and will work with my colleagues to ensure that the administration is taking the Russian threat seriously. Without action, we risk losing further credibility in international negotiations with both our friends and foes on critical trade deals, military alliances and nuclear arms. In this dangerous geopolitical environment, we must be both vigilant and strong in responding to foreign threats. The challenges posed by Russia are no different, and I hope the president shares my conviction that American strength, not weakness, is the best way to preserve a secure world in the face of adversaries like Russia.Will Hurd is a Republican congressman from Texas.

That does not mean NATO would have to pile in if Montenegro aggressively assaulted, say, Serbia, since the article is triggered only if a member is attacked. It has been invoked only once: not in the Balkans, but in support of the United States after 9/11.Mr. Trump might get his staff to find another missing double negative to roll back what he said.

When she was a girl, her father discovered that their pastor was dipping into church funds and reported it to the congregation. Instead of doing something about the pastor, the community shunned her family. Sarah and her siblings would sit at parties and neighborhood events and nobody would talk to them. She spent eight years of her childhood ostracized.Years later, she was beginning work on her Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins, mapping the neural structures of the brain. She was lonely, and she saw kids throughout the Baltimore schools who were lonely and isolated, too.She got the principal at Dunbar High School to give her names of some of the school\u2019s most academically underperforming kids and persuaded dozens of Hopkins students to volunteer as extended family members for the kids, driving them to school, bringing them lunch, driving them back to school when they skipped out, doing homework with them, taking them camping.Each volunteer is coached by a more experienced volunteer, called the Head of Family. The Head of Family is coached by a Grandparent, who supports the Head. The Grandparents are coached by Community Managers, who are paid Thread staffers. Circling the whole system are Collaborators, who offer special expertise when called in \u2014 legal help, SAT tutoring, mental health counseling, etc. In short, the organization weaves an elaborate system of relationships, a cohesive village, around the task of helping kids. The social network is as much for the adults and the city as for the kids.For the first few months, the students often reject the relationships. \u201cYou expect people not to be there for you,\u201d says Marcus, one of the students. Trust is built by persistence through failure. Thread also has an app called Tapestry. It tracks every time a volunteer has a touchpoint with one of the students \u2014 driving to school, sharing a meal. Hemminger calls it the Fitbit of social relationships. Tapestry can track how often a student has touchpoints, who hasn\u2019t had a touchpoint, how many touchpoints lead to what outcomes. They are very, very open when they are hurting. \u201cI entered in this role to combat social isolation, but this role is very isolating,\u201d Hemminger confesses. That vulnerability stretches throughout. Teenagers, who usually have their armor up with strangers, told me all about the stresses in their life, their fears and their mental health challenges.Thread also has an atmosphere of intense intimacy and outspoken love. Everybody is encouraged \u201cto call a thing a thing\u201d \u2014 to talk bluntly about what\u2019s going on \u2014 and to \u201cshow all the way up\u201d \u2014 to throw their mess on the table for others to carry. The program rejects any distinction between haves and have-nots. The volunteers are not there to do social change. They are there to be changed. The word \u201cmentor\u201d is banned because everybody is leaning on everybody else. Dozens of cities have asked Thread to come to their town. Hemminger has turned them down. Thread is about Baltimore. Thread is going to go deep in Baltimore. Hemminger wears a map of Baltimore as a pendant around her neck. These days, I spend my mornings writing depressing columns about a political culture marred by distrust and my afternoons visiting places like Thread. There is no way to repair national distrust without repairing individual relationships one by one. This is where American renewal begins.Advertisement"}

It might seem absurd to have to strategize how to set boundaries with your smartphone. But the reward \u2014 a vacation that feels like a vacation \u2014 is well worth the work. Here are some useful tips on how to use your phone on vacation, without letting it hijack your trip. You can always check these platforms through your phone\u2019s internet browser if you must, and you can reinstall them at any time \u2014 but why not use your vacation as a chance to see what life is like without Facebook?Put your other apps into folders on an interior page to prevent yourself from being tempted by their icons.For example, you could decide not to allow phones at meals, or to leave phones behind in the hotel lockbox when you go out to dinner, or to not post photos to social media till you\u2019re back from your trip. To prevent mutiny, you can also decide upon a time each day when everyone can use their phones freely \u2014 say, the hour before dinner. You could always just leave your phone at home. But if that sounds too extreme, try this: Every day, pick a time or activity when you will leave your phone behind. Then notice what it feels like to be without your digital appendage. For example, you could keep your notifications turned off, or refrain from automatically reinstalling the apps that you\u2019ve deleted, or charge your phone outside your bedroom, or schedule a time each day to go without your phone. Experiment enough, and you may be able to maintain a vacation-like sense of freedom during your normal life as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Warns NATO Allies to Spend More on Defense, or Else", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has written sharply worded letters to the leaders of several NATO allies \u2014 including Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada \u2014 taking them to task for spending too little on their own defense and warning that the United States is losing patience with what he said was their failure to meet security obligations shared by the alliance.The letters, sent in June, are the latest sign of acrimony between Mr. Trump and American allies as he heads to a NATO summit meeting next week in Brussels that will be a closely watched test of the president\u2019s commitment to the alliance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly questioned its value and has claimed that its members are taking advantage of the United States.In his letters, the president hinted that after more than a year of public and private complaints that allies have not done enough to share the burden of collective defense, he may be considering a response, including adjusting the United States\u2019 military presence around the world.\u201cAs we discussed during your visit in April, there is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in a particularly pointed letter, according to someone who saw it and shared excerpts with The New York Times. \u201cThe United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent\u2019s economy, including Germany\u2019s, are doing well and security challenges abound. This is no longer sustainable for us.\u201d\u201cGrowing frustration,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cis not confined to our executive branch. The United States Congress is concerned, as well.\u201dIn the letter, Mr. Trump told Ms. Merkel that Germany also deserves blame for the failure of other NATO countries to spend enough: \u201cContinued German underspending on defense undermines the security of the alliance and provides validation for other allies that also do not plan to meet their military spending commitments, because others see you as a role model.\u201dIn language that is echoed in his letters to the leaders of other countries \u2014 including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium \u2014 Mr. Trump said he understands the \u201cdomestic political pressure\u201d brought to bear by opponents of boosting military expenditures, noting that he has expended \u201cconsiderable political capital to increase our own military spending.\u201d\u201cIt will, however, become increasingly difficult to justify to American citizens why some countries do not share NATO\u2019s collective security burden while American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas or come home gravely wounded,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote to Ms. Merkel.Mr. Trump has long complained about the alliance and routinely grouses that the United States is treated shabbily by multilateral organizations of which it is a member, be it the World Trade Organization or the North Atlantic alliance. But in Europe, the letters to NATO allies have been greeted with some degree of alarm because of their suggestion that Mr. Trump is prepared to impose consequences on the allies \u2014 as he has done in an escalating tariff fight with European trading partners \u2014 if they do not do what he is asking.\u201cTrump still seems to think that NATO is like a club that you owe dues to, or some sort of protection racket where the U.S. is doing all the work protecting all these deadbeat Europeans while they\u2019re sitting around on vacation, and now he is suggesting there are consequences,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former Defense Department official who is the executive vice president for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\u201cEuropeans have been watching Donald Trump begin to implement his rhetoric on trade in ways that are very combative,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re starting to contemplate whether he would do this regarding security issues, as well.\u201dA White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that Mr. Trump is committed to the NATO alliance and expects allies to shoulder \u201ctheir fair share of our common defense burden, and to do more in areas that most affect them.\u201dJohn R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said Sunday that it was NATO members who refused to spend more on defense \u2014 not the president \u2014 who were responsible for undercutting the alliance.\u201cThe president wants a strong NATO,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIf you think Russia\u2019s a threat, ask yourself this question: Why is Germany spending less than 1.2 percent of its G.N.P.? When people talk about undermining the NATO alliance, you should look at those who are carrying out steps that make NATO less effective militarily.\u201dBut for diplomats hoping fervently to avoid another high-profile summit meeting collapse with Mr. Trump as the instigator, the letters were concerning.\u201cEuropeans, like many folks in our Defense Department, think that there are many good things that could come out of this summit if only they can keep it from going off the rails,\u201d Mr. Chollet said. \u201cThey are hoping to survive without irreparable damage, and so the fact that you have all these storm clouds surrounding NATO and Trump is really worrisome.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s disparagement of Europe and the alliance has become almost routine, leaving some veteran diplomats aghast. Last week, Jim Melville, the United States ambassador to Estonia, told friends and colleagues that he would resign at the end of this month after more than 30 years in the Foreign Service, in part because of the president\u2019s language.Still, the president is not alone in demanding more robust military spending by NATO allies.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated the country of which Mark Rutte is the prime minister.

There were ceremonies for these brave souls at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem, where they were honored and trees were planted.But their accomplishments were little known.\u201cI met Malka in 1985,\u201d Ms. Block said in a recent interview, \u201cand in 1986 she said to me: \u2018My rabbi, Harold Schulweis, from Encino, is a great, great man. He has been wanting someone to write a book about the rescuers for 25 years.\u2019 Nobody had wanted to pay attention to their stories because Holocaust survivors said that it whitewashed the Holocaust, and he had never gotten anyone to do it.\u201dThe writer and photographer began interviewing some of the rescuers who had relocated to Southern California, but they eventually traveled to Canada and Europe for 100 interviews. They worked on the project from 1986 to 1988, and in 1992 Ms. Block had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A separate traveling show was produced by Curatorial Assistance, and traveled to 50 venues over 11 years.Ms. Drucker wrote the original text, Ms. Block made the portraits and edited the interviews, and Cynthia Ozick contributed an introduction to the resulting book, \u201cRescuers: Portraits of Moral Courage in the Holocaust.\u201dNow it\u2019s the 30th anniversary of the \u201cRescuers\u201d project, and in a time replete with misinformation and unsettling incidents of racial and religious violence, Ms. Block hopes to bring the exhibit back for the 21st century. She says these stories can inspire others to stand strong in difficult times.\u201cEach rescuer was so different; was their own person,\u201d she said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any kind of formula. But by the time we met them so many years later, they didn\u2019t always have such an easy life. It was the biggest privilege of my life to be able to meet these people.\u201d Maria, Countess von Maltzan, was a veterinarian living in East Berlin at the time of her interview. She told of being raised on an 18,000-acre estate in the Silesia region of Germany, to fabulous wealth, a doting father and a cruel and unforgiving mother.Familial rebelliousness first drove her to become a member of the underground in Berlin during the war. \u201cIt was easy for me to resist Nazi authority because I had always resisted my mother\u2019s authority,\u201d she said.The countess hid Jews in a secret compartment in her sofa (among other places) and once dared an SS officer to shoot at it while her future husband, Hans, was still was inside. (He failed to call her bluff, thankfully.)\u201cI was a queen on the black market all during the war,\u201d she recalled, \u201cbut I had to be good at it because I had so many extra people to feed. I always said, no matter what came along, \u2018I prefer to be in a tough situation than to go to bed with a bad conscience.\u2019\u201dGustav Mikulai was raised in a Social Democrat family in Budapest and grew up with Jewish friends and neighbors. As a budding musician, he was impressed by the Jewish students he encountered in school.\u201cThe Jews were capable and everyone was envious,\u201d he said. \u201cI understood that from the beginning. I couldn\u2019t be anti-Semitic, first because I thought it would be immoral, and second because I thought well enough of myself that I didn\u2019t need to be envious of them.\u201dMr. Mikulai eventually married a Jewish musician and then hid her and her parents when the Germans invaded in March 1944. From that point on, he dedicated himself to saving as many Jews as possible.Being a resistance fighter required huge sacrifice, because, as he said, \u201cI found during this time of the Holocaust that I could kill anyone who was suspicious of me. It was a terrible time for humanity.\u201dMr. Mikulai was able to look back knowing that he was no bystander, watching while the world was subsumed by chaos. Reflecting from his perch in Bonn, Germany, he knew he had made a difference.\u201cI think in all I was able to save at least 50 people, and maybe 80 or a hundred,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy about the times I was able to rescue children who, now married and with children of their own, who\u2019ll not have had such a life without my help.\u201dJan Karski was a Polish spy who eventually became a professor at Georgetown University in Washington. Like a real-life James Bond, he once skied across Slovakia into Hungary on a mission and was eventually caught by the Germans before being rescued by the Polish resistance.Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the Jewish underground to take news of the Warsaw ghetto, and the annihilation of the Jews, directly to Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. But first, he had to visit the ghetto to see for himself.\u201cThe ghetto was macabre,\u201d he said in his interview. \u201cIt was not a world. It was not a part of humanity. I did not belong there. I vomited blood that night. I saw horrible, horrible things I will never forget. So I agreed to do what they asked of me.\u201dMr. Karski managed to meet with both leaders, but was disappointed to hear they were unwilling to put resources directly to stopping the Holocaust, as their focus was on the war. (\u201cHelping Jews was no advantage to the Allied war strategy,\u201d he said.)When he asked the president what message he should take back to Poland, Roosevelt replied: \u201c\u2018You will tell them we shall win the war and the enemy will be punished for their crimes. Justice will prevail. Tell your nation that they have a friend in this house. This is what you will tell them.\u2019\u201dZofia Baniecka, from Warsaw, was visiting her friend Ruth in Staten Island when she was interviewed for the \u201cRescuers\u201d project. She and her mother had been integral to the Polish resistance after her father was killed by a Russian bomb in 1941.Unlike some other rescuers, she and her mother evaded detection the entire time they fought the Nazis. \u201cI was never interrogated or nearly caught, though I don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just lucky. Luck, it was only luck, because I kept people and guns in my house from the winter of 1941 until the Polish uprising in August 1944.\u201dShe was consistent with many of her fellow rescuers, however, in stating her desire that these stories be shared well into the future.\u201cThere are many people who have saved my belief in humanity, and that is why it is important for people to know about this time, of Poland during the war, and that there were those of us who did try to save Jews,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is necessary for the children to know that there were such people.\u201dAart and Johtje Vos lived in an artist colony called Laren, near Amsterdam, and their home became a reliable stop on the underground. (So much so that they once had 36 people hiding there.)\u201cMore and more people came to hide in our house,\u201d Johtje said. \u201cWe had mattresses all over the floor, and they had to be camouflaged in case the Germans came.\u201dThe couple\u2019s bravery ruffled feathers within the home, with one of their own children questioning the risks they were taking. It was never a question for them, though, as they couldn\u2019t stand idly by while the Germans picked off their fellow countrymen.\u201cHolland was like a family and part of that family was in danger,\u201d Aart said. \u201cIn this case, the Jewish part. The Germans were threatening our family. We weren\u2019t thinking, \u2018What shall we do?\u2019 We just did.\u201dHelene Jacobs, who was born in Berlin, worked with a group called Confessing Church to provide false papers and identification to German Jews. Eventually, her counterfeit ring was tracked down by the Gestapo, and she was arrested in 1943.In her interview, she said: \u201cFrom childhood I believed that each of us who is given the gift of life is responsible for our own life and for what and whom we decide to surround ourselves. This is why I fought Nazism.\u201dMs. Jacobs spent 20 months in prison for her \u201ccrimes,\u201d and when she was released, discovered that her home had been burned. As a German who battled the Nazis, she felt it was her duty to fight.\u201cI always knew how dangerous it was, but I did it for humanity, and because I was a patriot,\u201d she said. \u201cI was ashamed of what the German people were doing.\u201dAgnieszka Budna-Widerschal was interviewed in Israel, where she lived with her second Jewish husband, Shimon. She sheltered her first Jewish husband, Motl, in Poland during the war and also saved his brothers.She described her brazen plan to sneak her brothers-in-law through the ghetto to safety: \u201cI pretended to be drunk while the two brothers walked on either side of me, each of them holding me under my arm. There were Nazis all over the street. I knew we would surely run into one of them, and when we did he just took one look at me and said with disgust, \u2018Ach, that\u2019s just like a Pole!\u2019 And he walked his way and we went ours!\u201dThough her family came through World War II intact, Motl died soon after from diabetes. Worse yet, in 1954, during a period of rising anti-Semitism, Agnieszka\u2019s daughter Bella was murdered by a gang of Polish teenagers.Agnieszka and Shimon moved to Israel a few years later.Pieter and Joyce Miedema were interviewed in their home in Canada, where they emigrated in 1952. He had been a Presbyterian minister in Holland and was an early proponent of helping Jews in the face of the Nazi onslaught.He had a stroke late in life, and his wife spoke on his behalf. They had worked together to shelter and support Jews during the war.\u201cHe thought he should practice what he preached,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was always one step ahead,\u201d and told his congregants, \u201c\u2018If you opt against opening your home and heart to an innocent fugitive, you have no place in the community of the just.\u2019\u201dSemmy Riekerk worked with her husband, Joop Woortman, to save Jews for the Dutch resistance. \u201cMy sister helped, too, but I didn\u2019t know it at the time,\u201d she said in her interview. \u201cYou never told anyone anything they didn\u2019t have to know. My husband used anyone he could trust.\u201dBeginning in 1942, they organized efforts to steal and forge papers to help Jews escape, but later focused their energies on saving children. (Ms. Riekerk adopted a refugee during the war.)When Joop Woortman was captured, and later killed in Bergen Belsen in 1944, Ms. Riekerk took up his mantle and did the work herself.\u201cI had to carry on his work until the end of the war,\u201d she said. \u201cThey gave me the book that listed 300 names and said: \u2018These are the people who are hiding children. You have to take them ration cards and money every month.\u2019 The banks provided money from the Dutch government-in-exile, and our organization provided the ration cards.\u201dEventually, the Jewish children were reunited with their mother in Amsterdam after the war and then moved to Israel when she died in 1947.By the time Gay Block and Malka Drucker interviewed Mr. de Vries, he was living in Ontario and going by the nickname Joe.Recalling Mrs. Haringman\u2019s original predicament, he said, \u201cWhat it must have been like for that mother to give up her children to someone she didn\u2019t know.\u201dStefania Podgorska Burzminski, born in a small village in Poland, was interviewed above her husband Joe\u2019s dentist office in Massachusetts. She had saved him, and two of his brothers, by hiding a cohort of 13 Jews in a cottage she procured during the war.Joe\u2019s parents and two of his other brothers had been taken by the Nazis, but he escaped by jumping from a train and soon showed up at Stefania\u2019s house.\u201cPoor Joe, he was filthy and his clothes were rags,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI gave him my nightgown to wear. Joe cried all night, and my sister laughed at him in my nightgown. I explained to my sister who Joe was, that he was a Jew, that Germans wanted to kill him, and that we had to help him.\u201dUltimately, they survived the war, and Joe converted to Catholicism in order to marry Stefania. It was very difficult for her to discuss the past, and Ms. Block returned a year later for a second interview to better understand the story.\u201cI work hard all day now, helping Joe in his dentist\u2019s practice,\u201d she told her. \u201cEvery time I have to do an interview like this, it brings back all the memories and I can\u2019t sleep for some nights.\u201dAlex and Mela Roslan were living in Clearwater, Fla., when \u201cRescuers\u201d was shot. They were originally from Poland and lived near Bialystok during the war.Alex had a textile business and noticed his Jewish clientele were disappearing, so he put on a star and entered the ghetto. \u201cI saw so many children, hungry and starving,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were so skinny. The parents had been taken to \u2018farms,\u2019 but we knew what that meant. I came home and told Mela we had to do something. We decided to go to Warsaw.\u201dThe young couple took an apartment and eventually hid three young, wealthy brothers: Jacob, Sholom and David Gutgelt. Though they were never discovered, tragedy struck regardless, as Sholom died of illness, and the Roslans\u2019 son Yurek was killed by a Nazi sniper.But Jacob and David survived the war and were eventually reunited with their father in Israel. Alex and Mela moved to America, and they all lost contact for years.In 1980, though, David moved to America to study at the University of California, Berkeley, and was reunited with the family that saved his life. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t recognize him,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in so long, and he had a beard. But then he threw his arms around me. David is a mathematician, and Jacob is a nuclear scientist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Women clamored for Chanel products (or inexpensive imitations of them) not just for their sleek looks, but because those products seemed to grant entry into the designer\u2019s enviable world. By turning her initials into a logo \u2014 those famous interlocking C\u2019s \u2014 Chanel crystallized her marketable identity into a recognizable badge of prestige. Ms. Trump\u2019s attraction to aspirational branding makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s the linchpin of her family fortune. Donald Trump\u2019s empire was always more about branding than building. He based his entire career on an outer-borough fantasy of aristocratic privilege. This is why he bought Mar-a-Lago, once the estate of the socialite-philanthropist Marjorie Merriweather Post. This is why he created an imitation heraldic Trump family crest, to ennoble cuff links, shirts and cologne. Mr. Trump\u2019s success has always derived from the implication that to embrace him, to buy into his brand, was to enter his fantasy luxury universe. His presidential campaign extended this idea: While thin on policy, it enticed the nation (or a subset thereof) to rebrand itself with the Trump logo and thus magically obtain mass privilege via osmosis. In Donald Trump we elected a (faux) luxury brand logo come to life.Like Chanel, Ivanka Trump understood the craving for both status and community. In response, she created an aspirational universe geared toward working women who yearned for advancement, wanting to fake it till they make it. It was a pasteboard \u201cC-suite\u201d feminist look \u2014 pastel-toned sheath dresses; structured bags conjuring C\u00e9line or Prada, but often made of vinyl; pumps and flats that closely imitated higher-end shoes (including Chanels). A preponderance of baby pink, ruffles, bell sleeves and other girlish touches undermined any real power-feminist vibe. Over all, the brand offered watered-down simulacra of luxury goods, accessibly priced, elite-seeming but poorly made.Ms. Trump was really selling her own pampered life, as her father sells his own. That she is more refined and soft-spoken than he, as well as delicate-featured and blond, only enhanced the fantasy she marketed. Even after assuming White House duties, Ms. Trump was unabashed about acting as a corporate advertisement, conflating branding and presidential politics \u2014 just as her father does. Recall her Republican convention speech: She wore a pink sheath, made available for purchase immediately after, while a fan blew her hair gently back, lending the whole scene the air of a fashion shoot. This slightly unreal, magazine-ad feeling still pervades much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. If Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand rode to success on the same forces that drove Trumpism, could the end of her logo-branded company also suggest diminishing tolerance for our logo-branded presidency? Perhaps. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Win a Battle Over Copyright Rules in Europe", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a fight nearly as old as the internet.On one side are news organizations, broadcasters and music companies that want to control how their content spreads across the web, and to be paid more for it. On the other are tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue that they funnel viewers and advertising revenue to media outlets, and free-speech advocates, who say that regulating the internet would set a dangerous precedent and limit access to information.That battle flared up in Europe on Thursday. Two powerful industries faced off \u2014 technology against media, platforms against publishers \u2014 in an unusually aggressive lobbying campaign in the European Parliament over a bill that would impose some of the world\u2019s strictest copyright laws, which would have required tech companies to filter out unlicensed content and pay for its use.On this occasion, tech prevailed; the proposal was voted down.\u201cMaking content available on the internet does not come without responsibility,\u201d said Eleonora Rosati, an associate professor on intellectual property law at the University of Southampton\u2019s law school in England, who has been tracking the bill. \u201cRights holders want to control how their content is made available, shared and indexed.\u201dMedia businesses like Axel Springer of Germany have become frustrated because even as their content has spread online, it is platforms like YouTube, owned by Google, and Facebook that have grown into advertising powerhouses on the back of the material.Those media companies have been seeking a rewrite of Europe\u2019s copyright laws that would give them more power to restrict how their content is distributed. They also cited concerns that Silicon Valley was not playing a strong enough gatekeeper role when it came to curtailing hate speech, violent extremism and fake news.Supporters of the bill argued that stricter copyright laws would give content creators more leverage against internet behemoths such as Google. Publishers have long complained that such companies profit from the work of others.\u201cThe real issue is Google\u2019s market power,\u201d said Lionel Bently, a law professor at the University of Cambridge who focuses on copyright. \u201cThe content industry feels it can\u2019t negotiate on a level playing field.\u201dInfluential policymakers in Brussels such as the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, have seemed receptive to such arguments. A proposal was put forward to require websites to use filtering technology to block unlicensed content from being posted and to obligate them to pay fees for news articles and other material posted online.The proposed rules would have added up to a sweeping change to copyright law.Operators of websites have long been protected from liability when unlicensed content is posted by a user. Instead, they are required only to remove infringing material once it is brought to their attention. In effect, if someone posts a movie clip on YouTube, or shares the text of an article on Reddit, those websites are not held legally liable.The new European proposals would put more responsibility on website owners, creating a potentially costly problem for sites that depend on user-generated material.The most contentious provision of the plans would require websites to use filtering software to screen such content before it was posted. YouTube already has a system to weed out unlicensed material, but the European rules would have gone further by requiring others to use similar tools. Another requirement, favored by book and news publishers, would prevent websites from using pieces of their content without authorization.Critics of the bill argued that it would lead to many unforeseen consequences, warning that it could even affect satirical content or the use of images in internet memes. They said it would restrict what was available online, and some described a provision requiring permission before websites used publishers\u2019 content as a \u201clink tax.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that those algorithmic filters are going to be able to decide that something is fair use, parody, a meme or a mash-up,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Brien, international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit group that opposed the bill.In defeating the proposal, the technology industry showed that it still held considerable influence, even as it has faced widespread criticism over privacy violations, the spread of misinformation, accusations of anticompetitive business practices and concerns about smartphone overuse.The coalition against the proposal that came together over the past month was similar to defenders of net neutrality in the United States, a mix of corporate giants and open internet activists. They said the copyright bill would limit the access to information and would overburden operators of websites, especially those without the resources of an American tech giant, with the costly task of screening user-generated content before posting it.Wikipedia said on its website that the measure \u201cthreatens online freedom and creates obstacles to accessing the web, imposing new barriers, filters and restrictions.\u201dMr. Gambini said he had received hundreds of messages from individuals and organizations attempting to win Mr. Tremosa\u2019s support. There was one from a Polish business group, he said, another from an artists\u2019 organization, and others still from news publishers and associations representing tech companies.He added that one message had come from the musician Paul McCartney, who wrote to members of the European Parliament in support of the tighter copyright rules.Advertisement"}

Is That a Good Thing?", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country is late to Twitter and Facebook \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t learned from other countries\u2019 mistakes.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Along with this sentiment comes a principled skepticism toward innovative ideas and technologies from more, let\u2019s say, energetic countries. My parents\u2019 generation remembers how long it took bluejeans and chewing gum to become socially acceptable here. I remember thorough debates about the pros and cons of cellphones, long after they were part of the everyday American landscape.Such reservation has arguably been a blessing. Being late to the social media party has allowed Germans to learn from others\u2019 mistakes. In principle, Twitter and Facebook are fantastic tools that give voice to otherwise unheard groups and challenge mainstream views. If the news media is the fourth estate, social media is the fifth, and a welcome check on the government, private sector and traditional journalists. The likelihood that falsehoods and careless errors will be immediately exposed by swarms of social-media users has been a boon for transparency and responsibility. In this sense, Germans should welcome more social-media use.But we also should recognize the converse, that for many social-media users, the goal isn\u2019t credibility \u2014 it\u2019s attention. Predictably, those two become muddled online, so that the loudest voice in the digital room is often the one with the most power and influence. As George Orwell put it: \u201cThe more you are in the right, the more natural that everyone else should be bullied into thinking likewise.\u201dFrom afar, this fact more than anything explains the rise of President Trump and, at almost the same time, Brexit in Britain (where social media penetration is at 66 percent), and it makes Germans wary of what might happen in their own country, should social media continue to spread.Of course, context matters: In Germany, we don\u2018t face a decision as tough as in the United States or Britain did two years ago. But we have reason to worry. Germans only really began taking to social media around the time of the refugee influx; in 2017 alone, the share of Germans who use social media soared by 15 percent. Germany\u2019s refugee crisis has been the first issue to be debated widely on social media. And how are we doing? I\u2019m afraid that despite all the lessons available from other countries\u2019 experiences, Germany is falling into the same Orwellian trap. We too have entered the vicious circle of the digital public sphere: Excitement trumps precision. Lack of precision leads to unfairness. Unfairness leads to anger. Anger again leads to a lack of precision. And so on.What worries me is that the skeptical innocence that kept Germans off social media for so long has also prevented us from learning from others\u2019 mistakes \u2014 and now we are rushing into it headlong, angry and na\u00efve at the same time. The result is a coarser, more violent discourse than we are ready for, and an openness to authoritarian responses on both sides. Before it\u2019s too late, Germans need to step back from our screens and ask: Do we really want to go farther down this road?Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingLinks golf, and the Open Championship where it is annually celebrated, is the sport\u2019s greatest setting \u2014 because golf is a game for chasers. Mr. Coyne, a 4 handicap and the author of \u201cA Course Called Scotland,\u201d played Carnoustie in May 2015 with his father, who, after listening to his caddie's advice to putt his ball \u201ctwo cups outside the left edge,\u201d proceeded to miss by four feet, and was thus admonished by his caddie: \u201cI didn't say two Stanley Cups.\u201dEvery links is a golf course, but not every golf course is a links. We throw the term around as a synonym for anything resembling a golf course, but most golfers will never actually play a links. Yet they witness one every July, when, as it has this weekend, the Open Championship returns to our televisions. This year\u2019s Open is being played on the Scottish coast at Carnoustie, and for golfers, it brings four consecutive Christmas mornings of coffee and major championship golf. But unless you know what you are looking at, it may seem a joyless holiday of brown fairways and bland sport.We fail to realize that we are watching golf played upon its most sacred altars. We can\u2019t see that we are witnessing a miracle of both nature and sport.He was no doubt recalling the Carnoustie collapse of the French golfer Jean van de Velde, who in 1999 pinballed his way down the final hole of the Open championship and frittered away a three-shot lead in infamous fashion. All golfers remember where they were that Sunday. I was a caddie at the time and watched on tiptoe at the pro shop window, glued to the television inside as images of golf\u2019s great tragedy unfolded. From every corner of the clubhouse came the groans, the laughter, the sickened silences as we watched Carnoustie rip back strokes from the Frenchman, leaving him barefoot in a flowing burn. It is a recollection that still unsettles a golfer\u2019s soul, because in our memories of that morning, we somehow feel our every failure and misstep and regret; we see Carnoustie, and imagine our own dreams turning to sand in our hands and passing through our fingers. We fear the place, but we really fear what it proved to us: that this game we love doesn\u2019t love us back. Golf remains indifferent to notions of hope and mercy, and on any given tee box, we suspect that we might all be Van de Velde.Dad and I had a quiet drive up to Carnoustie from St. Andrews. He had introduced me to links golf when I was 13 years old, on a family trip to Ireland where we took a break from hunting for gravestones with our name on them to play a local track called Enniscrone. From that first moment when we peered out into a rippled horizon of sandy mountains and waving beach grasses and our caddy said, \u201cHit it there,\u201d I was hooked. Links golf was not the golf I knew. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but I wanted to know it deeply. I have been chasing my golf ball through the dunes ever since. Before the helping herds came glaciers and ice ages and millenniums of receding waters and shifting tides that left behind these former seabeds turned preposterous dunescapes that no course designer could have imagined or sculpted. Millions of years of geographical phenomena went into shaping a true links course; nature forged the pathway that inspired and sustained the game. It\u2019s hard to say the same about Wrigley Field or the Staples Center, so forgive golfers when they behave as if their game is divinely inspired. Because it was.It took years for me to understand that this is what I was feeling on a links \u2014 the providence of it all \u2014 and to accept that golf in any other setting was an imitation (often wonderfully so) of the game\u2019s true state. Links golf plays differently \u2014 the ocean breezes require one to engage the landscape rather than avoid it. It\u2019s bowling versus darts. It\u2019s also relentlessly difficult. Links rough is wiry and hungry, and with little to stop your Titleist from finding it, golf balls go missing like there\u2019s a hole in your bag. The bunkers are shoulder-height, the gorse thorns will bleed you before giving back your ball, and even the most seasoned links player will struggle to gauge how the wind is going to affect a putt. Dad and I both survived Carnoustie that afternoon; we even carded a bogie and a par on 18, scores that would have had Van de Velde kissing the Claret Jug. But my pilgrimage to Carnoustie was only a stop on this links journey. I am in Donegal, Ireland, as I write this, a week deep into another links binge, and this morning I took five swings to dislodge my ball from the vegetation beside a fairway. I was Jean van de Velde. And I may be tomorrow when I head back out into the dunes again. Or maybe tomorrow will be the round when all the shots follow my intentions, and golf is finally solved. For this chaser, that would be a bigger nightmare than anything that ever happened on the 18th at Carnoustie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Filipino Specialty Best Paired With a Brew in the East Village", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosSisig \u2014 say it SEE-sig, half-hissing, the tongue darting behind the teeth \u2014 is a dish at once ancient and young. Its name entered Western history around 1699, in a grammar of the Kapampangan language of the Philippines written by a Spanish missionary, who defined it, briefly, as \u201cto cook with vinegar,\u201d giving no hint of its splendor.In its earliest form, it was simply unripened fruit, doused with vinegar to make it sourer yet, and used as a palliative for morning sickness. Over time, meat supplanted fruit, and in the late 1960s, a street vendor in Angeles City started making sisig with pig face, hacked with two cleavers into a merry hash and blackened in a hot skillet with onions, chiles, vinegar and a squeeze of calamansi (an indigenous citrus that out-stings lime). Now sisig numbers among the world\u2019s greatest foods to eat with beer, a sip and a bite, one consolation after another.Arcs of red onion gleam, while chiles lay low. Where cooks in the Philippines sometimes rely on pig brains to give the dish body, here the secret is cream. There\u2019s a trickle of vinegar and lemon in lieu of calamansi, but salt is in ascendance. Eating sisig leaves you parched and depleted, and still you can\u2019t stop.In sisig baboy, the chef, Carmen Sta Maria (pronounced Santa Maria), foregoes the usual pig ears, jowl and snout for pork belly and crumbled chicharr\u00f3n, to evoke the crunch, if not the chewiness, of cartilage. Better yet are versions featuring pusit (squid), so thoroughly broken down, it\u2019s impossible to distinguish arm from mantle, but tender and distinctly marine; bangus (milkfish), light and ready to flake; and tuna, rich and verging on beefy.Ms. Sta Maria, known as Aming, grew up in the Bicol region of the Philippines. She had never cooked professionally when she and her husband, Sam, the Bronx-born son of Filipino immigrants, opened the first Mama Fina\u2019s in New Jersey 14 years ago. In fact, she had hardly cooked at all before arriving in the United States in 2000. Missing the food of home, she consulted her mother, Delfina Dolor \u2014 Mama Fina \u2014 for recipes and carefully replicated each one.Her flavors are strong but balanced, as in sinigang, a soup suffused with tamarind to deliver an edifying sourness, and beef a lo pobre, so-called pauper\u2019s steak, a broad plank of Angus rib-eye anointed with the most minimal seasonings and tasting of plenty.Her food deserves a warmer space than this slightly unwieldy dining room that calls to mind a tavern. Orders are placed at the cash register up front, then brought to you. As the night gets busier, the time between dishes expands.Absent from the table is the typical battalion of condiments that Filipino diners use to recalibrate each dish to their taste. One exception \u2014 presented alongside kare-kare, an oxtail stew velvety with house-made peanut butter \u2014 is bagoong alamang (fermented shrimp paste), unsparing in funk. \u201cI don\u2019t eat it myself,\u201d Mr. Sta Maria said. \u201cBut if we run out, some customers really notice.\u201dAt the meal\u2019s end, there is showy halo-halo, made with a spill of evaporated milk over shattered ice and crowned with ube (purple yam) ice cream and house-made ube halaya (jam). You dive for treasure in the depths: jackfruit, pandan jelly, sweet beans and koang, translucent palm seeds with the butteriness of macadamia nuts.But I loved best leche flan, a small plateau of custard that sways gently at the touch, under a veil of caramel. Ms. Sta Maria lets the caramel go further than usual, closer to the edge of burned. In a lesser hand, it could easily tip into bitterness. Instead, it\u2019s better than sweet; it\u2019s dark and deep, and I am still dreaming of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Defeat Far-Right Nationalists, Don\u2019t Try to Imitate Them", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust look around Europe: It\u2019s clear that accommodating radical nationalists is a losing proposition. Why are Britain\u2019s Conservatives so set on that course, despite the fact that access to that market is vital to the prosperity of the country they govern? Because promising to \u201ctake back control\u201d of their country\u2019s borders gradually became the party\u2019s default response to a challenge that so many of Europe\u2019s center-right parties have been trying to deal with for a decade or more.The rise of anti-immigrant nationalist insurgencies claiming to represent \u201cthe people\u201d against a corrupt and uncaring political establishment has deep economic, political, social and cultural roots. Yet the reaction of the Continent\u2019s mainstream conservative, market-liberal and Christian democratic parties can be boiled down to four fairly shallow, and equally ineffective, approaches. Only if the center-right fully faces up to the fact that they are all dead ends can it begin to come up with better, more creative and probably more combative ways to deal with the challenge it\u2019s facing. The first approach is to try to ignore the populist radical right \u2014 and even treat it as some kind of pariah. That\u2019s essentially what the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Moderates in Sweden did for years. In the end, it hasn\u2019t worked.Meanwhile, the fact that the Sweden Democrats originated in that country\u2019s white supremacist underground didn\u2019t prevent them from gaining 13 percent in the 2014 general election. Many predict they will do even better this year, even in the wake of attempts by the Swedish government to strengthen border controls. The second approach taken by the center-right is to toughen its stance on migration and multiculturalism, promising to make life more difficult both for those who want to come to the country and for those who\u2019ve already made it. Countries where the center-right has tried this include the France, the Netherlands, Denmark \u2014 and Britain.Again, though, the results haven\u2019t exactly been impressive: The far-right National Front made it into the runoff in the 2017 French presidential election. The equally extreme Dutch Party for Freedom hasn\u2019t gone away. The Danish People\u2019s Party became Denmark\u2019s second-biggest party when it took 21 percent of the vote in the 2015 general election \u2014 at which point it resumed a role it had already played between 2001 and 2011, namely guaranteeing the survival of a minority government led by the center-right.In Britain, the Conservative Party\u2019s decision to try to outflank from the right the U.K. Independence Party, the populist radical-right party that under Nigel Farage (a big fan of Donald Trump) helped bring about Brexit \u2014 delivered it only a pyrrhic victory. True, the U.K.I.P.\u2019s vote share plummeted to just 2 percent in 2017 from 13 percent in 2015. But by alienating better-educated, more liberal voters, Mrs. May ended up losing her parliamentary majority. Since then, she has been forced to rely on the support of Northern Irish evangelicals to stay in power \u2014 and now, given the disagreements within her own party, even that might not be enough.Last year saw the Austrian People\u2019s Party, nominally Christian democrats, obliged to invite their radical competitors, the Freedom Party, into government for the second time. And the policy consequences are now becoming clear: The state has been empowered to seize cash and cellphones from asylum seekers and is planning to reduce welfare benefits to migrants who don\u2019t pass language tests and to ban girls under 10 from wearing head scarves. In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia finished this year\u2019s general election behind La Liga, whose leader, Matteo Salvini, is now the country\u2019s interior minister and the man responsible for Italy\u2019s recent refusal to allow boats carrying desperate asylum seekers to dock in its ports. The fourth and last approach is the most radical of all. Rather than trying to isolate, borrow from or govern together with a populist radical-right insurgency, a center-right party actually turns itself into one. This is effectively what has happened in Hungary, where Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz has over the past decade transmogrified from an apparently market-friendly mainstream party into an ultranationalist champion of closed borders and \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201dSo, trying to beat a radical right-wing populist insurgency by becoming one \u2014 or for that matter, by adopting its agenda and even inviting it into government \u2014 turns out to be a fool\u2019s errand. Just as important, it also has a huge ethical, as well as economic, cost. As the Bible puts it, \u201cFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d That\u2019s a question that Europe\u2019s center-right politicians (and maybe their Republican counterparts in the United States, too) seriously need to ask themselves, and soon.Advertisement"}

In that span of time, I had stepped inside two churches for three funerals, but as my mother and most faithful churchgoers will promptly make clear, simply stepping into the house of the Lord isn\u2019t the same thing as attending mass or truly engaging in praise and worship.Until an April morning in 2017, the closest I had come to church attendance was watching \u201cMary Mary,\u201d a reality series about that gospel duo, and inappropriately body-rolling to tracks of theirs like \u201cGod in Me.\u201d My other quasi-religious activities included posting social media updates about how the incredibly bad singing coming from the Baptist church across the street from my Harlem apartment was disrespectful to Jesus.I describe myself as a recovering Catholic, but when a more pointed question such as \u201cSo what do you believe in?\u201d surfaces, I don\u2019t know how to answer.As a child, I knew what to say, thanks to a religious-indoctrination diet of Bible-themed cartoons, saint-themed trading cards and required attendance at mass. As an adult, I still think Jesus seems like a swell fellow, but I feel out of step with most Christian churches. My talking points aren\u2019t what they used to be.In the midst of this cloudiness over my beliefs, I found my way to a church service on Easter Sunday. A friend invited me to First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem.For years, my mother had been encouraging me to go back to church. The most opportune times for her to push her agenda were whenever I felt my lowest. I liked my methods of coping better: Mary J. Blige albums and maybe another prescription for a generic form of Celexa.Since I grew up Catholic, a lot of traditions associated with the black church were much different from what I was used to. For example, I could wear jeans or slacks \u2014 either was acceptable at the Catholic churches in Houston that I attended. Outside of major holidays, I never had to dress to impress anyone there. I simply needed to be present. And in my experience, Catholics were big fans of brevity. A typical mass was no longer than an hour, and even on holidays like Easter and Christmas, it extended to no more than 90 minutes.On the other hand, my only recollection of attending a Baptist service as a child was being in church for what felt like an entire weekend. But what I remembered most about both church experiences \u2014 the overwhelming memory of hours spent in pews \u2014 was feeling the need to conform in order to be accepted by both the church and the God it purports to represent, to take the same-sex attractions I felt, bottle them up and pretend they didn\u2019t exist because the church said they were an affront to God\u2019s will.I got to First Corinthian before my friend did, and he found me in one of the lines to get in. There were two: one for regular parishioners, most of whom were black, and the other largely for white European tourists.It looked like segregation, except it was the remix in which black people had decidedly more power over the space. I would later find out that there were plenty of black tourists in the same line I was in, but the optics were striking all the same.Once I stepped inside the sprawling space, I marveled at its beauty. But the images that stuck with me most were of the people sitting inside. I saw a woman who I knew was married to another woman. Directly behind me was a gay man I knew. I ended up sitting between two gay men. All of them were regular churchgoers, yet none of them appeared torn about being there.Of course, there have always been gays, lesbians, bisexuals and trans people inside churches. Although their talent might be on display in, say, the choir, their sexuality was far less pronounced. As in, don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell, just sing your li\u2019l gay self off for God.And indeed, I did clock plenty of gays in the First Corinthian choir. But it felt different from what I was accustomed to. I knew what it was like to be around Christians who knew of my sexuality but who merely tolerated me. It reminds me of my mother, because while we love each other dearly, we have, uh, differences over what Jesus makes of that side of myself.In church that day, everyone seemed to be welcomed and behaved as such. In the front row, which was reserved for pastors of the church, I saw a sea of women. Women were typically marginalized out of leadership roles in the church. In Catholicism, no such roles even existed. But on that day in that church, there were more female pastors than male pastors.What I saw at First Corinthian in Harlem was the Christianity I wish I had seen as a child, as a teenager and as a young man trying to find a place in a world that appeared unwilling to offer one. This was the Jesus I had needed to see back then. In the past, I didn\u2019t think God would like me much unless I pretended to be someone else. In this church, I felt God knew who I was already and was just waiting for me to come to my senses about it.Months later, someone I went to catechism with at Saint Mark the Evangelist, the church I attended regularly as a child, got in touch with me on Facebook. She had watched an interview in which I described myself as a \u201crecovering Catholic.\u201dShe told me that I had her in tears. \u201cI had no idea you felt that way about being Catholic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt really hurt to hear you say you were recovering from it.\u201d She described the church as a big family, saying that we all had different opinions yet loved one another. And that the church we both grew up in was different now. That it was welcoming and that she could actually \u201csee and feel the love.\u201dUnfortunately, her telling me this story did not make me want to come back to the Catholic church or any church. All she did was remind me of what had kept me away for so long. It took me a long time to unlearn every damaging thing I\u2019ve seen and heard about my identity. I was in no rush to fall back into old habits.Still, for a brief moment on Easter Sunday 2017, 15 years after essentially abandoning Christianity in an act of self-preservation, I was able to experience religion the way I wish I always had.I do not know what my future with religion looks like. I don\u2019t see myself becoming saved by 40 \u2014 still a few years away, thank you \u2014 and releasing a trap gospel album soon after, but stranger things have happened. Whatever does happen, though, I know that with or without it, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll at least continue giving Jesus the courtesy of condemning anyone who can\u2019t sing for him in the correct key.Advertisement"}

I understand.)I\u2019ll be sharing five dishes with you, recipes for busy people who still want something good to eat. The goal is to give you options as you careen toward the weekend and make cooking plans for the week ahead. Sam will keep writing to you on Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.A question I get sometimes, because of my work, is whether I\u2019m a chef, or went to culinary school. I\u2019m not, and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just a passionate home cook, but one with access to intel from superb sources \u2014 my colleagues, the writers and editors behind NYT Cooking.Here are five dishes for the week:I like the mixture of lime, scallion, garlic and soy sauce in this Alison Roman recipe, a weeknight dish with a weekend vibe. Serve with simply cooked broccoli (or broccoli rabe) and rice to soak up the pan sauce. Make four extra cups of rice if you want to make the shrimp dish below.I find the combination of succulent shrimp and sweet bursts of summer corn utterly irresistible. This one-pot recipe could easily be a one-bowl meal; if you wanted to add more vegetables, toss peas into the pan when you add the corn. Plan ahead, because you\u2019ll need to start with cooked rice.This recipe relies on a delicious slow-cooked scallion sauce, though not so slow-cooked you couldn\u2019t make it on a weeknight. But next time I\u2019ll make it ahead and double the recipe \u2014 it keeps for weeks \u2014 so I can have these noodles several times, incorporating whatever vegetables are in the fridge (or leftover chicken from Recipe No. 1 above). The sauce is also excellent on tacos and fried or scrambled eggs.This Melissa Clark recipe, one of my favorites, begins with homemade garlic-anchovy butter, but I\u2019ve found that when I don\u2019t have time to let the butter soften, it\u2019s fine to skip Step 1 and add the plain butter, garlic and anchovies directly to the pan. Is this as outrageously good as Melissa intended? No. But the result is still pretty outrageous. Serve with a simple salad (kale is nice) and farro (great with that pan sauce).I love eggs for dinner, but those warm feelings don\u2019t extend to frittatas, which I find can be rubbery and dry. This one calls out to me, though \u2014 it\u2019s the potatoes in this gorgeous photo, a good idea, and the virtuous promise of more vegetables than you\u2019d typically find. You can make this with any vegetable, including leftovers, in about 30 minutes \u2014 and, as it happens, it would go brilliantly with that scallion sauce.Advertisement"}

(I think poor self-esteem prevents him from pursuing more reasonable partners.) When we try to speak with him about our concerns, he brushes us off. Should we try to support this relationship, or do the circumstances justify more extreme measures? (His fianc\u00e9e is just a few years older than my daughter!)ANONYMOUSI\u2019ve never met your father, so I won\u2019t opine on his self-esteem. Nor have I met his fianc\u00e9e \u2014 and have no idea what constitutes a \u201creasonable\u201d partner in your book. But I have seen loads of men marry women (or other men) who are young enough to be their children \u2014 particularly on their second or third trips down the aisle. I used to smirk and judge. But by now, I\u2019ve watched so many picture-postcard marriages crumble, and seen so many odd couples thrive, that I\u2019ve learned to hold my fire. Perhaps you should too.The gaping age gap, on its own, is not disqualifying, and you haven\u2019t raised any other objections. If a bride and groom are of sound mind and legally free to wed, other parties don\u2019t get a vote. They didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. In fact, your father blew it off. And I don\u2019t like the sound of \u201cextreme measures.\u201d (Are you planning on locking him up in the Tower of London?)Many folks think that money and power, or youth and need, are ugly bases for relationships. I disagree. It doesn\u2019t matter what catches our eye. In the end, marital success usually turns on hard work and mutual kindness. I get that a teenage stepmother is not your fantasy. But who knows? This may be a love for the ages (or a ridiculous error that your father is entitled to make).My 13-year-old godson, whom I love, often stays with us in the country.

It\u2019s heartbreaking yet hopeful (sort of), and I left the theater with a terrible stomachache. Teens these days deal with so much pressure!Talk with your godson about what he\u2019s going through. Ask about the pressure to post and curate, how he juggles it all and whether he ever gets tired. As a neutral adult, you may be a relief valve for him. You may even persuade him to lay down his phone occasionally. But I imagine it\u2019s not as simple as that anymore. For many kids, so-called real life is fused with their digital lives. It\u2019s the new normal. (And it looks tough.)My housemate and I are single and attending separate weddings where the brides have limited plus-one invitations to guests in serious, long-term relationships. This bothers us.

I have not received any thanks \u2014 written or verbal. This is part of a pattern. Should I let my grandson know I\u2019m upset?GRANDMOTHERIf your relationship with your grandson consists (mostly) of giving him gifts that he fails to acknowledge, I would stop sweating the thank-you notes and focus on creating a bond with him instead. Stop writing checks and start bribing him in more fulfilling ways, like taking him on an exciting trip or to a movie he wants to see. But if it\u2019s really just a thank-you note you want (and you\u2019re entitled to one), tell him that he\u2019s hurt your feelings, and there will be no additional gifts until he mends them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perils of the Trump Cult", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn wants to ride the president\u2019s coattails to the Senate. But will her plan backfire?Mr. Cavendish is the former editor of The Nashville Scene.NASHVILLE \u2014 Few candidates have lashed themselves to President Donald Trump quite like Tennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn, the Republican Party\u2019s choice to succeed Bob Corker in the Senate. Consider the scene at a rally in Nashville in May, where both candidate and president stood on stage together. And that\u2019s more or less where the Republican Party stands as well, lashed to an unpredictable president. It\u2019s true nationwide, but nowhere is this shift as clearly on display as in the South. There, home to a large chunk of his base, prospective candidates have little choice but to get on board or get out of politics. Even Mark Sanford, a conservative congressman from South Carolina who dared to voice the slightest occasional criticism of the president, was beaten in a primary by a candidate who promised absolute loyalty to Mr. Trump.So it\u2019s easy to understand Ms. Blackburn\u2019s fealty. But that fealty comes with a price. And if her experience so far is any guide, it will be a growing problem for Republican candidates who allow the president\u2019s ad hoc, often extreme agenda to box them in, cutting off not just independents and moderates but even a chunk of conservatives \u2014 even here in the South.Senator Corker, whose seat Ms. Blackburn would like to fill, called the Trump-era Republican Party \u201ccultish.\u201d Ms. Blackburn is firmly in the cult. She was one of 15 House Republicans who signed a letter nominating Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize before he ever met with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a move that seems premature in the wake of the duo\u2019s Singapore meeting. She was an early primary supporter of Mr. Trump in 2016, and even floated herself as a vice-presidential option.But as with any cult, membership may bring praise from the leader, but it will also create awkward situations when dealing with the outside world. When Mr. Trump announced tariffs on steel, the state\u2019s auto industry braced for the impact. Mr. Corker and Lamar Alexander, the state\u2019s senior senator, were quick to denounce the move, but Ms. Blackburn could only waffle, saying she was \u201cwaiting to see\u201d the plan. Tennessee\u2019s automakers and suppliers are a potent force in the state economy, responsible for 135,000 jobs and 830,000 vehicles in 2016. If tariffs start to dig into their profits, they won\u2019t stay silent \u2014 and Ms. Blackburn, as the local voice of the Trumpist Republican Party, will bear the brunt of their criticism.A week after the tariff announcement, the news blew up around the Trump administration\u2019s policy of child separation for undocumented immigrants. Mr. Corker slammed the change in direction from the Obama and Bush years, saying that children \u201cshould be protected and not used for deterrence.\u201d But Ms. Blackburn followed the president\u2019s line that Democrats were to blame. \u201cWe are in this position because liberals would not pay to enforce our immigration laws,\u201d she said. It was only days later, after the president himself indicated he might change the policy, that Ms. Blackburn said the process had to end.Just one day later, a government report calling for the sale of government assets, including Tennessee Valley Authority transmission lines \u2014 considered sacrosanct by Tennessee voters \u2014 forced Ms. Blackburn to attempt to distance herself from the president yet again. But few people are buying it: A candidate who has promised to do everything to implement the president\u2019s agenda is not very convincing when she tries to walk away from the specifics.Obviously, there are a lot of voters who will support Ms. Blackburn as long as she supports the president \u2014 he won Tennessee by 26 points. But for the rest, Ms. Blackburn is creating a huge opening for her Democratic opponent, former Governor Phil Bredesen, to not just capture the center but to also peel away a few conservatives by positioning himself as the real defender of the state\u2019s interests. \u201cWhat these tariffs amount to are attacks on Tennessee,\u201d he said, adding that it would \u201ccertainly kill jobs.\u201d The state is also home to a large distilling industry, including the Jack Daniel\u2019s distillery, whose parent company\u2019s stock dropped 8 percent after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey. Ms. Blackburn retreated, while Mr. Bredesen prepared ads with whiskey barrels in the background.This is the dance that many Republicans must do in 2018: Sidestep the specifics of Trumpism, but embrace Trump. And in that tension, many Democrats may have a road map for success in deeply red areas, especially if they can put up popular centrist candidates like Mr. Bredesen. Already, 69 percent of the state\u2019s independents have a favorable view of Mr. Bredesen, compared with just 44 percent for Ms. Blackburn. Of course, Ms. Blackburn has some built-in advantages: In Tennessee, 42 percent identify as Republican here versus just 29 percent as Democrat. To win, Democrats need to run less as party stalwarts than as the independently minded alternative to lock-step Trumpism.Also unlike many national Democrats, he has not demonized the president. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States and if he has an idea and is pushing some things that I think are good for the people of Tennessee, I\u2019m going be for it. It doesn\u2019t matter where it came from,\u201d Mr. Bredesen says in a TV ad that has run on heavy rotation in the state since March. \u201cAnd likewise, if I think it\u2019s not going to be good for Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be against it. I think that\u2019s what senators ought to do.\u201dIt\u2019s a message that even Trump supporters might find appealing \u2014 independent, pragmatic thinking that conveniently allows Mr. Bredesen to pivot between criticism and agreement with the White House, a flexibility that Ms. Blackburn and other Trumpist candidates have denied themselves. If more Democrats can make that distinction, particularly in the South, they might manage to make the South a little less red this fall.Steve Cavendish, a freelance journalist in Nashville, is the former editor of The Washington City Paper and The Nashville Scene.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s time for the Macron government to bring long-awaited economic opportunity to those neighborhoods.Contributing Opinion Writer \u201cI think allowing millions and millions of people to come to Europe is very, very sad,\u201d President Trump said during his current good-will tour of the Continent. \u201cI think you are losing your culture.\u201dMr. Trump, meet Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the 19-year-old breakout star of France\u2019s newly crowned World Cup soccer champions. The son of an Algerian mother and Cameroonian father, Mbapp\u00e9 is emblematic of a team of immigrants \u2014 16 of its 23 players are from families recently arrived in France. They\u2019ve just made an entire nation very, very glad of its diversity \u2014 at least for one day.Brazilians, Argentines, Italians and Germans may object, but France can now lay claim to being master of the beautiful game. Over the past 20 years, France has won two of the quadrennial World Cups and placed second in a third. France\u2019s soccer success is global in another way. Under the rules of FIFA, international soccer\u2019s governing group, players can suit up for countries where their parents or grandparents were born, even if they were not. Some 50 French-born players took part in this year\u2019s World Cup. More than half wore another country\u2019s jersey. Brazil, the next-biggest feeder country, provided 28 participants, including five to other teams. Over the past four World Cups, France has contributed more native-born players than any other country.First, in the decades after World War II, the French government recruited successive waves of immigrants \u2014 first from Southern and Eastern Europe and North Africa, later from West Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean \u2014 to rebuild the country and then meet a labor shortage. By the 1970s, France had taken in more immigrants \u2014 some 2.7 million \u2014 than any other European country. Most settled in the mostly nonwhite, working-class suburbs \u2014 \u201cles banlieues\u201d \u2014 that ring its major cities.Second, after a long postwar period of soccer failure, France established a national academy in the early 1970s to identify, recruit and train local youth. It put a special emphasis on hardscrabble immigrant areas around Paris, where nearly 40 percent of new arrivals take root \u2014 and where almost one-third of the members of this year\u2019s world championship team were born, including Mbapp\u00e9.In the hours after Team France\u2019s victory in Russia, an iconic photograph of President Emmanuel Macron of France cheering on the team circled the globe \u2014 a powerful image of youth, vigor and success. Mr. Macron will probably get an immediate and welcome bounce in public opinion polls, where he has taken a beating after ramming unpopular but necessary labor and tax reforms through parliament. The larger test for Mr. Macron is whether he can do for the banlieues what the banlieues have done for French soccer. It\u2019s a start.

{"Headline": "What Elon Musk Should Learn From the Thailand Cave Rescue", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Tufekci is a professor who\u00a0writes about the social\u00a0impact of technology.Silicon Valley moguls seem to believe they can fix most anything, and they appear befuddled when their attempts to do so aren\u2019t met with unbridled enthusiasm.He directed his engineers to build a miniature \u201csubmarine\u201d (basically a sophisticated metal cylinder) that he hoped could be used for the rescue. He shared videos of the submarine with his 22 million followers on Twitter. And he received widespread media coverage and encouragement from his many fans.Instead of venting, Mr. Musk \u2014 indeed, Silicon Valley as a whole \u2014 can perhaps see the Thai operation as a lesson. This was a most improbable rescue against the longest odds. Safely navigating 12 kids and one adult, many of whom were not swimmers, through a dangerous cave relied on a model of innovation that Silicon Valley can and should learn from.The Silicon Valley model for doing things is a mix of can-do optimism, a faith that expertise in one domain can be transferred seamlessly to another and a preference for rapid, flashy, high-profile action. But what got the kids and their coach out of the cave was a different model: a slower, more methodical, more narrowly specialized approach to problems, one that has turned many risky enterprises into safe endeavors \u2014 commercial airline travel, for example, or rock climbing, both of which have extensive protocols and safety procedures that have taken years to develop.This \u201csafety culture\u201d model is neither stilted nor uncreative. On the contrary, deep expertise, lengthy training and the ability to learn from experience (and to incorporate the lessons of those experiences into future practices) is a valuable form of ingenuity.This approach is what allowed the airline captain Chesley Sullenberger to safely land a commercial airplane on the Hudson River in 2009 after its engines were disabled. Captain Sullenberger\u2019s skill and composure were, of course, a credit to him personally. But they also rested on decades of training and learning in an industry that had been government-regulated and self-regulated to such a degree that hurling through the atmosphere in giant metal cans at 35,000 feet is now one of the safest ways to travel.By contrast, Silicon Valley moguls seem to favor spending money on improbable but impressive-sounding long shots. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, donated $100 million to New Jersey schools as part of a multiyear plan to improve them. The centerpiece of the plan was teacher evaluation and charter schools, but it didn\u2019t work well. Some aspects of the plan even made things worse. Education is a complex topic, and making a lot of money in tech is not a qualification for solving educational problems.Silicon Valley also tends to ignore problems in its own house. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has declared that space exploration is one of the main things he should spend his money on. But poorly paid workers in Amazon warehouses, who work under grueling conditions, may have other ideas about how Mr. Bezos might best spend his money.In the case of Mr. Musk and his submarine, the Thai authorities understood that they needed to let the expert cave divers plan and direct the rescue operation (and Mr. Musk, to his credit, said he would take the lead from the divers). But the kind of publicity Mr. Musk created can take on a life of its own and exert undue influence.I don\u2019t mean to dismiss the role of technological innovation. Maybe in the future, some version of Mr. Musk\u2019s contraption could be useful. But that would require long-term development, testing and collaboration with a variety of experts \u2014 not just a handful of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers.If Silicon Valley wants to help the world, there is a lot it can do, starting with making its own products safer and its own companies more just. Perhaps most important, it can develop respect for hard-earned expertise in areas other than its own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Sale: Survey Data on Millions of High School Students", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOWELL, Mass. \u2014 Three thousand high school students from across the United States recently trekked to a university sports arena here to attend an event with an impressive-sounding name: the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders. Many of their parents had spent $985 on tuition.Months earlier, the teenagers had received letters, signed by a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, congratulating them on being nominated for \u201ca highly selective national program honoring academically superior high school students.\u201dThe students all had good grades. But many of them were selected for the event because they had once filled out surveys that they believed would help them learn about colleges and college scholarships.Through their schools, many students in the audience had taken a college-planning questionnaire, called MyCollegeOptions. Others had taken surveys that came with the SAT or the PSAT, tests administered by the College Board. In filling out those surveys, the teenagers ended up signing away personal details that were later sold and shared with the future scientists event.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I sought out filling in my information for the College Board to sell to other companies,\u201d said Adriana Bay, 19, a sophomore at Vanderbilt University this fall who was solicited by the future scientists event when she was in high school. \u201cYou are giving them the liberty to profit off your information.\u201dThese marketing programs are generally legal, taking advantage of the fact that there is no federal law regulating consumer data brokers. They also face little oversight because federal education privacy laws make public schools, and not their vendors, directly responsible for controlling the spread of student data.But the handling of student surveys is receiving heightened scrutiny, particularly in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that siphoned off the data of Facebook users who took a personality questionnaire.For high school students who want to receive materials from colleges and scholarship organizations, nonprofit college admissions testing services, like ACT and the College Board, offer optional surveys. Many colleges, universities and scholarship organizations buy such survey data to pinpoint prospective students.As marketing materials on the ACT site put it: Purchasing the names of \u201cracial and ethnic minorities is a great way to increase diversity at your campus.\u201d Other survey services, however, sell students\u2019 personal information far beyond colleges.Scholarships.com did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cI find all of this really troubling,\u201d said Marianne Stephens, the college counselor at Shorewood High School, a public school in Shoreline, Wash. After students there received mailings from a slew of leadership events, Ms. Stephens posted a \u201cSham Alert\u201d on her school\u2019s website describing many student recognition programs as \u201cessentially well-packaged marketing schemes.\u201d The alert also said students could opt out of college surveys that share their information.\u201cStudents and families don\u2019t realize that the data may come back to them as misleading marketing,\u201d she said.Richard Rossi, executive director of the National Leadership Academies, the company behind the future scientists event, said the program accurately described itself as selective because it accepted only students with at least a 3.5 grade point average.\u201cDoes that make it less appropriate to tell them they are special?\u201d Mr. Rossi asked. \u201cIn my mind, no.\u201d\u201cI felt excited to hear words from people who were successful in science to inspire me,\u201d said Sebastian Gonzalez, a high school junior interested in engineering who came to the event with his parents from Northern California.But critics say survey services may categorize students in ways that could expose them to predatory marketing or exclude them from important opportunities.Paul Weeks, ACT\u2019s senior vice president for client relations, said his organization allowed only colleges, universities and scholarship organizations to use its database, which includes details like students\u2019 family income, religious affiliation and test score range. ACT also prohibits clients from sharing students\u2019 data with third parties, he said.He added that the National Leadership Academies requested and was denied access to student data in January.Last week, ACT acquired the company that owns MyCollegeOptions, one of the services that shared information with the future science leaders event. Ed Colby, a spokesman for ACT, said his organization would \u201ccontinue to abide by the highest standards of data privacy.\u201d (Until June, The New York Times had a contract with MyCollegeOptions to distribute codes for free trial subscriptions. The Times did not receive information about students.)But the College Board allows universities to share students\u2019 data with certain educational partners, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board. And one of those universities disclosed students\u2019 survey data to the for-profit National Leadership Academies.In a follow-up email, Mr. Goldberg said his organization \u201cwas troubled\u201d by the inquiry from The New York Times and was suspending the university that shared students\u2019 data while it conducted an investigation. He added that the College Board had previously terminated accounts when users violated its policies.Mr. Rossi, the National Leadership Academies\u2019 executive director, said his company planned to be more transparent about how it selected students.\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift, and people now need to know, deserve to know: \u2018Where does this all come from?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201c\u2018How did you get my name?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sri Lankan Lawmakers Target Reporters in Times Investigation", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday night, the lawmakers, who are allies of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, held a televised news conference in which they claimed that the journalists, Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan, were working on behalf of the current government to malign Mr. Rajapaksa. One lawmaker displayed a close-up photo of Ms. Bastians\u2019s face for the cameras.The news conference came after a days-long campaign on social media to discredit the journalists, who provided logistical help for the article, and to attack their families.The campaign on Twitter and Facebook received the support of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s family, including his son Namal Rajapaksa, a member of Parliament, who reposted claims that Ms. Bastians and the main author of the ports investigation, the Times correspondent Maria Abi-Habib, had been paid to write the piece by Sri Lanka\u2019s current government.Michael Slackman, the international editor for The Times, called those claims false. In a statement, he said the Times article was rigorously reported and accurate, and criticized the lawmakers\u2019 news conference.\u201cIt is unacceptable for journalists to be intimidated in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThis action appears intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms, and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe Times expects the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the safety of journalists working for our \u2014 or any \u2014 news organization.\u201dThe Times article was published on June 26. It detailed how Mr. Rajapaksa had taken on more than $1 billion in loans from China\u2019s government to build a seaport in his hometown of Hambantota, southern Sri Lanka, despite feasibility studies that concluded the project was not economically viable.The article also cited an ongoing government investigation into payments from China Harbor Engineering Co., a major, Chinese state-owned enterprise, to aides in Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s campaign before the 2015 elections. China Harbor built the Hambantota port.Unable to pay off the debt, Sri Lanka\u2019s current government handed over Hambantota port last year to China Merchants Port in a 99-year lease. China Merchants is another large, state-owned Chinese company.Sri Lanka is one of the most dangerous places for journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. During Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s 10-year presidency, journalists were routinely beaten and jailed, and 11 reporters were killed, their murders remaining unsolved to this day.When Sri Lanka\u2019s new government came to power, it promised more press freedoms, but physical attacks have continued, although none have resulted in death.\u201cThis naming and attempt to shame publicly these two Sri Lankan journalists is most alarming and worrying, because it is being done by the same people who did it earlier while they were in power,\u201d said Lakshman Gunasekera, president of the Sri Lankan chapter of the South Asia Free Media Association. \u201cDuring their regime, we journalists lived through a time where such direct naming and targeting of journalists could end with physical attacks, grenades thrown at houses and disappearances and killings, assassinations.\u201dBefore the article was published in The Times, Mr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests to comment on the article, including detailed lists of questions and assertions made by other officials.Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s letter denied the article\u2019s assertions that feasibility studies conducted during his presidency had concluded that Hambantota port was not economically viable.The Chinese Embassy in Colombo responded to the article over the weekend, claiming it was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with facts and calling it prejudiced.

I am not good at going up to someone in a bar, but online I\u2019m like a prowler.\u201dMr. Santos was surprised to discover that both he and Mr. Matsubara were from the Hawaiian island of Oahu and were now living in Manhattan. He wrote Mr. Matsubara a Facebook message, asking if he wanted to meet for coffee. Mr. Matsubara responded, \u201cI don\u2019t do coffee, I do drinks.\u201dEven though the two had many things in common, there was a strong chance they might not get along.For starters, they attended rival high schools. Mr. Santos, 30, who is the founder and chief executive of Homepolish, an interior design start-up, went to the academically oriented Iolani. He carried so many books, he needed a rolling backpack to prevent injury to his back. Mr. Santos was elected senior class president after promising to get cushions for the concrete benches in the library.Mr. Matsubara, 33, who is a vice president and style director at Nike Communications and handles accounts for high-profile clients like Moet Champagne and Bombay Sapphire gin, attended Punahou. The school had two famous alumni: former President Barack Obama and Steve Case, the former chief executive of AOL. Mr. Matsubara was a member of the varsity kayak team. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the best grades,\u201d he said. \u201cI threw the parties.\u201dEven their families were different. Mr. Santos, whose father is Portuguese, grew up in a large compound on the coast. His great-grandparents, grandparents, aunts and uncles all lived on the land along with hundreds of chickens, dogs and chameleons. As a child, he was often barefoot, roasting pigs on the beach for dinner.Mr. Matsubara, who is Japanese-American, grew up in Honolulu in a more formal household. His father is a prominent lawyer who owns his firm. \u201cHe\u2019s very esteemed,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say he\u2019s much more accustomed to formal wear.\u201dStill, on their first date, in November 2010 at the Rusty Knot, a nautical-themed bar in the West Village of Manhattan, they stayed until closing. Two days later they meandered down Fifth Avenue to take in the holiday lights. Within a month they were using the term \u201cboyfriend\u201d; shortly after, they said, \u201cI love you.\u201dMr. Matsubara was so taken with his new beau that he told his parents about him over Christmas, a huge feat considering he hadn\u2019t even revealed he was gay. \u201cI was watching, \u2018It\u2019s Complicated\u2019 with Meryl Streep and Steve Martin with my mom, and I was texting on the couch,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she asked who I kept texting, I said, \u2018It\u2019s my boyfriend.\u2019\u201dOn their next trip home to Hawaii they brought their parents together. Despite the personality differences, they stayed up until the early hours of the morning drinking sake, eating dinner and sharing stories. The two men were amazed by how well their families got along; they attribute it to the fact that both families had been in Hawaii for more than four generations.Now, even when their sons aren\u2019t visiting, their parents drive more than an hour to each other to drop off gifts of knitted items or avocados and papayas.Mr. Santos proposed in Paris over Memorial Day weekend in 2016. He had told his boyfriend that they were there on a work trip and shocked him when he knelt down in front of a Dior flagship, Mr. Matsubara\u2019s favorite store, with three rings: two from Tiffany and one from Cartier. What he said summed up their relationship: \u201cWithout you I am like a coloring book with no color. I am the structure, but you are the color.\u201dMr. Matsubara\u2019s mother, Arlene Matsubara, said the couple complements each other, with Mr. Santos being the focused, responsible one and her son being the playful, social counterpart. She remembered early in their relationship when her son was eating a slice of papaya and announced he was done before it was all gone. Mr. Santos made him finish it. It was a strong example of \u201cmottainai,\u201d a belief with Japanese roots that you should not waste. \u201cIt just hit me in my heart,\u201d Ms. Matsubara said.The couple spent a year planning the wedding of their dreams.

(\u201cShe was six months pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe epitome of beauty.\u201d)The reception was inspired by the 1998 movie \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d starring Gwyneth Paltrow. The couple even encouraged female guests to wear green so the party would look like the green shades in the movie. \u201cThey all had their gowns approved by Ross,\u201d Mr. Santos said, laughing. \u201cI think they were scared of him.\u201dThere were also local touches. For the welcome cocktail party, Mr. Santos\u2019s father, Alvin Santos, marinated nine pounds of pork brought over on the 40-minute flight from Oahu. Ms. Matsubara and a friend made 90 floral bracelets for guests featuring a rare green flower from the ohia lehua tree. Two of the couple\u2019s friends also performed a traditional Hawaiian hula dance, called Ka Uluwehi O Ke Kai, which is often danced at parties.For these newlyweds, Hawaii is not only their home, but also the place they feel most safe and loved. \u201cThe nice part about being from Hawaii is it means we can do anything in life,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that will happen?

The decision to remove posts is at the company\u2019s discretion, the court said.The role of moderating speech on online platforms has become a hotly contested topic, as the reach and influence of companies like Facebook and Google have grown. But the companies have long argued that the companies are not liable for posts published by others on their platform.The case concerned a San Francisco lawyer, Dawn Hassell, who had accused a client of posting defamatory statements against her on Yelp. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled that the posts were defamatory and instructed the client and Yelp to take them down.The order was upheld by both a second judge and a state appeals court.Yelp argued that the lower court decisions could provide a legal pathway for businesses seeking to have negative posts removed. The company also referred to the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 federal law that protects internet companies from liability for third party users\u2019 posts.The act, the ruling said, is meant \u201cto promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material.\u201dHowever, opponents argued that this free speech approach could prevent victims of online abuse from seeking a legal remedy.Ms. Hassell\u2019s lawyer, Monique Olivier, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cstands as an invitation to spread falsehoods on the internet without consequence\u201d and that Ms. Hassell was considering an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.Dissenting justices argued that because Yelp was inviting its users to post and read reviews, the company could be held complicit in users\u2019 refusal to remove posts.\u201cThe internet has the potential not only to enlighten but to spread lies, amplifying defamatory communications to an extent unmatched in our history,\u201d Justice Mariano-Florentino Cu\u00e9llar wrote.Aaron Schur, a lawyer for Yelp, said that the company examined the reviews about Ms. Hassell\u2019s business and did not find them to be libelous.\u201cAlso at risk are the separate speech rights of individuals that use online resources,\u201d Mr. Schur said, \u201csuch as those that post comments on news articles or consumers who choose to describe their business experiences online, which may be squelched through manipulations of our judicial system.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a lower court action in the case brought by Dawn Hassell. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ordered one of Ms. Hassell\u2019s clients and Yelp to remove a post from the site. The judge did not issue a second order asking Yelp to remove the post.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Door-Knocking Democrat Tries to Break G.O.P. Grip in Ohio Special Election", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ALBANY, Ohio \u2014 There was a pitiable chance of success when Danny O\u2019Connor knocked on Tami Halliday\u2019s door Thursday morning to ask for her vote. All the data showed that Mr. O\u2019Connor, a Democrat running in an August special election for a House seat here, was all but wasting his time.But when Ms. Halliday asked him his stance on gun control, things got brighter fast. Mr. O\u2019Connor said he favored an assault weapons ban, along with preventing people with domestic violence records and mental illness issues from having guns. \u201cDo you take money from the N.R.A.?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor replied. \u201cI have an \u2018F\u2019 rating from the N.R.A.\u201dWith that, Ms. Halliday, who voted for President Trump in 2016, said she would vote for Mr. O\u2019Connor.The special election in a region that stretches from the affluent suburbs of Columbus to the Appalachian foothills east of Zanesville could be the next big test of the vaunted \u201cblue wave\u201d brewing for November. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race a tossup.But Mr. O\u2019Connor, 31, will need hundreds, if not thousands, of Tami Hallidays to win on Aug. 7 in a district that has not elected a Democrat since 1980. Republicans are confident that they can blunt the Democrats\u2019 momentum and dampen liberal energy with a win here.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the race is a microcosm of what is going on in the country, but it\u2019s probably close,\u201d said Gary Walters, the clerk of courts in Licking County, who backs Mr. Balderson. \u201cYou have a big-city Democrat opposing a small-town rural conservative.\u201dWhat does he like about Mr. Balderson? \u201cHe\u2019s a Republican,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s enough here for me.\u201dAt a breakfast forum on Thursday at the New Albany Country Club, with its high ceilings and portraiture of dogs and horses, the candidates engaged in civil debate and essentially staked out orthodox positions of their parties. Mr. Balderson, who strongly supports Mr. Trump, tried nonetheless to distance himself from the president\u2019s policies on trade, which he said would hurt the region\u2019s farmers, and on separating migrant children from their families at the border.\u201cI don\u2019t support family separation,\u201d Mr. Balderson said. \u201cThat was not right. That was not the way this country was made.\u201d He does support the president\u2019s push for a border wall and highlights his \u201cA\u201d rating from the N.R.A.\u201cBy all accounts, both O\u2019Connor and Balderson are decent, successful men who would work hard for voters of the 12th District,\u201d The Dispatch wrote. \u201cBut one supports a reasonable, thoughtful approach to addressing the important issues facing Congress and our country, and the other supports a president who uses tactics and pushes policies that this Editorial Board has denounced.\u201dWhile limited public polling shows Mr. Balderson with a lead in the race, Mr. O\u2019Connor said he was encouraged by early voting numbers, in which he has an edge in traditional Republican areas, and by energy shown from progressive groups. The race is also in flux because turnout in any special election is difficult to forecast, and this one falls during summer vacation season.Mr. Balderson, who declined a request for an interview, has tried to paint Mr. O\u2019Connor as a far-left liberal who would simply do the bidding of the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi, if elected. Mr. O\u2019Connor said he was puzzled by those attacks because he has vowed not to vote for Ms. Pelosi to lead House Democrats if he is sent to Washington.Mr. O\u2019Connor said the party needed a \u201cnew generation of leadership.\u201d In Washington, he said, \u201cwe see a great debate society that is not focused on taking on the challenges of the 21st century.\u201dThat is a message that resonated with Mindy Hedges, who supports Mr. O\u2019Connor.\u201cWe absolutely need a change,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI am hopeful that this district is ready for a change as well.\u201dAfter the forum, Mr. O\u2019Connor changed from his gray suit, white shirt and maroon tie into a red Ohio State polo shirt, khaki shorts and running shoes to knock on doors in New Albany, a rarefied suburb with a median household income of more than $190,000. (In Zanesville, Mr. Balderson\u2019s hometown, the median income is $26,000.)The New Albany area, with its affluence and concentration of college-educated voters, represents the kind of area where Democrats must do well in the midterm elections if they are to recapture the House. The suburbs north of Columbus are pulsating with growth and prosperity.Door-knocking, on one level, is an inherently inefficient way to campaign. But the way Mr. O\u2019Connor assessed it, if he had won over Ms. Halliday, who said her views on gun control stemmed from her desire to protect her two daughters, then she may well talk to her friends and post something on Facebook \u2014 and, if he is fortunate, he will have 10 new votes instead of one.Phil Jones voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016. An executive at Nationwide Insurance, he told Mr. O\u2019Connor that the most important issues for him were the national debt and overhauling immigration laws. Mr. Jones said he did not care for Mr. Trump\u2019s manners, but he did like the president\u2019s tax plan because his company gave workers a bonus and increased its 401(k) contribution.Mr. Jones said he wanted someone who was willing to be bipartisan, then said to Mr. O\u2019Connor, \u201cI think that\u2019s one of your pitches in your commercials.\u201d\u201cIf you are willing to do what you say in your commercials then you absolutely have my vote,\u201d he promised.Mr. O\u2019Connor, who rarely misses a chance to tell voters that he is engaged to a Republican, readily said he would.After a couple more stops to meet with supporters, Mr. O\u2019Connor drove an hour east to Zanesville, Mr. Balderson\u2019s hometown and a strongly Republican area. Mr. O\u2019Connor went there to meet with a few retired mine workers for a beer.They did not show up.Advertisement"}

The 2016 lecture, focusing on the need for coral ecological restoration, resonated so deeply that it prompted Mr. Rosenfeld, a veteran underwater photographer, and Ms. Valois, a journalist in France, to spend the next two years exploring the problems facing these endangered marine colonies. Reefs are diverse ecosystems formed by the calcium secretions of coral clusters. These vast structures provide shelter and food for a huge variety of species, including crustaceans and fish mollusks.\u201cThe main idea is to discover an incredible biodiversity and show that it is threatened,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said by email. \u201cIt is also to present all the services provided by the reefs in term of coast protection, food resources, nursery for a huge part of the marine species.\u201d The photographs are as striking as they are troubling in showing the problems faced by various coral ecosystems.

Paraguay has eliminated malaria, the first country in the Americas to do so in almost 50 years, according to the World Health Organization.But worldwide, momentum against the disease has stalled. Malaria cases increased by five million between 2015 and 2016, climbing to 216 million from 211 million. \u201cThis is one of the diseases that hangs on tight,\u201d said Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, which finances major anti-malaria efforts in the Americas.\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep the pedal to the metal \u2014 stay intensely focused on the issue \u2014 malaria is going to make its return.\u201dMalaria, a blood disease contracted through the bite of an infected mosquito, kills about 445,000 people each year, mostly children, according to the W.H.O. Yet cost-effective prevention tools and treatments are well known.W.H.O. officials also expect to certify Argentina as malaria-free later this year, according to Dr. Marcos A. Espinal, director of the communicable diseases department at the Pan American Health Organization.But throughout the region, other countries are backsliding. Panama, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela each reported more malaria infections in 2016 than in 2010. Cases in Colombia doubled from 2015 to 2016.Officials say the chief hurdle is complacency: In many countries, domestic resources have shifted from anti-malaria efforts to other priorities as case numbers have dwindled. \u201cPolitical will is the single most important aspect for eliminating malaria,\u201d Dr. Espinal said. \u201cWe have effective tools: bed nets, vector control methods, treatments. We get to a certain point \u2014 we see the end of the tunnel \u2014 and then we risk losing the commitment.\u201d\u201cUntil there is a government in Venezuela willing to do something about it, it\u2019s hard to do anything but wait,\u201d said Mr. Moreno, who serves on the End Malaria Council, a response coordination team headed by Bill Gates. \u201cMosquitoes don\u2019t respect borders,\u201d Mr. Moreno added.In recent years, the fight against malaria in Central America has grown more complex. Lingering cases are concentrated in rural areas, where communities lack immediate access to health care and transmission is challenging to detect and disrupt.A top priority is controlling the insect itself. Environmental health workers minimize mosquito populations by coating the walls of vulnerable schools and homes with insecticide, a technique called indoor residual spraying. They also drain water in which mosquitoes might breed, such as muggy ponds, hollow cinder blocks and littered bottle caps.But as long as mosquitoes exist, even countries that eliminate malaria remain at risk for its resurgence. Paraguay, like any other mosquito-friendly country, will need to maintain a thorough surveillance system.\u201cIt is a much better economic investment to prevent a disease than to combat it at full force,\u201d Mr. Moreno said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is eliminate malaria and then have it come back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and the Return of Divine Right", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn deploying his pardon power freely and using the Bible to justify family separation, the president is exactly the sort of ruler that Enlightenment thinkers feared.Mr. Armitage is a professor of history at Harvard.CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 The heartbreaking scenes on the southern border seem a world away from recent presidential pardons. Sobbing children and bereft parents have nothing in common with Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and, most recently, the Oregon ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven, who had been convicted of arson in 2016 and whom President Trump pardoned on Tuesday. Yet both come down to a relationship between justice and mercy that has a long history \u2014 and a cautionary moral for the president. Family separation shows justice without mercy. The pardon power displays mercy in the name of justice. The administration cites the biblical injunction to obey the powers that be as one explanation for its zero-tolerance policy on immigration. With regard to immigration, it seems, there can be no discretion. By contrast, presidential pardons show how extensive discretion can be, because the Constitution gives the president \u201cpower to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in case of impeachment.\u201dMost Enlightenment thinkers were uneasy about the pardoning power. The two greatest oracles for the Constitution\u2019s framers, the French philosopher Montesquieu and the English lawyer William Blackstone, both attacked it. \u201cClemency is the characteristic of monarchs,\u201d wrote Montesquieu, who thought it inappropriate in republics. Blackstone was adamant. \u201cIn democracies,\u201d he thundered, \u201cthis power of pardon can never subsist.\u201d Contemporary reformers like Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham were just as skeptical about pardons. So was Immanuel Kant, for whom it was one of the slipperiest rights of the sovereign, a majestic encouragement to injustice.Eighteenth-century Europeans didn\u2019t have to look far to find examples to prove their case. At his trial for treason in 1649, King Charles I of England had denied the authority of the court set up by Parliament on the grounds that \u201cno earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent.\u201d Yet the court insisted on its authority to try him and he was convicted of \u201ca wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will.\u201d In the later 17th century, Parliament proceeded to crimp the royal prerogative until little residue of an absolute monarch\u2019s godlike capacity remained in the hands of George III. In this sense the American Constitution actually pushed back against Europe\u2019s anti-monarchical movement. The framers argued that \u201cwithout an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel,\u201d as Alexander Hamilton argued in Federalist 74. This was particularly true in \u201cseason of insurrection or rebellion,\u201d Hamilton continued, \u201cwhen a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth.\u201d With the ratification of the Constitution, George Washington received an array of powers many European monarchs might have envied. The president could veto legislation \u2014 something no British monarch had done since 1707. He was commander in chief of the armed forces; 1743 was the last time a British king had led an army, at the Battle of Dettingen. And after 1789, the French revolutionaries abolished the pardoning power that America\u2019s elective monarch now retained. Washington wielded his pardon power for the first time to reprieve insurgents in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795, \u201cto mingle in the operations of government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.\u201d Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson later pardoned rebels during and after the Civil War. In this way, mercy tempered justice, to justify importing kingly clemency into the republic.\u201cA pardon is an act of grace,\u201d opined Chief Justice John Marshall in 1833. His view held for a century until the Supreme Court overturned this view to argue, in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., that a \u201cpardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power,\u201d but is \u201ca part of the constitutional scheme.\u201d The pardoning power may have been established by the Constitution but it is now exercised by the president at his own discretion. The ability to absolve an individual of a legally mandated punishment remains a semi-divine power cloaked in constitutional dress.Despite suggestions at the Constitutional Convention that Congress should share in the determination of pardons, the proposal did not fly. The pardoning power is absolute and unmitigated.With his legislative agenda foundering, President Trump has had to find other means to express his will. He has used the pardoning power as one of his few unfettered prerogatives, in just the undemocratic way Enlightenment thinkers feared. For them, authority flowed from the people, not from God; the pardon was a residue of divine right. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions cites Paul\u2019s epistle to the Romans to justify family separation, he not only revives an argument used to defend absolutism and slavery but also implies there is still a power above the law defined by the Constitution. There is a tension here, as well. The president\u2019s and Mr. Sessions\u2019s claim to be bound by law to tear children apart from their parents is a lie. Not only is that a lie \u2014 the president has broad powers to set administrative policy \u2014 it is also hypocritical. The president can casually exercise his discretionary power to pardon Mr. Arpaio, who abused prisoners in his care, but then claims he is powerless to end a policy worthy of Sheriff Joe himself. As Hamilton might have said, that is not justice. It is sanguinary and cruel. Fortunately, the founders did not leave the people powerless. Impeachable offenses \u2014 high crimes and misdemeanors, carried out in the exercise of official duties \u2014 are literally unpardonable. King Charles lost his head for claiming a divine prerogative; a president can lose only his job. No one is above the law, not even the wielder of the pardoning power himself. King Donald should beware.Advertisement"}

What Have We Learned?", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s reflect on the fun, the controversies and the politics.Mr. Okwonga is a writer, poet and football fanatic. He has published two books on the sport.Here we are. The final match of the 2018 World Cup has almost arrived, and it has been as thrilling a tournament as I can remember. As Maximus, Russell Crowe\u2019s character in \u201cGladiator,\u201d famously yelled, \u201cAre you not entertained?\u201d Over the past four weeks, 32 teams from across the globe have come to Russia to play their hardest and to try their luck. One by one they have all gone home, often in heartbreak. There have been some shocking results, for sure. Germany didn\u2019t even make it out of the first round; the formidable Spain was knocked out by Russia. Brazil looked invincible, and then Belgium brushed them aside. My home team, England, made it further than expected, before a gallant and tearful exit at the semifinal stage on Wednesday. Now it\u2019s down to France against Croatia, on July 15. Here\u2019s the other wonderful thing about the World Cup: It really does bring people together. I\u2019ll never forget some of my favorite experiences watching the tournament this year in Berlin. There was that afternoon when the owners of a Mexican bar, delirious at their team\u2019s win over Germany, gave out free shots of tequila to fans of both countries. Or that night in my favorite restaurant when I watched as two Croats consoled a Dane, whose team Croatia had just beaten in a penalty shootout. Or the evening a beer garden full of international fans, in awe at the skill and sportsmanship of the Japanese, suddenly began to support them. Wherever you watched the games this year, you probably have your own similar memories. During the 2014 World Cup, I was lucky enough to be in Rio de Janeiro during the final. I\u2019ll never forget overlooking Maracan\u00e3 Stadium as Germany prepared to play Argentina for the title. Then, as now, billions of eyes were fixed on that small green stage, as the players prepared to perform, and perhaps claim their place in football history. There was a feeling of being a part of history. Whether Croatia or France wins, the 2018 World Cup final will have brought us viewers together in unexpected community. It will have given us joy. It will have taught us about one another and about the world. And for all of that, I am utterly thankful. May the best team win. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the A.C.L.U. Become the N.R.A. for the Left?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "FeatureThe suit filed on behalf of families separated at the border was just the latest action against the administration by the civil liberties group.Supported byThat case \u2014 Ms. L. v. ICE \u2014 was filed in late February, long before most of the rest of the world was aware that thousands of children were being separated from their families at the border. (As a point of comparison, a coalition of 18 state attorneys general filed a suit to stop family separation on June 26, four months to the day after the A.C.L.U. filed its suit.) It began with a single client, a 39-year-old Congolese woman, Ms. L., whose daughter was taken from her in November 2017, but it quickly grew into a national class action on behalf of every family whose children had been taken from them.On June 6, Judge Dana M. Sabraw, a George W. Bush nominee in the Southern District of California, rejected the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the case and ruled that in detaining the immigrants, it was violating the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The A.C.L.U. asked that Sabraw issue a nationwide injunction, which the judge was still considering when the White House, with no legal room to maneuver and public outcry intensifying by the day, issued an executive order on June 20 saying the practice would be stopped. Now, on that Friday afternoon, Sabraw asked the lawyers to call in to discuss how the executive order affected their cases. Did the White House\u2019s decision \u2014 in theory, anyway \u2014 negate the need for a nationwide injunction to stop family separation? And how did it affect the children who had already been separated?Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project and the lead lawyer on the case, dialed in from the A.C.L.U.\u2019s national offices in Lower Manhattan; Sarah Fabian, an attorney at the Department of Justice, called from Washington. I was listening on speaker in an office next to Gelernt\u2019s. After informing the attorneys that he was in the courtroom and that the call was on the record, Sabraw asked immediately: \u201cHow does the executive order affect this case?\u201d An injunction was more necessary than ever, Gelernt argued, given how much worse things had gotten since they argued the case in Sabraw\u2019s court in early May. \u201cAs your honor has probably been following in the media,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are about 2,000 kids now who have been separated. They range from little babies less than a year old to toddlers to young children. And they are suffering immeasurably.\u201dThe executive order still had too many exceptions that would allow family separations to continue, Gelernt said, and vitally, it didn\u2019t address the issue of how the families would be reunited. \u201cYour honor,\u201d he said at one point, \u201cI realize that I am almost pleading, but we believe it is necessary for you to issue an injunction as early as tonight or this weekend.\u201dSabraw asked if there was any interdepartment communication that would allow the government to even begin putting together a plan for reunification. \u201cI can\u2019t say today that there is a formalized process,\u201d Fabian responded.You could hear Gelernt trying to control the emotion in his response. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he said, \u201cI think the government has had plenty of time to realize that they are literally terrorizing these little children and creating irreparable harm to them.\u201dNear the end of the call, Sabraw asked for additional briefs to be filed before he issued a decision. Could the A.C.L.U. file theirs by Monday morning, clarifying what relief they were now seeking for their clients, and could the government reply by Wednesday afternoon? Gelernt tried one more time to push for an expedited process. \u201cWe could get something to you by midnight tomorrow night, if the government could respond by 9 a.m. Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cTo allow you to issue something, you know, by Tuesday, if the government is willing to do that.\u201dFabian declared that it was already too late on a Friday for that; the government needed time to prepare its response during normal work hours. So, it was decided, Wednesday.I took a brief walk with Gelernt after the call. He looked totally spent. I\u2019d thought about this a lot over the past few months, of course, but the profundity of the burden that he was under, fighting against the government for these families, seemed suddenly unimaginable. \u201cI feel terrible that I couldn\u2019t get him to budge on the timeline,\u201d he said. \u201cI did everything I could think of. Wednesday. That\u2019s another five days. How can we wait another five days?\u201d (The judge later amended the deadline to 9 a.m. Tuesday morning.)A little while later, I sat with Anthony Romero, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s executive director, in his office looking out on the Statue of Liberty. \u201cRome burns,\u201d he said. \u201cRome is burning. And the government\u2019s lawyers can\u2019t work a weekend.\u201dI recalled a conversation we had there 16 months earlier, a few days after President Trump issued his first travel ban. The A.C.L.U.\u2019s response to the ban had been immediate and wide-ranging. It filed its own case challenging the constitutionality of the order. But it also pushed out a template for habeas petitions to all the attorneys who had rushed to airports around the country offering assistance. And at the federal district courthouse in Brooklyn, in an emergency Saturday night hearing, Gelernt argued for a nationwide temporary injunction to block the government from deporting travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations who were now stranded at airports as a result of Trump\u2019s ban. (The White House was forced to modify its ban twice, before the Supreme Court finally ruled in the president\u2019s favor in late June.)I was in the crowd in Downtown Brooklyn when Gelernt stepped out onto the courthouse steps after the hearing. The atmosphere was electric. The new president had taken decisive action, and the courts and citizens rising up in protest had beaten him back. There had been, as with the crowd at the Women\u2019s March a week earlier, a feeling of power and possibility.\u201cThat\u2019s the model,\u201d Romero said when I met him that next week. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to survive this. Pressure in the courts, pressure from the public. We have to keep him in the pincers. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d But he also warned that they were only a week in. They were going to have to file suit after suit after suit. And he worried about how to keep morale up among his lawyers and the A.C.L.U.\u2019s members as time went on.Family separation was a perfect example. Even if Sabraw issued an injunction, that meant either more legal challenges as the government appealed, or intensive monitoring to make sure they were complying with the order, and more lawsuits if they weren\u2019t. This fight, like every fight on every front against the Trump administration, was going to grind on. For now, it was important to focus on what had already been accomplished. Trump could spin it any way he wanted, Romero said, but there was no denying that the executive order was a win for the opposition. \u201cThink about it,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump backed down. We made the president back down. The litigation worked. The public outcry worked. Now we have to keep up the pressure. That\u2019s what we do now.\u201dIn the 15 months that followed the election, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s membership went from 400,000 to 1.84 million. Online donations in the years before averaged between $3 and $5 million annually. Since then, it has raised just shy of $120 million. \u201cUntil Trump,\u201d Romero told me, \u201cmost of our support came from people who have been with us since we challenged Nixon. Now we\u2019re kind of cool. Cool\u2019s not a word generally associated with us.\u201dIn the latest string of celebrity fund-raisers, for instance, Radiohead announced that anyone who makes a $10 donation to the A.C.L.U. will be entered into a lottery to hang out with the band and get V.I.P. tickets to a show. Back in March 2017, Tom Hanks, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin were among the hosts for a Facebook Live telethon that raised more than half a million dollars and was nominated for an Emmy. That same spring, Zedd, a German house DJ, organized a benefit at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Gelernt was one of a handful of A.C.L.U. representatives who addressed thousands of fans between acts. \u201cI went on after Imagine Dragons,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was insane. I put on sunglasses and went out there and started talking, and I couldn\u2019t see anything. Then I go backstage, and these musicians who are practically my kids\u2019 age are partying and asking what we\u2019re doing to resist Trump. I was like, \u2018Well, there\u2019s an en banc hearing in the Fourth Circuit coming up.\u2019\u2009\u201dA big chunk of the money that the A.C.L.U. has raised has gone toward hiring more lawyers, both in the national office and throughout its network of 54 affiliates. (There\u2019s an affiliate in each state, with three in California, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.) \u201cI\u2019d like to have 500 lawyers nationwide by 2019,\u201d Romero told me back in the spring of 2017, when the organization was still in the early stages of figuring out exactly how to use the resources pouring in. \u201cThat\u2019s bigger than we\u2019ve ever been. But let\u2019s not lose sight of reality: There are 11,000 lawyers in the Department of Justice. Eleven. Thousand.\u201d When you add in the lawyers at the Departments of Homeland Security and Labor, who handle immigration law, and Health and Human Services, who field L.G.B.T. issues, there are at least 18,000 lawyers on the government\u2019s payroll. \u201cWe\u2019re the biggest of the advocacy groups, but even if we go from 300 to 500 lawyers, we are still tiny,\u201d Romero said. \u201cThe power of the federal government can\u2019t be overestimated.\u201dThe A.C.L.U. had been preparing for the new administration since the summer of 2016, when Romero asked the lawyers on staff to develop reports on each of the candidate\u2019s records regarding civil liberties. They were familiar with Hillary Clinton\u2019s and generally knew where the challenges would lie. For Trump, the group hired an opposition-research firm to go through all his campaign statements, which they then organized into five subject areas. The lawyers came up with legal strategies for opposing Trump in each of those areas. \u201cThere were no screeds,\u201d Romero said. \u201cNo character assassination. Just cleareyed, lawyerly analysis.\u201dRomero at first got some internal pushback on the Trump memo. \u201cThe lawyers were busy and felt Trump was a waste of time and they should be focusing on the Hillary report,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I forced us to do Trump, and that\u2019s what allowed us to come out of the gate right away.\u201d Romero arrived at his office the day after the election and pulled the memo, read through it again and began writing a statement that would be released that day, as well as the copy for a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times, detailing the ways in which Trump was a threat to the Constitution and declaring, \u201cYou will have to contend with the full firepower of the A.C.L.U. at your every step.\u201dSince Trump took office, the A.C.L.U. has taken 170 \u201cTrump-related legal actions.\u201d There have been formal calls for investigation, administrative and ethics complaints and requests for documents under the Freedom of Information Act. There have also been 83 lawsuits, more than at any other equivalent time in its history \u2014 in defense of immigrants and transgender people and abortion rights and free speech and voting rights and access to birth control.After that Friday afternoon family-separation call, I walked around the hallways for a little while and looked in on various rooms. The place had visibly changed from when I first started showing up there 18 months earlier. They were doubling lawyers up in offices now, and there was a communications and social-media team piled into what used to be a communal space. There were lawyers preparing for a hearing in North Carolina, challenging a state law barring transgender people from using the restrooms that match their gender identity. Another attorney, Louise Melling, one of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s deputy legal directors, stepped out of her office to commiserate briefly about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in favor of a Christian baker (and against the A.C.L.U., which argued the case) who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple in Colorado. \u201cThat one hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u201d There were plenty of other cases wending through the system, Melling said, and the issue would most likely rise up to the Supreme Court again. She sighed and then smiled broadly. She had come up fighting abortion rights cases for years, she said, so she was prepared for the long haul.It\u2019s not the first time the A.C.L.U.\u2019s mission has shifted. At its founding in 1920, the A.C.L.U. was less an institution that believed in the power of litigation than an activist group fighting on behalf of workers trying to unionize and \u201cradicals\u201d being arrested without warrants and deported by a government in the grip of anti-communist fever. \u201cThe A.C.L.U.\u2019s lawyers at that time didn\u2019t really believe in the courts at all,\u201d David Cole, its national legal director, told me. This is more or less smack in the middle of the Lochner era, a time when the courts were politically conservative and judicially aggressive. \u201cThe only constitutional rights the courts were concerned with were the rights of businesses to strike down any law designed to protect workers or consumers against unfettered capitalism,\u201d Cole said. (You don\u2019t have to stretch your imagination to see the parallels with the current Supreme Court.)The A.C.L.U. filed lawsuits at the time, fully expecting to lose, Cole said, figuring that the losses would at least be of propaganda value in demonstrating to Americans the uselessness of the courts when it came to protecting the rights of the people. \u201cAnd then, to their surprise, they start winning a few cases,\u201d Cole said. \u201cAnd they realize as lawyers that if you make more patient, incrementalist arguments, you can win in court, and that each incremental gain sets the stage for more progress. This really is the birth of civil liberties litigation, which is pretty much the only thing we did for the next 90-something years. Until now.\u201dAfter years at the Center for Constitutional Rights and a professorship at Georgetown Law, Cole took over as the A.C.L.U.\u2019s national legal director a week and a half before Trump took office. He accepted the job in the late summer of 2016, when the future was all Hillary Clinton and Merrick Garland and the first liberal Supreme Court in nearly 50 years. \u201cAnthony wooed me with visions of presiding over the new golden age of civil rights and civil liberties litigation,\u201d he said when I first met him. (Romero walked me through the plans they had formulated in the event of a Clinton victory: \u201cKnocking out the death penalty as unconstitutional. Establishing solitary confinement as cruel and unusual punishment. Challenging the Hyde Amendment,\u201d which prohibits Medicaid funding for a vast majority of abortion services. \u201cBlanket protection against L.G.B.T. discrimination. The application of the Fourth Amendment and privacy protections in a digital world. Indigent defense and racial profiling and mass incarceration. ...\u201d)In the fall of 2016, as if in anticipation of the moment in which we\u2019re now living, Cole published his seventh book, \u201cEngines of Liberty: How Citizen Movements Succeed.\u201d In it, he lays out three radically different examples of citizen groups banding together to change public perception and reshape political and judicial will: in 2015, when gay rights groups won the fight for same-sex marriage; the National Rifle Association\u2019s inexorable gathering of local and state-level influence that leads, in 2008, to the federal constitutional right of individuals to bear arms; and the international pressure brought to bear by human rights groups during the Bush administration\u2019s \u201cwar on terror,\u201d which led to a 2004 Supreme Court ruling that effectively ended the blanket legal deference historically afforded an American president during a time of war.Each of those outcomes was previously inconceivable, Cole says. What ultimately brought them about was less a sea change in the Supreme Court justices\u2019 worldview, or some masterstroke of lawyering, than a steady exertion of influence by civil society organizations whose members were deeply committed to change. No advocacy group is better at doing that, Cole points out, than the N.R.A. And despite what most Americans think, the N.R.A.\u2019s extraordinary influence comes less from campaign contributions or lobbying efforts than from \u201cits remarkable ability to mobilize its members and supporters at the ballot box.\u201dIn his book, Cole quotes a former N.R.A. president, David Keene, on this point: \u201cThe power of the National Rifle Association doesn\u2019t come from money,\u201d Keene said. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have to spend money, because we do. But it comes from votes. It comes from the people.\u201d Politicians can raise money from a range of sources, Keene asserted, \u201cbut if you tell a politician you\u2019ve got 8,000 members in his district, he\u2019s willing to think about things other than money.\u201dDennis Burke, who served as an aide to former Senator Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat from Arizona \u2014 a state where the N.R.A. has been deeply effective \u2014 is even more blunt on the money-versus-activism question. \u201cI don\u2019t think [politicians] care about the contributions they get from the N.R.A.,\u201d Burke told Cole. \u201cThey care about the piles of mail, these nasty calls and people picketing their state offices. Politicians are risk-averse.\u201dThe N.R.A. analogy wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was useful, Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously different. They\u2019re a single-issue group, and we cover the whole waterfront. Their yearly budget is around $300 million. Ours is bigger this year, but generally it\u2019s been around $130 million.\u201d Structurally, they\u2019re similar, however. Each group has national offices, a lobbying arm and affiliates in every state. And now, as Cole put it, \u201cwe have the threat.\u201dWhen I first met Shakir, a month or so after he started the job, I asked if he could imagine anything that would cause Republicans to start peeling away from the president. He smiled and slowly shook his head. \u201cMy prediction is that we will see levels of cowardice and cynicism that will be awe-inspiring. As long as Trump doesn\u2019t start offending the evangelical base or step on a land mine when it comes to Israel, they\u2019re going to let him do whatever he wants.\u201dThe one thing he felt certain of was that \u201cit will be easier for Trump to hurt the people he promised to hurt than to help the people he promised to help.\u201d For Shakir, that meant there was a chance to reach people and activate them. After taking the job, he set about creating a system, with proper infrastructure and resources and personnel, from which you could call people to action and which other groups could tap into. \u201cI hired people who know how to do this,\u201d Shakir said, referring to several digital organizers who worked for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign. Whatever you think of Sanders as a candidate, he said, \u201cout of the chaos that was the Bernie campaign was born a structure and a movement of people\u201d \u2014 volunteers who then became supervolunteers, who weren\u2019t on the campaign\u2019s payroll but were passionate and trusted and could be depended upon to turn out thousands of people for an event.In March 2017, the A.C.L.U. launched the new platform, called PeoplePower.org. The first call to action was around the creation of what Shakir called \u201cfreedom cities.\u201d \u201cWe sat down and thought about what are the power levers that will most hinder Trump\u2019s ability to get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we came to the conclusion that cities and towns across America are our greatest political strength. Effectuating power through city officials is the way we can push back.\u201d They created a list of \u201casks\u201d to present to local sheriffs, police commissioners or precinct commanders, and then prepared members with a script of questions to ask: \u201cDo they participate in transporting people on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Do they give home addresses to ICE? Do they detain people without judicial warrant?\u201d The idea was to take the town-hall concept and apply it not to a member of Congress but to local law-enforcement officials, fostering a sense that constituents were invested in these issues and wanted their views represented.The second major initiative, which the A.C.L.U. started last October in Lawrence, Kan., was a voting rights campaign called Let People Vote. Ronald Newman, the director of strategic initiatives and a former member of the Obama administration on the National Security Council, worked with Shakir to create geographically targeted campaigns. \u201cRonnie and I went to our affiliates and said: \u2018You know your state\u2019s issues better than we do. What\u2019s the one thing you desperately want to accomplish when it comes to voting rights?\u2019\u2009\u201d Shakir said. The responses fell into four categories: election reform (things like automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, expanded early voting); rights restoration for citizens who have committed felonies; gerrymandering; and pushing back on voter-suppression efforts like identification cards.The voting rights campaign was straight out of the N.R.A.\u2019s playbook: long-term advocacy that starts local, focuses on realistic wins that energize the membership and keeps the big picture in mind at all times. \u201cThe path to success varies by each state,\u201d Newman said. \u201cFor 70 percent of them, it\u2019s legislation. In a handful of states, there are ballot measures\u201d \u2014 the biggest being the state constitutional amendment on the ballot in Florida this November that would restore voting rights to an estimated 1.4 million felons who have served their time. \u201cAnd in some places, the work happens not at the state level but at the county level, so that\u2019s where we have to be involved.\u201dAnd yet the group has long had a lobbying effort in Washington and has always been involved in ballot referendums and deployed volunteers to get out the word on their core issues. Now, the leaders felt, those core issues were at the center of the storm in the United States, and the A.C.L.U. could operate on a scale that had never been possible. \u201cNone of that stuff is new,\u201d Romero told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve just never had this much money. In the old days, if we cobbled together $50,000 for a ballot referendum in California, and that was being in the game. Now we\u2019re dropping $5 million in Florida, $3 million in Michigan. We\u2019ll spend close to $10 million on ballot referenda this year.Last fall, Shakir and Newman began putting together a list of races with that question in mind. \u201cThere had to be an obvious civil rights and civil liberties story at play in a race,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t explain in the first two sentences what of our core issues are at stake in an individual race, then we shouldn\u2019t be involved.\u201dThe earliest test case took place in May 2017 during a Democratic primary for district attorney in Philadelphia. The race represented a rare open seat in one of America\u2019s most heavily incarcerated cities. Udi Ofer, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s deputy national political director, analyzed voting patterns and estimated that A.C.L.U. members in the Philadelphia area \u2014 11,438 voters \u2014 made up roughly a quarter of all the people who vote in primaries there. They then hired formerly incarcerated individuals to go door to door, talking about their experience in prison and mass incarceration. It was a simple message, Romero said: \u201cIf you were to cast a meaningful vote in this D.A. race, here are the issues we think you should consider.\u201d The winner of that primary and ultimately the election was Larry Krasner, whose reform-focused approach to racial discrimination in policing is more or less unheard-of among big-city district attorneys in the United States.\u201cWhat\u2019s great about this approach is that you have the data,\u201d Romero said. \u201cYou can see very clearly whether or not you\u2019re being effective, beyond just the outcome of the race. We looked at the number of people we made contact with and cross-tabulated that with the voter file. Then we compared it to voter turnout generally. What impact did we see? Astronomical growth in turnout from the folks whose doors we knocked on.\u201dNext up was a State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, in which they sent out hundreds of thousands of scorecards outlining the candidates\u2019 positions on a host of threats to civil liberties \u2014 immigration policy, the restriction of access to abortion services, L.G.B.T discrimination. Rebecca Dallet, the best candidate on civil liberties issues, won by 11\u00bd points.\u201cWe stepped up our involvement in Mecklenburg County after that,\u201d Shakir told me, referring to the Democratic primary for county sheriff in Mecklenburg County, N.C., in which the incumbent, Irwin Carmichael, had signed an agreement to help ICE locate undocumented immigrants. The A.C.L.U. paid for a radio ad that aired in the weeks leading up to the primary. \u201cSheriff Carmichael works for Trump\u2019s deportation force,\u201d it said, \u201cdetaining people for deportation, tearing families apart.\u201d Carmichael\u2019s challengers, it went on to say, \u201cpledge to stop working with Trump\u2019s deportation force.\u201d Carmichael, a strong favorite who had raised significantly more money than his opponents, finished third in the primary.In August, the A.C.L.U. will focus on the county prosecutor\u2019s race in St. Louis County, where there is a long history of racial discrimination in policing. (The incumbent is Robert P. McCullouch, who faced criticism for not pushing to bring charges in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in Ferguson.) The group is also looking for ways to affect the Arizona Republican Senate primary this fall, where Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, is running against Kelli Ward, a doctor, and Martha McSally, a state representative and former Air Force squadron commander. Arpaio was found guilty of violating a judge\u2019s order preventing him from detaining immigrants based solely on his suspicion that they lacked legal status. He was pardoned by Trump last August and announced that he would run to succeed Senator Jeff Flake, one of the few Republicans to speak out against Trump. \u201cI mean, that guy,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cHow can we not be involved in that race?\u201dAnd in Kansas, where Kris Kobach, the secretary of state, is running for governor, the group has been polling Republican primary and general election voters. It found that 44 percent of them \u201chave serious doubts\u201d about Kobach as a result of the disregard for people\u2019s privacy inherent in his voter-identification efforts. \u201cOur own modeling shows there is a slice of conservatives who are happy to hear from the A.C.L.U,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cWe want to be talking to them, not just to true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool resisters.\u201dThis level of political involvement, no matter the affiliation, hasn\u2019t settled well with all A.C.L.U. backers. In a recent article for The New Yorker by Benjamin Wallace-Wells, Ira Glasser, who preceded Romero as the A.C.L.U.\u2019s executive director for two decades, said of the involvement in candidates\u2019 races: \u201cI regard this as a departure which has the capacity to destroy the organization as it has always existed.\u201d What the A.C.L.U. does, Glasser and others have pointed out, is unique among advocacy groups in America. It is the only one purely committed to defending the Constitution. Once you wade into politics, the sanctity of that commitment risks getting stained.I brought this critique up with Romero. \u201cThese claims of catastrophic damage to the organization\u2019s future,\u201d Romero said, but then trailed off with a shrug, as if to imply he found it hard to take them too seriously. \u201cWhat can I say? Some people don\u2019t like change. Are we endorsing candidates? No. Are we creating a PAC? No. Will we sue the asses off of any candidate who might benefit from our involvement now if they do the wrong thing on civil liberties? Yes. Does anyone get a pass from us in the future? Hell, no. What we\u2019re doing is operationalizing. Just like the N.R.A. It\u2019s time. If anything, the A.C.L.U. has been too reluctant to involve ourselves in the political process.\u201dIn the 2016 fiscal year, he told me, the budget for its political arm was $37.7 million. For the 2018 fiscal year, which ended in March, the budget was $103.6 million. The budget for litigation (which also includes education and operations) in 2018 was $122.7 million. \u201cThe political work is of a commensurate size with the legal work,\u201d Romero said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it should be. The pincers movement is the only way to deliver. People did not give to the A.C.L.U. for us to put that money into a bank account. If at the end of this year what I have to show to all of these people rushing to become members of the organization is a better balance sheet, I\u2019d get properly skewered. Shame on us if we don\u2019t find a way to put that money to use.\u201dIt seemed impossible, too, that it was only four months ago when Gelernt first told me about Ms. L. Her story is still shocking in its particulars, and it\u2019s worth knowing, I think, because her fate, like the fate of thousands of others seeking asylum here, is still undecided.Nearly a year ago, fearing for their lives, Ms. L. and her daughter, S., who was 6 at the time, fled their small village in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A group of nuns gave them money and food and helped them flee the country. For the next several months, they slept outside most nights or sometimes on the floors of empty buildings they had been pointed to along their route north toward the United States. They cleaned themselves as much as possible in public restrooms. They scavenged for discarded food from restaurants. When they finally presented themselves at the crossing in San Diego, Ms. L. saw the American flag and told her daughter they were going to be O.K.: \u201cWe have arrived.\u201dThis was on Nov. 1, 2017 \u2014 months before the government denied it was separating children from their families, then said it was only families who were caught crossing the border illegally, then announced it was all part of a zero-tolerance policy. Ms. L. entered legally at the port of entry at San Diego. In broken Spanish she had picked up along the way, she told the border agents she was seeking asylum in the United States. The Border Patrol referred her to ICE, and after four days in temporary housing, ICE agents met with her and S. and asked the girl to go with a guard into another room. Once she was gone, they handcuffed Ms. L., who hadn\u2019t committed a crime. She listened to her daughter beyond the door, screaming and pleading with the guards not to take her away. S. was transported immediately to a facility for unaccompanied minors in Chicago. Ms. L. was detained in California with roughly 1,500 other detainees.In late January, Ms. L. appeared before an immigration judge without an attorney present. She hadn\u2019t seen S. for nearly three months and was consumed with worry and despair. After questioning her, the judge ordered Ms. L. to be removed from the United States. Confused by what was being asked of her, she waived her right to contest her removal. When she returned to the detention center and recounted what happened, another detainee asked, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d and explained that she was going to be sent to Congo. Ms. L. begged her fellow detainee to write a letter to the judge on her behalf. \u201cPlease don\u2019t send me back,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be killed there.\u201dThe night Gelernt told me her story, he was taking a break from writing a brief to be filed in two days, on March 9, amending her case into a nationwide class-action suit. \u201cWe just got a bunch of declarations in the last 15 minutes from people who work in detention centers down in Texas. They\u2019re saying they\u2019re seeing hundreds of cases.\u201dMs. L. was paroled from detention the following week, a few days before the government\u2019s response was due in her lawsuit. When I asked Gelernt why she had been released, he guessed it was an attempt to act as if her case had nothing to do with a policy of family separation. At the time, the government\u2019s justification for separating Ms. L. and S. was that it needed to verify that Ms. L. was neither a child trafficker nor an abusive parent, though both of those things could have been ascertained quickly and without separating them.A few days after she was released, Ms. L. traveled with an A.C.L.U. staff member from San Diego to Chicago. She was terrified to make the trip, certain that she would be arrested in the airport and sent back to Congo without ever seeing S. again. I met her briefly the next day, in a shelter on the outskirts of the city. Gelernt had gotten assurances from the government that Ms. L. and S. would be reunited, but he didn\u2019t know when. She sat on a worn sofa in the shelter\u2019s common room, wearing sweatpants and a thin sweater and plastic flip-flops, her face gaunt beneath tight braids. She kneaded her hands and looked into her lap as Gelernt asked her what S.\u2019s favorite foods were, what color clothes she would like, what toys she might want to play with when they were finally together again. \u201cFrozen,\u201d Ms. L. whispered.There were some creased, printed-out photos of her and S., taken before they fled Congo, spread out on a pool table at the end of the room. In one, Ms. L. smiles at the camera while S. sits behind her braiding her hair. You can recognize her in the pictures, the same softness in her eyes, the long, strong hands. But the woman in the room was, I would guess, 50 or 60 pounds thinner than the woman in the photographs. Before we said goodbye, we stood next to the pool table looking at the pictures. I remarked on how beautiful S. was, and she slowly ran a finger over her daughter in the photo, then gathered the papers up and slid them into a manila folder that she held against her chest.The next night, after I left, they were reunited in the shelter. I\u2019ve spoken with Gelernt several times about the moment of their reunion, what he called the most emotional thing he\u2019d experienced in 25 years of doing immigration work. Ms. L. stood near him waiting for her daughter on a worn marble staircase just inside the shelter\u2019s front door. When the door swung open, she crouched and stretched her arms wide. S. stepped through the doorway and saw her, and the most beautiful smile spread over the girls face, Gelernt said. She toppled forward, and Ms. L. gathered her in her arms and fell back onto the marble stairs. The look on her face as she held her daughter was almost too emotional to witness. For the next minute they lay there, clinging to each other and rocking from side to side. The only sound in the hall was a low, rhythmic moan, punctuated by S.\u2019s higher-pitched cry.Eventually they sat up and walked up the steps and settled on a bench in the shelter\u2019s hallway. After a few minutes, Ms. L leaned toward S. and spoke to her in Lingala, then pointed to Gelernt, and S. stood up and walked over to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cThere are times when this work is so tiring,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cBut something like this, if people could only see this, I think it could change the way some of them think about these issues. This isn\u2019t abstract policy, this is a mother and a daughter who have been through more than we can imagine. It was the rawest possible emotion,\u201d Gelernt said.Three days later, the immigration judge who ruled that Ms. L. would be deported denied the motion to reopen her case. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Gelernt told me. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously going to be appealed.\u201d As of now, they\u2019re awaiting a decision on that appeal. Gelernt told me that S. is doing a little better, going to school in the day with some other kids in the shelter. Ms. L. remains terrified that ICE agents will show up there to take her away, or take S. away, and that she\u2019ll be sent back to Congo and what she says and the government has agreed is certain death.As Anthony Romero predicted in the first weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency, the A.C.L.U. has never been able to savor a victory for long. On June 27, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he would be retiring from the Supreme Court, giving Trump an opening to nominate someone who could steer the court hard to the right for decades to come. It was catastrophic news for the group\u2019s members and donors, and it threatened many of the civil liberties that Romero and his lawyers have fought so hard to protect: abortion rights, voting rights, labor rights and many more. I got an email from David Cole the next morning. \u201cSo now Kennedy\u2019s gone. Very disturbing.\u201dI\u2019d begun thinking about this story a year and a half ago, when I met Cole just before the inauguration. He exuded empathy and fierce intelligence in equal parts. During our first conversation, I asked him about what he expected out of the next four years, and I thought he would say that even a court this conservative would provide a bulwark against assaults on the Constitution and civil rights, that it would fully exert the power of its branch. Instead, he said, \u201cThe courts won\u2019t save us.\u201d It\u2019s not that they wouldn\u2019t do their jobs. He had faith for the most part that they would. And groups like the A.C.L.U. and others would do their jobs, too. \u201cThe question is, will the rest of us do ours?\u201dI\u2019ve checked in with him several times over these 18 months to take his emotional temperature. Always it\u2019s a soft-sold optimism, and always it\u2019s tempered by the question of whether Americans can summon the anger and the energy and the empathy, the love, even, odd as it is to use that word in this context, to care enough about the suffering of other human beings to be willing to work on their behalf, whatever that work might require. \u201cI remain confident we\u2019ll find our way,\u201d Cole always says. Or, \u201cI believe we\u2019ll look back on this moment, and it will be the moment in which we saved the country from its worst self.\u201d Or, \u201cIf I\u2019m betting, I\u2019m still betting that justice wins out.\u201dWhen I asked him where his equanimity and optimism came from, he laughed and said it wasn\u2019t that he was born hopeful, it\u2019s that he\u2019s been in the fight for a long time. You learn to absorb defeats, and you recognize that change comes incrementally, that the dam only ever breaks after sustained, constant pressure. \u201cI fundamentally believe that hope is more the consequence of action than its cause,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me you have two choices in this life, you can be a fatalistic spectator, or you can engage and produce hope. If those are the two choices, there is really only one choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Father of Parkland Shooting Survivors Is Fatally Shot in Robbery", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo of Ayub Ali\u2019s children cowered in their classrooms as a gunman rampaged through their high school in Parkland, Fla., in February, in an attack that killed 17 people.The children \u2014 Elama, 17, and Rahat, 15 \u2014 were unhurt. But gun violence again found their family.On Friday, the students, their two younger siblings and their mother, Farhana, will stand by the grave of Mr. Ali, a 61-year-old grocery store owner who was shot dead in a robbery in North Lauderdale this week. Members of the area\u2019s Bangladeshi community will say prayers. His coffin will be lowered into the ground.Elama and Rahat, who were still coping with the trauma of the shooting five months ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, are showing similar signs of distress in the aftermath of their father\u2019s murder, a family spokesman and friend, Mirza Mustaque, said.The long periods of stunned silence. The disbelief.\u201cSometimes they express it by crying, sometimes they are quiet,\u201d said Mr. Mustaque. \u201cWe are trying to talk to them, and bring some kids to their home so they can talk, so they don\u2019t feel lonely.\u201dMr. Ali was a well-known member of the area\u2019s Bangladeshi community, which thrives in Parkland, Coral Springs and Margate. He and his family worshiped at the Jamaat Al Mumineen mosque in Margate, where Mr. Ali was known as a regular volunteer at social and cultural events.But then the man returned and shot Mr. Ali, who was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Joy Oglesby, the sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman, said Friday they had not made an arrest in the case.Mr. Ali came to the United States about 20 years ago from Bangladesh. He grew up in the village of Nanupur, on the outskirts of the southeastern city of Chittagong, Mr. Mustaque and another friend, Ali Munju, said in interviews. He worked hard with partners in the grocery business until he was able to strike out on his own and purchase his store, they said.\u201cIt is serious trauma for them, all of them,\u201d Mr. Munju said.They posted Facebook announcements of plans for Mr. Ali\u2019s burial in Hialeah\u2019s Muslim cemetery. In line with Islamic custom, his body was washed and wrapped in a special burial garment.A remembrance gathering will be held in Pembroke Pines, and friends planned a mourning period at Mr. Ali\u2019s home, where people can drop in, bring food and stay awhile.\u201cEverybody follows the family to the deceased\u2019s house and stays there as long as they can,\u201d Mr. Munju said. \u201cAll day and all night, somebody is next to them for some days.\u201dHe added, \u201cThey make them feel they are not alone, to show them they are not alone, we are next to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From the Poker Table to Wall Street", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTPORT, Conn. \u2014 There is almost nothing on Vanessa Selbst\u2019s tidy, unadorned desk on the second floor of this suburban office building that would suggest its occupant is the most successful female player in the history of professional poker except, perhaps, a neat stack of $5 bills to the left of her three monitors.That\u2019s a collection she has taken from her colleagues at Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund where Ms. Selbst has worked since last fall, for a gambling guessing game she has introduced to the office on the arguable premise that it somehow might help sharpen their strategic acuity.For a 34-year-old whose nights and days used to be consumed by endless hours grinding at felt tables in casinos from Barcelona to Melbourne, it is evidence that she really can find action anywhere. \u201cI do try to get people gambling as often as I can,\u201d Ms. Selbst said, chuckling.Her bosses at Bridgewater clearly don\u2019t mind; a faux-hawk-sporting poker champ with a Yale law degree probably makes perfect sense for a firm guided by Ray Dalio, Bridgewater\u2019s chief executive, and his philosophy of assembling teams of disparate, iconoclastic people and seeing what happens.Ms. Selbst\u2019s decision to shed her PokerStars hoodie and submit to a 9-to-5 routine in suburban Connecticut is, in many ways, just another surprising choice for a woman known for making unconventional calls.After all, she first came to the notice of the wider poker world in 2006 for a disastrous bluff at her first final table of a World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas. (She went all in with a 5 and a 2 against, it turned out, a pair of aces.) She eventually won $101,000 and seventh place in that contest, but that bust gained her a reputation \u2014 bolstered later by several other awe-inspiringly successful or horrifically failed bluffs now central to her YouTube fame \u2014 as a reckless aggressor.\u201cI\u2019m also anticapitalist at heart,\u201d she added, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t really fit in with my values, I guess.\u201dNow, she said in an interview, she sees it both as a more stable lifestyle as she and her wife expect their first child in October and as an intellectually stimulating challenge.But even more than that, Ms. Selbst said, it\u2019s a means to an end, that end being making as much money as she can as quickly as she can to help finance the progressive causes she supports. She has long been an active philanthropist; her charitable foundation, Venture Justice, for instance, pays for a two-year fellowship for a lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund through a program organized by Equal Justice Works. She has also raised $500,000 for the Urban Justice Center via an annual charity poker tournament and served for a time on that organization\u2019s board.\u201cAm I going and working with clients in prison? No, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re investing money and we\u2019re making money, and that\u2019s important,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who earned her law degree in 2012 and worked part time in recent years for a police-misconduct litigation firm. \u201cHopefully, if I\u2019m good at this and I do well, then that\u2019s probably the most efficient way for me to support the causes that I care about.\u201dMs. Selbst\u2019s pivot also reflects her gimlet-eyed view of poker today.In the early 2000s, she was among the flood of players inspired to play by the 1998 film \u201cRounders\u201d and the out-of-nowhere $2.5 million World Series of Poker championship win in 2003 by a Tennessee accountant and online player, Chris Moneymaker. (Yes, his real name.) Curious, Ms. Selbst started playing online and built her account up to $150,000 by the time she graduated from Yale with a political science degree.After graduation, she worked as a management consultant in the New York office of McKinsey & Company, but the cards kept calling her back.\u201cI was playing poker for one-third the amount of time and making three times as much money,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who splits her time between the Brooklyn home she shares with her wife and a Westport residence near the Bridgewater offices. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve got to give this a shot.\u2019\u201dFor elite poker players, it was a golden age. Ms. Selbst found it easy to reliably haul in $500,000 in profit annually \u2014 and often a lot more. More recently, though, an industry of instructional videos and books on how to win has fueled a steep rise in good players even as the available money has remained the same.\u201cYou have no job security, no health insurance. You\u2019re traveling constantly. You have no stability in terms of your life,\u201d Ms. Selbst explained. \u201cAnd there are huge swings because if more people now have a chance to win, it\u2019s very easy to have a losing year.\u201dThe lifestyle was also hard on her wife, Miranda Selbst, who oversees a joint venture between the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Department of Education to improve learning at low-achieving elementary schools.\u201cA lot of poker spouses are put in the awkward position of having to give up their passions to just support this other person,\u201d Miranda Selbst, 37, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain to your friends at home who have 9-to-5 jobs and think you are on vacation all the time. People don\u2019t really know how lonely and boring that can feel.\u201dVanessa Selbst was introduced to Bridgewater by a pro-poker friend, Galen Hall, who left the circuit in 2011 to earn an M.B.A. at Stanford before the hedge firm hired him. As Ms. Selbst expressed frustrations with both poker and her ability to effectuate more good in the world, Mr. Hall urged her to visit Bridgewater.\u201cIf something\u2019s undervalued, does that mean you want to buy? Well, maybe, but if you buy it, how\u2019s it going to go up? Who are the other people who are going to buy? What are they thinking about? What\u2019s their motivations?\u201d she said, offering an analysis that could fit either an investment or a poker hand. \u201cYou have to be thinking about who the other players are and what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dFor now, Ms. Selbst is far too junior at Bridgewater to have a pivotal role in big decisions. She admitted, too, to having struggled through the firm\u2019s intensive nine-month crash course on economics and the company\u2019s trading philosophy. Her poker success relied largely on exploiting a personal image of being intimidating and terse; at Bridgewater, she discovered, she must be approachable and collaborative.\u201cIt was really hard initially, and I wasn\u2019t doing well at all, so it was less about wanting to be the star and more just not being used to doing poorly at something,\u201d she said. \u201cMy defensive mechanism kicked in, and so then people were like, \u2018You\u2019re really defensive.\u2019\u201dAt Bridgewater, she said, she has learned to tame that, but her more obstinate persona re-emerged this month when she was mocked for busting on a wild bluff the first day of the World Series of Poker\u2019s $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold \u2019Em Main Event in Las Vegas. (Despite her retirement, Ms. Selbst intends to play in occasional high-profile tournaments.)Mr. Hall, 32, pointed to Ms. Selbst\u2019s counterintuitive play the day before in explaining why she\u2019ll do well in her new job.\u201cHere\u2019s somebody who has won a ton of poker tournaments, so obviously she knows what the standard play is, but she does something different and you say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 instead of taking five seconds to think about what this hyper-intelligent, hyper-successful person is doing,\u201d he said of her critics. \u201cAt Bridgewater, what\u2019s really valuable is people who can think extremely independently.\u201dMs. Selbst expressed relief \u201cthat this is not my life anymore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very insular world,\u201d she said of poker. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to come back and play and see people, but it\u2019s also really nice to know I have somewhere else to get back to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Miserably low turnout in the 2014 midterms helped Republicans take the Senate, which in turn allowed them to steal a Supreme Court seat from Barack Obama. And mediocre turnout in 2016 helped Donald Trump to win the presidency, which has allowed him to nominate two justices.The nominee may provide the fifth vote to take health insurance from millions of people and to overturn Roe v. Wade, both of which would be unpopular. Progressive activists can highlight those stances and build pressure on senators to oppose the nomination, Fallon says.

Putin referred specifically to associates of his arch-nemesis Bill Browder, a businessman (and British citizen) who has succeeded in getting seven countries, including the United States, to pass laws punishing Russian oligarchs suspected of corruption. (The Russians who met with members of the Trump campaign at Trump Tower in June 2016 wanted to discuss this law, the Magnitsky Act.)\u201cI\u2019ve known for a long time that Putin has been trying to use every trick in the book to get me arrested in a foreign country and extradited back to Russia,\u201d Browder told me after the news conference. It\u2019s chilling that Trump appeared willing to help Putin with his vendetta.It\u2019s always been obvious that Trump does not hold Russia\u2019s hacking of the 2016 election, which he publicly encouraged and gleefully benefited from, against Putin. None of us yet know the exact contours of Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, whether Putin is his handler, his co-conspirator or just his hero. But it\u2019s clear that Trump is willing to sell out American democracy for personal gain. After all, on July 27, 2016, he publicly called for Russia to find Clinton\u2019s emails, and, thanks to Friday\u2019s indictments, we now know Russia started trying to hack the domain used by her personal office that very day. Trump\u2019s collusion with Russia has always been out in the open, daring us to recognize what\u2019s in front of our faces.Some doubt that Trump is a Russian puppet precisely because his fealty to Putin is so blatant and undisguised. They should consider the case of Mariia Butina, which broke wide open just hours after the Trump-Putin meeting.This weekend, Butina was arrested in Washington, and on Monday a criminal complaint against her for acting as a Russian agent was unsealed. She was accused of conspiracy to \u201cexploit personal connections with U.S. persons having influence in American politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation.\u201d There\u2019s a useful lesson here in evaluating Trump\u2019s behavior. Sometimes things are exactly as bad as they appear.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to action taken against Mariia Butina.

{"Headline": "What if the Government Gave Everyone a Paycheck?", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAdvancing technologies aren\u2019t the only cause of this predicament, but notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claim to the contrary, technology is a bigger culprit than trade. The economy keeps growing yet most economic gains are going to a few \u2014 largely financiers and, increasingly, inventors and owners of the digitized devices that are replacing good jobs. Our economic system isn\u2019t designed for this. If the trend continues, it\u2019s unclear who will even earn enough to buy all the future robots.Economic change on this scale doesn\u2019t happen without something cracking. The shift from farm to factory featured decades of bloody labor conflict; the move from factory to office and other sedentary jobs caused more upheaval. What will happen when robots push most people out of steady work and into lower-wage gig jobs? I doubt we\u2019ll see a revolution. A more likely scenario is a slow slouch toward authoritarianism and xenophobia. We may already be there.What\u2019s the answer? Here in the Bay Area where I live, where inventors and engineers are busily digitizing everything, many civic and business leaders are touting something called a universal basic income, or U.B.I. It\u2019s universal in the sense that everyone would receive it, basic in that it would be just enough to live on and cash income rather than voucher-based, like food stamps or Section 8 housing. To the rest of America, a U.B.I. may seem like a pipe dream, but from my vantage point some form of it seems inevitable.U.B.I.\u2019s critics understandably worry that it would spur millions to drop out of the labor force, induce laziness or at least rob people of the structure and meaning work provides. Both Yang and Lowrey muster substantial research to rebut these claims. I\u2019m not sure they need it. After all, $12,000 a year doesn\u2019t deliver a comfortable life even in the lowest-cost precincts of America, so there would still be plenty of incentive to work. Most of today\u2019s jobs provide very little by way of fulfillment or creativity anyway.A U.B.I. might give recipients a bit more time to pursue socially beneficial activities, like helping the elderly or attending to kids with special needs or perhaps even starting a new business. Yang suggests it would spur a system of \u201csocial credits\u201d in which people trade their spare time by performing various helpful tasks for one another. (I.R.S. be warned.) Surely a U.B.I. would help compensate many people \u2014 especially women \u2014 for the unpaid labor they already contribute. As Lowrey points out, some 40 million family caregivers in America provide half a trillion dollars of unpaid adult care annually. Child care has become so expensive that one of every three stay-at-home mothers today lives below the poverty line (compared with 14 percent in 1970).But how could America possibly afford a U.B.I.? A $1,000-a-month grant to every American would cost about $3.9 trillion a year. That\u2019s about $1.3 trillion on top of existing welfare programs \u2014 roughly the equivalent of the entire federal budget, or about a fifth of the entire United States economy. Both Yang and Lowrey come up with laundry lists of potential funding sources \u2014 from soaking the rich (raising the top tax bracket to 55 percent, enlarging the estate tax and implementing new taxes on wealth, financial transactions and perhaps even the owners of the robots and related devices that are displacing jobs), to instituting a carbon tax or a value-added tax.Whatever the source of funds, it seems a safe bet that increased automation will allow the economy to continue to grow, making a U.B.I. more affordable. A U.B.I. would itself generate more consumer spending, stimulating additional economic activity. And less poverty would mean less crime, incarceration and other social costs associated with deprivation. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really expensive?\u201d Yang asks. \u201cDysfunction. Revolution.\u201dIf these measures still aren\u2019t enough to foot the bill, Lowrey suggests making a U.B.I. less universal by taxing away U.B.I. payments to high-income earners and reducing other forms of social insurance (for example, eliminating food stamps and welfare programs). As a last resort, she writes, a U.B.I. could be implemented as a kind of negative income tax, by which government simply ensures that every person or household has a certain minimum yearly income. This is what Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman had in mind. Lowrey figures that the cost of such a guarantee would approximate the current total costs of the earned-income tax credit, supplemental security income, housing assistance, food stamps and school lunches. She notes that the simplest way to achieve this would be to transform existing antipoverty programs into unconditional cash transfers.But there\u2019s a logical flaw in her argument. Once a U.B.I. is no longer universal or even basic (what if the poor are worse off when other forms of assistance are stripped away?), it\u2019s hard to see the point of having it in the first place. More troubling is Lowrey\u2019s blurring of the distinction between a U.B.I. that redistributes resources from the superrich to the growing number of vulnerable lower-income Americans and one that merely turns programs for the poor into cash assistance. The latter may be warranted, but it wouldn\u2019t touch America\u2019s growing scourge of inequality and economic insecurity, which will be made worse as robots take over good jobs.A core challenge in the future will be how to redistribute money from the ever richer owners of the robots and related technologies to the rest of us, who are otherwise likely to become poorer and less secure. This is not just an economic challenge but also a political one. As we know from recent history, vast fortunes translate directly into political power, and such power effectively resists redistribution. Sadly, neither of these authors discusses how to deal with this paradox.A world inhabited only by robots, their billionaire owners and a large and increasingly restive population is the plotline for countless dystopian fantasies, but it\u2019s a reality that appears to be drawing closer. If we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we will need to make fundamental choices about how to support human livelihoods and ensure equal participation in our economy and society. Most basically, we will have to confront the realities of vastly unequal economic and political power. Even if we manage to enact a U.B.I., it will not be nearly enough.Advertisement"}

Another shrinks.In separate ballrooms at the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan on Friday morning, shareholders of the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox agreed to a $71.3 billion purchase plan that gives Disney the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, substantially altering the entertainment landscape.Regulators in more than a dozen countries must still give their approval. But the shareholder votes brought to a close a six-month corporate showdown, waged across two continents by Disney and Comcast, for supremacy in the rapidly changing media business. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s trove represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain the bulk needed as a counterattack against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into Hollywood.\u201cAvatar,\u201d the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies, \u201cTitanic\u201d and TV shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d will now be owned by Disney. That adds to an already enviable content stockpile from divisions that include Lucasfilm, Marvel Entertainment and Pixar Animation Studios. The deal also gives Disney the cable networks FX and National Geographic; a controlling stake in the streaming service Hulu, which has more than 20 million subscribers; and Star, one of India\u2019s fastest growing media companies.Some people in Hollywood see the acquisition as the sad ending of an era. Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online, and this move could set off a wave of mergers in the film business, which has not seen significant consolidation since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox.A smaller number of companies control of a greater portion of TV shows and films, potentially altering where \u2014 and how \u2014 we see our favorite series, movies or actors.\u201cOne of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the deal in December. \u201cWe believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it\u2019s our highest priority.\u201d\u201cEveryone has decided that the future is owning both the content and the distribution,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a longtime media analyst.At the Disney meeting, shareholders voted on one item. Disney\u2019s final offer was made up of equal parts cash and stock \u2014 $35.7 billion in cash, 343 million shares \u2014 and Disney investors had to approve the issuing of those shares. The meeting lasted all of nine minutes. Disney said that voters controlling 68 percent of outstanding shares voted by proxy ahead of the meeting. Of those, 99 percent voted to approve. (There was a lone voice of dissent. When Alan N. Braverman, Disney\u2019s general counsel, opened the floor for shareholder comments, one man stood up and muttered, \u201cI think we are overpaying.\u201d)The Fox shareholder meeting took place in a much smaller ballroom on a subterranean level, with fewer than 60 people present. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. But near the end, a longtime shareholder, Philip Berman, stood up at the microphone and said, \u201cRupert\u2019s dream is complete.\u201dThe deal ends Mr. Murdoch\u2019s reign over an entertainment empire he spent six decades building. He will become a significant minority shareholder in Disney and will continue to run his remaining businesses, which include Fox News, the Fox broadcasting network, the cable network FS1 and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and The Sun in Britain.\u201cI want to thank all of our executives and colleagues for their enormous contributions in building 21st Century Fox over the past decades,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in a statement after the votes.Analysts expect that Disney will clear those hurdles by early 2019.American antitrust regulators approved the merger on the condition that Disney, which already owns ESPN, divest all of Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks, which include channels like the Yankees\u2019 YES network. Guggenheim Securities has estimated the value of the chain at $22 billion.\u201cWhile on paper the assets should be attractive, a lack of bidders could drive a relatively lower valuation,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a July 19 report.Mr. Iger said in a statement after the meetings that he was looking forward to \u201cwelcoming 21st Century Fox\u2019s stellar talent to Disney and ultimately integrating our businesses to provide consumers around the world with more appealing content and entertainment options.\u201dThere is no guarantee, however, that he will pull off the herculean task of integrating Fox, which has a drastically different corporate culture.

{"Headline": "The Constitutional Amendment That Reinvented Freedom", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 14th Amendment, the one that empowered the Bill of Rights, turns 150 on Saturday.Mr. Stiles is an author and historian.This month marks the 150th anniversary of the Constitution as we know it \u2014 the glorious, flawed, unexpected moment when our basic law was transformed into a charter of human rights. Its glories define us. But so do its flaws. It shapes almost every issue we debate today: immigration, racial and gender equality, voter suppression, free speech, corporations and federal power. Its history destroys the notion that freedom grew steadily over time \u2014 that the founders bestowed liberty on white men, which was gradually extended to others. Rather, the amendment reinvented freedom. It established birthright citizenship, required \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cequal protection\u201d of the law for everyone, and put the federal government in the business of policing liberty. It removed race and ethnicity from the legal definition of American identity.It\u2019s often called one of the \u201cCivil War Amendments,\u201d along with the 13th (abolishing slavery) and the 15th (prohibiting racial limits on the right to vote). But almost no one anticipated such a far-reaching measure during the war, or even after the Confederacy collapsed in May 1865. In 1860, four free states had constitutional prohibitions on the immigration of black people across their borders; in 1865, only five of 20 Union states allowed black men to vote. A race-neutral definition of citizenship and individual rights, let alone black enfranchisement, seemed absurd to most white men.A political crisis driven by African-Americans changed everything. During the war, they defied white expectations by starting what the historian Steven Hahn calls the greatest slave rebellion in history, seizing on the upheaval of war to flee and fight for freedom. Afterward, they asserted themselves in ways large and small, from picking their own surnames to insisting on equal dignity, especially in the case of former Union soldiers. It prompted a backlash. Southern states passed \u201cblack codes\u201d that virtually re-enslaved African-Americans. Confederate veterans killed countless people and organized into the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. Deadly police riots in Memphis and New Orleans in 1866 began with attacks on black veterans and political activists. This oppression overturned Northern assumptions. Even unapologetically racist voters and politicians reacted with outrage: Here were rebels, seen as traitors, attacking loyal black people, including many Union veterans. Something had to be done.Specifically, something had to be done to stop President Andrew Johnson. The stubborn and insulting Johnson, Lincoln\u2019s successor, sided with the white South, which drove Congress to pass the first Civil Rights Act over his veto. The battle led Republicans to conclude that the Constitution itself had to be changed.But if white Americans reconstructed the law, they did not reconstruct themselves. Bigotry suffused the debate, and infiltrated the amendment itself. In a half-step toward enfranchising the freed people, the 14th Amendment penalizes states that withhold the vote from \u201cmale\u201d citizens \u2014 the first use of that adjective in the Constitution. The historian Joshua Paddison notes how Western congressmen complained that ethnic Chinese would become citizens, stating that \u201cheathens\u201d had no place here. The 14th's framers replied that birthright should apply to all and that restrictions in naturalization law would minimize the problem. Asians became a lasting focus of nativist obsession over immigration, seen in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.A previous version of a caption for a political cartoon with this article misspelled the surname of the cartoonist. He was Thomas Nast, not Nash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesWhether an ant becomes a worker or colony royalty may depend on insulin metabolism.The critical factor for determining which ants become queens or workers may be as simple as some extra insulin.\u201cInsulin signaling \u2014 and this ILP2 version of insulin \u2014 seems to be at the core of these queen-worker differences,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. In one species, the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, the team added this hormone to worker ants and activated their ovaries. This suggests that an extra dose of insulin may make the difference between foraging for food like a worker or laying eggs like a queen.The team also found that insulin levels drop in worker ants when they\u2019re exposed to ant larvae. A bit like people getting hungry when their insulin levels fall, these worker ants are driven to seek food when they are exposed to larvae \u2014 which they then feed to their hungry young.\u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, that\u2019s a pretty clever way to make an organism social,\u201d Dr. Kronauer said. Ant ancestors developed the queen-worker social structure because it provided an evolutionary advantage. The new study suggests that insulin signaling could have driven that evolution.There are 14,000 species of ants, all of which are believed to share the same mechanism of differentiation between queens and workers. Wasps, bees and other insects are thought to have evolved along another pathway, so insulin signaling is unlikely to be the defining distinction for them, said Roberto Bonasio, a molecular biologist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. \u201cI think the question is, how does something so difficult seem to happen repeatedly in different branches of life?\u201d said Dr. Bonasio, whose lab studies how genes change in the brain as ants change behavior. With this experiment, the researchers lend support to the theory that changes in insulin signaling is one of the ways this can come about, he said. In people, when we eat, insulin is released into the bloodstream, enabling cells to take in sugar and use it for energy. Problems with this insulin system lead to diabetes. In ants, these insulin-like peptides regulate a lot of activities including metabolism, longevity and reproduction, Dr. Bonasio said. There is more work to be done to confirm these findings and to figure out what other types of genes are at work, he said. Such genetic analysis is tricky, he added, and more than half of key genes identified in the study were involved in activities other than insulin signaling. Advertisement"}

Over the long term, that trend will probably help the Democrats \u2014 the party of the country\u2019s growing demographic groups. In the short term, though, it presents some real risks. First, a little history: The Obama presidency started the new era of racialized politics. And it wasn\u2019t because of Barack Obama\u2019s actions. Academic research has found that he talked about race less often than any president since \u2014 get this \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

It turns out they didn\u2019t need it.So he left it there, \u201cin case it may be useful in the future,\u201d he said on Twitter.Once the last four boys, their soccer coach and military personnel were evacuated Tuesday, Thai officials said in a Facebook post that the mission was complete. It had taken 18 days, dozens of divers and hundreds of volunteers, but Mr. Musk\u2019s mini-submarine invention was left on the sidelines, a Thai official said.Mr. Musk himself was on the scene. He wrote in a tweet early on Tuesday local time that he had just returned from a large cavern in the Tham Luang cave complex where he had deposited the quickly assembled sub. \u201cIt is made of rocket parts,\u201d he explained. \u201cLeaving here in case it may be useful in the future.\u201dOn Tuesday, the head of the search operation, Narongsak Osottanakorn, until recently the provincial governor, rejected the notion that Mr. Musk\u2019s custom-made submersible was suitable for the extraction.\u201cI assure you that the equipment he brought to help us is not practical for our mission,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said. \u201cEven though the equipment has state of the art technology, it does not fit our mission in the cave.\u201dMr. Musk had mused on Twitter that they could build a \u201ctiny, kid-sized submarine\u201d with a part from a Falcon rocket, which SpaceX produces. He had said that a transfer tube, which helps move liquid oxygen to fuel the rocket\u2019s engine, could serve as the body of the submarine.Mr. Musk\u2019s representatives did not make him available for comment, but a SpaceX spokesman said that divers with the mission had signed off on the efforts.\u201cMultiple divers involved with the rescue said the mini-sub design was viable, and their feedback directly informed our engineering and testing,\u201d he said.The company did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether it planned to remove the abandoned submarine from the cave area.In his tweets amid the rescue, Mr. Musk presented his own evidence that team leaders had welcomed his help. He said of Mr. Narongsak: \u201cThe former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as \u2018rescue chief\u2019) is not the subject matter expert.\u201dBut a spokesman for Mr. Stanton said Tuesday that the cave proved to be too narrow for the mini-submarine.Muktita Suhartono reported from Mae Sai, Thailand, and Julia Jacobs from New York.Advertisement"}

As with many such things, the simplest preparations are usually the best: My go-to approach with scallops is to pan-sear or grill them, which concentrates their flavor and gives them a crisp exterior. If outdoor grilling isn\u2019t possible, use a ridged stovetop grill or a cast-iron pan, cranked up to nearly smoking. Large scallops, about two ounces each, are ideal for grilling or pan-searing. Whatever the size, it\u2019s most important to look for the best scallops: usually called dry-packed, day boat or diver scallops. This means they haven\u2019t been treated with sodium bisulfite (or another preservative solution), which bleaches them, plumps them with water, and makes them nearly impossible to brown. The trick here is to grill the scallops long enough on the first side. Let them brown and crisp well \u2014 otherwise they\u2019ll stick and have an anemic appearance.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the past two decades, antitrust enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe. Mr. Zingales is a co-host of the podcast Capitalisn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the first time. Just last year the European Commission (the administrative arm of the European Union) fined Google $2.8 billion for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in the search engine market, a charge that the American Federal Trade Commission had dropped a few years earlier. Is this the first salvo in an incoming trade war or a form of tax-thy-neighbor policy? Dangerous, because it will deflect from asking the real important question: Is there something wrong with American antitrust? Perhaps there is a reason Americans are paying so much more for smartphones in the United States than Europeans are. In the old days America was laughing at the \u201cnational champion\u201d strategy pursued by Continental Europe, where domestic consumers\u2019 interest was sacrificed to project local companies into the world. It seems that the table has turned now. The Google fine should not be used to escalate the commercial tension with Europe, but to start a soul searching about the proper level of government intervention to preserve competition in America.

{"Headline": "Google Shrugs Off $5.1 Billion Fine With Another Big Quarter", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 European authorities took their best swing, but it appears that Google hardly felt it.Alphabet\u2019s stock rose 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, and some analysts recommended the company\u2019s shares. With the regulatory issue settled, they said, Google could get back to focusing on selling ads across the internet.\u201cIt\u2019s like a delivery company having to pay for a parking ticket,\u201d Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst, said of the penalty, which Alphabet accounted for in the second quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a meaningful fine in the context of the size of this company.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s previous record fine was also aimed at Google, a $2.7 billion levy it imposed last year for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in its search results. Google booked that charge in the same quarter a year ago \u2014 and still posted a $3.5 billion profit.More substantive than the fine are the changes that will come to the company\u2019s Android software, which backs 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. European authorities ordered Google to stop effectively requiring phone makers in Europe to install Google\u2019s search engine and Chrome internet browser on their devices in order to use the Android software.Such a change could mean fewer people using Google\u2019s search engine on their phones, which would undercut an advertising business that is fueled by users clicking on ads in mobile search results.But it is Google that is responsible for crafting a remedy, and it will have much incentive to propose one that limits the impact on its business. After Google complied with last year\u2019s European Union\u2019s charges related to its shopping service, competitors complained that its solution did little to reduce the harm to their businesses.Google is \u201clooking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said on a call with analysts on Monday.Mr. Pichai said Google planned to appeal the charges, though it still must implement a remedy by mid-October or risk more fines. (The company said it was depositing the fine payment in a holding account while the legal process unfolds.) He said last week that Android lowered prices for consumers and encouraged competition in the smartphone market by helping handset makers compete with Apple. Google has said that it provides Android for free to phone makers and it must recoup its expenses by including its services with the software.Europe\u2019s new data privacy rule, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, appeared to have had little effect on Google\u2019s bottom line. The law, which restricts how companies obtain and handle users\u2019 information, sent many businesses scrambling to comply earlier this year. But some analysts believe Google and its partner in the digital-advertising duopoly, Facebook, stand to benefit from the rules because they can afford to comply while smaller competitors might not.Mr. Wieser said that after reviewing Google\u2019s earnings, the privacy rule \u201cprobably helped, at least in the European numbers.\u201d Alphabet\u2019s revenues rose 26 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East over the same period a year ago, though some of the increase was related to currency fluctuations.Alphabet\u2019s revenues in the quarter increased 26 percent to $32.7 billion as users clicked on more of the ads that Google serves atop its search results and before YouTube videos. Alphabet earned $11.75 a share in the quarter, excluding the fine, easily beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $9.54 a share.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is a Genetically Modified Crop? A European Ruling Sows Confusion", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Europe, plants created with gene-editing technologies will be stringently regulated as G.M.O.\u2019s. But older crops whose DNA has been altered will be left alone.Mushrooms that don\u2019t brown. Wheat that fights off disease. Tomatoes with a longer growing season.Many scientists responded to the decision with dismay, predicting that countries in the developing world would follow Europe\u2019s lead, blocking useful gene-edited crops from reaching farms and marketplaces. The ruling may also curtail exports from the United States, which has taken a more lenient view of gene-edited foods. \u201cYou\u2019re not just affecting Europe, you\u2019re affecting the world with this decision,\u201d said Matthew Willmann, the director of the Plant Transformation Facility at Cornell University.But the ruling also raises a more fundamental question: What does it actually mean for a crop to be genetically modified? In its decision, the European Union court exempted crops produced through older methods of altering DNA, saying they were not genetically modified organisms. That assertion left many scientists scratching their heads. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they are doing that,\u201d said Jennifer Kuzma, an expert in genetic engineering at North Carolina State University. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Do they have the right science advice?\u2019\u201d Since the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, all crop breeding has come down to altering the genetic composition of plants. For centuries, farmers selected certain plants to breed, or crossed varieties, hoping to pass useful traits to future generations. In the early 20th century, scientists discovered genes and invented new ways to breed crops. Two lines of corn, for example, could be melded into hybrid plants that were superior to either parent. By the 1920s, researchers realized that they didn\u2019t have to content themselves with amplifying the genetic variations that already existed in plants. They could create new mutations. To do so, they fired X-rays at plants or used chemicals that disrupted plant DNA. Mutagenesis, as this method came to be known, introduced random mutations into plants. Scientists inspected the mutants to find those that were improvements. Thousands of plant breeds in use today, from strawberries to barley, are the product of mutagenesis. In the 1970s, microbiologists figured out how to insert genes from humans and other species into bacteria. Plant scientists later used recombinant DNA, as the technology came to be known, to develop methods for inserting genes into plants to improve their growth. Some varieties of corn, for example, received a gene from bacteria that allowed the crops to produce an insect-killing toxin. These came to be known as genetically modified crops, and they sparked a storm of controversy.Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth raised concerns that genetically modified crops posed unpredictable dangers. The plants might escape farmers\u2019 fields and spread through wild ecosystems, for instance, perhaps hybridizing with wild plants and introducing their genes into new species.Environmental groups also raised the possibility that genetically modified crops could harm human health. Genetically modified crops not only produce proteins from their own genes, but from the genes of other species, as well.On opposite sides of the Atlantic, the conflict has played out in very different ways. While the government has put in place a number of regulations governing genetically modified crops, the industry has boomed. Over 185 million acres of these crops were planted in the United States in 2017.In Europe, by contrast, concerns about genetically modified organisms led the European Union to issue a directive in 2001. From the early stages of research to the marketplace, these products would have to pass a series of tests for environmental risks and human safety.But the directive made it clear that crops made through older forms of mutagenesis were not genetically modified organisms because they were \u201cconventional\u201d and had \u201ca long safety record.\u201dThe result of the directive has been that Europe grows almost no genetically modified crops. In 2017, only 325,000 acres were planted across the continent. In the years after the E.U.\u2019s directive came out, science advanced beyond recombinant DNA. Rather than inserting a gene from another species, researchers learned to snip out piece of a plant\u2019s DNA, or even rewrite short stretches of genetic material.Instead of inserting foreign genes, scientists were able to edit a plant\u2019s own DNA in new ways. They could create crops that make more, or fewer, proteins from their own genes, gaining advantageous traits. When scientists first started experimenting with gene editing on crops, the European Union offered no clear guidance. In 2015, a French agricultural union and allies such as Friends of the Earth went to court to have gene-edited crops labeled as genetically modified organisms \u2014 and regulated as such. And now the court has agreed. In a statement, the court said gene-edited crops were GMOs \u201cwithin the meaning of the G.M.O. Directive.\u201dDana Perls, the senior food and agriculture campaigner at Friends of the Earth, praised the court for recognizing gene editing as genetic modification. \u201cWe need to call it what it is,\u201d she said.Ms. Perls said that Crispr and other new methods for tinkering with plant DNA raise concerns about safety, just as recombinant DNA did. \u201cGene-editing technologies have unintended consequences,\u201d she said.Ms. Perls pointed to some scientific journal articles that describe how Crispr and other forms of gene editing can miss their targets, accidentally altering other stretches of DNA in an organism.But one of the authors of those papers, Jeffrey D. Wolt, a professor of agronomy and toxicology at Iowa State University, was dismayed by the E.U. court ruling. \u201cIt all boils down to legal interpretations of the directive rather than the weight of the science,\u201d he said.Dr. Wolt said that it\u2019s important to distinguish Crispr research on plants and the use of gene editing to develop new medical treatments. There are many opportunities in plant experiments to screen out unwanted mutations. As a result, the chances of unexpected mutations in gene-edited plants are falling to low levels.Dr. Wolt said that there wasn\u2019t a strong scientific reason to consider gene-edited plants to be G.M.O.s while exempting crops created in the old way, with X-rays and chemicals producing many random mutations at once. \u201cIt\u2019s hairsplitting,\u201d he said. The United States is continuing to veer from Europe. In March, the Department of Agriculture announced that it was not planning to regulate gene-edited crops as it does crops with foreign genes inserted with recombinant DNA. As a result, Crispr-edited crops like mushrooms are expected to move quickly into the American marketplace. But these crops may be barred from import into Europe.Strictly speaking, however, the United States stance also is contradictory. Crops created with recombinant DNA are said to be genetically modified organisms, because genes have been inserted into their DNA. Yet tinkering with a plant\u2019s DNA with Crispr is apparently not genetic modification, because these crops \u201care indistinguishable from those developed through traditional breeding methods,\u201d according to a U.S.D.A. statement issued in March.Dr. Wolt said that the only way to escape these contradictions would be for government regulators to stop focusing on mutagenesis, recombinant DNA, Crispr and other methods for making new crops. \u201cIt\u2019s the products we should be concerned with,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as we solve this problem favorably or unfavorably for Crispr, there\u2019s going to be a new technology that comes along and we\u2019re going to have the same problem again.\u201d Advertisement"}

Then she calmed, suddenly serious, and said, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s you?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant. She said, \u201cWhat if we\u2019re here in five years and we\u2019re it for each other?\u201d \u201cLike, what if in five years we look at each other and realize it\u2019s time to date?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201clike what if in five years it\u2019s you and it\u2019s this friendship and maybe we date other people but at the end of the day it\u2019s you?\u201d I smiled, imagining the two of us older than our mid-20s, still sitting below big trees in rainstorms, laughing and not wanting to get out of the car. She gazed ahead. \u201cI am so terrified of hurting you.\u201d I put down the lipstick and reached for her. \u201cMirah, you are the safest person I have ever loved.\u201dShe put her face in her hands and cried, and all I could see was her thick black hair, her jean jacket with the \u201cfierce love\u201d pin. That night was the first time Mirah and I acknowledged just how much our lives had molded around each other. Neither of us knew how to describe what we were. When someone asked if we were dating, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re in love.\u201dMirah smiled when she heard the story. She made her profile picture the two of us laughing on a bench. One day she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the best when I show up to parties and people ask me where you are.\u201d We spent evenings on my front porch reading articles aloud with titles such as \u201cMarriage Is Murder,\u201d \u201cThe Future of Queer\u201d and \u201cAgainst the Couple Form.\u201d We dreamed about what our lives could look like if we gave ourselves permission to be free from conventions. I was mortified at the thought of absorbing into a couple, and I knew it would be difficult, but I wanted to build a life of commitment where friendships mattered as much as romantic partnership. She emailed me a tweet from someone that said, \u201cThe best decisions I have ever made were made possible by my inability to invest in heterosexual narratives of love. The fact of being queer weirdly saved me from so much loneliness, even as it demographically made intimacy so much harder to find.\u201dI sent back a line of heart-eye emoji, and later, parked below my apartment windows on an early winter evening, Mirah put her arm around my shoulders and said, \u201cSammy, you are my epicenter.\u201dAnd for a while I was. Mirah picked me up for work every morning, I made her lunch on Sundays, and we made a beeline for each other in crowded rooms. She became No. 1 on my speed dial; we talked every day.When I thought I had bedbugs, she was the one I called in a panic. She came over with an acupressure mat, an iPhone tuned to the sound of waves and a flashlight.\u201cI\u2019m anxious,\u201d I said as I lay crying on the floor.\u201cI know,\u201d she said as she stood above me. For the first time I admitted (just to myself, in a whisper) how good it felt to rely on someone. Mirah pried me open and slowly I trusted she would be there, every time, solid. I started picturing my life with her always in it. Whatever shape our relationship took \u2014 because we had insisted on the permission to let ourselves change \u2014 I expected the changes would be small and that she would be central. But then Mirah told me about a woman she was going to date. This person wasn\u2019t like the cute queers Mirah had dated during our friendship, all of whom were already dating someone else, or emotionally unavailable, or not nearly astounding enough for her. This was someone Mirah had an actual, genuine crush on. She told me, like a confession, that she wanted romantic partnership, and that she might even want it to be primary, the central thing she builds her life around. And I wanted to shrivel that feeling inside of her until it atrophied and died. But I couldn\u2019t, so I strained to fit her vision of what she wanted.\u201cMaybe we should date,\u201d I said. Couldn\u2019t we make that work? Weren\u2019t we already in love and spending time together and talking every day?She shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to kiss you.\u201dAnd I had to admit that sometimes I imagine her lying next to me, and like a thought experiment I pretend we\u2019re lovers. I picture us laughing, and I brush her hair behind her ear. I hold her hand and count the rings she wears. I feel how small she is, only 5 feet and skinny, and I say, \u201cTell me everything about your day.\u201dShe looks at me with bright eyes, but it stops there. I never kiss her. Just imagining it gives me a tight, wound feeling, and I know we\u2019re not the ones to do that with each other. So I was silent for a long time and then said, \u201cThe question for me, Mirah, is in the event of an apocalypse, whose house are you running to?\u201d The tender part of me that had come to rely on her was screaming. I added in a terrified but certain voice, \u201cI am running to you.\u201dAnd then the woman who had pried me open, who had told me in the same car and under the same windows that I was her epicenter, stared through the windshield and said coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in hierarchies.\u201dIn the days afterward I tried to talk myself out of feeling hurt. I convinced myself I was holding on too tightly, asking too much, being unreasonable. But the truth is I wanted Mirah to turn to me and hold back laughter while she said, \u201cOf course I would run to you,\u201d as if it were the most obvious thing. People tell me, \u201cThis is normal\u201d and, \u201cThis is what happens when friends fall in love.\u201d But I was completely unprepared.But Mirah wasn\u2019t choosing me. Worse, I was going to have to watch her choose someone else. And worse still, I couldn\u2019t rail against her decision because we had promised to let each other change.I almost walked away, as if this all had been an experiment and a terrible mistake. But I couldn\u2019t. Underneath the hurt that she would choose someone else and the embarrassment of having come to rely on her, I didn\u2019t want to give up on radical friendship. And I didn\u2019t want to give up on Mirah. I would have to put her down by saying, \u201cShe gave in to the thing we reviled.\u201d Or put myself down by saying, \u201cMy dreams are impossible, I expect too much.\u201d And none of that felt right. A few weeks after our apocalypse conversation, Mirah and I went to a party together and she cupped her hand around my ear. \u201cI put you as my emergency contact,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere it asked for relationship, I wrote, \u2018family.\u2019\u201dIn that moment, under dimmed lights, I got the same beaming feeling I get every time she chooses me, and I saw that she doesn\u2019t want to lose me, either. But something had shifted, and I didn\u2019t smile. This time, I was the one who sat rigid and stared ahead \u2014 because it wasn\u2019t enough. I was quiet, wondering how it all fit together, and I realized, not with relief but with clarity: Neither of us knows how to do this.Sammy Sass is a graduate student and writer in Boston.Advertisement"}

But the cross-pollination has taken more logistical forms, too.In the week before New York\u2019s primary, Ms. Salazar helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez with get-out-the-vote efforts, as did an organizer for Ms. Pressley, who traveled from Boston to participate. Since the election, volunteers for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez (who is virtually guaranteed victory in November\u2019s general election in her predominantly Democratic district) have migrated to those of Ms. Teachout and Ms. Salazar; Ms. Teachout\u2019s aides, who previously coordinated volunteers via phone calls, have begun dispatching them through a group chat on WhatsApp, a tactic adopted from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign.Ms. Salazar, who like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, said she had heard from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s volunteers before their campaign was even over.\u201cThere used to be a tendency to operate with this vision of scarcity, rather than a vision of abundance, when it comes to political capital,\u201d Ms. Salazar said. \u201cI think that we see a shift.\u201dOur Revolution, the progressive organization led by alumni of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, is planning to unroll a project, called Our Revolution(ary) Women. The effort is designed to help the female candidates in New York it has endorsed, including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Salazar and Ms. Nixon, amplify each other\u2019s platforms.Rebecca Katz, an adviser to Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in New York, said such a spirit of partnership was previously unthinkable in the transactional world of politics.\u201cDo you know how long it takes for someone to send an email on your behalf?\u201d said Ms. Katz, a veteran strategist who has worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio and the former Nevada senator, Harry Reid. \u201cFor women candidates, especially, that has been extremely hard. There\u2019s usually so much back and forth, back and forth, please, can I have an endorsement?\u201dAnd while past collaborations had often focused on more intangible goods such as encouragement or ideas, \u201cwhat goes a little bit further, which is the sharing of actual resources, in some ways, of the campaign \u2014 that, I\u2019m not aware of historically,\u201d Professor Dittmar said.It is also uncertain if the nationwide excitement she has generated for candidates such as Ms. Nixon or Ms. Bush will energize the specific constituencies they need to elect them.But with many of these female candidates facing challengers whose fund-raising dwarfs theirs, collaborating may be a product not just of camaraderie but also of necessity.\u201cThey\u2019re folks that aren\u2019t necessarily endorsed by the party or don\u2019t have access to the party networks,\u201d Professor Dittmar said. \u201cSo in order to build that support base \u2014 among voters, but especially in terms of finances and volunteers \u2014 they have to build something new or at least draw from existing infrastructure for progressive candidates.\u201d\u201cI trust them in ways that I just don\u2019t have the trust from regular politicians,\u201d Ms. McGrath said of her fellow Naval Academy graduates. \u201cThey aren\u2019t one, and I\u2019m not one.\u201dBut most female candidates agreed that the most important outcome of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory was the legitimacy it lent to networks of women that many had previously dismissed.\u201cI do sense a huge difference now,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.\u201cI think when people see that we are using this bullhorn for something that\u2019s not self-interested,\u201d she added, \u201cthey\u2019re more likely to pay attention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Wall Street Missed at Facebook", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShould Wall Street have seen the problems brewing at Facebook?The company\u2019s stock plunged 19 percent on Thursday, wiping out roughly $120 billion of its market value, after it reported disappointing financial results that surprised investors and stock analysts.Spotting trouble at companies is never easy. Senior executives often don\u2019t go out of their way to shed light on difficulties, and they may be slow to see problems. But Wall Street firms and investment managers pride themselves on having a strong grasp of what\u2019s going on at large companies. In Facebook\u2019s case, they clearly didn\u2019t, even though there was much that was concerning. Here are some of the things that were missed.Before even getting to the political and regulatory pressures on Facebook, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not easy squeezing digital advertising revenue out of the clicks and swipes of social media users. The difficulties at Twitter and Snap in recent years have clearly shown this. How do you bring in new users, how do you keep them coming back, and how do you get them to click on ads? Investors assumed Facebook was different. The company\u2019s ad revenue had surged since it began introducing ads and a large portion of what advertisers spent online went to Facebook. But after Facebook\u2019s executives on Wednesday suggested growth might slow, investors have to contemplate that Facebook may not be that different from its mortal peers.One of the biggest mysteries hanging over the company is whether its main Facebook website is becoming a drag on its business. If so, the company may be relying on Instagram and other products to bolster its growth, and they may still be too small to pick up the slack. Facebook does not break out how much advertising revenue comes from each product, however. This prevents outsiders from assessing whether the main Facebook website is becoming stale in its most lucrative markets, the United States and Europe. Investors often view a lack of transparency as a reason to be cautious about a company. With Facebook, they did not.On a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, David Wehner, said: \u201cInstagram is growing more quickly and making an increasing contribution to growth, and we\u2019ve been pleased with how Instagram is growing.\u201dBut the scandals and new rules may be creating an environment in which people become less enthusiastic about Facebook\u2019s platforms and use them less, further slowing growth in advertising revenue. User numbers fell in Europe in the second quarter.Protecting Facebook from dangerous content is also expensive. The company has made it clear recently that it would spend large sums (though it does not disclose how much) to prevent election meddling and stamp out hate speech, but investors may have underestimated the costs. These investments will be worth it, if they prevent future abuse of Facebook\u2019s network. But investors may only now grasp that policing the biggest information exchange in the world does not come cheap. Content monitoring expenses, along with the costs of keeping the network engaging for users and profitable for advertisers, are contributing to a surge in spending that is eroding its profitability. Facebook\u2019s revenue in the second quarter grew 42 percent from a year earlier, but its total costs grew 50 percent.Advertisement"}

She founded the magazine Woman Rebel, which was often banned by the post office. She was charged with sending information about contraception through the mail. She fled to Europe but retuned to New York when the charges were dropped. In 1916, she opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brownsville, Brooklyn.Other suggestions from readers for statues of inspiring women include:Here\u2019s what else is happening:The stormy weather is sputtering out.The weekend is superb: sunny skies and highs of 85.Saturday Sunday When we stopped by yesterday afternoon to see how the effort was going, Con Edison employees were working near the site of the ruptured pipe and dozens of police officers were directing pedestrians around Fifth Avenue between 20th and 22nd Streets, where traffic was still restricted on Thursday and will be today.Out of the 45 buildings that were in the so-called \u201chot zone,\u201d 36 have been cleared and are being reoccupied as of Thursday, according to the mayor\u2019s office.

{"Headline": "Trying to Flip the House, ZIP Code by ZIP Code", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEthan Todras-Whitehill, executive director of the nascent political action group Swing Left, stood near the staircase inside the lobby of the St. James Theater in Manhattan, home of the musical \u201cFrozen.\u201d It was a Tuesday afternoon in mid-June, and the bearded Mr. Todras-Whitehill was dressed in jeans and a blue blazer, as well as a new shirt bought earlier that day at H & M after the one he\u2019d been wearing was deemed unacceptable for television. (There was a crew from MSNBC in attendance.)Mr. Todras-Whitehill seemed unbothered by the subtle change in attire. Since he and two close friends \u2014 none of whom then worked in politics \u2014 led the formal launch of Swing Left in January 2017 with the aim of flipping the House of Representatives to Democratic control in the 2018 midterms, Mr. Todras-Whitehill has quickly acclimated to his newfound prominence in the world of grass-roots politics.Swing Left\u2019s mission of identifying 78 swing districts, 23 of which would have to be flipped in order to return the Democrats to power in the House, has found a receptive audience. The group has more than 400,000 members and has raised more than $9 million in donations so far.\u201cI like the fact that they come from outside politics,\u201d said Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief and Cond\u00e9 Nast creative director, an early supporter of the group. (At one point, another attendee at the St. James event, the actor Mandy Patinkin, whirled around to take a picture of Ms. Wintour on his smartphone.) \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have very good hearts and are super smart, but they\u2019ve been doing it in the same way for a long time.\u201dIn some ways, Swing Left\u2019s strategy is strictly a numbers game. The group did not vet or support specific candidates based on a set of issues. Instead, it decided to raise money earmarked for whoever won the Democratic primaries in targeted districts, keeping the contributions in escrow \u2014 in so-called district funds \u2014 until general election campaigns began. Mr. Todras-Whitehill wondered whether it was even possible to raise money if the group did not know the identities of the candidates it would ultimately support. Swing Left\u2019s lawyers assured him it was.\u201cYou turn the music off and you have a lot of people who had been drinking,\u201d Ms. Lim said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, when the speeches started, \u201ceveryone just listened. I don\u2019t know if it was an \u2018A-Ha\u2019 moment, but people were engaged.\u201d\u201cI felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want to bother people,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sedgwick said. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not really bothering them. I\u2019m passing along something that\u2019s crucially important for the future of our country.\u2019\u201dIn many ways Swing Left is modeled less on a political organization than on a Silicon Valley start-up. Its founders saw a need for a product \u2014 one that allowed people to easily identify their nearest swing district by simply typing in their ZIP code and seeing what nearby races they might want to get involved in.In a glassy conference room inside a midtown WeWork space the day following the St. James gathering, Mr. Todras-Whitehill, 37, asked, \u201cWhat do tech start-ups focus on?\u201d and then answered his own question. \u201cThey focus on having a clean, appealing product that fills the need of the user,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd one of the big innovations is thinking about our user \u2014 our volunteers as we call them \u2014 almost as a customer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s built into our DNA from the very beginning.\u201d (Swing Left identifies districts to target through a variety of factors including 2016 results, polling, past presidential elections and demographic and geographic indicators.)What began as an all-volunteer organization now has 25 full-time staff members, including one who deals with human resources issues. Two of the original founders have since left the organization, and a professional political organizer has been brought on board: Matt Ewing, a former national field director for MoveOn.org, who is now the group\u2019s chief community officer.It goes without saying that it didn\u2019t take much for Mr. Todras-Whitehill and the others from Swing Left to win over the audience. After the event, sitting in the darkened theater, Mr. Roth joked the location and crowd wasn\u2019t just blue, but \u201cnavy blue\u201d bordering on \u201ccerulean.\u201dMr. Todras-Whitehill\u2019s involvement began on the morning of November 9, 2016, in a coffee shop in Amherst, Mass., close to where he now lives. As he thought about the election results the day before, he began to focus on the midterms two years later. He knew there would be little chance of retaking the Senate in 2018, given how few Republican seats would be at risk, and instead turned his attention toward the House.But the 2016 election results made getting involved feel more urgent, and Mr. Todras-Whitehill began looking for his nearest swing district. With some effort he found it. He then wondered why he had to do that much work. Where was the app?And that was the start. Mr. Todras-Whitehill reached out to a high school friend from his Upper West Side childhood, Joshua Krafchin, an entrepreneur, and his wife Miriam Stone, a branding strategist, both now living in the Bay Area. The couple quickly signed on.They thought about potential names, like \u201cAdopt-a-District\u201d and \u201cMake America Blue Again\u201d before settling on \u201cSwing Left.\u201d\u201cIt sounded like a movement,\u201d Mr. Todras-Whitehill said. \u201cAt that moment in time, we needed more than just a tool. We needed a movement.\u201dWith a cadre of a dozen friends from technology, marketing and media, they developed a website to fill a need they saw lacking: An easy apparatus to let people know which nearby congressional seats could possibly change from red to blue, and potential opportunities to make that happen.For instance, let\u2019s say you type in 80203, a ZIP code in the reliably blue enclave of Denver, Colo. What pops up is a map of the neighboring 6th District, anchored by Aurora, currently held by the Republican congressman Mike Coffman, along with the information that while Mr. Coffman \u201cwon this district by only 31,254 votes (8.3 percent)\u201d in 2016, it was also carried by Hillary Clinton that year and thus should be in play for 2018. (Says the site: \u201cDemocrat Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger and tireless advocate for veterans, can flip this critical seat!\u201d)Though some wanted their site, to go up as soon as possible, Ms. Finocchi preached patience. She had gone to college at Columbia University with Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone and saw Swing Left as an opportunity to act on her frustration over the 2016 vote. But, with most of the others, Ms. Finocchi had no experience in politics, having worked mostly in fashion and the arts.\u201cKnowing people were going to be thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Finocchi, said of the inauguration, \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s give people something to talk about the day before.\u2019\u201dThey had initially hoped to sign up 20,000 people by the end of March. Within a matter of days, however, that number had reached 200,000. This came about thanks to Twitter posts by celebrities like Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, and hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook. Roughly 10,000 people offered up their professional skills and expertise as a way of assisting the group. (Swing Left is technically a \u201cHybrid PAC,\u201d an organization that the Center for Responsive Politics, defines as having \u201cthe ability to operate both as a traditional political action committee, contributing funds to a candidate\u2019s committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures.\u201d)The group was something very real now, something that needed shape and structure. Also it didn\u2019t help that two of Swing Left\u2019s founders \u2014 Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone \u2014 had their second child soon after the organization began, forcing them to retreat from full-time leadership roles.Over the next few months, Swing Left began to build upon that initial fervor. On February 12, 2017, the group held a conference call that drew registrations from 17,000 people. The group encouraged the formation of house parties in different districts \u2014 the first round of which generated 700 across the country.But as Swing Left grew, it also had challenges with staffing. The organization could no longer have people exist in a quasi-volunteer role when the demands on their time demanded real salaries. In late March 2017, Swing Left established a \u201cDonate\u201d button on its home page. To date, Swing Left has raised over $9 million, half of which has been designated to candidates via district funds, with the rest allocated for a massive get-out-the vote effort this fall. That includes the funding of full-time staff salaries that range from roughly $4,000 to $10,000 per month.\u201cIt was a relief to feel that we could put aside our other obligations and make this our full-time focus,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cWe\u2019d all been burning the midnight oil because we had other responsibilities. It was great to be able to go back to my family and say, \u2018That thing? Now it\u2019s my job.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Civil War Portrayals\u2019 Glaring Omission", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat we found when we visited two battlefield re-enactments.In collections of famous last words, you are likely to find my ancestor, Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick of the Union Army. As he surveyed his troops\u2019 battle line, he said: \u201cThey couldn\u2019t shoot an elephant at this distance.\u201d Moments later, he was killed with a shot to the cheek by a Confederate sharpshooter. The re-enactors all told me to be proud that this history was in my blood. Their easy familiarity with \u201cUncle John\u201d points to the many advantages that Sedgwicks, who arrived on these shores in 1636, had getting into the history books. They were, after all, inclined to write them. For the nearly 600 re-enactors at Zoar, a weekend wrapped in scratchy wool and the culture of the 1860s was their idea of the perfect getaway. Many brought the whole family. While the \u201ccivilians\u201d \u2014 women, children and those physically unable to fight \u2014 kept the fires burning in camp, the soldiers ran drills and prepared for battle, picking straws for who had to die first. They were factory workers, teachers, lawyers and even veterans of today\u2019s wars. Some were descendants of Civil War soldiers. Most were men, and all loved history. For them, the experience is somewhere between a spiritual communion with the dead and a Boy Scouts\u2019 outing for grown-ups.Zoar, with its four square blocks of pristine 19th century, plays its part. Local volunteers dress up and churn butter for families and school groups. Residents are obligated to keep their homes looking quaintly Victorian. One troop organizer told me later that re-enacting was the fulfillment of a boyhood dream, and that it was a calling to inform the public about who really fought in the Civil War. \u201cWhen people think about black people in the Civil War, they think about slaves, but that\u2019s not the whole story,\u201d said Guyler Turner, an African-American who is the president of the 102nd Michigan United States Colored Troops, a group formed by descendants of Michigan\u2019s only black unit. \u201cI think this is meaningful to people, black or white.\u201dMany of the troops in the 102nd had been enslaved themselves and were fighting to free others from bondage. All re-enactors talk of the bravery of Civil War soldiers, but for the members of the 102nd, fighting in the South meant risking re-enslavement \u2014 or worse \u2014 if they were captured.The man, who asked not to be identified because of the disagreements among re-enactors over historical portrayals, said he was proud to honor the 102nd\u2019s daring confrontation of prejudice. \u201cThere was the idea that they would not make good soldiers because of their race, but they fought bravely,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to bring their stories to life for current audiences and expand people\u2019s understanding of who it was that actually participated in the war.\u201d Josephine Sedgwick is a senior news assistant at The Times.In the last decade or so, the crowds at large scale re-enactments have dwindled. Longtime hobbyists are aging out and retiring \u2014 soldiers in their 50s and 60s filled much of the camp at Gettysburg \u2014 and younger people aren\u2019t marching onto mock battlefields in nearly the same numbers.Enthusiasts cite a number of factors. Video games are to blame, some grouse, while others attribute the decline to the rising expense of gear. A reproduction Civil War rifle alone can cost more than $1,000.But many are more introspective about it. In the 1980s and \u201990s, \u201cthe whole tone of the country was different,\u201d said Thomas Downes, 68, a retired machinist from Cleveland, who has been re-enacting for the Union side for 38 years.\u201cUp until the last five or 10 years, the social causes of the war did not come into what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were paying tribute to the fighting man.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018I\u2019m racist and I want to glorify slavery,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNobody really thought a lot about the social reasons of why the South went to war. It was just these poor guys who were underfed, undermanned, underequipped, fighting valiantly to the last man, until they couldn\u2019t stand anymore.\u201dBrad Keefer, a 61-year-old corporal in the Union re-enactor ranks and a professor of history at Kent State University, said: \u201cRe-enactors look at the war as a four-year period between 1861 and 1865 in which you can cut out all the stuff leading up to the war and very much ignore everything that happened afterward.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t get tangled up in all the messy bits, which are the causes and outcomes, which are complicated and uncomfortable,\u201d he said.It\u2019s a vision of history placed in narrow context. The military details are meticulously researched and recreated down to the stitching of a uniform, but the broader social and political realities of the Civil War \u2014 the profound struggle over slavery and emancipation, racism and equality, citizenship and disenfranchisement \u2014 are largely confined to the margins.Still, those issues can no longer be ignored. After a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, where demonstrators wore swastikas and carried Confederate flags, and where an anti-racist protester named Heather Heyer was killed, at least two smaller Civil War re-enactments were canceled.

{"Headline": "The Cost of Policing Facebook and Twitter Is Spooking Wall St. It Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine it\u2019s next December and evidence is mounting that Russian-backed entities were widely active across Facebook and Twitter ahead of the midterm elections.Users are fleeing the social media companies, and members of Congress are talking about stringent legislation to restrict what the two firms can and can\u2019t do. The stocks of Twitter and Facebook go into free fall.Today, the two companies are spending large sums to prevent that outcome. But, in a possible sign of Wall Street\u2019s myopia, investors are punishing them for doing so. When Facebook and Twitter this week reported a surge in costs, driven by efforts to secure their networks, investors dumped their stocks. Facebook\u2019s shares plunged 19 percent on Thursday, and Twitter\u2019s slid 21 percent on Friday.The sheer amount of the spending may explain some of Wall Street\u2019s nervousness. Facebook and Twitter don\u2019t break out the costs directly related to locking down and cleaning up their networks, but broader measures of expenses ballooned. Company executives said the increases were partly driven by extra outlays related to making their services safe.In the second quarter, Facebook\u2019s costs totaled $7.4 billion, a 50 percent increase from a year earlier. Revenue growth was 42 percent. In the first half of 2018, Facebook\u2019s capital expenditures, or spending on items like new servers and offices, rose 133 percent from the same period last year. At Twitter, they were up 243 percent.Investors might be cautious because they don\u2019t know how big the security bill will be and whether the spending will be effective. But shareholders have been happy to go along with higher costs at Twitter and Facebook when it was for improving their networks for users and advertisers.Senior executives at Facebook and Twitter seem to understand that if they don\u2019t want to be closely regulated by the government, the companies need to show they can police themselves. The coming months should shed some light on whether they can.But Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth, financial success and stock performance almost depend on maintaining networks that feel safe to users. Explaining the investments in security, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday, \u201cWe do believe, ultimately, over time, that this will help our growth story and encourage more people to stay with Twitter and also tell their friends, family and colleagues about all the value they\u2019re getting out of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Friday\u2019s Indictments Mean", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe allegations of subverting American democracy are troubling in themselves. They also spell trouble for the president.Mr. Eisen is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, where Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director.Today we learned that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has obtained indictments charging that 12 Russian military intelligence officers engaged in a conspiracy to subvert our democracy. The indictments demonstrate that Mr. Mueller, the Department of Justice and a federal grand jury agree with a conclusion that the intelligence community, the Senate Intelligence Committee and a majority of Americans long ago reached: The Russian government was unambiguously responsible for the attack on our election. The direct and specific evidence of Russian interference laid out in the indictment \u2014 both by hacking into Democratic Party accounts and into actual state election commissions \u2014 is immensely significant.Any other president would seriously consider canceling Monday\u2019s summit with the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. One of us is a former American diplomat in the region, but you don\u2019t need to be an expert to understand that it is unlikely the official Russian conduct Mr. Mueller has unearthed could have occurred without Mr. Putin\u2019s blessing. To confer legitimacy on the man who was part of an assault on our country is reprehensible.Unfortunately, we have no expectation that Mr. Trump will cancel. If he proceeds, the indictments must be the first point of reference for the president as he meets next week with the leader \u2014 and former intelligence chief \u2014 of the country that orchestrated this attack. In previous statements, President Trump has at times said that he takes Mr. Putin at his word that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election. To put it bluntly, the evidence collected by the Department of Justice further demonstrates that Mr. Trump\u2019s trust in Mr. Putin is horribly misplaced. He must now tell Mr. Putin he knows that he is lying.The indictments \u2014 like others that preceded them \u2014 also have important domestic implications. Already some of the president\u2019s defenders are using these latest indictments to suggest that they exonerate the president\u2019s campaign. No Americans were alleged to have participated in this hacking, except perhaps unwittingly, the argument goes, and therefore the Mueller investigation has definitively found no collusion. That is precisely the wrong reading of this latest development. As is Department of Justice policy, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced this complaint, he stuck to the facts alleged in the complaint but repeatedly emphasized that no Americans were charged with crimes \u201cin this indictment.\u201d Media reports indicate that the investigation is wrapping up its look into possible obstruction charges and now moving toward collusion. As criminal law experts (one from the prosecution side and one from the defense camp), we believe that Mr. Mueller is moving steadily toward the Trump campaign. The signs are many, including the fact that numerous high-level individuals in and around the campaign have not yet been interviewed, as far as we know. (They include Roger Stone, Donald Trump Jr., Brad Parscale and, of course, Michael Cohen.) We do not know whether Mr. Mueller will ultimately find that those around Mr. Trump \u2014 or the president himself \u2014 knowingly participated in illegal efforts to influence the election or otherwise violated the law. But it would be recklessly premature for the president or anyone else to conclude that today\u2019s filing absolves the Trump campaign and its associates of any wrongdoing. If there was catastrophic wrongdoing closer to home, we are confident Mr. Mueller will find it and will charge it if the law and the facts allow. He is moving effectively and, for an investigation of this breadth and complexity, extremely quickly. If others in this country broke the law in connection with the last election, now is not the time for them to rest easy. The decision to allow the national security division of the Department of Justice to assume responsibility for this prosecution of Russian officials allows Mr. Mueller\u2019s team to focus on investigating other issues here at home.Still, many Republicans, and House Republicans in particular, have so far seen too much to be gained by obscuring the truth and revisiting irrelevant disputes about Hillary Clinton \u2014 rather than uncovering the truth about Russia and possible cooperation by the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, while evidence of Russian interference mounts, bipartisan efforts to protect the special counsel investigation and to better secure our election infrastructure have also stalled \u2014 in no small part because there is no support from Mr. McConnell and the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. With the 2018 midterm elections approaching, the hour for protecting the rule of law and the sanctity of our elections is already late. Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s call for patriotism and the indictment he unveiled is therefore a reminder more than anything that we must do more. Mr. Mueller will continue his march toward accountability for wrongdoing related to the last election. But if Russia is permitted to interfere in our elections again, or if the President is permitted to interfere with this investigation, the impact on our democracy, and Americans\u2019 faith in it, could be catastrophic.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Endless Gaming May Be a Bad Habit. That Doesn\u2019t Make It a Mental Illness.", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMindThe World Health Organization last month added \u201cinternet gaming disorder\u201d to its manual of psychiatric diagnoses, and the reaction was, shall we say, muted. At a time when millions of grown adults exchange one-liners with Siri or Alexa, the diagnosis seems years overdue, doesn\u2019t it? They\u2019re stuck. They sleep with their heads on keyboards. They could use a friend of the breathing, let\u2019s-go-to-the-park variety. They could use some help.Yet embracing I.G.D., as it\u2019s known, as a new mental health disorder has its own perils. Many psychologists are skeptical that it exists at all as a stand-alone problem. The diagnostic criteria are still fuzzy, and the potential for overdiagnosis is enormous.\u201cThe question is, what\u2019s the difference between a bad habit and a disorder, and where do you draw that line,\u201d said Scott Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory University. \u201cSome, like me, believe there\u2019s often no reliable way to do that. Others disagree. The point is, you need to be very careful in doing so\u201d for people who need help to buy in.The W.H.O.\u2019s definition of gaming disorder is a mouthful: A pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.As a diagnosis, it\u2019s a potential blockbuster. Estimates of its prevalence \u2014 up to 9 percent of all gamers \u2014 mean that tens of millions of mostly young people worldwide may now be said to have a mental disorder.Some of them surely do, whatever its underlying dynamics.\u201cThe kids I see truly have a problem, and it has disastrous effects on many parts of their lives \u2014 school performance, social life, their moods,\u201d said Dr. Clifford Sussman, a psychiatrist in Washington who treats compulsive gaming with psychotherapy.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t much matter what you call it, the point is to give them tools\u201d to control the habit, he added, and better integrate it into their lives. Many other psychiatrists agree and say they have treated the compulsion successfully. But the American Psychological Association, among other groups, takes exception to the diagnosis. The association argues that the definition remains too vague, and that mood problems may in fact precede excessive gaming, not vice versa. The new label reflects a \u201cmoral panic,\u201d the critics say \u2014 an unfounded fear of new technology that years ago had parents and some experts finger-wagging about the mentally corrosive effects of TV, and before that, radio.Parts of the published science thus far, he said, have not been reassuring. Take, for example, the search for a \u201csignature\u201d of the disorder in the brain. Another report, also using brain imaging, concluded that people with I.G.D. had \u201cdecreased connectivity between the left amygdala and left middle frontal and precentral gyrus.\u201dThat\u2019s a lot of fancy-sounding brain regions. But the conclusions are all virtually meaningless, since no one knows much about how those regions interact, or why one gamer\u2019s bilateral cuneus happens to be thicker than another\u2019s. \u201cOnce you decide there\u2019s a disorder, you start looking for it in people\u2019s brains and trying to knock it out, like you would a brain tumor,\u201d Dr. Lilienfeld said. But of course there is no tumor in this case.After seven days of \u201cequine-assisted activities and therapies,\u201d a group of adolescents diagnosed with I.G.D. showed improvement in \u201cavoidance and anxiety scores,\u201d this study concluded. Horse riding, usually with a therapist-guide riding alongside, giving instruction and encouragement, has shown some benefit for people with autism, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. Now...gamers.Whether W.H.O.\u2019s inclusion of compulsive gaming eventually leads to better research, or to standardized treatments that reliably change behavior, is an open question. But for now it would be hard to blame anyone with a serious joystick jones for balking at the prospect of a \u201cdisorder.\u201d A bad habit may be bad. But at least fixing it doesn\u2019t involve brain scans, antidepressant pills or clinging for dear life to some cantering Cheyenne or Misty.The digital horses are a lot safer to ride, after all. And you get to carry a sword. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Daigo Hand Roll Bar, Sushi Looks to Its Humble, Glorious Roots", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosSushi was not highborn. It came from the streets, from the roadside stalls of early 19th-century Edo, the fishing village that grew into neon-floodlit Tokyo.There, an enterprising chef decided that the traditional way of preserving fish and rice \u2014 in which they were arranged in layers, pressed under weights and left to ferment \u2014 took too long and sapped flavor from the fish. So he molded a handful of pickled rice and topped it with raw fish straight from the bay.This was sushi as a snack, cheap and efficient, and no less the glorious for it. And this is sushi as you\u2019ll find it at Daigo Hand Roll Bar in the subterranean DeKalb Market Hall in Downtown Brooklyn, where almost every hand roll \u2014 made with generosity, exactitude and beautifully supple, barely anointed fish \u2014 is less than $10.The specialty here is temaki, seafood rolled inside rice and nori (dried seaweed) and presented uncut. Each roll is made to order, so the rice is always warm and fluffy, laced with rice vinegar, dashi kombu (kelp-and-bonito stock), sugar and salt \u2014 a lovely balancing act, the flavor not quite committing to sour or sweet.Some say that temaki is only as good as its nori. Here, the frail panes of seaweed are of the most prized variety, harvested from the cold waters of the Ariake Sea off the island of Kyushu in Japan, which has one of the world\u2019s greatest differentials in high and low tide \u2014 20 feet \u2014 so that the nori has a chance to absorb both the ocean\u2019s nutrients (washed down from the mountains by rivers) and sunlight.The pedigree matters: The nori is lustrous and nearly black, chewy and crackly at once, with a delicate flavor, like the saline imprint after downing an oyster. It\u2019s toasted just enough for it to be malleable without losing crispness, and doesn\u2019t wilt, despite the warmth of the rice.But all this would mean nothing if the fish weren\u2019t fresh. The chef, Masanobu Ishikura, known as Ishi, is vigilant about seafood, and reserved and judicious in his adornments: a dark daub of plum paste against botan ebi (sweet shrimp), whose translucent flesh crunches; charred jalape\u00f1o, confettied, alongside hamachi (yellowtail), waiting to melt; the clarity of cucumber under salty sacs of ikura (salmon roe) that pop like water balloons.Saba (mackerel), briefly cured, has a light, clean scent. Ginger is tucked in, to cut the oiliness, along with shiso for a sunny finish. Hokkaido scallop, firm and plush, is all brightness from yuzu kosho, a crush of chiles, salt and yuzu peels, tang and fragrance collapsed into one. Octopus, braised until compliant, gets a hit of sansho pepper, cousin to Sichuan peppercorn but more floral: It cools, then slowly and sneakily numbs.One night, he recognized a familiar face in the crowd: David Moon, who used to eat at Kura Sushi three or four times a week. Mr. Moon, the owner of Bunsmith, a Korean restaurant with outposts in Crown Heights and at DeKalb Market, thought he\u2019d never see his favorite sushi chef again. He rejoiced, and proposed a collaboration.Daigo opened last summer, as one of the market\u2019s smaller stalls, too cramped for a full-fledged sushi setup. Slabs of fish are cut on a central block; two 20-cup rice cookers stand at attention. Mr. Ishikura presides most days, and has trained his staff well, so that the rolls hold up without him. They take a few minutes to make \u2014 might as well wander the hall while you wait \u2014 and may be eaten standing up at the counter.There\u2019s no reverence, no hush. But why should sushi be respected only in the most refined of environments, when the bill invites vertigo? In the 19th century, as the citizens of Edo went mad for this newfangled snack of raw fish on pickled rice, sushi vendors kept charging more and more \u2014 until the shogunate arrested hundreds of them for price-gouging, outraged at their greed. It was a reminder: Sushi is food for common people; sushi belongs to us all.An earlier version of this article described incorrectly how the octopus at Daigo Hand Roll Bar is prepared. It is braised, then sprinkled with olive oil. It is not braised in olive oil.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Urges Congress to Regulate Use of Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lengthy blog post about the potential uses and abuses of facial recognition, Bradford L. Smith, the company\u2019s president, compared the technology to products like medicines and cars that are highly regulated, and he urged Congress to study it and oversee its use.Tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, and Mr. Smith\u2019s unusual entreaty illustrates how powerful technologies involving artificial intelligence \u2014 including facial recognition \u2014 have set off a contentious battle among tech executives. These technologies have the potential to remake industries. They could also reduce workers\u2019 job prospects or result in unequal opportunities for consumers, leading some to argue that the products are too risky for tech companies to deploy without government oversight.Mr. Smith\u2019s appeal also comes as Silicon Valley is facing withering scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy experts. Several companies have been harshly criticized in recent months for their role in spreading false information during the 2016 election, and exploiting users\u2019 personal data. In response, some businesses, like Facebook, have expressed more openness to regulation of practices like political advertising.With many of its rivals under fire, Microsoft has aggressively tried to position itself as the moral compass of the industry. Company executives have been outspoken about safeguarding users\u2019 privacy as well as warning about the potential discriminatory effects of using automated algorithm to make important decisions like hiring.Now that facial recognition has become a new lightning rod for critics, Microsoft is taking the lead in calling for some regulatory restraint.The powerful technology can be used to identify people in photos or video feeds without their knowledge or permission. Proponents see it as a potentially important tool for identifying criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that the technology could enable mass surveillance, hindering people\u2019s ability to freely attend political protests or go about their day-to-day lives in anonymity.In calling for government oversight of facial recognition, Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of any new state efforts to tightly regulate the technology. Mr. Smith, the company\u2019s president, suggested that governments around the world examine both law enforcement and commercial uses of the technology.\u201cShould law enforcement use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould the law require that companies obtain prior consent before collecting individuals\u2019 images for facial recognition?\u201dIn the European Union, many of these questions have already been settled.Civil liberties and privacy advocates said they both welcomed and felt wary of Microsoft\u2019s push for government regulation, questioning how committed the company was to strong user privacy controls.April Isenhower, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said that the company had long been committed to privacy, including pushing for a national consumer privacy law in the United States since 2005.Tech companies are spreading facial recognition in part because it provides a powerful way for them to connect consumers\u2019 online and real lives.In addition to using facial recognition for its own consumer services, Microsoft \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 also sells the software to others.Mr. Smith wrote in the blog post that Microsoft was examining its own development and marketing of the technology.He also said Microsoft had rejected facial recognition requests from certain customers \u201cwhere we\u2019ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,\u201d and that the company was committed to \u201cestablishing a transparent set of principles\u201d for the technology.Microsoft employees recently protested the company\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that has been involved in the separation of migrant children from their families at the border. In his blog post, Mr. Smith wrote that the company\u2019s contract with that agency \u201cisn\u2019t being used for facial recognition\u201d or to separate families.Ms. Isenhower, the Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about whether the company provided facial recognition services to other government agencies or whether it had put any specific restrictions on its customers\u2019 use of the technology.

It comes encased (with potatoes standing in for chicken) in crimped puffs of obligingly flaky pastry the size of dolls\u2019 fists, and is the essential accessory to hand-stretched and spun roti canai, a layered flatbread that\u2019s close to see-through at the center and thick and chewy along the circumference.With ingredients recalibrated, the curry turns into soup and a backdrop for egg noodles and yong tau foo: varying vessels \u2014 including hollowed-out eggplant, fried jicama, pugilistic green chiles and blocks of tofu \u2014 stuffed with fish paste. More fish paste, clarifyingly briny, is pressed between crisp sheets of tofu skin, made from the plush film skimmed off boiling soy milk.Other Malaysian specialties are scattered on a menu largely devoted to Thai and Chinese classics. They\u2019re worth hunting for, like char kway teow, springy flat bands of rice noodles slung in the wok with tight whorls of shrimp, squid, rough-hewed pork and eggs that break apart and half-set in creamy scraps.This is brought to the table in a shadowy heap, inked by soy sauce; the scent \u2014 of smoke and charred molasses \u2014 precedes it, and infiltrates every bite. Pickled green chile appears on the side, sweet and sharp from a layover in sugar-spiked vinegar and still harboring a grumbling heat.Hokkien mee is darker yet, snaking egg noodles simmered in the wok with chicken stock and a dose of richer, aged soy sauce and kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). Into it tumble the same combination of shrimp, squid and pork, and at the last minute choy sum, the leaves wilting quickly but the stalks bringing a clean crunch, a momentary reprieve from the salt.One dish is listed simply as \u201cFried Carrot,\u201d without elaboration. The vegetable in question is white, recognizable on our shores as daikon radish. It\u2019s shredded and stirred with dried shrimp, nubs of Chinese sausage and rice flour to bind it into a cake, which is then steamed for two hours. It rests in the refrigerator for a day, and is then sliced into cubes and plunged into the fryer, emerging buoyant, with a faint crust of soy sauce approaching caramel.From the outside, Little House Caf\u00e9 suggests a bakery more than a restaurant. The dining room is plain-spoken, with scuffed tile underfoot and only a handful of tables, and desserts almost outnumber savory dishes. Displayed in baskets up front and behind glass at the back, the day\u2019s offerings might include steamed brown sugar cakes, nicely riddled with air pockets, and rounds of sweet potato dough wrapped around mung bean paste and molded to look like tortoise shells.Kuih talam, a two-tiered rice cake, is evenly split between a delicate layer of salted coconut milk and a sweet, more custardy layer, bamboo green in color from pandan, which tastes something like jasmine rice smells, nutty and grassy without resolving into either.Note that not everything that looks like a dessert actually is one. A pale monolith of taro cake sits chummily among the sweets, but those are onions strewn across the top, fried until crackly. And the perfume? Garlic.Advertisement"}

Their tours range from special themes, like feminism or gay culture, to museum highlights designed for time-pressed or attention-deficit travelers.Mr. Oddo and his co-founder, Jason Spiehler, met while working in Rome, where Mr. Spiehler was a guiding tours at the Vatican. Together they founded Walks in Italy in 2010; in other countries the company now goes by Take Walks. The company offers tours like the Louvre in Paris at closing time, when traffic around the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d dies down, and a full-day trip to three sites by the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, two of them museums, in Barcelona. \u201cIn the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a shift from larger-group, checklist-style, in-a-bus itineraries to smaller tours with guides that have a specific knowledge on a subject and can speak to that nuance,\u201d Mr. Oddo said of the Take Walks tours, which are designed for 12 to 15 people. (Most museum itineraries run two to four hours and range $42 to $107; register at takewalks.com.)The company\u2019s tours are not exclusively museum-based, but where they are, \u201cthemes range from connoisseurship, the currency of art, art theft (alleged or not), and generally the ostentatiously wealthy and conspicuous consumption,\u201d wrote Nick Stropko, a marketing associate at Context, in an email. \u201cWe are taught to look at art in an almost disorienting and intimidating way, that art is about distinct styles and theoretical concerns,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a great place to start. People like to know context, and, of course, this is a fun side of context.\u201dMuseum Hack, in contrast, was founded by Mr. Gray who had no background in art or history, but said he fell in love with the wonders of the Metropolitan Museum, where themed tours now range from the \u201cun-highlights\u201d to an \u201cunofficial and definitely unlicensed boy wizard tour.\u201d Now in five cities, Museum Hack tends to hire actors, comics and engaging teachers to guide its tours including feminist tours at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

With an editorial staff steeped in technology, the site has experimented with new ideas, including making bots that give readers the news and integrating ads into its newsfeed.The news site, the presentation said, is expected to bring in more than $35 million this year and will start a paid subscription model. \u201cDespite its strengths, Quartz needs to shift its business model,\u201d the presentation said. Quartz will retain its name, brand, staff and offices, according to the announcement. Mr. Delaney and the publisher, Jay Lauf, will share the title of chief executive, and will report to Yusuke Umeda, a Uzabase co-founder.In a memo of his own to Quartz staff members, David G. Bradley, Atlantic Media\u2019s chairman, recounted how, during a Christmas vacation trip several years ago to Beirut, Lebanon, he had discussed the future of the company with his three adult sons. After he decided that his sons would not succeed him in running Atlantic Media, Mr. Bradley said, his family then planned to divest all of its media properties by the time he was 70.\u201cWhere I am caught by surprise is in the timing,\u201d Mr. Bradley, 65, said. \u201cAfter selling the majority of The Atlantic to Emerson Collective, I had thought it would be a few years before we launched the search for a Quartz buyer.

He said he would continue to work as an adviser to the company for at least the next year.Uzabase, which runs a business news aggregation app called NewsPicks, said it was buying Quartz to help expand its overseas business. Quartz will take over the English language version of NewsPicks and develop new paid products, according to the emailed memo.Uzabase and Mr. Umeda have tried to challenge a staid media environment in Japan by focusing coverage on emerging technology trends, according to Japanese media interviews with Mr. Umeda.Discussions between Uzabase and Quartz began in the fall and were rooted partly in Mr. Umeda\u2019s early admiration of Quartz, according to the statement.\u201cFive years ago, when I was originally thinking about launching a digital media business, I discovered Quartz for the first time,\u201d Mr. Umeda said in the statement. \u201cI thought that they were truly the first new media company to successfully combine quality journalism with mobile technology, and they played a big role in inspiring me to launch NewsPicks.\u201dStill, it appears that Quartz will now follow the direction set by Mr. Umeda and his NewsPicks product.

Then, galvanizing them further, Ms. Minaj chimed in, too.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy,\u201d Ms. Thompson said through tears in an interview, calling herself \u201cphysically drained\u201d and \u201cmentally depleted.\u201dSuch are the risks of the new media playing field, which may look level from afar, but still tilts toward the powerful. As social media has knocked down barriers between stars and their faithful (or their critics), direct communication among the uber-famous and practically anonymous has become the norm. But while mutual praise can cause both sides to feel warm and tingly, more charged interactions can leave those who have earned a star\u2019s ire, like Ms. Thompson, reeling as eager followers take up the celebrity\u2019s cause.\u201cHer fans mimic her behavior,\u201d Ms. Thompson said of Ms. Minaj, who responded to her critique after some of the rapper\u2019s 21 million followers brought the initial tweet to the attention of their queen.Ms. Minaj has been particularly present online lately, rallying her troops in the run-up to her new album, as early songs from the project have failed to stick commercially. (Of her two songs as a lead artist currently on the Billboard Hot 100, none is higher than No. 81.) Ms. Minaj and her team declined to comment for this article.Ms. Minaj\u2019s response to Ms. Thompson only served to rile up the Barbz, as the rapper calls her stans. (A \u201cstan,\u201d as in Eminem\u2019s 2000 hit, is internet parlance for the most rabid, loyal kind of fan, devotees who often congregate in large groups online, tracking their chosen stars \u2014 and their detractors \u2014 as if they\u2019ve taken a blood oath, or tallying industry stats and cutting down rivals like the most die-hard Boston Red Sox obsessive.)The incident also affected Ms. Thompson\u2019s professional life.Since April, she had written remotely as an unpaid intern for KarenCivil.com, the eponymous blog of the hip-hop media personality Karen Civil, who also advises artists on social media and brand strategy. Ms. Minaj is a client of Ms. Civil\u2019s \u2014 a fact Ms. Thompson said she did not know when she wrote her initial tweet. But as Ms. Thompson\u2019s assessment picked up steam online that night, its signal boosted by outraged Nicki Minaj fans, she was told by KarenCivil.com staff in an internal group chat to delete the tweet.Around the same time, Ms. Thompson realized that she had been messaged privately by Ms. Minaj. \u201cIf I just posted the DM I got,\u201d Ms. Thompson tweeted cryptically, \u201cI will lose A LOT. I want a career in writing and who will hire me after this? But this DM is DISGUSTING.\u201dMs. Civil said in an interview that she and her staff believed Ms. Thompson\u2019s tweets were referring to their internal chat to her, and did not know at the time that Ms. Minaj had sent Ms. Thompson a direct message. Hours later, Ms. Thompson received an email from the site\u2019s chief operating officer, Christian Emiliano, informing her that her internship position had been terminated.Mr. Emiliano wrote that Ms. Thompson had been asked to be \u201crespectful to any of the clients\u201d with whom the site\u2019s leadership \u201care working with or are building a relationship.\u201d The email also stated that Ms. Thompson had violated a nondisclosure agreement \u201cby talking about an in-house and contained incident.\u201d (Ms. Thompson denies violating her N.D.A.)Ms. Civil said Ms. Minaj did not order Ms. Thompson\u2019s firing. Ms. Civil added that she contacted Ms. Thompson to smooth things over, and condemned the \u201ccyberbullying\u201d that resulted. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad situation when fans take it upon themselves to say these things,\u201d she said.As for Ms. Minaj\u2019s role in the barrage, Ms. Civil added that the immediacy of social media is \u201ca gift and a curse.\u201d \u201cIf someone is feeling attacked, they respond,\u201d she said. However, \u201cIt\u2019s never right to bully anybody in any situation. It\u2019s not fair.\u201dBut Ms. Thompson said that while she stuck by her opinion on Ms. Minaj\u2019s music, she wished she had never made it public.\u201cIf I knew it would get this much harassment and that my daughter would be affected, I don\u2019t think that I would have posted it,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery person has a right to defend themselves and react to certain statements.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time for a Chemistry Lesson. Put on Your Virtual Reality Goggles.", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new tool allows researchers to manipulate molecules in three dimensions, recalling physical models used to visualize forests of atoms in the past.These days simulations on screens have replaced such models, sacrificing some of their tactile value while gaining the ability to show movement. But what if you could enter a virtual reality environment where the molecules lie before you, obeying all the laws of molecular physics as calculated by supercomputers, and move them around in three dimensions? Intuition about how molecules behave physically remains a very important skill in chemistry and biology and their practical applications. Where a molecule might bend, where it won\u2019t and just how the positive and negative charges it is riddled with attract and repel each other, are all key to understanding how a drug will slip into a cleft in a protein, among other puzzles. In the virtual world, users are experiencing the cutting of edge of what scientists know about how molecules move and flex, said David Glowacki, a researcher in chemistry and computer science at the University of Bristol in England who is a co-author of the paper. The simulation, which anyone with a virtual reality setup can access, is being run on Oracle supercomputers, with a grant from the company. \u201cWhen you reach out and touch these molecular strings, you are touching the absolute real physics,\u201d Dr. Glowacki said. \u201cThe way that it moves and behaves is to the best of our knowledge the real deal.\u201dThe researchers asked users to perform three separate manipulations of molecules and timed how long each took. They had to thread a molecule of methane through a simulated carbon nanotube; unwind a helical molecule and wind it up in the opposite direction; and tie a knot in a simulated protein. They also did the same tasks on computers using a touchscreen or a mouse. Each task resembles research that is current in biology and chemistry. The task with the helical molecule took about the same amount of time in both environments, however. Dr. Glowacki suggested that this is because the solution \u2014 grasping one end and moving it a flat spiral \u2014 is essentially a two-dimensional movement. In addition to making it faster and easier to solve three-dimensional problems at the molecular level, the virtual reality tool could allow researchers at pharmaceutical companies and universities who are far apart to look at molecules together at the same time, Dr. Glowacki said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started a few pilots with a few different chemical companies, also some pharma companies,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere they\u2019re piloting it in their research labs and looking at how their scientists use it.\u201d An earlier version of this article misattributed a quote about building models of molecules.

{"Headline": "\u2018Evil Has Won\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPro-American Germans feel betrayed.Opinion ColumnistBERLIN \u2014 Klaus Scharioth, who served as Germany\u2019s ambassador to the United States during both George W. Bush\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s administrations, was born in 1946, the year after Germany\u2019s surrender in World War II. His earliest impressions of America were of a magnanimous, generous country.\u201cIt was never forgotten that the United States included Germany in the Marshall Plan, which you would not have expected,\u201d he told me, speaking of American aid to rebuild Europe after the war. He remembers getting packages of food from the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe, or CARE: \u201cThe victor sends the one who is defeated, and who began the war, CARE packages! Imagine that. It doesn\u2019t happen too often.\u201d In the world he grew up in, America was seen as the guarantor of the liberal democratic order, an order in which Germany, abandoning its aggressive history, would come to thrive. And so for many Germans, it\u2019s a profound shock that the president of the United States now attacks that order, while appearing to fawn over Russia.\u201cGermans have grown accustomed to the fact that the United States would always be their friends,\u201d Scharioth said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like when a very good friend leaves you. It hurts. I would say of all European countries, the Germans psychologically are the ones who are wounded most.\u201dI traveled to W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, last week for a conference about the free press, where journalists from Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, spoke of the challenges of reporting in conditions of ever-increasing authoritarianism. Afterward I spent a few days in Berlin, speaking to politicians and foreign policy experts as Donald Trump threatened to blow up NATO. In both places there was a funereal sense \u2014 not universal, but pervasive \u2014 that the era of open societies might be ending. \u201cFor me, the key thing is the Enlightenment,\u201d Scharioth said. \u201cI think that keeps the E.U. together, the values of the Enlightenment \u2014 a free press, religious freedom, minority protection, free elections, democracy, a free judiciary independent of all the other branches of government, tolerance, respect for others. I\u2019m afraid the United States might no longer be speaking out for these values. And that makes me very anxious.\u201dObviously, even before Trump, not everyone in Germany admired the United States the way Scharioth did. As in every country in Europe, there has been significant anti-American sentiment in Germany, particular on the far left and the far right. But those Germans who do believe in the best of American values are struggling to come to terms with a world in which the United States, whose support has undergirded German foreign policy assumptions for 70 years, can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cThe trans-Atlantic relationship is not going to survive eight years of Trump,\u201d said Marcel Dirsus, a center-right-leaning political scientist at the University of Kiel. He\u2019s not sure it can survive four. \u201cWhat comes next is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d he said.That phrase \u201ctrans-Atlantic relationship\u201d might sound like a diplomatic banality. But a world without it would be an extremely different place. America has long wanted Europeans to spend more on their own defense, but should every nation in Europe feel the need to significantly build up its military \u2014 and perhaps to nuclearize \u2014 the continent would likely become far less stable. There\u2019s no reason to take for granted that most countries in Europe would remain open, pro-Western democracies.When I met with Cem \u00d6zdemir, a member of the German Bundestag from the center-left Green Party, he spoke with awe of the Statue of Liberty and all it represents. \u201cThat was the dream of everybody in the world, that one day we would all live in democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day, we would all live in a world that is fair and just. If the guy in the center of this world is evil, evil has won.\u201d\u201cIt reminds me of a James Bond movie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a guy\u201d \u2014 Putin \u2014 \u201cwho has a clear plan. Step 1, Step 2. It\u2019s Brexit, it\u2019s President Trump, it\u2019s having Europe stumbling, it\u2019s having authoritarian regimes getting stronger on a daily basis, it\u2019s an escalation in Syria.

He was 80.His wife, Carole Hyams, confirmed the death. She said he had been ill for some time but did not specify a cause.Mr. Howard, widely known as Big Man because of his linebacker\u2019s build, did not have the high profile of the Panther leaders Bobby Seale, Huey P. Newton or Eldridge Cleaver as the group, which was formed in Oakland, Calif., in 1966, went national and took on issues like police brutality and racial injustice.As the group\u2019s deputy minister of information, Mr. Howard was often quoted when the more prominent party figures were on trial or in the news for other reasons. (The minister of information, Mr. Cleaver, was in exile overseas.)He was the go-to Panther for comments during the 1970 trials in New Haven of Mr. Seale and other party members in a 1969 murder case, proceedings that spawned demonstrations and protests.Later that year he often spoke for the party as it tried to hold a convention in Washington to rewrite the Constitution \u2014 symbolically, at least \u2014 to make it fairer to minorities and poor people, and he showed that he, like the party leaders, could bring the heated language when necessary. After the group and Howard University got into a dispute over the use of its campus for the event, he called university officials \u201ca tool of this racist and fascist American government.\u201dBut in a 2004 interview with the website of the PBS documentary series \u201cPOV,\u201d when Mr. Howard was asked to name something people did not appreciate about the Black Panthers, he replied:\u201cPeople didn\u2019t understand what our survival programs really meant: schoolchildren\u2019s breakfasts, feeding the hungry. Those programs helped immediate problems. They were also organizing tools.\u201cThe Panthers themselves weren\u2019t the only ones in those programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe got the community involved, teaching them how to become self-reliant, whereas the government wouldn\u2019t help with problems. It was about us helping ourselves.\u201dMr. Howard was born on Jan. 5, 1938, in Chattanooga, Tenn., to Anderson and Emma (Hawkshaw) Howard.In 1956 he enlisted in the Air Force. He served four years, and when he was discharged, from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, he decided to stay in the area.Attending Merritt College in Oakland on the G.I. Bill, Mr. Howard met Mr. Newton and Mr. Seale, who were also students there and central figures in organizing the Black Panther Party.He did not consider himself a public speaker at first, but he found himself given speaking assignments anyway. For the first one, he was sent to address an organization of San Francisco probation officers.\u201cThey wanted to know what we thought about them and their jobs,\u201d he wrote later. He told them, bluntly, that black people viewed them as being interested only in sending someone back to jail.\u201cMy final question to the group,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas, \u2018Did your college education and training teach you to deal with human beings with all their complex problems, or did your training just turn you into a tool to keep the revolving door at the penitentiary turning?\u2019 \u201d\u201cIt was not what they wanted to hear,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t care.\u201dMr. Howard edited the party\u2019s newspaper, made several trips overseas representing the organization, and worked on the types of project that did not make headlines.Ms. Hyams said Mr. Howard had been adept at organizing, working on things like access for people with disabilities as well as programs aimed at black neighborhoods. \u201cHe connected with all manner of groups of people,\u201d she said, \u201cnot just African-American groups.\u201d\u201cWhen it was announced that Bobby Seale and a delegation of the B.P.P. was there, the whole yard erupted with applause and yells of acknowledgment,\u201d Mr. Howard wrote. \u201cOn our way to our seats, I shook hands with many, many inmates who said, \u2018Hey, Big Man, all power to the people.\u2019 I had no idea these guys knew me or who I was.\u201dThe party eventually became riven by internal disputes. Mr. Howard left in 1974.In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Tynisa Howard Wilson; a stepson, Robert Grimes; two grandsons; and three step-grandchildren. He lived in Santa Rosa.Ms. Hyams, who first met Mr. Howard in the 1960s, reconnected with him years later. They married a decade ago. In a telephone interview, she said that for their celebration, Big Man did what he did best.\u201cHe, the organizer, organized it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was the wedding planner.

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Failing to Aid Inquiry Into \u2018Fake News,\u2019 British Lawmakers Say", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A closely watched British parliamentary committee examining Russia\u2019s exploitation of social media to try to influence elections has called for sweeping new regulations on tech companies, and has accused Facebook of providing \u201cdisingenuous answers\u201d to some questions while avoiding others \u201cto the point of obstruction.\u201dA report from the House of Commons panel, which is investigating \u201cfake news\u201d on the internet, cited Facebook\u2019s resistance to disclosing information as evidence of the need for more stringent rules to hold social media giants accountable for content.\u201cFacebook should not be in a position of marking its own homework,\u201d the committee said, in a report scheduled for release on Sunday, arguing that Facebook\u2019s resistance to providing information to Parliament \u201cdoes not bode well for future transparency.\u201dThe report is the latest indication that policymakers in Europe and North America are turning sharply more skeptical about the social media giants, once hailed as leaders of a revolution in free speech and human interaction.The panel \u2014 the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee \u2014 collaborated with the Senate Intelligence Committee in Washington, which on Friday announced that it would hold its own hearing in the coming week on foreign influence operations over social media.\u201cThe threat posed by this challenge is not just an American problem \u2014 it is one that confronts all free societies, and we need to work together to ensure we are protecting our democracy,\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, said in an emailed statement.Damian Collins, the chairman of the British parliamentary committee, said in a statement, \u201cWhat we have discovered so far is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d calling this \u201ca watershed moment in terms of people realizing they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service.\u201dThat revelation was part of the impetus for the formation of the British parliamentary committee, which sought to determine whether Russia had applied similar efforts to sway the 2016 referendum on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.Moscow has long sought to weaken the European Union, and the committee\u2019s report cited research showing that in the six months before the referendum in June 2016, the Kremlin\u2019s English-language outlets, Sputnik and Russia Today, published 261 articles supporting Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc. Those articles then somehow reached more users on Twitter than the content produced by the two main campaigns for Brexit.Yet the committee complained in its report that a lack of disclosure by the internet companies had thwarted its efforts to assess the extent of Russia\u2019s potentially hidden efforts to use false identities or polarizing messages on social media sites to manipulate public opinion.\u201cTime and again, Facebook chose to avoid answering our written and oral questions,\u201d the report noted.\u201cThere has been a continual reluctance on the part of Facebook to conduct its own research on whether its organization has been used by Russia to influence others,\u201d the report said, describing \u201ca disconnect between the government\u2019s expressed concerns about foreign interference in elections, and tech companies intractability in recognizing the issue.\u201dOfficials at Facebook and Twitter, who were not immediately available for comment, have said that they cooperated fully with the committees, suggesting that British intelligence agencies failed to provide the kind of information about fake Russian accounts that enabled the companies to disclose more about the American case.Most worrisome for the internet companies, however, are the committee\u2019s recommendations to impose stricter regulations, disclosure requirements and penalties on the social media companies. The committee said the British government was expected to lay out proposals for a new regulation framework later this year. It not yet clear how much influence the committee\u2019s recommendations may have on that process.European and American lawmakers have long treated the social media networks as passive platforms for content shared by users, and the laws have largely shielded the companies from liabilities for defamation, privacy violations, copyright infringement and other issues \u2014 protections that advocates for the companies say are essential to their business model.The committee urged an end to that impunity, arguing that the companies in fact have control and thus responsibility for their content.\u201cSocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a \u2018platform,\u2019 \u201d the report asserted. \u201cThat is not the case; they continually change what is and is not seen on their sites, based on algorithms and human intervention.\u201dAmong other proposals, the committee called for the regulators who oversee television and radio to set standards for accuracy and impartiality on social media sites, for the establishment of a \u201cworking group of experts\u201d to rate the credibility of websites or accounts \u201cso that people can see at first glance the level of verification,\u201d and for a new tax on internet companies that would pay for expanded oversight.To address influence campaigns, the committee called for the mandatory public disclosure of the sponsors behind any online political advertisement or paid communication, as required in traditional news media outlets \u2014 an idea that was proposed in Congress as well.The committee also noted that British law currently caps fines for election-law violations at a maximum of 20,000 British pounds, which would be almost meaningless for an internet giant. The committee suggested setting the maximum fine at a fixed percentage of a company\u2019s revenue. For a company like Facebook, that could be a much more threatening penalty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Supreme Court Opening Could Affect Gay Marriage as Well as Abortion", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe effect Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement could have on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights has received less attention. The prospect of a more conservative justice, though, has L.G.B.T. rights groups worried about legal challenges from conservative groups that oppose gay marriage, who may see an opportunity to challenge rulings that have established its legality.\u201cI\u2019d really hate to see the clock turn back after we\u2019ve made such tremendous strides,\u201d said Stacey Long Simmons, advocacy director for the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force.Opposition to Roe v. Wade has been a driving force in American conservatism for decades. But Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage, is a newer setback for religious conservatives. Many activists said they would welcome the chance to challenge the ruling, but they said it could take years for a case to reach the Supreme Court.\u201cIt is a recent decision,\u201d said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council. \u201cThe case is still being built as to why it is problematic.\u201dThat includes young evangelicals, 45 percent of whom support same-sex marriage, according to a 2017 poll by the Pew Research Center. More than 60 percent of younger and older evangelicals oppose abortion.Conservative activists and L.G.B.T. groups agree that religious liberty cases could be the most potent challenges to same-sex marriage and other issues concerning gay and transgender people.These kinds of challenges could bring Obergefell v. Hodges back into play, said Mathew Staver, chairman of the Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian litigation group that has represented elected officials who resist same-sex marriage.Mr. Perkins agreed. \u201cIf we continue to see the confrontation with religious freedom over the definition of marriage, this issue isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d he said.That case, which was narrowly decided, upheld the right of a Christian baker to refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple, citing his religious objection to the marriage. But Justice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in that case, also defended gay rights, writing that \u201cthese disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.\u201dThe Supreme Court could reconsider abortion as early as this next term or the next year, Mr. Staver said, because relevant cases are already working their way up the legal pipeline.But when it comes to a direct challenge to Obergefell, a conservative state, like Kentucky or Alabama, may need to enact legislation that attempts to regulate marriage. That could draw a legal challenge that sets a Supreme Court case in motion, but likely not until at least 2020, he said.The Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that argued the Masterpiece case, is currently litigating cases where free speech, religious freedom and public accommodation laws collide. Earlier this year, it filed a brief with the Kentucky Supreme Court on behalf of a printer who refused to make shirts for a Pride festival. The group is working on similar cases in Arizona and Minnesota.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much of a leap to anticipate that a justice who is confirmed to the court to replace Justice Kennedy actually could result in a situation where we have a 5-4 decision on some very key issues, whether it\u2019s marriage protections or the tensions between religious beliefs and L.G.B.T. nondiscrimination protections or reproductive rights,\u201d said Ms. Long Simmons of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force.Activists pointed to state-level restrictions on abortion as a model for how already-established rights, like same-sex marriage, could be undermined. Measures in states like Arkansas and Texas have limited the availability of abortion services despite Roe v. Wade.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is you don\u2019t have to go overturn the marquee case in order to make the rights inaccessible to real people,\u201d said Rachel Tiven, the president of Lambda Legal, an L.G.B.T. legal advocacy group. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether or not the marriage equality decision will be overturned \u2014 the threat is they will be hollowed out from underneath by a combination of religious exemptions and state rejection of equal treatment.\u201dReligious conservatives had been cautious about what cases involving marriage to bring to the court as long as Justice Kennedy was on the bench, concerned that it could establish precedent with a ruling unfavorable to them. Now that Justice Kennedy has retired, the dynamic has shifted, said Mr. Staver, and it is gay rights groups who should proceed with caution.\u201cIn the absence of Kennedy, I\u2019d think they\u2019d want to stay as far away from the Supreme Court as possible on any gay rights issue,\u201d Mr. Staver said. \u201cThey are going to have to move their attention to local battles. That is a huge shift.\u201d\u201cPotentially, we don\u2019t have the Supreme Court as a democratic backstop anymore, or we will not in the future if anyone on this list gets through,\u201d she said.Kristen Waggoner, the senior vice president of the Alliance Defending Freedom, said she was less concerned with specific issues than with getting a constitutionalist in the mold of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch on the court.\u201cTalk about reversing certain precedent is a talking point of the far left,\u201d she said. \u201cThe court decides on cases, not on issues.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Have a Mission in the Desert: Finding the Bodies of Border Crossers", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "Members of \u00c1guilas del Desierto \u2014 Eagles of the Desert \u2014 gathered before dawn one July morning in San Diego for a foray along the Mexican border. Their mission: to find the bodies of immigrants, hundreds of whom die in the desert each year.Illegal crossings are down sharply on the southwest border, but the number of people dying is climbing. At least 412 migrants were found dead in 2017, from 398 the previous year. Exposure to extreme heat or drowning in irrigation canals causes many of the deaths. With the expansion of the Border Patrol pushing immigrants further into remote territory, forensic researchers say the number of deaths may be much higher. As the search began, temperatures were approaching 100 degrees, and wildfires scorched the desert nearby.We scoured a stretch of federal land that was both desolate and futuristic; huge wind turbines towered above the brittlebush. Normally, the \u00c1guilas search in remote parts of Arizona, but on this quest we were only an hour from San Diego.\u201cI know the agony of losing a loved one to the desert,\u201d Eli Ortiz, the group\u2019s leader, said as we set out. He found the bodies of his brother and cousin in 2009.Most \u00c1guilas are immigrants themselves: maids, gardeners, combat veterans, construction workers. They find purpose in providing closure for families haunted by missing relatives. They\u2019ve undertaken this gruesome task once a month for six years.I doubted they would find anything; the desert around the Carrizo Gorge Wilderness is vast and forbidding. But their planning was meticulous. They used satellite images, GPS mapping and intelligence gleaned from Border Patrol agents and smuggling networks.Occasionally, family members who contact \u00c1guilas on Facebook go along. Rafael Luna, 50, said his brother went missing two months ago after setting out from Jalisco in western Mexico. \u201cHe was left out here to die,\u201d Mr. Luna said.Jos\u00e9 Genis Gonz\u00e1lez, 33, is a Navy vet, and trained as an E.M.T. He crossed with his parents when he was 2. After another volunteer picked up the scent of a dead body, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez rushed to what turned out to be a grisly scene.There was a body decomposing in the desert. Careful to avoid disrupting the remains while authorities were called, volunteers used gloves to examine the scene. Next to the body, they found a prayer card with the image of St. Peter, thought to protect migrants from harm, and a Mexican ID card bearing the name of Adri\u00e1n Luna, Rafael\u2019s brother.I wasn\u2019t prepared for what happened next. Mr. Luna began shouting, \u201cMy brother, my brother!\u201d before collapsing on the desert floor. His wails echoed across the empty hinterland. \u00a0Agents from the San Diego County medical examiner\u2019s office recovered the body. Coroners sometimes carry out DNA testing to definitively identify remains.The \u00c1guilas don\u2019t always find a body. Sometimes all they find are scattered bones or a crushed skull, evidence, perhaps, of a homicide. Authorities have found so many unidentified bodies in California that they stopped burying them, opting for cheaper cremations.Migrants perish in the desert from dehydration, hypothermia or heatstroke. Some are raped and killed by smugglers. Rafael Luna doesn\u2019t know how his brother died, but people in Adri\u00e1n\u2019s group told him where the body could be found. The volunteers face challenges that include snake bites and exhaustion. One volunteer collapsed from dehydration as we trekked in the punishing heat, and had to be carried out on a stretcher. Nourishment was bologna sandwiches and cans of Pepsi.Volunteers placed a simple wooden cross where they found the body. \u201cThe desert is like a lion, stalking both the strong and the weak,\u201d said Mr. Ortiz, the leader of the \u00c1guilas. \u201cThe desert could devour any of us.\u201dSimon Romero is a national correspondent for The New York Times based in Albuquerque, where he covers the southwest United States.Produced by MORRIGAN MCCARTHY and ANDREW ROSSBACKAdvertisement"}

You could tour the city\u2019s proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany.

To the extent that it resembles other places, it\u2019s probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who\u2019s who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes.On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I\u2019ve lucked into a precisely shaped C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25.I can\u2019t figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn\u2019t bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko\u2019s bar. And I don\u2019t understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened.The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece.The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up. Try this description, then: Imagine an eccentric, highly polished David Chang restaurant that the world hasn\u2019t heard about yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Shadow of the Blueberry Titans, Smaller Growers Thrive", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "The cultivated blueberry was born in South Jersey, and today its heirloom descendants can still be found on little farms sprinkled among the big producers.Supported byHAMMONTON, N.J. \u2014 Jeanne Lindsay often apologizes for the semi-wild state of her pick-your-own blueberry patch, which she runs on the farm her in-laws started in 1941. Yet it\u2019s precisely the old-fashioned imperfections of Lindsay\u2019s Farm that make its moss-carpeted rows worth the trip for regulars, many of whom now bring their children.\u201cSome people come just for the Rancocas,\u201d Mrs. Lindsay said. \u201cThey\u2019re good pie berries.\u201dFrom late June until the end of July, this corner of South Jersey, known as the Pinelands, is the blueberry epicenter of the Eastern United States; this flat region of sandy soils is where commercial cultivation of the berries began a century ago. Today, New Jersey\u2019s blueberry crop remains the fifth-largest in the nation by acreage, eclipsed in recent years by those of states (like Washington and Georgia) with more land for growers to expand into, said Mark Ehlenfeldt, a blueberry breeding specialist with the United States Department of Agriculture in nearby Chatsworth.Most of New Jersey\u2019s blueberries are now cultivated on vast farms with hundreds of acres, which normally grow just three high-yield varieties that can withstand machine picking and shipping: Dukes in June, Bluecrops by July, then smaller, tarter Elliots to finish the season.But if you take the time to drive the smaller byways of the Pinelands \u2014 a seven-county area that includes a million government-preserved acres of pitch pine, white cedar and a fine-grained soil called sugar sand \u2014 you can still find plenty of less conventional blueberries, and smaller farms, like Mrs. Lindsay\u2019s. The farm is now run by their 38-year-old son, Richard Stevens Jr.; the family sells its crop to a packer, but also allows customers to pick their own berries. They still grow mostly what was planted there in 1951, said the son, offering a taste of Elizabeths, Stanleys, Weymouths, Berkeleys, Blue Crops and Jerseys, plus a few Rancocas that are off-limits. \u201cThey\u2019re my mom\u2019s pride and joy,\u201d said the younger Mr. Stevens. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to touch them.\u201dLike cranberries, blueberries thrive in acidic soils, which the Pinelands have in abundance. Elizabeth White, who died in 1954, also helped start the Tru-Blu Cooperative Association to distribute and market the fruit across the country, with the help of advertisements in the New York City subway and breakfasts at B. Altman & Company, the former department store on Fifth Avenue.The group\u2019s first order of business was just to get people to call them blueberries. Originally, said Mr. Ehlenfeldt, who moonlights as the newsletter editor for Whitesbog, most people called any blue berry a huckleberry, which is a different fruit.Botanically speaking, there are three types of blueberries, said Mr. Ehlenfeldt: highbush (the type grown on most commercial farms), lowbush (still only wild and most famous in Maine) and rabbiteye. The rabbiteye berries have an earthier flavor, he said, and are traditionally found in the American South, though Mr. Ehlenfeldt has quite few in his vast research collection.Most cultivated blueberry plants now grown in New Jersey \u2014 and many around the world \u2014 can be traced directly back to White\u2019s work.A few miles west of Whitesbog is Haines Berry Farm, run by the great-grandson of the Whitesbog superintendent. And just across the road from Whitesbog is Pine Barrens Native Fruits, run by White\u2019s great-nephew Joe Darlington.The Darlingtons lease and farm the cranberry bogs at Whitesbog, and care for several acres of Elizabeths. Released in 1966 and named after White \u2014 who considered it to have exquisite flavor \u2014 the Elizabeth is a cult favorite, said Connie Casselman, who works in the office at Pine Barrens Native Fruits. Ms. Casselman alerts the farm\u2019s mailing list when the fruits, which can grow to the size of a quarter, are for sale.They pick for you at Pine Barrens Native Fruits. But at Fred Plus III, in Pemberton Township, visitors are free to pick their own berries, and explore the historic fields and surrounding pine forest.The farm is owned by Fred Detrick, 96, a retired professor who still takes to his tractor to monitor more than 60 acres of berries. He used to sell twice that commercially to make extra money in the summers through the Whites\u2019 Tru-Blu cooperative, which closed in 2005.Mr. Detrick said the cooperative told him he could make $1,000 an acre, though he\u2019s quick to add that he never has.His daughter-in-law Roni Detrick, 61, now runs his you-pick operation, where customers can rest in the shade of an ancient oak after a few hours of thumbing clusters of old-fashioned sweet Walcotts into a pail. They have Dukes, Bluecrops and Elliots, too.Mr. Stevens\u2019 favorite berries are the Bluecrops, especially if they sit on the bush for an extra day or two to get a little sweeter. Like most New Jersey growers, however, he\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not the variety that matters so much, but how long ago they left the bush.\u201cI\u2019ve turned into one of the blueberry snobs,\u201d Mr. Stevens said. \u201cYou should see me in the grocery store.\u201d Look for the dusty blue-white coating that slips away the more the fruit is handled, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a fresh berry.\u201d\u201cJust picked \u2014 that\u2019s probably the most important thing,\u201d Mr. Paluszak said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even eat refrigerated berries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But she treated me like a friend, not like a daughter. When I was a teenager, she confided in me that she was cheating on my father, as I suspected. The affair (and the marriage) lasted a few more years. But my knowledge was a guilty burden to me and hurt my relationship with my dad, whom I never told. Now my parents are fresh off a messy divorce, and I\u2019m keeping my distance from my exhausting mother. So, she reaches out to my friends and fianc\u00e9 and bashes me behind my back. Any advice?ANONYMOUSYour mom, like every adult I know, has made some pretty bad judgment calls. But what a drag to see her decisions weigh on you, making you complicit in her affair and straining your relationship with your father. Her new gambit of trash talking you to friends \u2014 probably to reel you back in \u2014 doesn\u2019t suggest much growth. But we can\u2019t do anything about her. The question here is: Can we make this better for you?I suggest radical honesty, which may sound aggressive but can be quite healthy. Start with your dad. Tell him the flat-out truth about the affair: \u201cI was just a kid, and I was afraid that if I told you about it, you and Mom would split up.\u201d By being that blunt, you can possibly reset your relationship with your father.Your mother may be a harder case. Be straight with her too: \u201cAs a girl, I felt so burdened when you confided in me about your affair, and the guilt still haunts me. I need some time to work through this. And you calling my friends to complain about me will not make it go any faster \u2014 or easier.\u201dShe may make excuses for herself. But you never know; your confrontation (and a few nights to sleep on it) may help her see that treating you like an adult was unfair. This won\u2019t fix the past, but it may put you on better footing in your relationship now. She\u2019s the only mother you\u2019re going to get. So, I\u2019d work at this as long as she\u2019s willing to be as honest as you are. And if she\u2019s not, at least you tried. One of the perks of my job is receiving complimentary tickets to various cultural events. I often give them to friends. Most people thank me effusively before and after the events. Some give me gifts \u2014 not necessary, as I didn\u2019t pay for the tickets, but appreciated nonetheless. Recently, I gave tickets to a friend who thanked me before the performance, but I haven\u2019t heard anything since. I think it would be nice to hear if he enjoyed the performance. Your thoughts?ANONYMOUSOne thank you for the redistribution of freebie tickets seems plenty to me. And while we\u2019re at it: Do the cultural institutions that give you these tickets (because of your job) know that you\u2019re handing them out like breath mints? And does your employer know that you\u2019re accepting gifts in exchange for them? It smells fishy to me!My husband is a public official. I think he does a great job balancing the needs of our small community with the property rights of individuals. Most people are happy with his work. But a small vocal group has formed an anonymous community page on social media. It has about 300 members who make mean and unfounded accusations anonymously. If you disagree or point out errors, they harass you. My husband doesn\u2019t pay attention, but I do! I hate reading these posts. I think I know who started the group. What should I do?LUCYPut up your blinders and promise me that you will never, ever look at the page again. I know this will be extremely hard for you. It\u2019s brutal (and addictive) to watch people we love be savaged on social media. But there is no winning an anonymous arms\u2019 race. And no point in confronting someone you suspect of anonymously founding an anonymous group \u2014 much less torturing yourself by reading the comments there. (O.K., have you quit yet?) A few years ago, a high school friend eloped. Ten of us got together and bought her a $250 gift card to the hotel spa where she was staying. (We were just out of college, so $25 per person seemed right.) She thanked us immediately and told us she looked forward to using it. But I just got a call from the hotel that the gift card is about to expire. Clearly, our friend never redeemed it. Should I confront her about this?ANONYMOUSYes! Who doesn\u2019t want to swan around in a plush hotel robe en route to a relaxing hot-stone massage? But don\u2019t think of this as a \u201cconfrontation.\u201d The certificate probably slipped your pal\u2019s mind. Tell her it\u2019s about to expire and ask if she can use it. If not, go back to the group (quickly!) and draw straws to figure out who will.Advertisement"}

After seven years of infertility and one horrendous miscarriage, I adopted my daughter, Julia, from Ethiopia at 8 months old and made motherhood my mission. She plays with dolls that look like her, reads books that feature brown children and had the \u201cSesame Street\u201d video of a muppet proclaiming that she loves her kinky-curly hair in steady rotation. Yet our most powerful experience of racial identity came through a pair of ballet tights.Julia longed to attend classes at the Dance Theater of Harlem with her older pal, Jade. Her audition this winter, held behind closed doors, ran an hour. Two weeks later, the results arrived. Julia, thanks to her preschool ballet lessons, had made the cut.We headed to the school store to purchase her gear. A saleswoman pulled a pair of tan tights from a basket and held them against Julia\u2019s forearm.\u201cUmm, too bright.\u201dShe returned to the basket. My curiosity followed. Inside, I spied an assortment of legwear \u2014 from nutmeg to milk chocolate to espresso \u2014 in neat packaging. She tried a cognac-colored pair.\u201cNow that\u2019s a match.\u201d\u201cTo her skin tone.\u201dMy eyes widened. I\u2019d given ballet, and its uniform, little thought since I studied the form as an 8-year-old in a Detroit studio, decades ago. I wore an inky black leotard paired with snowy white tights. The pairing made a bold graphic statement, much like a Franz Kline painting, or a penguin, or a grand piano. Back then no one considered my skin tone. Ballet tights were typically white, just as the ballet dancers typically were. Now, 40 years later, my daughter\u2019s ballet school protocol peeled back my brain.Next the saleswoman held up a pair of cotton-candy colored slippers and explained that I would need to dye them to match the tights, so the line of Julia\u2019s leg \u201cwould be continuous to the eye. That\u2019s the look we want to create.\u201d I nodded, studying my assignment.Arthur Mitchell, a professional African-American dancer with the New York City Ballet, founded the Dance Theater of Harlem, along with Karel Shook, in 1969. Mr. Mitchell wanted to create opportunities in the Harlem community where he grew up. With funding from Alva Gimbel, wife of the board chairman of Gimbel Brothers, the Ford Foundation, and his own savings, Mr. Mitchell opened his school. Next he set out to open minds.\u201cInitially, Dance Theater of Harlem dancers wore pink tights and toe shoes,\u201d Anna Glass, the executive director of the school, is quoted as saying in a 40-year retrospective. \u201cBut Arthur Mitchell changed course as he believed pink tights visually interrupted his dancer\u2019s lines. The wardrobe staff worked with each dancer to combine the correct amount of Rit dyes to match their individual skin tone, then applied pressed powder to their ribbons and shoes to seamlessly blend the color. Now, matching tights and toe shoes to skin tone became a trademark of Dance Theater of Harlem.\u201d And with that, Mr. Mitchell broke a 300-year-old tradition.In 1971, the neoclassical company debuted at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, wearing custom, skin-toned shoes and tights, which, nearly 50 years later, remains the company\u2019s signature.To have a beloved art form reflected back in body shapes and hues that mirror yours is powerful. That was part of the magic behind the success of the blockbuster \u201cBlack Panther\u201d when it opened in February. For African-Americans to see actors of color reflected as the protagonist, antagonist, scientist, even the queen, created a revelry of humanity that resulted in over $1 billion in ticket sales.How is such a drive born without a basket of brown-hued tights? Perhaps, Freud found the key. \u201cBeauty has no obvious use; nor is there any clear cultural necessity for it. Yet civilization could not do without it.\u201d Ms. Austin couldn\u2019t, either.She dreamed of becoming a ballerina and carried that dream to stardom. Not every brown girl who loves classical dance will be a star, of course, but many can find inspiration through their tights, their bodies, their being. I want that opportunity for my daughter, that unique confidence code.On the first day of classes, I helped Julia get dressed and line up with the other students. The girls admired their forms. There\u2019s an inherent sweetness to tiny ballerinas. As I studied the tableau of dark chocolate, cinnamon and caf\u00e9 au lait legs, the sense of racial pride, self-identity and belonging set me glowing.But not everyone seemed to fall under the same spell: Beside me, a mom with long, thin braids perused her Facebook feed on her iPhone. \u201cTime to go!\u201d the teacher announced. Moms and dads stood. We checked the girls\u2019 upswept buns once more. We planted kisses on their smooth foreheads. We watched our daughters troop down the hall, toward the studio, in a conga line of cuteness. My eyes glossed over. I turned. The Facebook addict.\u201cSure is.\u201dShe sighed. \u201cThose brown tights get me every single time. I had to look at Facebook, so I wouldn\u2019t start crying.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the ballet company with which Arthur Mitchell danced. It was the New York City Ballet, not American Ballet Theater.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the origins of a 40-year retrospective on the Dance Theater of Harlem. It was curated by the dance company, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and the California African American Museum, not International Arts and Artists.Advertisement"}

You can find both on the coasts and both in the interior \u2014 and you can find both in just one little corner of south-central Pennsylvania.I was invited in April to give a paid book talk here in Lancaster, and I was so blown away by the societal innovation the town\u2019s leaders had employed to rebuild their once-struggling city and county that I decided to return with my reporter\u2019s notebook and interview them.My original host was the Hourglass, a foundation founded by community leaders in Lancaster County in 1997, when the city of Lancaster was a crime-ridden ghost town at night where people were afraid to venture and when the county\u2019s dominant industrial employer, Armstrong World Industries, was withering.Pretty much the exact opposite of what\u2019s happening in Washington, D.C., today.At 7:30 Friday morning in early June, the Hourglass leaders in Lancaster were all sitting around the kitchen table at Art Mann Sr.\u2019s house, as they do every Friday. The seven men and women representing different Lancaster societal and business interests were discussing the region\u2019s shortage of clean water, because of farm runoff, fertilizer and salt on the streets.None is in city government or an elected politician; they\u2019re just respected volunteer community activists who will make a recommendation, based on research, to the city or county to get a problem fixed and help galvanize resources to do it. They all know one another\u2019s party affiliation, but they\u2019ve checked them at Mann\u2019s front door.As the breakfast wore on, I was reminded of the business philosopher Dov Seidman\u2019s dictum that \u201ctrust is the only legal performance-enhancing drug.\u201d And I recalled Israeli societal innovator Gidi Grinstein\u2019s dictum that what is saving so many communities today is \u201cleadership without authority \u2014 so many people stepping up to lead beyond their formal authority.\u201dMann, a Republican local metals manufacturer who began his civic life running for the school board, was one of the original conveners of Hourglass \u2014 after looking around Lancaster in the early 1990s and seeing a county that was hemorrhaging jobs and a city that was dying and wholly unprepared for the 21st century.\u201cMy family has been here since 1740 and was always interested in public service,\u201d Mann told me. \u201cWe could see that in the late \u201990s that the county was going to hell if we didn\u2019t do something.

If we let the city die, it would affect the whole county.\u201dUnwilling to let their hometown die a slow death, and fed up with weak municipal politicians, Mann and other civic leaders \u201cgot together in my living room\u201d to become catalysts for change. \u201cOur first insight was that leadership matters\u201d \u2014 and if it wasn\u2019t going to come from the politicians, then it would come from them \u2014 and it would be devoid of party politics.The Lancaster ethic was best described to me by Ray D\u2019Agostino, president of the Lancaster Housing & Opportunity Partnership, one of myriad young societal entrepreneurs I met here. His nonprofit mobilizes citizens to contribute time and resources to build and repair affordable housing.\u201cThere is big P politics \u2014 party politics \u2014 and small P politics,\u201d said D\u2019Agostino. \u201cWe check the big P at the door and just worry about solving the issues \u2014 not worrying about what Republicans or Democrats think about it. It [became] ingrained in us. We still look at things in a conservative or liberal way, but I can work with my liberal friends because we agree on what needs to be done \u2014 and it has to get done. I won\u2019t vote for them, but I will work with them. And you are talking to a guy who is the chairman of the Republican Party for our local school district!\u201dWhen visitors from nearby York, Reading or Harrisburg \u2014 communities not doing all that well \u2014 see what\u2019s happening in Lancaster, \u201cthis is all foreign to them,\u201d added D\u2019Agostino. \u201cI tell them: \u2018You don\u2019t know how to collaborate. You\u2019re still working in silos.\u2019\u201d When a leader from York told him: \u201cRay, you know, we take care of our own. We\u2019re doing things our way,\u201d D\u2019Agostino responded, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201dThat\u2019s also how it used to be in Lancaster. Back around 2000, \u201cnobody was talking to each other,\u201d recalled Mann, which is why the convention center and other projects were stalled. So in December 2005 Hourglass started the \u201cFirst Friday Noontime Forum\u201d to get community leaders, business owners and elected officials into one room \u2014 with no press \u2014 to discuss all the components of fixing the city.\u201cWe found that people who were responsible for key parts of the city, business and government had never met each other,\u201d said Mann. \u201cThey were all in their own silos, and we \u2014 Hourglass \u2014 were neutral, so we could get them together.\u201dMany locals say the turnaround began in the early 2000s, when Lancaster got the chance to have a minor-league baseball team and stadium. The ballpark was originally planned for the suburbs \u2014 no one would come downtown at night \u2014 but a public-private coalition emerged to locate the stadium in the city\u2019s northwest corridor in 2005. Recalled Mann: \u201cI went to opening night and sat next to people from suburbia and they said, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in Lancaster.\u2019\u201dAt the same time, Hourglass, and other groups provided the funds so public officials and the private sector could learn from the best experts in the world on how to lift their city and businesses. These included bringing in the mayor of Charleston, S.C., Joseph Riley, to explain how to build a thriving downtown; Edward Deming to teach quality improvement strategies; and an urban development expert from Brookings, Christopher Leinberger, to help create a long-term growth vision for the city and county. They\u2019ve even looked to Denmark for insights.I found the hunger for best practices profound. \u201cThere is an awareness that all good ideas don\u2019t start here,\u201d said Susan Eckert, president of the Lancaster Partnership for Health. \u201cWho is the best small-city mayor? Let\u2019s call \u2019em. Who is the best urban planner? Call \u2019em. Who are the education transformers? Call \u2019em. Who is doing the most interesting stuff in public health? Call \u2019em. No one is bowling alone here. The civic life and engagement are as rich and dense as anything I have ever seen.\u201dGray describes himself as a \u201cDemocratic capitalist,\u201d which, he said, means: support businesses to invest in town \u2014 because there are no employees without employers \u2014 make sure they pay people a living wage and don\u2019t damage the environment. It was a balance a lot of locals of all political stripes found appealing.\u201cOn the local level I don\u2019t know how many people would come up to me and say: \u2018I am a Republican but I really like what you do,\u2019\u201d said Gray. \u201cWe have gotten over the partisan divide.\u201dAlso in the early 2000s, farsighted community leaders at Franklin & Marshall, the dominant local university, and Lancaster General Hospital, the town\u2019s biggest employer, decided to get together to redevelop the street that connected them, creating a new urban hub of restaurants, entertainment and housing called the \u201cJames Street Improvement District\u201d (which later grew into the Lancaster City Alliance to work on improvements all across the city).F&M and the hospital each committed $250,000 a year for three years to improve the whole northwest quadrant of the city, offering financial incentives for people to buy homes along James Street and fix them up. That led to more attractive homes, park benches, trash cans and lighting, and to F&M eventually tearing down some of the hedges that separated it from the city and making it better neighbor. F&M also built a beautiful new sports complex on the grounds of the demolished Armstrong World Industries plant. The whole corridor has since been reborn as the \u201cEds and Meds\u201d district.All successful complex adaptive coalitions have some kind of college or university in their town. Gray told me he once remarked to F&M\u2019s president, \u201cYou want to make Lancaster a place where students want to come and I want to make it a place where graduates want to stay.\u201dWord got around. Restaurants, bars, coffee houses and businesses began moving in across Lancaster, bringing many young people and start-ups with them.But it was the partnership among Hourglass, the mayor and local business and community leaders and politicians to get the stalled convention center built and a Marriott Hotel next to it \u2014 in the heart of the city \u2014 that made downtown Lancaster not just somewhere people drove through on their way to boutique hotels in Amish country, but a destination of its own.It wasn\u2019t only the First Friday Forum\u2019s getting people together that broke the deadlock over the convention center. It was Gray\u2019s willingness to work with any Republican who would work with him. In particular, he forged a quiet partnership with Lloyd Smucker, a Republican who was then a state senator, to establish a community reinvestment zone that created the income stream to pay off the bonds needed to fund the convention center. \u201cThat was because Smucker and I could work together,\u201d said Gray. \u201cYou get an awful lot done if you don\u2019t worry who gets credit.\u201dPart of Gray\u2019s strategic plan was also to bring public art into the city. \u201cArt makes people feel better about themselves and their communities,\u201d he told me, \u201cso we made a huge push for public art, and we included the neighborhoods in deciding what kind of public art \u2014 and we now have a full-time director of public art for every development in the city.\u201dBut for all its progress digging itself out of a deep hole \u2014 by bridging political divides \u2014 racial divides and policing issues are alive in Lancaster, just like in other cities.Last Thursday a white Lancaster police officer used a Taser on a 27-year-old black man who was sitting on a curb during an arrest \u2014 which he did not appear to be resisting. A bystander\u2019s video of the tasing has amassed more than two million views on Facebook. It\u2019s quite disturbing. The new mayor, Danene Sorace, who has ordered an investigation, told me, \u201cThe progress Lancaster has made in recent years is too precious a thing for us not to respond to this incident in a meaningful way \u2026 and with systemic changes that we were already working on.\u201dThe unemployment rate in Lancaster County is 3.3 percent while in the city it\u2019s over 10 percent. And while some 30 percent of the city lives below the poverty line, it reaches 50 percent in some of the poorest neighborhoods.In other words, this is not nirvana. What differentiates Lancaster from its neighbors is the degree to which it built a complex adaptive coalition to save the city from terminal decline, the resources this has created to try to bridge its still tough economic and racial divides \u2014 and the sheer number of people here who want to get caught trying.You name a challenge and someone here has started a nonprofit \u2014 the Lancaster Coalition for XYZ \u2014 to fix it. For instance, it was the Lancaster County Lead Coalition that brought the City Council\u2019s attention to the horrors of lead poisoning in impoverished neighborhood rental properties, which led to a new set of safety ordinances. How many counties have a lead coalition?Randy Patterson is director of economic development and neighborhood revitalization for the city and past president of the county United Way board. The United Way used to raise dollars through workplace campaigns and then distribute them to 30-some local agencies and partners, each going its own way.\u201cThere were no community-oriented goals,\u201d explained Patterson. \u201cSo the board moved to a collective-impact model \u2014 four bold goals over 10 years \u2014 aimed at reducing poverty by 50 percent; making sure that every child is kindergarten-ready in terms of basic learning skills; ensuring that every adult has access to postsecondary education and credentials; and ensuring that every citizen has access to some kind of health care.So now, he said, \u201cwe raise money through the United Way, but we will only fund collaborative efforts to achieve those four goals. Grants are also for three years, not just one. We\u2019re funding elements of 100 different agencies now, working collaboratively toward these four goals,\u201d and \u201cwe partnered with F&M to measure our success.\u201dTo succeed in today\u2019s world, concluded Patterson, a community has to decide \u201cwhat it wants to be\u201d \u2014 no one is stopping you, but no one will do it for you. Lancaster got that. A lot of its neighboring towns haven\u2019t.The Amish and Mennonites are not just a tourist attraction around here. These faith communities, with their strong family values, work ethic and openness to refugees \u2014 they came to this region to flee religious persecution themselves \u2014 are one of the unique attributes and competitive advantages of Lancaster.\u201cWe have a refugee inflow 20 times the national average,\u201d said Gray, \u201cand we say, \u2019I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from, you are welcome here.\u2019\u201d Local churches, synagogues and mosques have all been active in resettlement, as has business.At the same time, there are roughly 13,000 job openings in Lancaster County, said Tom Baldridge, president of the Chamber of Commerce. Everyone is looking for workers. \u201cThe broader business community here is pro-immigration and wanting to make sure we can assimilate [immigrants] into the community as quickly as we can,\u201d Baldridge said. \u201cThe average education level of immigrants is higher than ours, and [while] the language barrier is real, they have a work ethic beyond belief \u2014 and they love America. We just had dinner with a family from Syria, and afterward we were saying to ourselves, \u2018Why are we scared of this?\u2019\u201dSam Bressi, C.E.O. of the Lancaster County Community Foundation, a private trust set up decades ago that now boasts $100 million in assets, put it to me this way: \u201cWe are not an extraordinary community unless we are an extraordinary community for everyone here. We started the country\u2019s first refugee-oriented community center \u2014 located at a middle school.\u201d It brings together in one neighborhood school all the different nonprofit services the community has to offer for immigrants, a one-stop shop for kids and parents.To be certain that they were in tune with the direction the community wanted to go, Bressi\u2019s foundation also started a \u201ccommunity champion quiz. We set up pop-up booths all over town \u2014 in the central market, local coffee shops, a bilingual training center \u2014 and had a film crew with each one. We asked people: \u2018What is the most important thing for a successful community?\u2019Damaris Rau, superintendent of the Lancaster School District, presides over 11,500 students \u2014 mostly poor, black and brown \u2014 who speak 37 languages. \u201cMy biggest challenge is that 90 percent of our students are eligible for free and reduced lunch,\u201d she told me. To attract more affluent students, the district long ago instituted an international baccalaureate program. To help more needy students, Rau developed a program by which high school seniors who have completed all of their graduation requirements can take college courses in areas of their interest or needed technical skills, like nursing, and the city will pay their tuition. \u201cIt gives them a leg up when they start college.\u201dRau told me about how one church noticed that there were a lot of children waiting for their public school to open each morning, because parents dropped them off and had to get to work. So for the last three years the church has opened early to provide breakfast for the kids.Another thing I\u2019ve seen in all complex adaptive coalitions is the business community getting involved in both K-12 and college courses, translating in real time the skills demanded by global businesses today \u2014 not waiting for the schools to figure it out.For instance, Pete Slaugh Jr., managing director of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, decided to fund a program in entrepreneurship \u2014 with classroom, mentoring and hands-on experiences \u2014 at Millersville University, near Lancaster, to teach students how to turn ideas into products or services. \u201cWe need to make sure employers have workers with the actual skills they need,\u201d said Slaugh.Can Lancaster\u2019s successes be replicated?Yes. Its problems are global and the strategies Lancaster has employed to resurrect itself are shared by complex adaptive coalitions I\u2019ve visited all over. The organization Grinstein, the societal innovator, created, called Reut, is helping to catalyze some in Israel. I took him with me to Lancaster, and afterward he noted common features that all of these successful coalitions share:1. They are mostly started and inspired by civic leaders with no formal authority, and not by politicians, and are driven not by party ideology or affiliation but by a relentless \u201cwhat-works attitude.\u201d2. They all begin with a vision, strategy and benchmarks for rebuilding their community, which enable them \u201cto harness each element of the community and mobilize their unique resources, and societal innovations, behind this vision. \u2026 We call this \u2018extending the yoke.\u2019 The longer yoke you have, the more horses you can have pulling the wagon \u2014 and in a community, the \u2018yoke\u2019 is the inspiring vision and the \u2018horses\u2019 are the business leaders, social entrepreneurs, local colleges, philanthropies, nonprofits and faith-based institutions.\u201d3. They understand that there are no quick fixes for regenerating a community, which is why civic leadership is so crucial \u2014 \u201cbecause civic leaders can adopt a long-term view that transcends political tenures.\u201dSo, on this Fourth of July, it\u2019s worth remembering that it was our ability to do big hard things together as Americans that also got us this far as a country. And if you want to be reminded of what that looks like \u2014 because it is so easy to forget these days \u2014 Art Mann is serving breakfast for the Hourglass folks in his kitchen this Friday. It starts at 7:30 a.m. \u2014 and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d invite you in.Advertisement"}

We asked people. Here\u2019s what we learned.Abdelmalek Ibek Ag Sahli was at work in a petroleum plant on the outskirts of Ouargla that day. He and the rest of his crew had heard it would be hot. They had to be at work by 7 a.m., part of a regular 12-hour daily shift. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was impossible to do the work. It was hell.\u201d By 11 a.m., he and his colleagues walked off the job.Ouargla\u2019s older residents told him they\u2019d never seen a day so hot. In this city of skyscrapers on the edge of the South China Sea, temperatures soared past 91 degrees Fahrenheit for 16 consecutive days in the second half of May. Swimming pools overflowed with people. Office air-conditioners purred. But from morning to night, some of the city\u2019s most essential laborers went about their outdoor work, hauling goods, guarding construction sites, picking up trash.\u201cIt\u2019s very hot and I sweat a lot,\u201d said Lin, who would only give her first name before rushing off on her rounds. \u201cBut there\u2019s no choice, I have to make a living.\u201dPoon Siu-sing, a 58 year-old trash collector, tossed garbage bags into a mounting pile. Sweat plastered the shirt onto his back. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d he maintained. \u201cI\u2019m a robot used to the heat of the sun and rain.\u201d The streets were deserted that day, a local journalist named Zulfiqar Kaskheli said. Shops didn\u2019t bother to open. Taxi drivers kept off the streets to avoid the blazing sun. Throughout the area, hospitals and clinics were swamped. There weren\u2019t enough beds. There weren\u2019t enough medical staff. The power failed repeatedly throughout the day, adding to the chaos. Every day that week, the high temperature in Nawabshah was no less than 113 degrees, according to AccuWeather.\u201cWarning! We remind you about the total ban on fires and barbecuing near the forest and on the islands.\u201dThis was the text message that Oslo residents got from city officials on a Friday afternoon in June. May had been the warmest in 100 years. June was hot, too. By mid-July, a village south of Oslo recorded 19 days when the temperature shot up past 86 degrees Fahrenheit, or 30 Celsius, according to MET Norway. \u201cPeople not being used to this heat, they\u2019re used to leaving a barbecue and nothing happens, Marianne Kjosnes, a spokeswoman for the Oslo Fire Department, said. \u201cNow if a little spark catches the grass, you have a grass fire going.\u201dAt least Marina Zurkow had air conditioning. Ms. Zurkow, an artist, has long been grappling with climate change in her work. But she was still surprised when a day of extreme weather impacted one of her projects in a big way.The name of that project, which was designed to make people think about the impact of climate change on how we eat, is \u201cMaking the Best of It.\u201d It is only half in jest. \u201cIt\u2019s both trying to make the best of a bad situation,\u201d she said, \u201cand in another way it\u2019s a commitment to making things as delicious as possible.\u201d The latest iteration of that project was to host a dinner for a new era of dry, hot weather in California. Less Mediterranean, more Mojave Desert. Ms. Zurkow\u2019s partners, a team of two private chefs called Hank and Bean, prepared an elaborate meal designed to make their guests chew on the impact of climate change. The menu included sage fritters, stuffed rabbit, flatbreads made of cricket and mealworm, and jellyfish. Lots of jellyfish. They had planned to serve dinner al fresco in the courtyard of a downtown Los Angeles test kitchen. But nature had other ideas. That day, the first Friday of July, air from the Mojave blew westward and stalled, compressed and extra hot, over Los Angeles. Downtown hit a high of 108 degrees. It was too hot to eat outside. \u201cEven if you\u2019re talking about climate change, you can\u2019t torture invited guests,\u201d Ms. Zurkow said. \u201cWe had to move the dinner into the kitchen.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an episode in which Riaz Soomro\u2019s father fell ill. While Mr. Soomro recounted the episode as taking place during Ramadan, which ran from May 16 to June 15 in Pakistan this year, his father fell ill on April 30.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a heat wave in which parts of the United States recorded the hottest month of May and the third-hottest month of June. The May record and the near-record in June were for the 48 contiguous states only, not the continental United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "8 Critically Endangered Black Rhinos Die in Kenya", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEight black rhinoceroses died after being transported from a national park in Kenya to a sanctuary meant to help preserve their critically endangered species, the government said on Friday.Wildlife workers say they believe the rhinos died from drinking water with a high saline level in their new environment while being accustomed to fresh water, according to a statement from Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. The government did not specify when the rhinos had died, but said such a high death rate in this sort of transport was \u201cunprecedented\u201d in the country.Workers from the Kenya Wildlife Service were scheduled to relocate 14 black rhinos from Nairobi and Lake Nakuru national parks to a sanctuary meant to aid the conservation effort, the government\u2019s statement said. Eight of the 11 that were moved to Tsavo East National Park, which is southeast of Nairobi, died.The government statement said the salty water most likely led to dehydration in the rhinos, which then prompted them to drink more water, exacerbating the problem. The surviving rhinos that were transported are now being given fresh water.Poachers hunt black rhinos for their horns, which are coveted for traditional Chinese medicinal practices and are displayed as status symbols. In Kenya, where about 80 percent of the world\u2019s wild black rhinos live, conservationists planned to move the rhinos to the Tsavo sanctuary as part of a long-term effort to save the species from extinction by protecting them from poachers.The government agency said that from 2005 to 2017, 149 rhinos were relocated in Kenya with only eight mortalities.Officials plan to announce the results of forensic testing on the rhinos and have opened an independent investigation into the deaths that will be overseen by a veterinary expert from the University of Nairobi. Disciplinary action will be taken if the government finds evidence of \u201cnegligence or unprofessional misconduct\u201d during the transport process, the statement said.Susie Ellis, the executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, said relocating a rhino is a highly delicate process that always carries some risk. Wildlife workers must immobilize the animal, ensure it is calm in the crate so it doesn\u2019t injure itself and then safely reverse the immobilization after the transport.But this death toll is unrivaled on a global scale, Dr. Ellis said.\u201cYou might lose one, you might lose two,\u201d she said, \u201cbut losing eight is unheard-of.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On a Path to Expand the View of Blackness", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo students at Yale are traveling the nation to collect stories of African-AmericansIt seems like hardly a week goes by without a headline about the collision of race, politics and education on American campuses, as policymakers, students and activists battle over hot-button words like diversity and fairness. Often, they speak about groups of people \u2014 black students, Latino students, Asian students \u2014\u00a0rather than focusing on individuals.Vivian: What motivated you to start this project?Vivian: I definitely had a similar experience of not necessarily thinking about race, or thinking about it subconsciously, in middle school, and then coming to grips with it in high school and certainly in college. How did you decide on the series format, on the title? Vivian: I\u2019m curious about the recruitment process. Did you have to convince your subjects to talk about the experience of being black at Yale?This is very personal for me, because I wrote my senior thesis at Yale on what it means to be an Asian-American writer and discovering that identity. I reached out to a lot of Asian-American writers to talk about that, and a lot of them just didn\u2019t want to talk about the topic. They didn\u2019t want to be seen with that label. Involved in that, of course, is their black experience, which they spoke to very well. But we really highlighted that this was about telling their story, and people were very excited about that. You know, very often, you\u2019re right, there is resistance to being pigeonholed into talking about yourself from a particular perspective. And I think a lot of our subjects saw this as an opportunity to avoid being pigeonholed and just tell their story as it is, in full. It\u2019s not new that black students often have to consider things like this. Whether we like it or not, there will always be someone questioning your right to be here, or celebrating the fact that you\u2019re here. Vivian: I\u2019m curious how you see your series engaging or not engaging with politics.Just being a black student at Yale, it becomes political. People see you as, you know, \u201cHere is a black person doing something maybe different than what I expected,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m impressed, because you are black and also you go to Yale.\u201dVivian: What is in each of your cups?Vivian Wang is a reporter at The New York Times, covering New York State politics in Albany.

{"Headline": "Escaping to Freedom, in the Shadows of the Night", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRACE STORIESA new series by the photographer Dawoud Bey summons a time in African-American history when the journey to freedom was made largely under cover of night.In his poem \u201cDream Variations,\u201d published in 1926, Langston Hughes yearned for a time when the African-American worker, exhausted by the daily grind of hard labor and discrimination, might be truly free. This liberation, he imagined, would be achieved not in the glare of daylight, but rather under the brooding, protective cover of night. Inverting a dominant literary conceit, blackness and not whiteness functioned as a metaphor for hope and transcendence \u2014 a \u201cNight coming tenderly/Black like me,\u201d as Mr. Hughes wrote, that abetted the struggle for racial equality and justice.Today, little visual evidence remains of the Underground Railroad, an antebellum network of secret routes and safe houses, maintained by brave black and white \u201cconductors,\u201d which facilitated the escape of slaves to free states and Canada. For Mr. Bey, whose work has often focused on urban environments, the challenge was to create images that evoke the history of largely rural areas. While he photographed sites in Cleveland, he sometimes found the city\u2019s urban character inconsistent with the historical past. His research led him to the more rustic town of Hudson, Ohio, 30 miles southeast of the city, with areas of landscape that are little changed from the years before the Civil War and where several Underground Railroad stations remain.\u201cI wanted the photographs to almost involuntarily pull you back to the experience of the landscape through which those fugitive black bodies were moving in the 19th century to escape slavery,\u201d Mr. Bey said. \u201cSo I had to learn, for the first time, how to make photographs in that kind of space.\u201dThe photographs of \u201cNight Coming Tenderly, Black\u201d are among Mr. Bey\u2019s most sensual and layered. In their splendor and mystery, they transform fields, bodies of water and houses shrouded in darkness into symbols of hope: a pristine picket fence and farmhouse seen through the haze of night; a marsh glistening in twilight; a forest thick with small trees, a scene that is at first claustrophobic then liberating when understood through the lens of history; and an image of Lake Erie, its expansive sky and horizon foreshadowing the independence that lies beyond.Mr. Bey was at first skeptical when the artistic director of the Front International, Michelle Grabner, suggested that he consider installing \u201cNight Coming Tenderly, Black\u201d in St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church. \u201cI\u2019m a white box artist who makes works about nonwhite box things,\u201d he recalled saying to her at the time. He had come to see exhibitions of his photographs as enlivening, engaging and challenging traditional art institutions through imagery typically overlooked by them.Mr. Bey noted that Mr. DeCarava\u2019s photographs were typically printed in a dark and rich tonal range. In this context, the photographic print served as a metaphor for the black subject and experience. \u201cDeCarava used blackness as an affirmative value, as a kind of beautiful blackness through which his subjects both moved and emerged,\u201d Mr. Bey said. \u201cHis work was formative to my own thinking early on, and these dark landscapes are a kind of material conversation with his work, using the darkness of the landscape, and the photographic print as an evocative space of blackness through which the unseen and imaginary black fugitive subject is moving.\u201dUltimately, \u201cNight Coming Tenderly, Black\u201d envisions a historic struggle for freedom not in stark black and white or vivid color but in luminous shades of gray. Like the work of Mr. Hughes and Mr. DeCarava, Mr. Bey\u2019s images refuse to represent the darkness of night as a space of intimidation.\u201cIt is a tender one, through which one moves,\u201d he observes. \u201cThat is the space I imagined the fugitive black subjects moving through as they sought their own self-liberation, moving through the dark landscape of America and Ohio toward freedom under cover of a munificent and blessed blackness.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "California Today: Ferguson Fire Forces Largest Closing of Yosemite in Decades", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Millions of people from across the world visit Yosemite National Park each year for an opportunity to take in the sweeping vistas at one of America\u2019s most treasured natural preserves. But hundreds of visitors were ordered to evacuate the park Wednesday as firefighters struggled to contain the encroaching 38,000-acre Ferguson Fire, which has roared for nearly two weeks and remains just 25 percent contained.Dry conditions have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames.\u201cThe conditions are incredibly strenuous, and we\u2019re seeing triple-digit temperatures in places,\u201d said Dan McKeague, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. \u201cSome sections are extremely remote. Access is limited because there aren\u2019t a ton of existing roads.\u201dDaniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said that long-term drying caused by rising global temperatures has exacerbated the risk of wildfires in the western United States.\u201cOver decades there has been a trend toward less moisture in the soil and forest, and that is affecting how dry the vegetation is becoming in summer,\u201d he said.Mr. Swain said the drought several years ago and resulting bark beetle infestations in forests have combined with rising temperatures to create difficult conditions for containing wildfires.Scott Gediman, a park ranger and spokesman for the National Park Service, said the last major closing because of fire at Yosemite was in 1990 during the A-rock Fire. A flood in 1997 closed the park for about two and a half months, he said, and since then there have been partial closings every so often.\u201cI\u2019ve been a park ranger for 22 years now, so I have plenty of experience in shutting the park down,\u201d Mr. Gediman said. \u201cFloods, fires and my personal favorite: government shutdowns.\u201dRead about the Yosemite fire and other fires raging across the West here.More coverage:The hooded figure vaguely resembles the Grim Reaper, but the structure it is grasping is unmistakably the Golden Gate Bridge.\u201cI\u2019m so confused and terrified and impressed,\u201d one commenter wrote.The creepiest aspect of the piece, he said, was \u201cthe assembly of every element combined: the fog, the size of the monster, the vastness of the ocean.\u201dThe monster, to be clear, is not the Grim Reaper. Mr. Leduc said he was inspired by the Nazg\u00fbls in the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies and didn\u2019t intend for the figure to be the eeriest part of his piece. \u201cSince the concept of surveilling people is a pretty popular theme among 3-D artists nowadays, I thought I\u2019d go with that,\u201d he said.\u201cI love the color and design of the bridge,\u201d Mr. Leduc added. \u201cI would love to visit it one day.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Officials to Tech Workers: Buy Your Lunch", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The corporate campuses of the Bay Area\u2019s technology companies have become independent fiefs with dry cleaning, gyms, doctors, shuttle buses and bountiful free meals, made by the best chefs poached from the region\u2019s famous restaurants. Now, local officials are knocking at the gates.And they are coming for the food.Two San Francisco supervisors introduced an ordinance last week that would forbid employee cafeterias in new corporate construction. It is not clear whether the measure will pass, but it is a direct attack on one of the modern tech industry\u2019s most entrenched traditions.The ordinance, which seeks to force tech workers out of their subsidized cafeterias and into neighborhood restaurants, is the latest attempt by San Francisco leaders to make the tech companies that are migrating north from Silicon Valley adapt to life in the city.Though San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors is not expected to consider the cafeteria ban until the fall, local reaction to it has fallen along the city\u2019s typical, pro- and anti-tech fault lines.\u201cThese tech companies have decided to leave their suburban campuses because their employees want to be in the city, and yet the irony is, they come to the city and are creating isolated, walled-off campuses,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor who is co-sponsoring the bill with Ahsha Safa\u00ed. \u201cThis is not against these folks, it\u2019s for them. It\u2019s to integrate them into the community.\u201dMr. Peskin\u2019s ordinance is also aimed at getting more out of a tax deal given to tech companies that would agree to move into a troubled area called Mid-Market. In 2011, the companies were given tax breaks on payroll and stock options with the hope that they would bring jobs and investment to the neighborhood, just a short walk from San Francisco\u2019s City Hall.Within a few years, a number of companies like Twitter, Square and Uber moved into Mid-Market. But despite initial excitement over the opening of a number of restaurants and shops, the neighborhood has not yet flourished the way many had hoped.Open drug use is still common on the streets around Twitter\u2019s headquarters. Some of the big restaurants that moved in have already moved out because they were not drawing enough customers. A few stories up, in a forbidding Art Deco-style building, Twitter employees enjoy free meals in an expansive corporate cafeteria. Tight security on the ground floor keeps the problems of the street away.\u201cWe gave huge tax breaks to revitalize neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Peskin said. \u201cBut instead, they\u2019re all walled into their tech palaces.\u201dExisting tech kitchens would be grandfathered in under the proposed ordinance, so that anyone who has in-office meals now would keep them. But newcomers would have to learn to eat out or brown bag it.\u201cI\u2019m not taking away anybody\u2019s lunch,\u201d Mr. Peskin said.\u201cThere\u2019s never been anything on the scale of what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said Ms. Berlin, who wrote a history of the industry called \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered what\u2019s lost in this trend to just constantly stay in your own ecosystem. What are the risks in these siloed monocultures?\u201dTo some tech workers, targeting their free food feels more like scapegoating for the city\u2019s problems than like sound policy. San Francisco had drug and homelessness issues long before Twitter came along. Tech companies cannot be blamed for local policies that have helped to derail new housing construction. And not every computer programmer, they note, is a millionaire.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat,\u201d said James Manning, 43, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories, where in-office meals are heavily subsidized. \u201cThe idea the food doesn\u2019t need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.\u201dAs he talked, Mr. Manning was having lunch (barbecue ribs) on a foray outside his office \u201cas a treat\u201d because he was meeting up with friends.\u201cIt\u2019s the food equivalent of going out for drinks,\u201d he said.Certainly, not all tech companies in San Francisco offer employees free meals. Salesforce, the largest tech employer in the city, does not. And Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame, a start-up that offers free credit scores, said the cafeteria ban could help him compete for workers.\u201cThis could even the playing field a bit,\u201d he said. He said his company had just recruited someone from Google, which is hard because it cannot match the food spread.Katherine Chiao, the co-owner of Kagawa-Ya Udon, a Japanese bistro that shares a building with the Uber and Square offices in Mid-Market, said the corporate cafeterias were making local restaurants \u201cunsustainable.\u201d Workers do not come downstairs to eat, she said.\u201cAll the restaurants that moved in here, we\u2019re just sitting ducks,\u201d Ms. Chiao said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to go down next?\u201dIn the center of Mid-Market, downstairs from Twitter, is a buzzing grocery store and food court called the Market. The food hall includes a poke bar, an organic chicken sandwich counter, a wine bar and a Malaysian restaurant. But it is hard to compete with free.Michael Cohen, the Market\u2019s managing partner, said he visited some of the tech company cafeterias and was shocked to see people not only eating their free lunches \u2014 they were picking up a few things to eat at home.\u201cThey\u2019re grabbing extra fruit, snacks, drinks, right out of the refrigerators,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong grocer, and I saw people shopping.\u201dStill, he offered as a caveat, the bigger issue for him is crime, street chaos and the staggering expense of security (there are several security guards at the door and inside). Recently, someone took off their pants in the store and had to be carried out by a guard, only to come back and urinate on a window.\u201cI\u2019ve operated grocery stores all over the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis environment is the most challenging I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201dSitting outside the Market were two tech workers dressed in layers for the San Francisco summer chill, wearing corporate badges on drawstrings. Free food, they said, was more necessity than luxury.\u201cI\u2019d personally rather have the cash,\u201d said Tim Bellay, 40, a software engineer at Microsoft, which has a local office.\u201cIf I have food upstairs, I\u2019m not going to pay for it, no way,\u201d said K. C. Clawson, 35, who does business analytics for Microsoft. \u201cI\u2019m so cheap.\u201dWhat then do they spend their money on?\u201cRent,\u201d Mr. Bellay said flatly.\u201cRent,\u201d Ms. Clawson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. Even on weekends. You know, I used to go out. I used to go out to restaurants all the time. I used to love it. Now in San Francisco, when I don\u2019t eat at the office, I cook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Human rights advocates and other defenders of Mr. Reisch said they thought he was being used as a scapegoat.\u201cThere was no mention in court of the captain violating international rules or about what happened during the rescue operation,\u201d said Neil Falzon, the director of the Aditus Foundation, a Maltese human rights group that is offering legal assistance to Mr. Reisch. \u201cThey are targeting NGOs to target anyone dealing with immigrants.\u201dMr. Falzon said that the decision to prosecute Mr. Reisch and the Lifeline had occurred only after comments from local politicians.\u201cThe goal is to hamper NGOs activities to rescue lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut refugees will continue leaving Libya, and the solution can\u2019t be to let people die.\u201dMr. Reisch, who pleaded not guilty, said, \u201cWe did the right thing,\u201d adding that he had not committed any crime.Bail conditions imposed by the court mean that he must stay in Malta for the length of a trial, Mr. Reisch\u2019s lawyers said. He will have to check in with a police station weekly. Should he leave Malta, he will face a fine of 10,000 euros, about $11,600.His lawyers said that saving people in distress was the golden rule of anyone out at sea, and that governments were using charities\u2019 work as a political statement to press for closed borders at the European Union level.Malta is not the first country to act against private volunteer groups operating in the central Mediterranean. Italian prosecutors have sought charges against a few nonprofits in the past year for what they said were murky connections with traffickers in Libya.Last month, judges in Palermo, Sicily, cleared two European organizations of accusations that they had ties to human smugglers and had aided and abetted illegal immigration.The Maltese authorities on Monday also stopped another vessel, operated by Sea-Watch, one of five nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean, without providing any legal or technical explanation, the group said.Human rights advocates expressed concern over the approach taken by Italy and Malta.\u201cThe NGOs are present to fill a lifesaving gap in the absence of a state-led response to reduce the loss of lives,\u201d said Federico Soda, Italy\u2019s director of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cI don\u2019t expect this to change.\u201dThe migration agency estimated that more than 200 migrants drowned last weekend off Libya. While the number of migrants arriving to Italy this year is roughly 26,000 \u2014 down 80 percent compared with the same period last year \u2014 1,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean in 2018. Over the weekend, Italian newspapers carried pictures of Libyan Coast Guard officials holding three babies who had died in a shipwreck.Humanitarian groups arrived in the Mediterranean in mid-2015, after a handful of deadly shipwrecks following the end of Europe\u2019s Mare Nostrum program, in which Italian ships served as the front line in rescue operations. European leaders had reduced funding for the mission and left only some naval vessels patrolling the Mediterranean.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Wars? Three Funds Made Solid Profits Anyway", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter \u2014 as well as over the last five years \u2014 by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.\u201cSemiconductors are China\u2019s largest import, even more than oil,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies.\u201dMs. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances. GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.\u201cCancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., if you get cancer, you\u2019re likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time. In China, 65 percent of treatment is still chemotherapy.\u201dA challenge for an investor in emerging-market small caps is a dearth of the corporate disclosures and market regulation that developed-world investors take for granted. Ms. Hsiao said she compensated by sleuthing.\u201cI\u2019ll interview ex-bosses and ex-co-workers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I visit a factory, I always ask to see the defects. How do they define a defect? If a little scratch qualifies as a defect, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to cheat me on the numbers.\u201dMs. Hsiao\u2019s fund, which has a net expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 2.37 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. For the five years that ended June 30, it returned an annualized average of 14.78 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re usually overweight the U.S. because that\u2019s where the best intellectual property is,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cBut after the Trump victory, we went underweight because stocks went up so much, and emerging markets were in crisis.\u201dMr. Eiswert called himself a \u201ccareful contrarian\u201d about emerging markets and said he waited for crises to buy companies he liked.The fund\u2019s largest emerging-market bet \u2014 the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant \u2014 is also its largest holding. (Alibaba is based in China but has American depositary receipts that trade in the United States.)\u201cFacebook, Amazon, Google \u2014 there are elements of natural monopoly in those businesses,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s similar with Alibaba. And monopolies are good ways to make money.\u201d Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s holding company, Alphabet, are also top holdings.The fund has a heavy slug of technology stocks \u2014 about a third of its assets, compared with only a fifth for the typical world stock fund tracked by Morningstar. That allocation may reflect Mr. Eiswert\u2019s background: He spent about a decade as a tech analyst and tech fund manager for T.

Dimensional doesn\u2019t make many real estate investments in its other stock mutual funds because many clients already have some exposure through vacation homes and rental properties, Mr. Chi said. Its separate real estate funds let them fine-tune their overall asset allocations.Mr. Chi said this fund didn\u2019t make bets on individual securities, gathering up promising ones and avoiding potential laggards, but rather held a broadly diversified basket of real estate investment trusts \u2014 nearly 450 in all. The holdings are generally weighted by market capitalization \u2014 the larger a REIT\u2019s market cap, the larger its place in the fund.Though the fund is actively managed, it focuses on minimizing costs and generally keeps turnover very low, recently about 2 percent.\u201cTurnover is expensive, so we\u2019re very cost sensitive about how we trade,\u201d Mr. Chi said.The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.24 percent, returned 5.36 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 7.43 percent over the last five years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Quiet Death of Racial Progress", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow can we stop backsliding toward inequality?Opinion ColumnistOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been trying to write a comforting column. The thesis was going to be that even though Donald Trump is doing his best to inflame racial division, we are still making gradual progress against racism and racial disparities.Unfortunately, this is not that comforting column. The deeper I dug into the evidence, the more I came to doubt the idea that we are still making progress on race. For every positive statistic indicating racial reconciliation, there was one indicating stagnation or even decay.When it comes to segregation, the story is even worse. One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the past decades is that place really matters \u2014 the nature of your neighborhood and surroundings.As a nation we seem to have lost all enthusiasm for racial integration. A culture of individualism has led people to focus more on individual outcomes and less on the components of each community. We have settled into a reality that is separate and unequal, and we seem not too alarmed about that.I\u2019d say the correct response to all this is an attitude I encounter a lot among people who are working in these communities, which you might call left on structural racism and right on cultural accountability.That is to say, the left-wingers have it correct when they point to the systems of oppression that pervade society: the legacy of residential segregation; the racist attitudes in the workplace that demonstrably make it much harder for African-American men to get jobs; the prejudices \u2014 in the schools, in the streets and in the judicial system \u2014 that make it much more likely that African-American males will be punished, incarcerated and marginalized.But conservatives are right to point to the importance of bourgeois norms. Three institutions do an impressive job of reducing racial disparity: the military, marriage and church. As the A.E.I. study shows, black men who served in the military are more likely to be in the middle class than those who did not. Black men who attended religious services are 76 percent more likely to attain at least middle-class status than those who did not. As Chetty\u2019s research shows, the general presence of fathers \u2014 not just one\u2019s own \u2014 in the community is a powerful determinant of whether young men will be able to rise and thrive.We\u2019ve fallen into a bogus logjam in which progressives emphasize systems of oppression and conservatives emphasize cultural norms. Both critiques are correct. If we\u2019re going to do something about this appalling retrogression on race, we probably need to be radical on both ends.Advertisement"}

To me this is about, no matter who lives in these areas and who they believe in, they have to profess to the values required to have a good life in Denmark.\u201dYildiz Akdogan, a Social Democrat whose parliamentary constituency includes Tingbjerg, which is classified as a ghetto, said Danes had become so desensitized to harsh rhetoric about immigrants that they no longer register the negative connotation of the word \u201cghetto\u201d and its echoes of Nazi Germany\u2019s separation of Jews.\u201cWe call them \u2018ghetto children, ghetto parents,\u2019 it\u2019s so crazy,\u201d Ms. Akdogan said. \u201cIt is becoming a mainstream word, which is so dangerous. People who know a little about history, our European not-so-nice period, we know what the word \u2018ghetto\u2019 is associated with.\u201dShe pulled out her phone to display a Facebook post from a right-wing politician, railing furiously at a Danish supermarket for selling a cake reading \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d for the Muslim holiday of Eid. \u201cRight now, facts don\u2019t matter so much, it\u2019s only feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the dangerous part of it.\u201dFor their part, many residents of Danish \u201cghettos\u201d say they would move if they could afford to live elsewhere. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Naassan was sitting with her four sisters in Mjolnerparken, a four-story, red brick housing complex that is, by the numbers, one of Denmark\u2019s worst ghettos: forty-three percent of its residents are unemployed, 82 percent come from \u201cnon-Western backgrounds,\u201d 53 percent have scant education and 51 percent have relatively low earnings.The Naassan sisters wondered aloud why they were subject to these new measures. The children of Lebanese refugees, they speak Danish without an accent and converse with their children in Danish; their children, they complain, speak so little Arabic that they can barely communicate with their grandparents. Years ago, growing up in Jutland, in Denmark\u2019s west, they rarely encountered any anti-Muslim feeling, said Sara, 32.\u201cMaybe this is what they always thought, and now it\u2019s out in the open,\u201d she said. \u201cDanish politics is just about Muslims now. They want us to get more assimilated or get out. I don\u2019t know when they will be satisfied with us.\u201dRokhaia, her due date fast approaching, flared with anger at the mandatory preschool program approved by the government last month: Already, she said, her daughter was being taught so much about Christmas in kindergarten that she came home begging for presents from Santa Claus.\u201cNobody should tell me whether or how my daughter should go to preschool. Or when,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather lose my benefits than submit to force.\u201dBarwaqo Jama Hussein, 18, a Somali refugee, noted that many immigrant families, including her own, had been settled in \u201cghetto\u201d neighborhoods by the government. She moved to Denmark when she was 5 and has lived in the Tingbjerg ghetto area since she was 13. She said the politicians\u2019 description of \u201cparallel societies\u201d simply did not fit her, or Tingbjerg.\u201cIt hurts that they don\u2019t see us as equal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually live in Danish society. We follow the rules, we go to school. The only thing we don\u2019t do is eat pork.\u201dAbout 12 miles south of the city, in the middle-class suburb of Greve, though, voters gushed with approval over the new laws.\u201cThey spend too much Danish money,\u201d said Dorthe Pedersen, a hairdresser, daubing chestnut dye on a client\u2019s hairline. \u201cWe pay their rent, their clothing, their food, and then they come in broken Danish and say, \u2018We can\u2019t work because we\u2019ve got a pain.\u2019\u201dHer client, Anni Larsen, told a story about being invited by a Turkish immigrant to their child\u2019s wedding and being scandalized to discover that the guests were separated by gender and seated in different rooms. \u201cI think there were only 10 people from Denmark,\u201d she said, appalled. \u201cIf you ask me, I think they shouldn\u2019t have invited us.\u201dAnette Jacobsen, 64, a retired pharmacist\u2019s assistant, said she so treasured Denmark\u2019s welfare system, which had provided her four children with free education and health care, that she felt a surge of gratitude every time she paid her taxes, more than 50 percent of her yearly income. As for immigrants using the system, she said, \u201cThere is always a cat door for someone to sneak in.\u201d\u201cMorally, they should be grateful to be allowed into our system, which was built over generations,\u201d she said.Her husband, Jesper, a former merchant sailor whose ship once docked in Lebanon, said he had watched laborers there being shot for laziness and replaced by truckloads of new workers gathered in the countryside.\u201cI think they are 300 to 400 years behind us,\u201d Jesper said.\u201cTheir culture doesn\u2019t fit here,\u201d Anette said.The new hard-edge push to force Muslims to integrate struck both of them as positive. \u201cThe young people will see what it is to be Danish and they will not be like their parents,\u201d Jesper said.\u201cThe grandmothers will die sometime,\u201d Anette said. \u201cThey are the ones resisting change.\u201dBy focusing heavily on the collective cost of supporting refugee and immigrant families, the Danish People\u2019s Party has won many voters away from the center-left Social Democrats, who had long been seen as the defenders of the welfare state. With a general election approaching next year, the Social Democrat party has shifted to the right on immigration, saying tougher measures are necessary to protect the welfare state.Critics would say \u201cthe state cannot force children away from their parents in the daytime, that\u2019s disproportionate use of force,\u201d said Rune Lykkeberg, the editor in chief of Dagbladet Information, a left-liberal daily newspaper. \u201cBut the Social Democrats say, \u2018We give people money, and we want something for this money.\u2019 This is a system of rights and obligations.\u201dDanes have a high level of trust in the state, including as a central shaper of children\u2019s ideology and beliefs, he said. \u201cThe Anglo-Saxon conception is that man is free in nature, and then comes the state\u201d constraining that freedom, he said. \u201cOur conception of freedom is the opposite, that man is only free in society.\u201dGet the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.\u201cYou could say, of course, parents have the right to bring up their own kids,\u201d he added. \u201cWe would say they do not have the right to destroy the future freedom of their children.\u201dOf course, he added, \u201cThere is always a strong sense of authoritarian risk.\u201dMs. Hussain, the high school student from Tingbjerg, is accustomed to anti-immigrant talk surging ahead of elections, but says this year it is harsher than she can ever remember.\u201cIf you create new kinds of laws that apply to only one part of society, then you can keep adding to them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will turn into the parallel society they\u2019re so afraid of. They will create it themselves.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect estimate of the number of Muslims in Denmark. There are half a million non-Western immigrants and descendants; the Danish government does not provide statistics on religious groups.Anna Schaverien contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

On that we can agree, yes? Seriously? He imperiled his family\u2019s finances because he couldn\u2019t get enough of the team that has been a bipartisan waste of time and energy for people in Washington for a decade?But the Nats? They are the most soul-sucking strain of professional sports franchise. Not awful. Not great. Just tempting enough for suckers to believe they might be one or the other. Judge Kavanaugh went to Yale Law School, right? My dad did, too, and I\u2019ve smugly bragged on it for years. But maybe reputations aren\u2019t what they seem \u2014 Yale\u2019s, I mean, not my dad\u2019s.Are we so deep into the post-fact era that we can\u2019t expect a Supreme Court nominee to take seriously the irrefutable evidence before him?So while Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings are weeks away, it\u2019s not too early for both parties to begin preparing the baseball brief against him. On Tuesday night, in the actual All-Star game, there were a record 10 home runs hit. Exactly none of them by Harper, who went 0-for-2, striking out twice.There is, too, the team\u2019s new manager, Dave Martinez, named before the season to supposedly put the Nats over the top. I covered Martinez as a player, and while my powers of recall have eroded in all sorts of unfortunate ways, I ought to be able to remember a single distinctive thing he did or said. Of course I can\u2019t because it only makes sense that the Nats, famous for not showing up in big spots, would choose to be led by an invisible former player.The managing history gets worse. In 2011, Jim Riggleman up and quit on the Nats. His. Own. Team. Midseason. During a hot streak. Seems he wanted a contract extension, though he appeared to stress he wasn\u2019t deluding himself, either.\u201cI know I\u2019m not Casey Stengel,\u201d Riggleman said at the time. Few rushed to argue the point. Americans have come to take a lot for granted about the Supreme Court nomination process. It will be bitter. There will be serious talk about abortion and originalism. But surely judges guilty of crimes don\u2019t deserve a shot, even if the crimes are just against good taste or common sense.The Nats played their final series of the season\u2019s first half against the Mets last week, one of the few teams actually more snakebit than the Nats. They could do no more than split four games, and so they enter the second half in third place in the National League East with a record that stands at a perfectly appropriate .500 \u2014 a living, lightly breathing embodiment of mediocrity.Judge Kavanaugh dropped tens of thousands on this franchise? I know, I know, it seems like part of his debt resulted from him buying Nats tickets for friends.

Nothing Good", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president talks tough about drug prices, but pharmaceutical companies hear sweet nothings.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Taken together, the developments help explain why, a year and a half after Mr. Trump took office, prescription drugs cost more than ever.These machinations would be troubling enough by themselves. But the administration seems intent on adding insult to injury, by blocking states from carrying out a policy that might actually make a dent in the drug-cost problem. That proposal would have opened the door on allowing state Medicaid programs to deny coverage for certain medications. Private insurance companies, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other countries with drug prices far lower than ours already do this, but Medicaid is required to cover all federally approved medications, no matter how much they cost or how well (or poorly) they work. If states were allowed to circumvent this rule, they would be able to avoid paying for pricey new drugs that aren\u2019t necessarily as effective as cheaper versions already on the market. They would also have much more negotiating power because they would be able to walk away from the table for drugs that were overpriced. \u201cIt takes away a substantial tool that a lot of states were hoping to use,\u201d says Rachel Sachs, a law professor and drug policy expert at Washington University in St. Louis. It also points to a hypocrisy, she says. \u201cThey\u2019re permissive when it comes to work requirements that put added burden on the vulnerable, but protective when it comes to measures that would strain the pharmaceutical industry.\u201dThe good news is that elections are coming, and lawmakers know that Americans are enraged by soaring drug costs.

{"Headline": "Mice Don\u2019t Know When to Let It Go, Either", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnimals, like humans, are reluctant to give up on pursuits they\u2019ve invested in, psychologists report. Suppose that, seeking a fun evening out, you pay $175 for a ticket to a new Broadway musical. Seated in the balcony, you quickly realize that the acting is bad, the sets are ugly and no one, you suspect, will go home humming the melodies. Do you head out the door at the intermission, or stick it out for the duration?Studies of human decision-making suggest that most people will stay put, even though money spent in the past logically should have no bearing on the choice. This \u201csunk cost fallacy,\u201d as economists call it, is one of many ways that humans allow emotions to affect their choices, sometimes to their own detriment. But the tendency to factor past investments into decision-making is apparently not limited to Homo sapiens. The more time they invested in waiting for a reward \u2014 in the case of the rodents, flavored pellets; in the case of the humans, entertaining videos \u2014 the less likely they were to quit the pursuit before the delay ended. \u201cWhatever is going on in the humans is also going on in the nonhuman animals,\u201d said A. David Redish, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Minnesota and an author of the study. This cross-species consistency, he and others said, suggested that in some decision-making situations, taking account of how much has already been invested might pay off.\u201cEvolution by natural selection would not promote any behavior unless it had some \u2014 perhaps obscure \u2014 net overall benefit,\u201d said Alex Kacelnik, a professor of behavioral ecology at Oxford, who praised the new study as \u201crigorous\u201d in its methodology and \u201cwell designed.\u201d \u201cIf everybody does it, the reasoning goes, there must be a reason,\u201d Dr. Kacelnik said.Even more important than the similarity among species was the study\u2019s finding that sunk cost effects appeared only after the subjects had decided to pursue a reward, Dr. Redish noted, not while they were still deliberating whether to do so.In effect, the animals seemed to consider the deliberation time not to be part of their investment \u2014 an indication, Dr. Redish said, that different brain processes might be at work in different aspects of decision-making. The idea runs counter to the notion that \u201ctime is time, and you\u2019re wasting it either way,\u201d he said. Shelly Flagel, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said the research had \u201cfar-reaching implications across fields including education, economics, psychology, neuroscience and psychiatry.\u201d For example, she said, persisting in a behavior even though it has adverse consequences is reminiscent of the conduct \u201cexhibited by people with addictions.\u201d\u201cOnce they start searching for their next \u2018fix,\u2019 they will often go hours or days on the same quest, even if it means giving up food, relationships, their job,\u201d Dr. Flagel said. Learning more about the distinct processes that go awry in psychiatric disorders like addiction might yield new strategies for treatment, she added.In the study, led by a doctoral student, Brian M. Sweis, three research laboratories at the University of Minnesota collaborated to conduct tests on mice, rats and humans. The rodents were trained to forage for the flavored pellets \u2014 banana, chocolate, grape or plain \u2014 in a square maze with a \u201crestaurant\u201d in each corner. The humans were taught to \u201cforage\u201d on a computer for videos of kittens, a dance competition, landscapes or bicycle accidents. Both rodents and humans were given an overall time limit for the foraging tasks.In the rodents\u2019 version of the task, the animal first entered an \u201coffer zone\u201d outside a restaurant and heard a pitched tone that informed it how long the wait would be for the pellet reward \u2014 a delay that varied randomly from 1 to 30 seconds. The animal could skip the offer, in which case it was withdrawn, or it could enter the \u201cwait zone\u201d of the restaurant, setting off a countdown signaled by a descending tone. At any time during the countdown, the rodent could choose to leave the restaurant, but once it left it could not return without going all the way around through the other restaurant offer zones.In the human version of the experiment, subjects were offered a video and presented with buttons saying \u201cstay\u201d or \u201cskip.\u201d A download bar informed them how long they would have to wait to view the video. Clicking the \u201cstay\u201d button started a countdown, and the screen showed the progression of the download. The study found that the more time the rodents spent in the \u201cwait zone,\u201d the more likely they were to stick out the delay to the end, even though the longer they waited, the more it cut into their overall time to seek food. Similarly, the longer the human subjects spent waiting for a video to download, the more likely they were to stay the course until the download was finished. Surprisingly, the amount of time that the subjects \u2014 rodent or human \u2014 spent deliberating whether to accept the \u201coffer\u201d of a reward did not affect whether they quit before receiving it or stayed through to the end. \u201cObviously, the best thing is as quick as possible to get into the wait zone,\u201d Dr. Redish said. \u201cBut nobody does that. Somehow, all three species know that if you get into the wait zone, you\u2019re going to pay this sunk cost, and they actually spend extra time deliberating in the offer zone so that they don\u2019t end up getting stuck.\u201d Dr. Flagel, of the University of Michigan, noted that as compelling as the new research was, it was not without limitations, including the fact that the tasks presented to humans and rodents, though similar in some ways, were still quite different.\u201cThe challenge moving forward,\u201d Dr. Flagel said, \u201cis going to be to know that one is truly capturing the same phenomenon across species. Or perhaps more appropriately, what is the meaning of the differences that will be revealed between species?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Wine and Critics, Populists Find an Easy Target", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourStudies keep drawing the conclusion that people like cheap wines best and should not trust experts. But the findings say more about fears than tastes.Every few years an article bubbles up with claims that expensive wines are really no better than cheap ones. The findings come with an inevitable corollary: essentially, that you are better off seeking advice from random strangers in a bar than from wine experts.The bigger question is: Why is wine so regularly singled out in the United States to be assailed as something of a con game? And what is it about wine critics that invites such gleeful dismissals of their knowledge and judgment?One reason these populist studies resonate is that they all contain elements of truth. While it may be ridiculous to assert generally that expensive wines are no better than cheap wines, it is absolutely true that many expensive wines are not as good as many cheaper wines. The essential point the wine populists, and many of these studies, make is that ordinary people with little knowledge of wine prefer cheap wines to expensive ones, even if wine critics prefer more expensive bottles. Therefore, people should not listen to know-it-all wine critics because they will lead them to spend more for wines that are not to their tastes. The studies concede that the more people knew about wine, the more their tastes aligned with the critics\u2019. So it might have been reasonable for the studies to conclude instead that people\u2019s tastes evolve as they learn more about wine. But that would not have offered the same satisfying punch line.In any case, what is it about wine that permits it to be subjected to the indignity of a popularity contest? J.K. Rowling has sold a lot more books than Saul Bellow, and given the choice, most people would probably prefer to read Ms. Rowling. But does that lead to the conclusion that Nobel-winning authors like Mr. Bellow are for suckers?Authors of these gotcha wine expos\u00e9s may know better, but they publish them anyway because they understand that an American audience will find them particularly gratifying.Wine in American culture has long been a synonym for snobbery. I\u2019m sorry to say that wine culture has partly brought this on itself with its history of pretension, its equating of wine with connoisseurship, and the absurd vocabulary and rituals that many people assume must be mastered simply to enjoy wine.No politicians, no matter how much they enjoy wine in private, would dare be seen campaigning with a stemmed glass in hand \u2014 not when a can of Bud could be brandished instead. As much as people love wine and as important as it is to the economy of several American states, it is still viewed by American society as somehow foreign, un-American, effete, prissy and intellectual. Wine is a convenient subject for bashing because, let\u2019s face it, it is intimidating and anxiety-producing no matter what silly steps the wine business takes to simplify or demystify it. It\u2019s a little late for that, anyway. For far too long, the industry has been complicit in equating wine with stuffy connoisseurship. Before one could simply enjoy wine, one had to take \u201cwine appreciation\u201d classes, read textbooks and learn the esoteric vocabulary of tasting notes in which, simply to enjoy a glass of wine, one had to break down the constituent elements of a swallow into a grocery list of aromas and flavors. Left out of the equation are the emotions that wine provokes, the companionship it brings and its place on the table (except in the sense of the so-called art of food-and-wine pairing, which, with its own formulas and rules can be as intimidating as wine itself). The efforts to demystify and simplify never ring true because they ignore the fact that wine by its nature is mystifying and complicated. These qualities can be embraced and celebrated without suggesting that they require mastering, but that would force us to think and talk about wine in a different sort of way, as a food staple to be enjoyed rather than as a symbol of status or as a \u201clifestyle.\u201dI think we have made a start in that direction, but the regular reappearance of articles like Vox\u2019s demonstrate that the old way of looking at wine still has a firm hold. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that many people will not enjoy the mass-produced bottles, nor do I fault anybody who is satisfied with those wines. But if you are curious and want to drink better, more distinctive wines, the slightly higher price is money well spent. It\u2019s a matter of choosing craft over commerce, the difference between a fast-food burger and one from a cook who grinds the beef, cooks it to order and sees that the roll and condiments are of similar high quality. It will cost more, but for some people the expense will be worth it. Good wine critics present arguments and offer as evidence the bottles themselves. They make their cases with love and hope. The goal is to inspire curiosity, to promote ease and comfort with wine, to enlighten, to entertain and, occasionally, to offer vicarious pleasure. For those who believe they are demeaned by wine or wine writers, I would suggest it is the wine populists who are doing the demeaning, by pandering to inchoate feelings of fear and resentment. These feelings may well be real. But they are not caused by wine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Woman Whose Hair Frightens Iran", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When Masih Alinejad was a girl in the tiny Iranian village of Ghomikola, her father \u2014 who eked out a living selling chickens, ducks and eggs \u2014 once brought home a thick yellow stick. Her mother, the village tailor, cut it into six tiny pieces at her husband\u2019s instruction. Each child got one, including the youngest, our author. The yellow stick was a banana, a fruit that the poor family had never seen or tasted. Alinejad, the rebel of the lot, didn\u2019t listen when told to throw the skin away; she sneaked it to school the next day to show off to her friends.She got away with it, but the episode was a precursor of what is to come; hers is a life of rebellions big and small followed by ignominious and sometimes draconian punishments. At 18, Alinejad, who would ultimately rise from her humble beginnings to become one of Iran\u2019s top journalists, is carried off to prison. She has been stealing books and carrying on with a ragtag group of feverish ideologues whose crime is printing pamphlets calling for greater dissent in Iranian society. It is enough to get them all arrested.When Alinejad is finally let out, she is a changed woman \u2014 and not only because of the imprisonment. She is also pregnant, a fact that she discovers during her internment. The father is her fianc\u00e9. Iranian marriages are two-part affairs; though the legal portion of theirs is complete, the traditional reception has not taken place, which means her parents regard the couple as just engaged. Her pregnancy, therefore, is a scandal. Alinejad, stubborn as well as rebellious, is not terribly bothered. \u201cI still don\u2019t want a wedding. I hate weddings,\u201d she insists to her father when she finds out about the rushed face-saving feast he has arranged. \u201cIt\u2019s not for you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cThe wedding is for the family, to show that we have raised a fine daughter, even though you\u2019ve given us so much grief.\u201dThere is more grief on the way. The marriage, which gets Alinejad out of the tiny village of Ghomikola, does not last. Her poet-husband runs off to marry a woman he met at a literary salon, leaving Alinejad alone with a small child in Tehran. At the divorce trial, the odds are stacked against her. \u201cI don\u2019t want his money,\u201d she proudly tells the judge, refusing the alimony that is due her. He denies her custody of her 3-year-old son anyway. \u201cI was all by myself,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was September 2000, a week before my 24th birthday.\u201dThe story of Alinejad\u2019s rise and recovery from that dark moment is the anchor of \u201cThe Wind in My Hair.\u201d Told poignantly and with a blunt honesty that seems a characteristic of Alinejad\u2019s life and writing, here is a gripping tale that permits us to peek at the inner workings of the Iranian Revolution and consider the question of its health and longevity.Not even the president intimidates her. Hanging out in the hallways in the days after the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to Shirin Ebadi, she encounters none other than the entourage of President Khatami. \u201cMr. Khatami, the whole world has been congratulating Shirin Ebadi. Do you intend to congratulate your fellow citizen?\u201d she yells over her counterparts. President Khatami hears the question, but it annoys him. His peeved response, uncharacteristic for him, catapults Alinejad to journalistic notoriety; now even the president\u2019s brother recognizes her in the hallways of the Majlis. She has come a long way from her days of sneaking banana peels.The easing or tightening of restrictions on women\u2019s dress, Alinejad notes, is a barometer of Iranian politics; when a new, less reformist Majlis is elected, for instance, women reporters receive admonitions to improve their appearances. One day it is Alinejad\u2019s turn. A plump cleric shakes a fist at her and yells, \u201cCover your hair, or I\u2019ll punch you out of here,\u201d when he sees a tiny bit of hair escaping from her hijab. We should all know what happens next. Alinejad, ever the reactionary, yells back: \u201cAll this fuss about two strands of hair. You should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d The ensuing altercation has to be broken up by others. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you a lesson,\u201d the cleric says as he walks away.It is bitter vengeance. Not long after, Alinejad loses her press pass. She continues to write ever more incendiary articles, getting scoops that expose the graft and corruption of the overtly pious Islamic Republic, but she also begins a series of trips to London and ultimately finds exile in America.It is while abroad that she founds the Facebook page \u201cMy Stealthy Freedom,\u201d which encourages women to photograph themselves without their hijabs. The page, soon followed by hundreds of thousands of women, ignites a protest against compulsory headscarves.Two-thirds of \u201cThe Wind in My Hair\u201d is a story of a woman struggling against incredible odds, poverty, political repression and personal crises. It seems, until this point, a departure from the narrative arc that is often forced on Muslim woman memoirs, one that requires the proverbial (and literal) throwing off of the veil and an embrace of what are seen as Western values. Alinejad seems set to avoid this victim-turned-escapee trajectory and she very nearly does. One believes her when she expresses the granular and grass-roots nature of the Iranian movement against the compulsory hijab, and one also believes her detractors who say, \u201cYou think we don\u2019t have bigger problems than compulsory hijab?\u201d In both is a prescient expos\u00e9 of the cruelty of paradigms, the constrictions of the Muslim woman liberation tale and the often maddening centrality of the veil within it.\u201cThe Wind in My Hair\u201d exposes just how vexing it is to disentangle the veil from the context in which it is worn and thus to wage a transnational fight either for its permissibility or its elimination. Now in exile, Alinejad, a woman of exceptional courage, must face the tragedy of being territorially torn from a struggle that is uniquely Iranian and also crucially feminist. In Trump\u2019s America, the agenda of \u201cMy Stealthy Freedom\u201d confronts the further danger of being sucked into the maw of a massive American warmongering machine, eager to drop bombs, to eliminate veils and mean Muslim men. This is not Alinejad\u2019s goal, and she tries mightily to articulate the difference, the possibility, of opposing both those who enforce the veil and those who wish to ban it. Born as it is in a world carved into binaries, blue or red, reformist or conservative, \u201cThe Wind in My Hair\u201d will likely be judged not on its nuance but on which cruelty, that of the imposed veil or that of the banned veil, cuts more, not on how far Alinejad has come but on how far she still has to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How WhatsApp Leads Mobs to Murder in India", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "In India, false rumors about child kidnappers have gone viral on WhatsApp, prompting fearful mobs to kill two dozen innocent people since April.One of the first to be killed was a 65-year-old woman named Rukmani.She and four family members were driving to a temple in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in May. A mob on this road mistook them for \u201cchild lifters\u201d and assaulted them.\u00a0We went to the village where Rukmani was attacked to see how WhatsApp and local authorities have struggled to contain the false messages, which have circulated throughout India for months.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has a quarter billion users in India alone. Some of the false messages on the app describe gangs of kidnappers on the prowl. Others include videos showing people driving up and snatching children.This clip went viral. It was produced as part of a public service announcement in Pakistan, but it was edited to look like a real kidnapping. The authorities don\u2019t know who altered the video.False information has flooded social media in recent years, inciting violence from Brazil to Sri Lanka. The messages in India have preyed on a universal fear: harm coming to a child. And the millions of poorly educated Indians coming online for the first time mean many are quick to believe what is on their phones.Venkatesan, Rukmani\u2019s brother-in-law, was in the car with her and was injured during the beating. He described the attack to us.\u00a0As they got close to the temple, the family stopped to ask for directions. A grandmother nearby grew suspicious and called her son, who raised the alarm.\u00a0The family became nervous and decided to turn back. By the time they got to the next village, a crowd was waiting for them.\u00a0They were stripped naked and beaten with iron rods, wooden sticks, bare hands and feet. Videos of the attack were circulated widely online.\u00a0When it was over, Rukmani was limp and lifeless. The others were left for dead. Their red sedan was crushed, and their belongings were stolen.\u00a0The region\u2019s top government official said the police had gone around for weeks before the attack warning people not to believe the false kidnapping rumors. But they were no match for WhatsApp. \u201cWe could not compete,\u201d he said.WhatsApp\u2019s design makes it easy to spread false information. Many messages are shared in groups, and when they are forwarded, there is no indication of their origin. The kidnap warnings have often appeared to come from friends and family.WhatsApp said it was horrified by the killings.\u00a0Last week, it began labeling all forwarded messages. It also took out newspaper ads to educate people about misinformation and pledged to work more closely with police and independent fact-checkers.Authorities across India have tried curbing the attacks. Besides warning people of the false rumors, they have arrested some who spread them. In a few places, they briefly shut down the internet. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court urged the government to use \u201can iron hand\u201d against mob violence.The police have arrested 46 people for the attack on Rukmani and her family and are pursuing 74 more.\u00a0Venkatesan, 52, who had lived in Rukmani\u2019s house since he was 15, still doesn\u2019t understand why they were assaulted. \u201cThey just wanted to kill us,\u201d he said.Gajendran, Rukmani\u2019s son-in-law, was gravely injured in the attack. He was in a coma for weeks and remains in the hospital.\u00a0The most recent mob attack was on Friday. A software engineer was killed and three companions were injured after giving chocolates to children outside a school.Vindu Goel is a technology correspondent in Mumbai.

{"Headline": "11 and Married: Malaysia Spars Over an Age-Old Practice", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUA MUSANG, Malaysia \u2014 Norazila and Ayu were best friends and they shared everything that girls do: sleepovers, selfies, musings about cute boys.But their friendship, which had blossomed in their placid hamlet in northern Malaysia, was destroyed late last month when Norazila, 14, discovered that Ayu, 11, had secretly become her father\u2019s third wife.\u201cMy best friend is my stepmother now,\u201d said Norazila, whose family name is Che Abdul Karim, as she scrolled through her Facebook page filled with posts of the girls posing with adolescent pouts and fingers forming peace signs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dAyu\u2019s marriage to Che Abdul Karim Che Abdul Hamid, a 41-year-old rubber trader with a prominent role at his mosque and a fleet of fancy cars, has reignited debate in Malaysia about the persistence of conservative Islamic traditions in this modern, multiethnic democracy.\u201cThis is a practice from many centuries ago and at this stage in Malaysia\u2019s growth and development, child marriage is not acceptable,\u201d said Charles Santiago, a lawmaker with the governing coalition.But ever since outrage over Ayu\u2019s case erupted on social media in Malaysia \u2014 after Mr. Che Abdul Karim\u2019s second wife posted pictures on Facebook of the marriage ceremony with a sarcastic \u201chappy wedding\u201d message to him \u2014 critics say the new government, under the guise of religious freedom, has done too little to protect minors.Malaysia\u2019s deputy prime minister, who also serves as minister of women, family and community development, called the marriage an \u201calleged incident.\u201d The minister, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, said last week: \u201cIt would be unjust to lynch someone on social media because of how we feel about the issue.\u201dMs. Wan Azizah, who has previously expressed opposition to child marriage, declined to discuss Ayu\u2019s case because it involved continuing investigations by several government agencies, including for the crime of sexual grooming.Last year, Malaysia criminalized sexual grooming, in which an adult creates an emotional bond with a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation.\u201cThe girl is a victim, no doubt about it,\u201d said Latheefa Koya, a prominent human rights lawyer. \u201cWhy are we dillydallying in protecting a child? The lack of serious urgency about this case is disturbing,\u201d she added.\u201cAs a Muslim, I am offended by the idea that we should not protect a child because of an assumption that this has something to do with Islam,\u201d Ms. Latheefa said.Ayu was taken to a hospital for a virginity test this month, but later the same day was reunited with her husband and has been with him often since, family members said.\u201cI love her,\u201d Mr. Che Abdul Karim said by phone, stressing he would not \u201ctouch\u201d his new wife until she was 16 years old.For her part, Ayu said in a text message that she loved her husband, who has six children with his two other wives. She used a heart emoticon to describe him.Constitutionally, Malaysia\u2019s legal system is bifurcated. Non-Muslim Malaysians, mostly from the nation\u2019s ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities, are bound by civil law. Under the law, unless special consent is given by a high-ranking state minister, Malaysia\u2019s non-Muslims cannot get married until they are 18.The country\u2019s ethnic Malay Muslim majority, however, must hew to Islamic law. A Shariah court must grant permission for minors below the age of 16 to marry. If a Muslim receives approval from Shariah authorities, there is no minimum age for marriage.\u201cIn Islamic procedure, as long as a bride agrees, her parents agree and the girl has had her menstrual period, then a marriage is O.K.,\u201d said Sayed Noordin, the imam at the Kuala Betis mosque that Mr. Che Abdul Karim attends.\u201cChe Karim is a good Muslim,\u201d Mr. Sayed added. \u201cHe always comes for prayer, and he is a responsible man.\u201dBut Mr. Che Abdul Karim did get in minor trouble for not following all the requirements for a child marriage. The Shariah Court in Kelantan this month fined him $450 for the infraction of marrying Ayu in neighboring Thailand without the court\u2019s prior permission.But an effort to outlaw underage unions for all Malaysians amid the toughening of child sex crime legislation failed in Parliament. Arguing against the ban, Shabudin Yahaya, a legislator from what was then the governing party, said that a girl as young as 9 could be ready for marriage if she had gone through puberty.\u201cTheir body is already akin to them being 18 years old,\u201d Mr. Shabudin, a former Shariah court judge, said in a parliamentary session. \u201cSo physically and spiritually, it is not a barrier for the girl to marry.\u201dMany child marriages in Malaysia are informal pairings that are not legally recognized by any court. But couples who do try to register their marriages find little resistance. A study by the Malaysia office of Unicef found that of 2,143 child marriage applications made to Shariah courts in seven Malaysian states from 2012 to 2016, 10 were refused.In some instances, girls have ended up married to men charged with raping them. In 2015, a man from the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak was charged with the statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl. But the case was dropped after he married her with permission from a Shariah court. Marital rape is not a crime in Malaysia.Sometimes, Shariah courts accept underage unions to legitimize out-of-wedlock pregnancies, the Unicef report said. Other child marriages are driven by the poverty of the bride\u2019s family.In the case of Ayu, which is a shortened version of her full name to protect her identity, the income discrepancy was clear. Ayu is a Thai citizen whose father moved the family over the border to Gua Musang in Kelantan State to work as a rubber tapper. She grew up in a shabby, stilted wooden house with no running water.Mr. Che Abdul Karim, by contrast, lives in a modern villa, his prized Mazda RX-8 parked in front. His first wife, Nuraini Che Nawi, runs a restaurant and grocery next door.One of her employees was Ayu\u2019s mother, Aminah Hitam. Because Ayu did not go to school, she often accompanied her mother to work.Kelantan is one of Malaysia\u2019s poorest and most conservative states. An Islamic political party has governed the state for decades, urging Muslim women to wear head scarves in public and ordering Arabic to be displayed on signs.Mohamad Amar Nik Abdullah, Kelantan\u2019s deputy chief minister and vice president of the Malaysian Islamic Party, stressed that child marriage was legal in Islam and said the country had more pressing social issues to address.He said the existence of homosexuals and single parents in Malaysia \u201cshould be a concern for our government and society.\u201dLiberal Malays have questioned whether child marriage is truly an Islamic tradition or simply an outdated cultural practice. They have challenged the notion that the Prophet Muhammad married one of his wives when she was 6, saying that she was, in fact, much older.\u201cWe cannot use a historical error about the Prophet Muhammad to condone child marriage,\u201d said Ms. Latheefa, the human rights lawyer. \u201cThat\u2019s sickening.\u201dMuslim-majority countries like Morocco and Egypt have outlawed child marriage, although underage unions remain common there.This month, Malaysia\u2019s Islamic affairs minister, Mujahid Yusof Rawa, said that his ministry had begun efforts to prohibit child marriage for Muslims, even as he cautioned that putting such a ban into effect would take time.Meanwhile, Mr. Che Abdul Karim\u2019s first two wives have banded together.\u201cWe have said to him, it is us or that girl,\u201d said Siti Noor Azila, Mr. Che Abdul Karim\u2019s second wife. \u201cWe said, you choose. You cannot have all three of us.\u201dMalaysia follows general Islamic custom by allowing Muslim men up to four wives.Ms. Siti Noor said her husband never gave her enough money to care for their four children, including one with spina bifida. She works as a baker to pay her bills.\u201cHe is so stingy with us, but he has enough money to get married to Ayu and take her on holiday,\u201d Ms. Siti Noor said, referring to a trip to a hill retreat that Mr. Che Abdul Karim posted about on social media. Ayu, she said, was the only one of the wives allowed to ride in their husband\u2019s Mazda sports car.As Ms. Siti Noor spoke, two toddlers screamed for space in her lap. She looked exhausted.\u201cTheir father never takes care of them,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even like children.\u201dMs. Siti Noor corrected herself. \u201cExcept one,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Ayu.\u201dSharon Tan contributed reporting from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Climate Change Has Altered the Way Cristal Champagne Is Made", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWith a visionary in charge, Louis Roederer has walked the line between a big Champagne house and a grower-producer.How would the world change for Champagne? And what should Roederer do to adapt to those changes?Mr. L\u00e9caillon was hardly an obvious candidate to take on this study. Just 30 years old at the time, he had joined Roederer in 1989 with degrees in agronomy and oenology. He had seen wine operations in other parts of the world, working on Roederer projects in California and Tasmania.But he had been marked as a future chef de cave, or head of the winemaking team, and had worked closely with Jean-Claude Rouzaud, then the head of Roederer, whose family has owned the house since Louis Roederer gave it his name in 1833.Mr. L\u00e9caillon produced a forecast that anticipated the wide-ranging effects of global warming. It asserted that it was imperative for Roederer to emphasize the sense of place in the wines, while carving out clearer identities for each cuv\u00e9e.As it turned out, he was remarkably prescient, not only about the increased importance of climate change but also about how a big Champagne house would need to adapt to the changes about to sweep over the region.Today, Louis Roederer is arguably the greatest large-scale producer in Champagne. Each of its wines \u2014 from the nonvintage Brut Premier to the prestigious Cristal \u2014 is at the top of its form, and each is among the best wines of its kind in Champagne. While some big houses have certainly been coasting for a long time, or have taken a cautious approach, Roederer is not among them. Led by Mr. L\u00e9caillon, Roederer is a progressive leader in Champagne, as if it had seen the future and positioned itself perfectly.Champagne has come a long way since the mid-1990s, when the big houses unquestionably ruled. Many consumers think about it completely differently now, as a wine rather than as festive bubbles divorced from vines and earth.Back then, the focus of Champagne was the cellar. Few people talked about the vineyards, and almost nobody in the region wanted to speak about terroir. The big houses preferred it that way.The shoddy viticulture and the rampant mediocrity of mass-market Champagnes could be ignored by talking up the skill of the master blender, who could mix a little of this and a little of that to create a house style that was repeated year after year, regardless of vintage conditions or vineyards.Tuxedos and evening gowns were the images of Champagne, not the dirt-encrusted boots of the vigneron.Terroir and farming are of prime concern to Mr. L\u00e9caillon, who took over as chef de cave in 1999 on the condition that he be put in charge of the vineyards as well. Responding to global warming and increasing the sense of place in the wines required some radical changes.He wanted the vines to have a much deeper root system that plunged into the bedrock of chalky limestone and clay; he believed that would help to protect against heat and drought while better expressing the character of the vineyard. To accomplish this, he eliminated the use of herbicides and fertilizers, developed techniques for training the roots downward and began trials for both organic and biodynamic viticulture.\u201cAfter four or five years we were 100 percent able to identify the wines from biodynamic soils,\u201d he said. \u201cMore intensity, more clarity of fruit, a velvety texture and a link between fruit and acidity.\u201cIt\u2019s a very intelligent way of farming,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand Steiner at all, but I see the results.\u201dNonetheless, he says that some years his team preferred the wines farmed organically. He said organic farming produced fleshier wines, while biodynamics gave \u201cmore pixels.\u201d\u201cI would say biodynamic is more suited to warmer years, and organic to cooler years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need both because you never know.\u201d \u201cA perfect world is an idea of the 1970s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist, and it\u2019s super boring. When you see no disease, you don\u2019t know your enemy, and you don\u2019t learn.\u201d What he seeks instead, he said, is \u201cperfect imperfection.\u201dEven the details of producing compost for the Roederer vineyards fascinate him, and he will launch into a disquisition on the differences between horse and cow manure. (Horse manure ferments at a higher temperature.) \u201cComposting is an art, not a standard recipe,\u201d he said.The myriad holdings, in different soils and climates, act for him, he said, as \u201ca kind of a super think tank for the future of viticulture.\u201d\u201cWe know how to make great sparkling wine in California,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not afraid of climate change.\u201dIt all would not be worth much, of course, if the quality of the wines did not bear out his efforts. But they do.The nonvintage Brut Premier, which accounts for about 70 percent of the production, is among the best of its kind, a wine both of freshness and depth. It\u2019s the least expensive of the Roederer lineup, at $30 to $50 a bottle. The vintage Champagne is a step up in precision and complexity, made from a blend dominated by pinot noir. The 2008, $75 to $80, is full, deep, fresh and harmonious, with undertones of red fruit, while the 2010 Blanc de Blancs \u2014 $80 to $100, made entirely from chardonnay grown in the village of Avize \u2014 is creamy and saline, with a lovely, lip-smacking liveliness. \u201cIt\u2019s not single vineyard, but single village, and always the same four parcels,\u201d Mr. L\u00e9caillon said. Most telling are the top-of-the-line Champagnes, the Cristal and Cristal Ros\u00e9, which \u2014 although dismissed by some wine lovers as status symbols \u2014 are simply brilliant. The \u201908 Cristal, $250 to $300, is salty, chalky, softly textured and fresh, with flavors that seem to flow endlessly in the mouth. The rare and expensive \u201908 Cristal Ros\u00e9, $550 (sigh), is among the greatest ros\u00e9 Champagnes, pure and saline with profound finesse. For Mr. L\u00e9caillon, the \u201908 Cristal is a platonic ideal. \u201cThis the exact vision of Cristal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would not have been able to make this wine without the \u201996 experience.\u201d The 1996 vintage in Champagne should have been a dream vintage, a classic, but many producers \u2014 Roederer among them \u2014 made wines that were not as good as they could have been. It was this experience, Mr. L\u00e9caillon said, that prompted the 30-year study and the subsequent evolution.As for that study, Mr. L\u00e9caillon says, it has never stopped, but rolls over each year as Roederer continues to look into the distance. The next chapter, he said, will most likely focus on reviewing everything done in the cellar.\u201cHaving done the work we have done, which is kind of disruptive,\u201d he said, \u201cthe whole Roederer team is now empowered in the idea of experimenting, trialing and questioning all the time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Georgia Leaders Condemn Jason Spencer, Lawmaker Who Used Slurs on Sacha Baron Cohen Show", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJason Spencer, a Republican state representative in Georgia, found himself on the wrong end of a Sacha Baron Cohen prank that aired Sunday night on Showtime. It was the second episode of \u201cWho Is America?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen\u2019s latest foray into duping unsuspecting participants into saying embarrassing things.But Mr. Spencer\u2019s segment was one of the most humiliating yet to air on the show.Mr. Cohen was playing a character named Erran Morad, an Israeli antiterrorism expert who, in the first episode, fooled several current and former lawmakers and gun-rights advocates into expressing support for arming young children. In Sunday night\u2019s episode, the Morad character persuaded Mr. Spencer to take part in what he believed was antiterrorism training.For Mr. Spencer, it went downhill from there. In a series of wince-inducing scenes, Mr. Cohen got him to yell a racial epithet and drop his pants on camera by telling him that those tactics would scare terrorists away.At the end of the episode, Mr. Spencer used another slur in referring to people from the Middle East. By Monday morning, he came under intense criticism from leading Republicans in Georgia. He issued an apology but rejected calls for his resignation.Mr. Spencer isn\u2019t quite as prominent as the other lawmakers that Mr. Cohen has fooled, including Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, and Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. But you might have heard his name before.He had a reputation of being combative and a knack for attracting negative attention, which may have been what brought him to the attention of Mr. Cohen.The legislation passed unanimously in the House, but in the Senate, the language was whittled down and the legislative session ended without the bill passing.In a statement last week, Mr. Spencer said that he had received death threats after proposing the bill that would have banned facial coverings, and that Mr. Cohen had \u201ctook advantage of my fears that I would be attacked by someone inspired by the vile rhetoric used against me.\u201dHe called the stunt \u201cdeceptive and fraudulent behavior\u201d and \u201cexactly why President Donald Trump was elected.\u201d Mr. Spencer also threatened legal action.On Monday, the speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives demanded Mr. Spencer\u2019s resignation for behavior he called \u201creprehensible.\u201d\u201cRepresentative Spencer has disgraced himself and should resign immediately,\u201d the speaker, David Ralston, said in a statement. \u201cGeorgia is better than this.\u201dGov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, said Monday that \u201cthe actions and language used by Jason Spencer are appalling and offensive.\u201d The governor, in his post on Twitter, added, \u201cThere is no excuse for this type of behavior, ever, and I am saddened and disgusted by it.\u201dThe chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, DuBose Porter, said that Mr. Spencer \u201chas put a blemish on our state that even Ajax cannot remove.\u201d And the campaign of Brian Kemp, a Republican candidate for governor who had drawn Mr. Spencer\u2019s support, said it had erased the lawmaker\u2019s name from its roster of endorsements.\u201cRep. Spencer\u2019s words and behavior are hurtful, insensitive and completely unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Kemp said in a statement.In a series of text messages to The Washington Post on Monday, Mr. Spencer reiterated that he had taken part in the segment because he had received threats, which had \u201cescalated to the point that my wife received threatening phone calls.\u201dHe added that he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in participating but that \u201cMy fears were so heightened at that time, I was not thinking clearly nor could I appreciate what I was agreeing to when I participated in his \u2018class.\u2019\u201dMr. Spencer continued: \u201cI apologize to my family, friends, and the people of my district for this ridiculously ugly episode.\u201d But he said that he would serve out the final five months of his term.Showtime declined to comment on Mr. Spencer\u2019s statement.Alan Blinder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Sniff and a Signal, These Dogs Hunt Down Threats to Bees ", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Maryland, a state employee is training dogs to inspect hives for harmful bacteria \u2014 a crucial job as honeybees are sent around the country to pollinate crops.JARRETTSVILLE, Md. \u2014 Cybil Preston stretched her bare hands into a noisy beehive and pulled out a frame of honeycomb, its waxy cells filled with nectar, its surface alive with bees.\u201cThis girl right here was just born,\u201d she said, pointing out a bee with a silvery thorax. \u201cSee how her hair is still matted down like a teddy bear?\u201dHoneybees are a vital, invisible work force in the food industry, pollinating about a third of the nation\u2019s crops, and Ms. Preston leads a team that tracks their well-being. She pays close attention to Maryland\u2019s commercial colonies, which beekeepers lease out to work blooms across the country \u2014 almonds in California, blueberries in Maine and New Jersey, citrus in Florida.Unlike human inspectors, dogs don\u2019t need the hives opened up to check them for foulbrood. They can trot by, sniffing at the comb, and tell if the bacteria have killed off any larvae. Four people working full time cover less than half of what her dog can, Ms. Preston said.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have dogs, these bees just wouldn\u2019t be able to move,\u201d she said.\u201cYou want Foulbrood Bunny?\u201d she asked, throwing the fuzzy gray toy across the field. Tukka caught the toy in a frenzy, salivating at the smell of it, chewing it with delirious pleasure. \u201cThis is what I want to see,\u201d Ms. Preston said.Soon, she will move on to putting foulbrood inside a small rubber toy and throwing it farther, or in an unexpected direction, to see if Tukka can sniff it out. Then she will hide the scent in the training installation she built exactly for this purpose \u2014 tubes mounted close together at various heights on an industrial plastic pallet.If the exercises are successful, Tukka will learn to find even small traces of the scent, and communicate that to Ms. Preston by pointing with his nose, then sitting down.She trained Mack the same way, bonding with the dog through games and repetition, building up his confidence and trust, all the while teaching him the basics of his important new job. That training took nine months.\u201cI had to learn to trust him,\u201d Ms. Preston said.Mack was a year and a half old when she found him living in a garage. Ms. Preston adopted him on the spot and took him to Mark Flynn, the K-9 unit commander at the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, to get his opinion. Mr. Flynn trains dogs to associate scents with play. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for those dogs that\u2019ll jump into water to get the ball, the ones completely obsessed with their toys,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when a dog is searching, he believes in his heart he\u2019s trying to find his toy.\u201d This applies whether the dog is looking for contraband cellphones and drugs in prison cells, or foulbrood in beehives.Many of the dogs Mr. Flynn trains are adopted through rescue organizations, exhibiting the kind of high-energy behavior and hunting instincts that make them unlikely to be adopted as family pets, but ideal for scent work.Mack\u2019s drive was low. \u201cBut there is this phenomenon where you can actually build up drive in a dog,\u201d Mr. Flynn said. And through play, reward and repetition, that\u2019s just what Ms. Preston did.She goes home in the middle of her busy workdays to train Tukka, a rescue dog she adopted through Mr. Flynn, because Tukka requires sessions at least four times a day. It\u2019s a lot of time, but Ms. Preston reminds herself that once Tukka is up to speed, he will help her team cover more ground, work faster and more meticulously, and protect more honeybees.The hive of a single healthy colony may hold around 30,000 bees in the late fall, and closer to 20,000 by the end of the winter. This time of year, as the bees gear back up and forage, each hive could be buzzing with up to 60,000 bees. The tractor-trailers that carry hives across the country to pollinate crops are typically moving about seven million bees at a time. They are all vulnerable.If someone with even a single hive loses the colony to foulbrood and lets the empty hive sit around, other bees in the area will quickly move in, loot its resources and inadvertently carry the dangerous, spore-laden honey back to feed their larvae. As Ms. Preston put it, \u201cIt\u2019s in every bee\u2019s nature to rob.\u201dThis makes even one hive a risk. \u201cIf there are foulbrood spores in the comb, they stay in the comb for probably a hundred years,\u201d Dr. Spivak said. \u201cThe only solution is to burn the comb and equipment, and that\u2019s harsh.\u201dOutbreaks are preventable, but beekeepers have to know what they\u2019re looking for.Maryland has run a canine detection program since the 1980s. But when Ms. Preston took over the department, both the dog handler and his dog retired at the same time. It took almost a year, but she built the program back up from scratch.\u201cAll beekeepers are having trouble keeping their bees alive,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re putting the effort in, I want to put the effort in.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a couch potato,\u201d Ms. Preston said.Just as she was throwing the scent-soaked toy for Tukka, Mack leapt up from his sunny spot in the grass and charged at the other dog full-speed, only to delicately lick the Department of Agriculture\u2019s newest employee right on his snout.An earlier version of this article misstated the breed of Cybil Preston's dog Mack. He is a Labrador retriever, not a golden Labrador.Advertisement"}

After the trip, we all promised to keep in touch. Buoyed by the experience, I returned home with a renewed commitment not only to exercise and healthful living, but to simply step up my social life and spend more time hanging out with happy people.\u201cFriends can exert a measurable and ongoing influence on your health behaviors in a way that a diet never can,\u201d Mr. Buettner said.In Okinawa, Japan, a place where the average life expectancy for women is around 90, the oldest in the world, people form a kind of social network called a moai \u2014 a group of five friends who offer social, logistic, emotional and even financial support for a lifetime. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful idea,\u201d Mr. Buettner said. \u201cTraditionally, their parents put them into moais when they are born, and they take a lifelong journey together.\u201dIn a moai, the group benefits when things go well, such as by sharing a bountiful crop, and the group\u2019s families support one another when a child gets sick or someone dies. They also appear to influence one another\u2019s lifelong health behaviors.Mr. Buettner is working with federal and state health officials, including the former United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, to create moais in two dozen cities around the country. He recently spent time in Fort Worth, Tex., where several residents have formed walking moais \u2014 groups of people who meet regularly to walk and socialize.\u201cWe\u2019re finding that in some of these cities, you can just put people together who want to change health behaviors and organize them around walking or a plant-based potluck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe nudge them into hanging out together for 10 weeks. We have created moais that are now several years old, and they are still exerting a healthy influence on members\u2019 lives.\u201dThe key to building a successful moai is to start with people who have similar interests, passions and values. The Blue Zone team tries to group people based on geography and work and family schedules to start. Then they ask them a series of questions to find common interests. Is your perfect vacation a cruise or a backpacking trip? Do you like rock \u2019n\u2019 roll or classical music? Do you subscribe to The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal?\u201cYou stack the deck in favor of a long-term relationship,\u201d said Mr. Buettner. One of my fellow travelers, Carol Auerbach of New York City, noted that surrounding herself with positive people has helped her cope with the loss of two husbands over the years. Ms. Auerbach was widowed at 30, when her children were just 2 and 5. With the support of her family and friends, and her own tenacity, she was able to support her family, and she eventually remarried. And then in 1992, her second husband died unexpectedly. To cope the second time, she focused on volunteer work and contributing to her community.Ms. Auerbach said she believes that she learned to have a positive outlook from her mother, a Holocaust survivor who left Germany at the age of 19 and never saw her parents again. \u201cWhen I was growing up we were not affluent, and the four of us lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and my parents slept on a pullout sofa,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother never complained. I think she quietly knew that difficult things happen, but you feel very appreciative of the life you do have, and you feel a responsibility to make the most of it.\u201dMs. Auerbach eventually found love again and has been married to her third husband for 15 years. \u201cLife is too short to be around negative people,\u201d she said. \u201cI need people around me who care about me and are appreciative, and see the world as a glass half full, not half empty.\u201d\u201cI argue that the most powerful thing you can do to add healthy years is to curate your immediate social network,\u201d said Mr. Buettner, who advises people to focus on three to five real-world friends rather than distant Facebook friends. \u201cIn general you want friends with whom you can have a meaningful conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can call them on a bad day and they will care.

{"Headline": "In Cambodia, Dissenting Voters Find Ways to Say \u2018None of the Above\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 One Cambodian voter defaced his or her ballot with a lively reference to a dog\u2019s anatomy. Others ticked every single box, or crossed out the entire ballot. Still others drew pictures of the sun, the symbol of the outlawed main opposition party.But the second-largest number of votes went to a surprising beneficiary: no one. Around 600,000 Cambodian voters, or 8.6 percent of the electorate, cast inadmissible ballots, according to the National Election Committee.During the last general election in 2013, which the opposition nearly won, only 108,085 invalid ballots were recorded.The surprisingly high number of invalid ballots hinted at quiet defiance from an electorate cowed into voting, but distressed by the kneecapping of democracy in Cambodia.Exiled leaders of the opposition had called for a boycott of the poll. But the authorities spread the word, in villages and urban areas alike, that the state would be watching to see whether voters had fulfilled their duty. On the eve of the election, Mr. Hun Sen warned that those who dared to skip the voting were \u201ctraitors.\u201dAt some garment factories in Phnom Penh, the capital, workers \u2014 who had flocked to the opposition in 2013 \u2014 were warned not to return to the factory line unless their fingers were inked to prove they had voted. The National Election Committee, which is not an independent entity, reported that 82.89 percent of registered voters had shown up at polling stations, a higher turnout than in 2013.A 40-year-old grocer named Pheap, from Sarikakeo commune in Kandal Province, said he had spoiled his ballot by blacking out the name of the governing party. He said the election was not fair because of the absence of the main opposition party. Like other voters interviewed, he gave only his first name because he was worried about the consequences of his dissent.On Tuesday morning, Mr. Hun Sen \u2014 who has maintained his grip on power for 33 years with a potent mix of military power, political guile and old-school thuggery \u2014 took to Facebook to deem the polls free and fair. The prime minister said there had been no pressure on voters to choose the Cambodian People\u2019s Party.\u201cThe absolute majority of people support democratic, liberal and multiparty elections, which is the biggest wish of the Cambodian people,\u201d Mr. Hun Sen wrote on his Facebook page.But Sunday\u2019s electoral exercise can hardly be described as a display of multiparty democracy.Rights groups, the United Nations and Western governments said the election had been compromised before a single ballot was cast. In November, the main opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was ordered dissolved by the nation\u2019s highest court. Its leader, Kem Sokha, is in jail, accused of plotting to overthrow the government with American support.Meanwhile, China, itself a flourishing one-party state, has stepped in with aid and investment to replace funds withheld by Western governments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, which sent observers to Cambodia even as Western monitors stayed away for fear of legitimizing the polls, deemed the elections a success.As Mr. Hun Sen and his government have unleashed a crackdown on dissent over the past year, Western governments have begun imposing economic sanctions on those they consider responsible for the dismantling of democracy. The United States is expected to ramp up efforts to tighten visa restrictions on antidemocratic forces in Cambodia, including on members of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s family.\u201cThe flawed elections, which excluded the country\u2019s principal opposition party, represent the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia\u2019s constitution,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Official election results are not expected for days.In Phnom Penh, where the Cambodia National Rescue Party did well in last year\u2019s commune-level elections, 11.6 percent of the ballots cast on Sunday were declared invalid.Holding up his inked finger, a restaurant worker named Chheang said he had scrawled a big X over his ballot. The party he wanted to vote for, he said, was not on it.Sok Eysan, the spokesman for Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Cambodian People\u2019s Party, said on Tuesday that the governing party\u2019s domination of the elections could be credited to its success in shepherding the country out of its genocidal, war-torn past.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have good policies, we wouldn\u2019t have gotten a landslide victory,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns about the high number of spoiled votes and the absence of the main opposition party.\u201cWe didn\u2019t grab votes from others,\u201d Mr. Sok Eysan added. \u201cPeople gave them to us.\u201dJulia Wallace contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Watching it \u2014 agog that it ever got made in the first place \u2014 felt like getting a little glimpse into the future, and not just because its dystopian satire is half a step away from our reality.The film is impossible to really summarize, and I don\u2019t want to give away its gobsmacking twists. It\u2019s about an African-American man named Cassius Green \u2014 he goes by Cash \u2014 living with his girlfriend, an avant-garde artist, in the garage of his uncle\u2019s house, which is facing foreclosure. Desperate for work, he becomes a telemarketer, where his uncanny ability to feign the voice of a confident white man makes him a star, lofting him into a rarefied realm of high-paid, grotesquely immoral salesmanship. The movie includes subplots about unionization, (literal) debt slavery, viral videos, brutal reality television and the cultural worship of sociopathic entrepreneurs. (As well as weird disturbing stuff I don\u2019t want to give away.) I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Even if it weren\u2019t that good, the mere existence of the movie would be an astonishment. That\u2019s also how I feel about \u201cDietland,\u201d an uneven drama on AMC about an overweight ghostwriter for a fashion-magazine editor who gets involved with feminist terrorist revolutionaries. (It\u2019s wild to see corporate advertising on a show in which the anarchist idea of the \u201cpropaganda of the deed\u201d is invoked more or less sympathetically to justify murdering misogynists.) Dietland is another early sign that the atmosphere of ambient rage we\u2019re all living in is making its way into pop culture. In another time, the fantasies of violent leftist resistance in \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d and \u201cDietland\u201d might have caused more of a backlash. But the scary obliteration of limits on the right has also opened up new imaginative space on the left. Donald Trump is trying to destroy liberal democracy, a system that seemed inviolable, before our eyes. Watching it happen, it\u2019s hard not to wonder: what other systems might be more fragile than they seem?At least for the duration of \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d capitalism feels evil but also tawdry and preposterous, and labor solidarity seems sexy and exuberant. Sitting in the theater, I felt like I had a new apprehension of what it might be like to be young, idealistic, and at the mercy of nearly totalitarian economic forces.Advertisement"}

There was to be much fun, many pleasures, many stabs of Joy; but no more of the old security. It was sea and islands now; the great continent had sunk like Atlantis.\u201dIt may seem melodramatic, but that passage comes to mind when I think of the death of America\u2019s relationship with Europe, and Donald Trump\u2019s betrayal Monday of the democratic values that were the basis for that relationship.Europe is America\u2019s mother continent. Our foundational institutions were inherited from Europe. Our democracy is Greek and British. Our universities are German. The etiquette book George Washington read to improve himself was translated from French, and so were Thomas Jefferson\u2019s ideals. As a young adult nation, we took what Europe had and started democratizing it for our own purposes. The luxury hotel is a European palace turned into a commercial enterprise. Frederick Law Olmsted visited England in 1850, marveled at the gardens of the aristocracy, came back to America and turned what he saw into great public parks \u2014 Central Park, the U.S. Capitol grounds and many more. Then as a mature nation, we became our parent\u2019s partner. After World War II, a reforged, American-led West stabilized itself. There were fights and rivalries, but underneath, there was an unspoken awareness \u2014 these are our kin. This trans-Atlantic partnership was a vast historical accomplishment, a stumbling and imperfect effort to extend democracy, extend rights, extend freedom and build a world ordered by justice and not force. Since 1945 it is the thing we have all taken for granted.Over the weekend, Trump ripped the partnership to threads. He said the European Union is our \u201cfoe.\u201d On Monday, Trump essentially sided with Vladimir Putin, who has become the biggest moral and political enemy of the Euro-American relationship. Trump essentially dropped a project that has oriented American culture and policy for centuries. He pointed us to a world in which the central ethos is that might makes right. But remember, Donald Trump exists only to put a capstone on every poisonous trend that preceded him. It took many hands to kill the Euro-American bond.Progressives fell into the poisonous trap of racialism. They looked at the glories of Aristotle, Shakespeare and Mozart, and the most interesting thing they had to say about them was that they were dead white males. Future historians will marvel at how sophisticated people willfully made themselves so simple-minded. Eurocentrism became a code word for colonialism, oppression and privilege, taking a piece of European history for the whole of it. Europeans didn\u2019t help. In the wake of the Cold War, they have dedicated themselves to a post-nationalist project that is too top-down and technocratic and is now crumbling. Trump could have gone to last week\u2019s NATO summit and taken credit only for increased European military spending. Instead, he moved the goal posts, humiliated the Europeans, reasserted his trade war talk and made it impossible for European leaders to do anything that might seem to support him. These are the actions of a man who wants the alliance to fail.His embrace of Putin Monday was a victory dance on the Euro-American tomb.\u201cThis is not just another family quarrel,\u201d Kagan writes. \u201cThe democratic alliance that has been the bedrock of the American-led liberal world order is unraveling. At some point, and probably sooner than we expect, the global peace that that alliance and that order undergirded will unravel, too. Despite our human desire to hope for the best, things will not be okay.\u201dKagan was writing before Monday\u2019s press conference, and now his core point is doubly true. If you thought we could ride the Trump storm and then return to normal, you can surely see now this view is mistaken. The fundamental arrangements of our world are being remade.Today, Europe and America face common perils and common problems \u2014 including the rise of ravenous strongmen who want to remake the world order. We\u2019ve lost the bonds that might enable us to fight them together. Worse, the wolves are not only in the henhouse; they are in the Executive Mansion.Beware what happens when you walk away from your lineage.Advertisement"}

To make the novel work she\u2019s had to include a chapter near the end that\u2019s essentially a monologue from Zoe, conveniently mulling over everything she knows about the bank\u2019s illegal activities. It\u2019s a particularly inelegant information dump, something a more seasoned writer would never have done. But readers may be able to look past it in light of \u201cThe Banker\u2019s Wife\u2019s\u201d otherwise slick, heart-hammering entertainment.Sarah Carpenter\u2019s drafty farmhouse, perched on a gusty North Yorkshire moor that\u2019s all \u201ctussocky windblown grass, clouds racing overhead, drops of icy rain when you\u2019re not expecting them,\u201d is the very definition of desolate. The solitude didn\u2019t bother Sarah when her husband was alive, but now the creaky floorboards and banging doors set her nerves a-jangle. So when Aiden, an old flame, appears out of nowhere and asks if he can rent her guesthouse, she jumps at the chance, and when Will, a friend of her son\u2019s, shows up needing a place to stay for the night, she\u2019s quick to say yes to that, too. The stage is set.At first, the various subplots move a bit slowly, but Haynes soon finds her rhythm and the pages begin to fly. First it becomes clear that Aiden is hiding secrets about the way he earns a living, and then Will begins to act erratically, showing up at odd times and even popping silently into the house without knocking. Haynes is an expert at ratcheting up tension, so when someone poisons one of Sarah\u2019s dogs, you know something bad is about to happen to Sarah herself. Until the very end, though, you aren\u2019t sure who exactly it is that wishes her ill.\u201cI wondered how it was that you could spend weeks, months \u2014 years, even \u2014 just chugging on, nothing really changing, and then, in the space of a few hours, the script of your life could be completely rewritten,\u201d Sarah muses, looking back at the moment she met her soul mate, Eddie. The couple spent an inseparable week together before Eddie left for a planned vacation, promising to call, Skype and FaceTime while they\u2019re apart.Now, if you think as I do that perhaps Eddie has an extremely good reason for never contacting the stalkerish Sarah again, then you do not want to pick up \u201cGhosted.\u201d But if you\u2019re a nicer, more romantic soul, you might enjoy this book. Walsh has a good ear for dialogue, and the mystery behind Eddie\u2019s disappearance is a particularly satisfying one.Tina Jordan is an editor at the Book Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parents Behaving Badly: A Youth Sports Crisis Caught on Video", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 In one video, a fan at a youth soccer game bellows profanities and violently kicks a ball that slams into a teenage referee standing nearby. She disagreed with a penalty called.Another captures parents at a youth basketball game charging the court to hurl punches at the referee. And yet another shows parents berating game officials as they walk to their cars after a soccer game. The players were 8-year-olds.\u201cI do it to hold people accountable \u2014 to identify and call out the small percentage of parents who nonetheless create a toxic environment at youth sports,\u201d Barlow, 44, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very visual deterrent, and not just to the person caught on video but to others who ask themselves: Do I look like that jerk?\u201dIn fact, many do.A torrent of verbal, and occasionally physical, abuse toward referees nationwide has disrupted the sidelines of youth sports.The harassment has grown so rampant that more than 70 percent of new referees in all sports quit the job within three years, according to the National Association of Sports Officials. The chief cause for the attrition, based on a survey conducted by the association, was pervasive abuse from parents and coaches.The result has been drastic referee shortages across the country with scores of youth and high school games canceled and leagues aborted. Barry Mano, the president of the officials\u2019 association, said it received one or two calls weekly inquiring about the organization\u2019s assault insurance or for the legal advice that goes with it.Here in eastern Oklahoma, Barlow chose to fight back. Players, parents, coaches and administrators in the area say his online postings \u2014 he has put up only a small fraction of the hundreds of videos from around the country he has received \u2014 have altered sideline behavior.\u201cIf one parent starts yelling at a ref, all the other parents move away and say: \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t want to be videotaped for Barlow\u2019s Facebook page,\u2019\u201d said Kristin Voyles, whose 14-year-old son, Easton, is a referee and soccer player in Broken Arrow, a Tulsa suburb. \u201cWe know that everyone on the sideline has a smartphone in their hand.\u201dSid Goodrich, the executive director of the Oklahoma Soccer Association, agreed that Barlow\u2019s initiative has had an effect.\u201cPeople are looking at themselves and asking, \u2018Am I the reason we don\u2019t have more referees?\u2019\u201d said Goodrich, who added that his association loses about 40 percent of its referees each year, forcing zealous recruitment of new officials.Barlow\u2019s quest to shine a light on the worst sideline behavior has made him a minor celebrity in the Tulsa area, where he lives. In the 18 months since he started the page, which also includes guidance for referees and pictures of appreciative fans, he has been the subject of three segments on local television stations.But Barlow has also made his share of enemies among the \u201ccheeseburgers,\u201d as he calls the abusers, that he denounces.\u201cSome people, frankly, want to punch me in the mouth,\u201d he said.Travis Featherstone, a Tulsa coach, referee and father of young players, praised Barlow\u2019s intentions, but wondered if the page went too far.\u201cThere may be a different way to go about it, as in getting more parents involved with it instead of just pointing them out and making them look like they\u2019re awful people,\u201d Featherstone said.And some parents have begged Barlow, who owns a marketing company, to take down certain videos, a request he has occasionally granted. (Because the videos are recorded in public settings and posted with the permission of the person taking it, he said, he has avoided legal issues.)Just because Barlow runs the page, it does not necessarily mean parents and fans always tone it down around him, or even his 12-year-old daughter, who is a referee for games with younger children.After a game last month, Barlow and two other referees needed an armed police escort to their cars. Last month, his daughter, Zoe, had to stay inside a building for 90 minutes after a game at the urging of tournament officials, to protect her from threats made by parents who were irate with calls made by the crew of referees. The game had to be canceled.\u201cSometimes I have to intercede and tell these parents that it\u2019s not the World Cup, and remind them that the players are 6 years old and the ref is 12,\u201d Lori Barlow, Brian\u2019s wife, said.Brian Barlow, a referee for 14 years, has done more than use the Facebook page to stand up for his fellow officials. He started a program called S.T.O.P. (Stop Tormenting Officials Permanently) that distributes bright signage prominently placed at youth sports complexes. One sign reads: \u201cWarning: Screaming at Officials Not Allowed.\u201d Another reads: \u201cCaution: Development in Progress, Stay Out of It.\u201dThe initiative also includes S.T.O.P. vests that are worn by volunteers acting as field marshals, assigned by leagues to oversee games. The marshals also have large, red octagon S.T.O.P. signs, and if parents are growing agitated with the officials, the marshals are instructed to hold up the S.T.O.P. signs from the sideline.Youth referees also hand out small badges to offending coaches that read in part: \u201cThis is a warning. A \u2018youth\u2019 referee has issued this pass. The next one will be a dismissal.\u201dSix Oklahoma clubs have paid a one-time fee of $999 to join the S.T.O.P. initiative, and 30 leagues from states including Virginia and Washington State have made inquiries.Barlow\u2019s methods are not the only efforts to curb abuse across the country.The South Carolina Youth Soccer Association last year instituted a policy called \u201cSilent September.\u201d Parents and visitors at games statewide were not allowed to verbally cheer, or jeer, players or referees for the entire month. Clapping was allowed.\u201cIt was a resounding success and made for a much more focused environment for learning and for play,\u201d Burns Davison, who heads rules and compliance for the South Carolina association, said. \u201cWe got everyone\u2019s attention. People thanked us for the peace and quiet.\u201dOther states have tried a more punitive approach. Legislatures in nearly 20 states have increased the penalties for assaulting a sports official by making it a discrete, independent category of the crime, according to Alan. S. Goldberger, a lawyer from New Jersey and the author of \u201cSports Officiating: A Legal Guide.\u201dOne factor that many sports officials believe contributes to parents\u2019 bad behavior is the desire for their children to earn athletic college scholarships. Leagues in Massachusetts and Virginia have tried to address that pressure and jolt parents back to reality with signs at the entrance to athletic complexes that read: \u201cNo N.C.A.A. scouts are looking at your child today,\u201d or \u201cNo N.C.A.A. scholarships will be awarded on this field today.\u201dMany families regularly spend $2,000 to $20,000 a year per child on elite club team dues, private trainers and other costs, like far-flung travel to the best tournaments and recruiting showcases. The investment of money and time leads to heightened expectations among parents, even at a contest between elementary schoolers. In fact, sports officials insist that the younger the players, the worse the sideline behavior usually is.\u201cWhen I got into officiating I looked forward to doing the youth games; I didn\u2019t know that was where most of the trouble was,\u201d said Mary DeLaat, a basketball referee in the Milwaukee area who began officiating in 2014 but quit this year. \u201cThe parents are all like, \u2018My kid is going to get that scholarship and be the next LeBron James.\u2019\u201cWhen something isn\u2019t going right with that plan, the blame has to go somewhere, and often it\u2019s the referee. It\u2019s our fault.\u201dIt\u2019s possible, of course, the sideline behavior springs from bad officiating, in part because the shrinking pool of referees leads to quick turnover in the ranks, which can lead to unprepared refs.\u201cIt\u2019s a very volatile situation,\u201d said Donnie Eppley, who oversees officiating for several high school and youth programs in central Pennsylvania.In Oklahoma, aside from the shaming videos, clubs have made their own efforts to keep parents in line, including assigning game proctors to document bad behavior and even having children reprimand them.\u201cIf a parent was acting up, we had a coach who would remove that parent\u2019s child from the game and send her around to the other side of the field to talk to her parent,\u201d said Eric Edwards, the father of three children playing soccer in the Tulsa area. \u201cIt was embarrassing for the kid and the parent. The girl went back in the game right afterward but most of the other parents were saying, \u2018Thank God the coach did that.\u2019\u201dIn early May, Barlow donned his bright yellow referee jersey to work a semifinal game of the Oklahoma high school state soccer championships in Tulsa. To his relief, it went smoothly, with no irate parents or fans \u2014 and one even thanked him.\u201cThat kind of thing does happen,\u201d he said afterward, soaked in sweat outside the locker room. \u201cLots of people get it and are very nice, too.\u201dEarlier that day, Barlow was having breakfast with a handful of soccer coaches and administrators. One coach at the table, Richard Beattie, conceded that he was once the kind of person who might have ended up as a video star on Barlow\u2019s Facebook page. But a few years ago, at a coaches meeting, he saw himself on video kicking a water bottle and yelling at the referee. He was embarrassed and resolved to change.\u201cI was once the biggest abuser,\u201d Beattie said, \u201cand if I can say that my behavior was unacceptable and had to change, then other people can do it, too.\u201dBarlow smiled.\u201cThis is what I mean, this is what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cHave we won the war? No. Are we fighting back? Yeah, we are.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Cements Right-Wing Agenda in a Furious Week of Lawmaking", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Wrapping up its business before a long summer recess, the right-wing, religious coalition that rules Israel\u2019s Parliament moved aggressively this week to push through its polarizing agenda, piling up points at the expense of its already weakened foes.But to right-leaning Israeli Jews, the measures were part of a long-overdue restoration of the proper balance between Israel\u2019s dual identities as a Jewish and a democratic state. Many supporters of the governing coalition see that balance as having been tilted dangerously askew after a quarter-century of legislating from the bench by a liberal Supreme Court.\u201cThere are people who it\u2019s in their interest to make it sound extreme, but they\u2019re overexaggerating,\u201d said Sharren Haskel, a 34-year-old member of Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s party. \u201cWe are a right-wing government, we\u2019re proud of it, and we\u2019re bringing Israel to a better place.\u201dCritics in the opposition, and even some on the right, say the frenzy of lawmaking reeked of pre-election-season posturing by a coalition that has cemented its hold on power, and whose members were trying to outbid one another for the support of their most hard-core primary-campaign voters.Israelis across the political spectrum cited support from the Trump administration as providing Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government with protective cover. They also pointed out that the wave of nationalism and populism sweeping across Europe and the United States made their own country look like just another face in the crowd.Still, the rightward legislative lurch was extraordinary for Israel.Yediot Ahronot, one of the country\u2019s most widely read newspapers, on Friday summed up the week\u2019s events with a drawing of the Knesset, Israel\u2019s Parliament, showing a giant black flag flying overhead. \u201cIsrael 2018: Coalition celebrating, equality being trampled,\u201d a headline read.Nor were the divisive moves confined to the legislative chamber.He later received an apology from the government.But in an online post, Michael J. Koplow, Mr. Koplow\u2019s son and an executive at the Israel Policy Forum, a liberal think tank, publicized his father\u2019s run-in over what he said was \u201cthe most rudimentary evidence of basic engagement with the Palestinians,\u201d calling the interrogation \u201cyet another example in a seemingly never-ending string of the massive problem that Israel is having with American Jews.Sallai Meridor, who was Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States a decade ago, explained the week\u2019s developments as a precursor to elections in November 2019.\u201cThey may feel that this is their last chance to pass laws\u201d before the campaign season begins in the fall, Mr. Meridor said, \u201cand they\u2019re focusing on competing for right-wing votes, rather than on long-term, strategic issues or what the world may think.\u201dHe also suggested that elections could be called sooner, with Mr. Netanyahu expected to be indicted in a tangle of corruption investigations.Mr. Hartman, the president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, said, \u201cIsrael is suffering from a new phenomenon, and that\u2019s political stability.\u201dIndeed, even if Mr. Netanyahu were to leave office, recent polls show, the coalition, led by his Likud party, could survive with scarcely a hiccup.\u201cThe opposition is irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Hartman said. \u201cAnd the stability of Israeli political life is enabling some of the darker forces to put forth bills and ideas that would never have been passed before.\u201dTo members of the coalition, there is nothing dark about their legislative efforts. \u201cWe have a pure-right agenda; we believe in liberty, and patriotism, and you need to have it, in a country like Israel where you\u2019re surrounded by enemies,\u201d Ms. Haskel, the Likud lawmaker, said.Those enemies are not merely political. In Gaza on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces responded to the killing of a soldier by Palestinian militants with waves of airstrikes on bases and weapons caches maintained by Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.Yet others said Israel\u2019s government was showing a dangerous degree of hubris \u2014 and not only with its legislative moves this week.Bradley Burston, a left-wing columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said in an interview that some in the government now appeared to believe that it might not be necessary ever to reach a solution to the Palestinian conflict.\u201cTill now, leftists believed the occupation was unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Burston said. \u201cBut on the right, the more friends they have abroad who are themselves authoritarians, accepting of illiberal rule, the easier it is to accept that there\u2019s this bizarre, quasi-colonial situation on the West Bank. And maybe you can just keep it going long enough that it becomes permanent.\u201dThe government may have overstepped this week in the vote against surrogacy rights for single men and gay couples.Officials warned that the work stoppage could even delay flights in and out of Ben Gurion Airport.With little other recourse than taking to the streets, critics on the left and in the Arab minority say the policies and hostility they see emanating from Parliament are growing difficult to bear.Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Israeli Arab lawmaker, said he and his liberal Jewish friends increasingly felt \u201cstrangled\u201d by what he called a \u201cfascist atmosphere.\u201dHe noted acerbically that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who was asked on Friday about the Israeli nation-state law, had stressed the need to protect the rights of minorities.\u201cMerkel is ready to sacrifice her coalition by defending migrants,\u201d Mr. Tibi said, \u201cand Netanyahu is ready to sacrifice his coalition to push this Jewish supremacy and downgrade the Arabic language. She is defending immigrants, and he is attacking the indigenous.\u201dMr. Tibi, who recalled almost wistfully a kindler, gentler form of oppression decades ago \u2014 \u201cThey confiscated our land, but they talked sweetly,\u201d he said \u2014 indicated that Mr. Netanyahu had nothing to fear from the United States, or from anyone else.\u201cWhy are they passing these laws?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the Long Run, It\u2019s Terrible.", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterRising carbon dioxide levels are making the world greener. But that\u2019s nothing to celebrate. \u201cGlobal greening\u201d sounds lovely, doesn\u2019t it?Climate change denialists were quick to jump on Dr. Campbell\u2019s research as proof that increased carbon dioxide is making the world a better place.Recently I talked Dr. Campbell, and as it turns out, he feels people like Mr. Bast are drawing the wrong lessons from his research. Here are four reasons he believes nobody should be celebrating \u201cglobal greening.\u201d\u201cA 30 percent increase in photosynthesis does not translate into a 30 percent increase in strawberries off the land,\u201d said Dr. Campbell.While photosynthesis does pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, much of that gas goes right back into the air. The reason: At night, the chemical reactions in plants essentially run backward. In a process known as respiration, plants pump out carbon dioxide instead of pulling it in.\u201cPart of the story is that photosynthesis is going up, and part of the story is that so is respiration,\u201d said Dr. Campbell.While the increase in photosynthesis is greater than that of respiration, the ultimate benefit to crops has been small \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t explain our modern agricultural revolution. \u201cThe driving factor has to be the fertilizers, the seed varieties, the irrigation,\u201d Dr. Campbell said.As more carbon dioxide gets into the atmosphere, the problem will grow. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely strong evidence that quality will be affected,\u201d said Dr. Campbell.Just as carbon dioxide speeds up photosynthesis, it may also increase the rate at which soil microbes take up nutrients, leaving less for plants to suck in through their roots.In Southeast Asia, for example, the researchers estimated that the rate of iron deficiency may rise from 21.8 percent to 27.9 percent by 2050.Deficiencies in iron and other nutrients could make millions of people more vulnerable to diseases including malaria and pneumonia, leading to many premature deaths.It\u2019s not just strawberries and other crops that are taking in extra carbon dioxide. So are the forests, grasslands and other wild ecosystems of the world.When scientists take into account both extra photosynthesis and respiration, they estimate that plants remove a quarter of the carbon dioxide we put in the atmosphere.\u201cThat\u2019s on par with what China emits,\u201d said Dr. Campbell. \u201cAnd China is the biggest global polluter.\u201dEven more remarkably, the plants have been scrubbing the same fraction of carbon dioxide out of the air even as our emissions explode. \u201cEvery year we build more power plants, and every year the plants take out more CO2,\u201d Dr. Campbell said.But that isn\u2019t cause to celebrate. It\u2019s a bit like hearing that your chemotherapy is slowing the growth of your tumor by 25 percent.If plants keep on absorbing only a quarter of our carbon dioxide in the future, then we can expect all these trends to get stronger.In other words, if global greening isn\u2019t saving us now, we can\u2019t rely on it to save us in the future.There\u2019s still a lot that Dr. Campbell and his colleagues don\u2019t understand about global greening. Most importantly, they don\u2019t know how long it will last.As temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change, plants may stop soaking up extra carbon dioxide.\u201cPlants are quietly scrubbing the air of one China\u2019s worth of carbon. What frightens me is knowing this can\u2019t go on forever,\u201d said Dr. Campbell. \u201cIf respiration catches up with photosynthesis, this huge carbon reservoir could spill back into our air.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a wild card out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As her three children played nearby, she began going down a list of names written on it in purple marker.\u201cHillary Estefany. Hillary Alejandra,\u201d she read, explaining they were 19-year-old twins whose brother was separated from them after they illegally crossed the Southwest border.

She\u2019s from Guatemala,\u201d she went on. \u201cSeparation case. $30,000.\u201d\u201cThe subtext was if we could get her here, she could get her kids back,\u201d Ms. Schwietert Collazo said.She set about getting Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez to New York. She asked a few mothers she had just met at a donation drive for separated children \u2014 and then the public \u2014 to help post Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s $7,500 bond.Sara Farrington, a playwright, joined the group and \u201cblitzed mom groups within 100 miles of here\u201d on Facebook to raise money. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018Why this?\u2019 \u2018Why aren\u2019t you focusing on the midterms?\u2019 I think it comes back to empathy,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the gut punch of a mom separated from her 5-year-old. The reason that this has exploded, I truly think, is that moms have put themselves in that situation. It has hit a primitive motherly nerve. I think it all stems from, \u2018What if it were me?\u2019\u201dMs. Schwietert Collazo, a former social worker, is now a writer and editor. She launched the Yeni Gonz\u00e1lez crowdfunding campaign on June 25. Days later, she paid her bond, and Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez was released to her lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Orochena, in Eloy, and set out for New York.Other women in the Eloy Detention Center learned of Mr. Orochena through Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, who gave them her lawyer\u2019s contact information before she was released. Someone typed it up at a library in the detention center, printed 50 copies, and circulated them, Mr. Orochena said.As the lawyer was flooded with calls, he passed along women\u2019s names to Ms. Schwietert Collazo and her group. And so began their round-the-clock work to release and reunite the mothers of Eloy with their children. For each woman they learned about, the organizers launched a crowdfunding campaign in her name.The group has also provided the newly reunited families with housing and pro bono attorneys in the states where they have ended up, Ms. Schwietert Collazo said, creating, in the process, a broad network of helpers. \u201cWith the rabbis in Tennessee,\u201d she said into her phone at one point this week, \u201cwe should be set.\u201dBut now, the group\u2019s role may be changing. The federal government is hastily putting families back together in order to meet a court-ordered deadline to reunite all separated families by July 26. And the group in New York is getting calls for new kinds of help from all over the country.This week, a lawyer made an urgent request for medical care for two girls, 2 and 6, who were on the road to Maryland after being reunited with a parent, but had been running high fevers. Another lawyer needed diapers and wipes.Meghan Finn, the group member in charge of coordinating the women\u2019s travel after they are released from Eloy, said what they had been hearing was distressing.After being transported over long distances to be reunited, often without much food or sleep, many families had been released in government offices, airports and bus stations, with their ankle monitors and a handful of paperwork from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and little more than the clothes in which they crossed the border.\u201cThey\u2019re getting dropped off at Greyhound stations at random times,\u201d said Ms. Finn, co-artistic director of the Tank, a nonprofit theater in Midtown Manhattan.\u201cListen, this is our job. This is our job because our government did something really heinous to these families, and it\u2019s not just about putting them on a bus.\u201dOther than Ms. Schwietert Collazo\u2019s husband, Francisco Collazo \u2014 a refugee from Cuba who arrived on the Mariel boatlift \u2014 the group members are all women, most of them mothers. As their days have been consumed with helping separated families, their partners and parents have taken over child care duties, cooking meals, giving the children haircuts.\u201cMy mom refers to the kitchen as the \u2018immigration office,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Finn, who lives in Kensington, Brooklyn, with her husband and their two young sons.Ms. Schwietert Collazo remembers checking with her husband before she launched the first campaign. \u201cI said, \u2018We both have to be all in on this. Because it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to take over our lives.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think either of us expected it would be to this extent.\u201dMeeting the women they have bonded out has revealed the toll of separation and detention, Ms. Finn said. \u201cThey\u2019re losing their hair. Their hands are peeling. They\u2019re malnourished. It takes them a while to eat properly.\u201dSo the group has continued raising funds to get more mothers out of Eloy, even as the immigration authorities there have kept increasing the bonds. Delmi\u2019s bond, $30,000, is about four times as much as Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s bond. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest one I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Ms. Schwietert Collazo said.On Tuesday, Ms. Finn sat with her laptop in a narrow dressing room at Tank on West 36th Street \u2014 that day\u2019s immigration office.

According to Israeli law, in order to be Jewish you have to have a Jewish mother. So it\u2019s not my fault; it\u2019s your mom\u2019s.\u201d\u201cGreat,\u201d my wife protested, \u201cnow you\u2019re shouldering me with your children\u2019s inequality?\u201dWhen Israel was founded on the ruins of the Palestinian people in 1948, it was defined as a Jewish state. The Israeli flag was always a Jewish one, bearing a Star of David; the national anthem invokes the \u201cJewish soul,\u201d excluding anyone who is not Jewish from these national symbols. The Palestinians who became Israeli citizens when the state was founded \u2014 like my family \u2014 have always been viewed as an undesirable demographic burden and subjected to discrimination.So what does the issuance of the Nationality Law change? In essence, perhaps not that much. It has turned de facto racism into de jure racism.Israel\u2019s message to its Arab citizens is that it does not wish to be our state. Moreover, it prefers to be the state of people who were born elsewhere, who do not speak its language, have never visited it or paid it taxes or served it in any way. The State of Israel will welcome these foreigners, wherever they are from, as long as they are considered Jewish by Orthodox Jewish law. Individuals who are lucky enough to have been born to Jewish mothers can \u2014 practically overnight \u2014 receive Israeli citizenship, join the ruling race and become masters of the native population.The Nationality Law prevents the possibility of multiculturalism in Israel and rejects any collective history or memory other than the Zionist one. By revoking Arabic\u2019s status as an official state language, the law delivers yet another blow to the culture that has been vying for a position since Israel was founded. Article 7 of the Nationality Law, whereby the state shall regard Jewish settlement as a national value and work to advance it, has a distinctly colonialist tone, addressing Jewish settlement without any mention of the 20 percent of the population who are Arabs and who live in crowded conditions, under continuous threat of having their land appropriated. While the message to Arab citizens within the State of Israel is unequivocal, the Nationality Law is murky when it comes to the Palestinians who reside in the West Bank and Gaza. What are the limits of the law, and to whom does it apply, in a state that avoids declaring its borders and refuses to accept those determined by international law? Doesn\u2019t the fact that Israel controls the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories through military rule mean that it is now a state in which one population has civil rights and a second population is under occupation and lacks civil rights?The powerful right wing in Israel wishes to annex the West Bank, or large parts of it, and some voices have been saying that Israeli law should be instated in the Occupied Territories, too. If this were to occur, how would the Nationality Law apply to the millions of Palestinians under occupation? Would there still be a prohibition against any definition other than the national-Jewish one? Does this law not aim to prevent any possibility of national Palestinian fulfillment in the State of Israel as conceived by the right wing \u2014 namely, one Jewish state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, in which only Jews are permitted self-actualization and granted a national identity? It seems the only hope for the remaining millions of Palestinians to avoid losing what is left of their home is to find a Jewish mother who will agree to adopt them.Sayed Kashua is the author, most recently, of \u201cNative: Dispatches From an Israeli-Palestinian Life.\u201d This essay was translated by Jessica Cohen from the Hebrew.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Fake Fix for a Bad Economic Policy", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUsing tax dollars to bailout farmers hurt by President Trump\u2019s tariffs is not the way to strengthen the economy. Mr. Block is a professor of economics at Loyola University in New Orleans.As an economist who shares President Trump\u2019s belief that we should be cutting taxes and shrinking government, I might be expected to be enthralled by his policies. But that is not the sentiment I and many other libertarians feel when it comes to his decision to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum and a host of other products made overseas, particularly in China.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had reached an agreement to step back from a trade war and to discuss ways to lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and possibly increase European imports of American soybeans. But the outcome of those talks is far from certain, and trade tensions between the United States and China remain very high.What is driving the president\u2019s apparent eagerness to impose tariffs is a simple and wrongheaded idea that plays to a large part of his base: A trade war will spur job growth in America. He is trying to use tariffs to give a leg up to American industries against countries that manufacture the same products that we do \u2014 whether steel, aluminum or cars \u2014 but more efficiently. And who could be against that if it creates more jobs? In reality, however, creating jobs alone does not make for a strong economy. What we really want is to increase production. And to achieve that, we need to allocate labor as efficiently as possible. One way to do that is to ensure that if other countries can make certain goods more efficiently than we can, we trade with them for these items, rather than manufacture them ourselves. The result is cheaper goods, which is to our advantage. But tariffs do nothing to improve this efficient allocation of labor. They also do not increase or decrease employment. They just shift jobs around, and almost always in a manner that hurts the economy.As an illustration, assume Mr. Trump is the governor of New York. He is devoted to making the Empire State \u201cgreat again.\u201d Right now, both New Yorkers and Iowans raise pigs \u2014 but Iowa produces far more than New York. So Governor Trump sets up a protective tariff against the importation of Iowa-raised pork. Will this make New York great again?Hardly. There is a very good reason the Empire State does not produce a huge amount of this product: economic efficiency, the true path toward economic greatness. Of course, pork product jobs will increase in New York thanks to the Trump tariffs. But this is the way to ruin the state\u2019s economy.There are good reasons the United States is such a prosperous country, one of which is this: The country is a gigantic free-trade zone among the states. Yes, every once in a while a state legislature will get in the way. Wisconsin may try to reduce the importation of wine from California. But this only interferes with the specialization and the division of labor that maximizes output. Happily, the Supreme Court has typically given the back of its collective hand to all such attempted interferences with interstate economic freedom.We would do well to apply the same principles to American trade with other countries. That is why Milton Friedman urged a unilateral declaration of free trade with all nations, regardless of their own restrictions on international trade.The negative consequences of a trade war will soon be felt, if they aren\u2019t already. Even if the United States avoids trade conflict with Europe, tariffs on steel and aluminum from China, Mexico and Canada will raise domestic prices, hurting consumers. And the administration is likely to find itself subsidizing voters who purchase these items or who are hurt when other countries slap tariffs on American goods in retaliation \u2014 mainly farmers, manufacturers and builders. That is one reason Mr. Trump went to Iowa on Thursday: The state\u2019s farm industry could be severely hurt by taxes or tariffs on American farm exports imposed by China and other countries in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. So the president heralded a plan to provide as much as $12 billion in emergency relief to farmers caught in the trade crossfire. That is a $12 billion bailout using taxpayer funds for a problem the president himself created. There are other, longer-term consequences of a trade war. After the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, announced in May that tariffs would be imposed on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union, our European allies embraced greater trade relations with, of all places, Russia. Canada is sidling up to China. This will only hurt American exporters.Maybe we should be happy that the president hasn\u2019t yet kicked Hawaii out of the union and imposed a tariff on pineapples to strengthen the weak pineapple industry in other states. Absurd, yes, but hardly less bizarre than thinking tariffs on foreign goods will make the American economy great again.Walter E.

It\u2019s not clear exactly what either one is saying or what they mean. We now know that President Trump and his aides have repeatedly lied about the efforts to cover up an alleged affair he had with a former Playboy model. Almost everything else \u2014 including whether the tape creates new legal problems for Trump \u2014 is unknown at this point.I am not saying that Trump and Giuliani are always lying. When the truth helps them, they speak it. But the mere fact that they make a claim shouldn\u2019t alter anyone\u2019s judgment about its likely veracity. One statistic in Duffy\u2019s piece captures why Kemp remains favored. Abrams generated enormous excitement in the primary. She\u2019s an appealing candidate \u2014 the first female African-American gubernatorial nominee in any state \u2014 with an uplifting message. When I watched her victory speech on primary night, I thought I might be witnessing a new national star. And yet for all the excitement about Abrams, turnout in the Republican primary was still higher than in the Democratic primary. In fact, more Republicans voted in this week\u2019s runoff \u2014 won by Kemp \u2014 than Democrats voted in the original primary. There are simply more Republican than Democratic voters in Georgia. Yes, Abrams can significantly improve her chances by turning out even more progressives \u2014 especially younger and nonwhite voters \u2014 in the general election.

{"Headline": "Pet Cremation: Seeking \u2018Good Afterlife\u2019 for Bangkok\u2019s Pampered Dogs", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBangkok DispatchBANGKOK \u2014 The Siberian husky burned in Bangkok, the flames devouring her thick fur. Holding hands in the pet funeral hall, the dog\u2019s owners wept soundlessly.They had paid $160 for their dog, Friendly, to be cremated in the proper Thai way, festooned with marigolds and sprinkled with holy water at a Buddhist temple, or wat.Bangkok, a messy city with little green space, is not ideal for pets. A park near where I live is home to nine-foot-long monitor lizards that looked capable of snacking on Agatha, my family\u2019s miniature schnauzer. Pets swallowed whole by pythons are not as uncommon an occurrence as one would hope.The Bangkok government takes a blas\u00e9 attitude toward stray animals, so there is little in the way of spaying or neutering. As a consequence, an estimated 100,000 street dogs, in varying states of disrepair, roam the streets of the Thai capital.A recent rabies outbreak spooked the city. Animal shelters are overflowing, and the city\u2019s zoos are hardly a bastion of animal rights, with elephants forced to perform for tourists.Still, many Bangkok residents are mad for dogs and cats, and they try to create pet havens in this urban jungle, which is my home base in my role as the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The New York Times. The animal hospital where Agatha got her vaccinations has its own chandeliered lobby, cafe with doggy treats and V.I.P. rooms where humans can sleep over should their hospitalized pets prefer the company.When it gets cold in Bangkok \u2014 by which I mean around 70 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 pet owners dress their dogs in sweatshirts or, if they have the money, Burberry raincoats.Agatha, more used to northern climes from having grown up in China, was content to venture out with nothing more than her own fur. Unlike the poodle that lives around the corner, she was never treated to a pedicure, complete with red nail polish.The final send-off for Thai pets can be equally lavish.Thailand is overwhelmingly Buddhist, and the faithful believe that animals, through a cycle of rebirth into different life forms, can eventually attain nirvana. At our local wat, monks often chant for dogs, cats, hamsters, lizards, snakes and turtles, the prayer hall filling with the murmur of their incantations.On occasion, pious Buddhists who find deceased strays make merit by helping the animals transition to their next life through a wat funeral. Most animals can be cremated at the wat, although pet pigs present difficulties for the crematory because of their copious fat.At the Krathum Suea Pla Wat, where Friendly the husky was cremated, employees fold hundreds of ornate paper flowers each day to decorate the animal corpses. Piles of fresh blooms and golden paper await the bereaved.A young couple once came to mourn their pet goldfish, a Valentine\u2019s Day gift, whose sudden death was feared might imperil the relationship.Friendly\u2019s owner, Watcharasit Siripaisarnpipat, knew he and his wife had spoiled their dog. In this tropical country, they kept Friendly and six other Siberian huskies in an enclosure with 24-hour air-conditioning, even if they themselves would sometimes make do with a fan. On her birthday, Friendly ate ice cream.\u201cShe enjoyed a good life,\u201d Mr. Watcharasit said, as they sifted through the bones that emerged from the crematory. \u201cShe deserves a good afterlife, too.\u201dA few weeks later, Mr. Watcharasit, his wife and his daughter boarded a boat on the Chao Phraya, the river that curves through Bangkok. With the breeze blowing, they tipped an urn and scattered their dog\u2019s ashes into the water.As a creature lucky enough to have lived in this devout Buddhist kingdom, Friendly was now free to reincarnate.Eight years ago, Cassius, our dog before Agatha, died of complications from a tick-borne bacteria. (The blood disease that killed her also decimated American canine units during the Vietnam War.)We had Cassius cremated at a wat. Monks prayed, and her body was consigned to the fire, a purifying, soul-cleansing force in Thai tradition. Over the years, we transported her celadon urn to Beijing, then to Shanghai, then back to Bangkok. Cassius\u2019s ashes still sit on our bedroom dresser.But as I watched the ceremony for Friendly, I thought to myself: When it\u2019s Agatha\u2019s turn, I don\u2019t think I can do this again.It wasn\u2019t the visceral horror of watching the crematory worker shove a poker into the oven that turned me. According to Buddhism, all forms are impermanent, even furry cold-nosed ones.I was more bothered by how commercialized the pet cremation business had become \u2014 with special packages that required choosing which urn to buy or how many monks would pray for your pet.And then I saw one of the four monks reciting sutras for Friendly check his cellphone as he was supposed to be praying for the Siberian husky. He sneaked a look at his Facebook feed, his finger scrolling frenetically, even as his mouth moved in prayer.No, I thought, we would do something else when Agatha\u2019s time came, something without monks addicted to social media.But since our miniature schnauzer was only 6 years old, I didn\u2019t consider the specifics of what we might do instead.That evening, as I downloaded pictures and video of the pet funeral, Agatha snoozed on my lap, unaware of the images of canine mortality playing on my laptop.Less than a week later, Agatha was hit by a car on our lane in Bangkok. She died almost instantly.My family loved our little schnauzer, born in Beijing, raised in Shanghai, transported by airplane to Bangkok last year. In her new home in Thailand, she made friends with local street dogs and learned the pleasures of riding on the back of a motorcycle taxi, the wind ruffling her beard and eyebrows.Agatha had big ears and an even bigger heart. She had scampered across a section of the Great Wall of China and liked to crunch on cucumbers. Her eyes were the color of dark chocolate. We buried her under a big tamarind tree in the garden of our apartment building.Our Thai neighbors brought us an armful of orchids. Frogs, worms and shiny plated centipedes now keep Agatha company. Soon, plants will grow from her grave, the tropical earth, always wet and warm, replenishing the Buddhist cycle of life.Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Into the Land of Happiness: Touring Nepal and Bhutan", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "Cultured TravelerA couple hope to experience \u201csomething big, something different\u201d on a trip to Nepal and Bhutan. There was only one possible stumbling block: the organized tour they signed up for.Supported byA country that, for many of the most ambitious mountaineers, all but invented trekking, plus a pristine sliver of the Himalayas that celebrates both happiness and Buddhism? We signed on.But we had some concerns, mainly having to do with our preconceived ideas of organized tours. My husband and I are youngsters in our pre-60s. What if the others on the trip turned out to be downright old? And what if the guides spent too much time on stuff we weren\u2019t interested in? Could you even get off the bus if you wanted to? We\u2019d never been on an organized tour.Yet what did we know about stupas? Maybe we needed the kind of tour provided by professionals after all.Stupas are hemispherical structures, focal points for worship and meditation. As our excellent tour guide, Sanjay Nepal, explained, they\u2019re typically painted with four sets of eyes pointing in four directions to symbolize the Buddha\u2019s all-seeingness. My own set of eyes didn\u2019t know what to look at first: the prayer flags fluttering in the sky, the prayer wheels being spun by the devout, the monks on their cellphones or the monks at their devotions?And then there were the monkeys. Monkeys, monkeys, everywhere \u2014 in the trees, on the sleeping Buddha statue, climbing the enormous stupa.By the end of the day, I would learn that the downside of being on a tour was not, in our case, our fellow tour-goers (who, though mostly older than we were by an average of 12 years, were an energetic, friendly bunch). Rather, it was exactly what the upside of the tour was supposed to be: the schedule, which included meal times and number of sites visited per day. You went where and when the tour took you, even if you would have preferred a good long apr\u00e8s-lunch nap.Instead, Day 1 included not just Swayambhunath, but also Durbar Square, the historic city center. Still, despite my jet lag, every one of my sense organs woke up as we climbed off the bus and into a place unlike anything I\u2019d seen except in movies.It was here \u2014 specifically, to \u201cFreak Street\u201d \u2014 that the hippies who \u201cdiscovered\u201d Nepal in the 1960s flocked. They were attracted to the astonishing jumble of temples, alleys, courtyards, shrines, statuary, pagodas, friezes, vegetable-and-spice sellers, fishmongers, palaces and hashish shops.The hashish shops are long since closed. But still, I felt like I was in an altered state when I saw the little girl, known as the Kumari, who is worshiped as the incarnation of the Hindu goddess Taleju. She lives in the 18th-century brick palace of Kumari Ghar; visitors may enter the courtyard and take snapshots of the richly carved reliefs, but may not photograph the goddess herself, should she appear\u2014 as she did\u2014 at the window of her royal cage, her little-girl eyes huge with ritual makeup.The city is also home to many religious traditions that have long rubbed up against each other, resulting not just in the parade of stupas that we\u2019d see, but also in an almost overwhelming profusion of gods, spirits, demons, carvings, masks, mendicants, monks, music, prayer, ritual and meditative practices.I\u2019d need a lifetime of study to understand the various manifestations of Hinduism, Buddhism, animism, tantric tradition and their offshoots, but I can say, albeit in extreme oversimplification, that most Hindu practice revolves around individual deity worship. Buddhism, which came out of the same ancient Indian religious culture as Hinduism, centers on its four Noble Truths, which articulate, among other things, that all suffering comes from craving.Is one path more peaceful than the other? I wouldn\u2019t know. I do know that in Nepal, they\u2019re often all mixed up with one another, or coextensive with one another, or share the neighborhood, as they do in Patan Durbar Square \u2014 a different Durbar Square from the one we\u2019d already visited, this one in the Kathmandu Valley city of Lalitpur, the ancient seat of the Malla dynasty. Though now subsumed by the greater Kathmandu sprawl, Patan\u2019s Durbar Square is cleaner and more hippie-free than its counterpart to the north.Up a hill and over and around stood many temples devoted to numerous expressions of numerous deities. By now it was late afternoon on Day 1 of the tour, and my brain was exploding \u2014 or, rather, imploding. It was a lot to take in, particularly since it was well past bedtime in New Jersey. Not to mention that, because I enjoy low blood pressure, I tend to keel over when I\u2019m tired or hungry. At an elevation of 4,593 feet, Kathmandu would have been challenging for me even without the overstimulation. As if he could see into my soul, Sanjay sent us back to the bus via rickshaw.As the tour continued and I wandered through temple complexes, past statues of deities and among robed monks, I began to have a new appreciation of how being rooted in spiritual tradition might be a key to something akin to serenity, to life fully lived.But nothing quite excited my own lifelong quest for being in proximity to the divine like the Pashupatinath Temple complex, Nepal\u2019s holiest Hindu shrine, where I witnessed my first cremation. My first seven or eight cremations, actually. Because here, along the banks of the Bagmati river \u2014 turgid and brown before the onset of the monsoons \u2014 is where the devout send their dead to the next world in accordance with the teachings of the Vedas.The Pashupatinath Temple is a pagoda-style building with copper and gold roofs, dating to the 15th century and surrounded by the additional temples, ashrams and shrines that make up the complex. The whole of it is populated by priests, caretakers, scholars, mendicants, seekers, tourists, knick-knack-and-jewelry sellers, and children, beggars and others so impoverished that you feel guilty about your entire, cushy life.Still, even surrounded by poverty, I had a hard time dealing with the dearth \u2014 at least in public places \u2014 of modern, clean toilets. Hotels were fine. Open-air temple complexes, not so much.Speaking of plumbing, Bhaktapur, a small city some eight miles east of Kathmandu and the center of a third of the once-independent city-states in the Kathmandu Valley, was until a few years ago something of an open-air toilet, or so Sanjay explained.Now it\u2019s so pristine that you feel as if you\u2019ve wandered onto a movie set. For the past 2,000 years or so, it\u2019s been home to the Newars, master craftsmen who, in the medieval era built a splendid city of warm brickwork, back alleys, temples and squares, including the Nyatapola Temple, with five pagoda stories at the top of a steep flight of stairs flanked by statues of elephants, lions and griffins.An almost untouched swath of forest, mountains, waterways and fertile agricultural lowlands, with a population of fewer than one million residents who are governed by a constitutional monarchy, Bhutan is Edenic, and possibly even the world\u2019s happiest country, as it claims to be. But I also wondered if it wasn\u2019t also somewhat, well, rigid.I didn\u2019t observe a single person yelling, cursing, road-raging or even frowning. Except me, especially when, during our first night in the capital city of Thimphu, a passel of dogs had a howling contest under my window.Perhaps they were trying to communicate with the nearby and recently completed Great Buddha Dordenma. At 169 feet tall, it\u2019s massive, and as shiny as real gold \u2014 because it is real gold, or rather, gold plate. Inside its base, there are some 125,000 additional, much smaller gilded Buddha statues.No one seemed bothered by the apparent contradiction of a golden statue in a poorly educated and developing country. But herein is the strange wonder of Bhutan: Being there, even with a guide whose job it is to show you an idealized version of the place, is like being immersed in a fairy tale. You want to believe it, too, even while knowing that gross national happiness was introduced as a government goal as recently as 2008.And why not? Until the 1960s, the country didn\u2019t have cities (even now the largest city, Thimphu, has fewer than 100,000 people), but was made up of villages, forested uplands and rural, sometimes seminomadic, settlements.What the country did have were dzongs. These majestic and usually whitewashed fortress-monasteries, typically built along rivers, today are home to both monks and government officials, and are considered to be the physical manifestation of Buddhist principles.The most beautiful one we saw was in Punakha, where, on a spit of land between the Pho Chu and Mo Chu Rivers, the looming 17th-century dzong was surrounded by blooming jacaranda trees. Constructed of compacted earth, stone and timber with fanciful trimming, the building gives way to courtyards, doors, a large stupa and fanciful statuary, painting and friezes.We also walked through farming villages and flooded fields to Chimi Lhakhang, a temple and monastery devoted to Drukpa Kunley, the \u201cdivine madman\u201d said to have introduced Buddhism to Bhutan in 1499, and famous for the mystical powers of his penis. Thus, as we ascended to the divine madman\u2019s temple, we were surrounded by shops selling phallus curios of varying sizes, including standing statues.Tiger\u2019s Nest is built into a cliff 3,000 feet above Paro and is more than 10,000 feet above sea level. And there before my eyes was every single member of our group of seniors, all of whom had arrived at the much-photographed wonder considerably before me.I was happy to arrive with all my parts, including my brain, in functioning order, and couldn\u2019t wait to return to our hotel so I could brag about my achievement on Facebook. So what if a bunch of oldsters and little kids had passed me, not to mention the locals who practically danced up the trail, some wearing little more on their feet than flip-flops? Even in flip-flops \u2014 or, in the case of some of the women, high heels \u2014 they seemed happy.Whether Bhutan really is the world\u2019s happiest nation is impossible for me to discern, despite my overall impression of a populace that at the very least smiles a lot. Evidence of happiness? Who knows?All I knew was that I, a woman of a certain age who\u2019s had her share of trials and challenges, was standing at the doorway to Tiger\u2019s Nest with a dizzying view of cliff, forest, valley and sky before me, and my true love of 30 years by my side.Jennifer Moses is the author of five books, including \u201cThe Book of Joshua,\u201d to be published this fall.Advertisement"}

A handful of photographers have pushed the technological limits of photography to explore those answers visually. Their results might be viewed as representative of a new kind of portrait photography, one that fuses mathematics and aesthetics to bridge the gap between human and machine vision. But Mr. Paglen said people deserve the ability to visualize how facial recognition systems understand the human face, especially as those systems become more ubiquitous. Arguably, they are becoming the single most important way in which people are identified.In his series \u201cIt Began As a Military Experiment,\u201d Mr. Paglen revisits a seminal moment in the development of facial recognition technology. The ten portraits of government employees in the work are drawn from a database compiled for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s Facial Recognition Technology program, or FERET. \u201cIt\u2019s more like fingerprinting than classical portraiture,\u201d Mr. Paglen said. Around the same time, Mr. Paglen used the eigenface method of facial recognition to depict dead political, artistic and scientific radicals for a series called \u201cEven the Dead Are Not Safe.\u201d Through that method, a system subtracts from someone\u2019s face the features it has in common with other faces in a database, storing the difference as a kind of personal bar code. Using that bar code, a system could easily recognize this same individual\u2019s face in other images. A human viewer, however, would likely find the blurry, ghostly visualizations Mr. Paglen has created of those bar codes to bear only a modest resemblance to the person depicted. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is not a photorealistic image of the face,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing an image that is the most probable statistical distribution of the values of the pixels in an image of that person.\u201d Dissatisfaction with a photographic portrait\u2019s ability to adequately grasp a subject\u2019s essence dates back to the genre\u2019s 19th century beginnings. Jan von Brevern, an art history professor at the Free University of Berlin, said that dissatisfaction was rooted in the \u201cgap between what was expected of the then-new medium of photography and what it actually delivered.\u201d \u201cAs a technical medium, it was considered to be \u2018exact\u2019\u2014 and indeed most early accounts of photography talk about this supposed accuracy,\u201d he said via email. \u201cBut actually, it produced a very specific kind of accuracy \u2014 one that wasn\u2019t necessarily in line with what sitters expected from portraits at that time.\u201dBy showing viewers in clear, visual terms how facial recognition systems read and understand people, Mr. Paglen, Mr. Chanarin and Mr. Broomberg want to help viewers question their perceptual accuracy. They ultimately want viewers to look beyond the systems\u2019 own veneer of anonymity and to see those systems for what they are: the products of human beings with their own distinct prejudices and preferences. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about technologies like this,\u201d Mr. Paglen said, \u201cthe main questions you should be asking at the beginning and the end of the day is \u2018Whose interests do these particular technologies serve and at whose expense do they come?\u2019\u201d Advertisement"}

I could get a leather interior and heated seats without a problem, but there was one glaring oversight: accessibility. As a wheelchair user, I\u2019ve found that no major automaker offers an accessible vehicle as standard. For this recent purchase, I had to pay more than $25,000 \u2014 on top of the car\u2019s list price \u2014 for features like hand controls, a ramp and locks for my chair.So after the floor drop, adding in the removable seats, and putting in a ramp, how much will that cost me?            Your entirelife savingsSir... glad wecould help!So after the floor drop, adding in the removable seats, and putting in a ramp, how much will that cost me?            Your entirelife savingsSir... glad wecould help!This month marked the 28th anniversary of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. For those of us who had endured exclusion because of a disability, that moment in 1990 felt like the arrival of a long-delayed justice. But despite the power of that landmark legislation, and the profound benefits it has delivered, remnants of exclusion remain stubbornly in place.Millions of people with disabilities or restricted mobility still struggle to find reliable and affordable transportation options that empower them to lead active, independent lives. Roughly four million Americans depend on wheelchairs and 11 million more use a cane, walker or crutches (estimates in a new unpublished study bring the numbers to 5.7 million and 15.7 million, respectively), but the ability to afford and drive a motor vehicle has  historically been out of reach for far too many.With the development of autonomous vehicles, a better day is in sight. Once the stuff of the imagination, this innovation is now a reality: Self-driving cars are here. Now, as the vehicle design and development continues, the entire industry has a rare opportunity to create a cutting-edge product that can be used by everyone, including wheelchair users, without the unfair and exorbitant cost and effort now required for customization. Automakers should seize that opportunity.So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this one.Uh... ramp?So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this oneUh... ramp?So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this oneUh... ramp?At best, these supposedly futuristic vehicles lack an appreciation for the need of those who rely on wheelchairs. At worst, they continue the auto industry\u2019s legacy of exclusion.This does not have to be the case. Since autonomous vehicles will not have traditional pedals, there will be no need to add hand controls for acceleration and braking. And manufacturing wheelchair-accessible autonomous vehicles should cost less than retrofitting conventional vehicles. Without the need for a human driver, the interior of these vehicles can be rethought to accommodate anyone, regardless of ability.Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!To meet the challenge and keep the promises enshrined in the Americans With Disabilities Act, automakers must make accessibility integral to the design of self-driving cars. The people who stand to benefit most from this innovation need to be heard.Automakers should sit down at the table with disability advocates, engineers, designers, transportation planners, transit agencies, policymakers and other stakeholders, so we can use our collective passions and brainpower to address this vital issue. We know that these companies have at their disposal the talent and the resources to change the future of mobility, and we challenge them to partner with people with disabilities, whose lives and livelihoods are at stake, and hold themselves accountable to the goals they have set.If automakers can shake off the exclusionary thinking of the past, and rise to meet this challenge, they can deliver on the true potential of self-driving cars \u2014 to benefit all people, not just those who can get around without a wheelchair.Advertisement"}

What to do?I am 16 and recently came out to my family as a lesbian. My parents, grandparents and aunt were totally supportive of me. The problem, surprisingly, came from my little brother, who is 15. He barely talks to me now, and when he does, he makes hurtful comments and calls me mean names. He also told all of his friends about me, even though I asked him not to tell anyone. Now I\u2019m getting teased and bullied by other kids. I\u2019m not sure how to handle this. Help!ANONYMOUSI\u2019m sorry for your ugly experience. But I\u2019m glad you wrote. I had a similar problem with my brother about a million years ago, and I handled it all wrong. Maybe together we can do better for you. I was too ashamed to tell my parents that I was being treated badly. But this bullying is not your fault. Ignoring it won\u2019t make it go away, and everyone needs a helping hand occasionally. Tell an adult about this now.And if that first adult fails to shut down the nasty behavior or makes excuses for your brother and his friends (and some may), then find another adult. Your story is an important reminder that the world can be tough for L.G.B.T.Q. kids, even in (mostly) supportive families. We grown-ups have an absolute responsibility to protect you. So, if the adults in your life let you down, please write again.Now, I want to ask something more of you that may be hard to deliver: Try to keep an open heart toward your brother. If he\u2019s like mine, he\u2019s simply not as brave as you are. Your coming out may have frightened him into thinking that his so-called friends would target him \u2014 so he turned on you, instead. His behavior is still lousy. But if you can manage not to write him off, he may redeem himself in time. Mine did.Three friends of mine were diagnosed with lung cancer recently. Invariably, when I mention this to others, who are not necessarily friends of the people who are ill, the first thing they say is: \u201cDoes she smoke?\u201d This infuriates me! My friends are gravely ill. I\u2019m looking for support or shared sadness \u2014 not to assess blame. How should I respond?ANONYMOUSPeople blurt, especially when they\u2019re anxious. And nothing produces anxiety like serious illness in people we sort of know. It can remind us of our own mortality (without kindling the empathy of real concern). This doesn\u2019t excuse your friends\u2019 tactlessness; it\u2019s just a possible explanation of how these scenes unfold.The next time someone responds to your bad news with the smoking question, say: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that whether she smokes wouldn\u2019t change how sad I am about her illness.\u201d That answer redirects the conversation to your feelings. With any luck, your pals will join you there. It\u2019s a tradition in my family that when women finish graduate school, our mom gives us a sewing machine. (The irony isn\u2019t lost on her; she just thinks that women need decent sewing machines as well as careers.) I earned my Ph.D. four years ago and received an expensive sewing machine that I\u2019d coveted. Problem is, it\u2019s still in the box. There\u2019s nothing around my house that needs sewing, and even if there were, I don\u2019t know how to sew. I\u2019d like to donate it, but I\u2019m sure my mom would find out, and she\u2019d be hurt. What do you recommend?EVAThere\u2019s a bigger irony than giving expensive sewing machines to women with graduate degrees, and that\u2019s giving them to people who don\u2019t know how to sew. There\u2019s no reason to feel guilty about giving it to someone who does.If you think your mother would notice the absence of the sewing machine, she has probably already picked up on the fact that it has sat in the box for four years. If you want to learn to sew, there are good tutorials on YouTube. Otherwise, donate the machine to an organization that works for women\u2019s rights. It honors the holistic spirit of your mother\u2019s gift, and you never have to learn what a bobbin is.I was widowed two years ago after being happily married to the love of my life for many years.

If you want to wear the ring as a symbol of your love for your late husband, keep wearing it or put it on a chain around your neck.

{"Headline": "Raising My Child in a Doomed World", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONESome would say the mistake was having our daughter in the first place. I cried two times when my daughter was born. First for joy, when after 27 hours of labor the little feral being we\u2019d made came yowling into the world, and the second for sorrow, holding the earth\u2019s newest human and looking out the window with her at the rows of cars in the hospital parking lot, the strip mall across the street, the box stores and drive-throughs and drainage ditches and asphalt and waste fields that had once been oak groves. A world of extinction and catastrophe, a world in which harmony with nature had long been foreclosed. My partner and I had, in our selfishness, doomed our daughter to life on a dystopian planet, and I could see no way to shield her from the future. Anyone who pays much attention to climate change knows the outlook is grim. It\u2019s not unreasonable to say that the challenge we face today is the greatest the human species has ever confronted. And anyone who pays much attention to politics can assume we\u2019re almost certainly going to botch it. To stop emitting waste carbon completely within the next five or 10 years, we would need to radically reorient almost all human economic and social production, a task that\u2019s scarcely imaginable, much less feasible. It would demand centralized control of key economic sectors, enormous state investment in carbon capture and sequestration and global coordination on a scale never before seen, at the very time when the political and economic structures that held the capitalist world order together under American leadership after World War II are breaking apart. The very idea of unified national political action toward a single goal seems farcical, and unified action on a global scale mere whimsy. And even if world leaders somehow got their act together, significant and dangerous levels of warming are still inevitable, baked into the system from all the carbon dioxide that has already been dumped. There\u2019s a time lag between carbon dioxide increase and subsequent effects, between the wind we sow and the whirlwind we reap. Our lives are lived in that gap. My daughter was born there.Barring a miracle, the next 20 years are going to see increasingly chaotic systemic transformation in global climate patterns, unpredictable biological adaptation and a wild spectrum of human political and economic responses, including scapegoating and war. After that, things will get worse. The middle and later decades of the 21st century \u2014 my daughter\u2019s adult life \u2014 promise a global catastrophe whose full implications any reasonable person must turn away from in horror. Society is not simply an aggregate of millions or billions of individual choices but a complex, recursive dynamic in which choices are made within institutions and ideologies that change over time as these choices feed back into the structures that frame what we consider possible. All the while, those structures are being disrupted and nudged and warped and shaken by countless internal and external drivers, including environmental factors such as global warming, material and social innovation, and the occasional widespread panic. Which is just to say that we are not free to choose how we live any more than we are free to break the laws of physics. We choose from possible options, not ex nihilo.To take Wynes and Nicholas\u2019s recommendations to heart would mean cutting oneself off from modern life. It would mean choosing a hermetic, isolated existence and giving up any deep connection to the future. Indeed, taking Wynes and Nicholas\u2019s argument seriously would mean acknowledging that the only truly moral response to global climate change is to commit suicide. There is simply no more effective way to shrink your carbon footprint. Once you\u2019re dead, you won\u2019t use any more electricity, you won\u2019t eat any more meat, you won\u2019t burn any more gasoline, and you certainly won\u2019t have any more children. If you really want to save the planet, you should die.Buckel\u2019s self-sacrifice takes the logic of personal choice to its ultimate end. But like most of us, I can\u2019t or won\u2019t make that choice. I\u2019m committed to life in this world, the world I live in, in all its stupidity and suffering, because this world is the one everyone else lives in too: my colleagues and students, my friends and family, my partner and daughter. This world is the only one in which my choices have meaning. And this world, doomed as it is, is the only one that offers joy.When my daughter was born I felt a love and connection I\u2019d never felt before: a surge of tenderness harrowing in its intensity. I knew that I would kill for her, die for her, sacrifice anything for her, and while those feelings have become more bearable since the first delirious days after her birth, they have not abated. And when I think of the future she\u2019s doomed to live out, the future we\u2019ve created, I\u2019m filled with rage and sorrow.Our children will not face the choices we face. They won\u2019t have the opportunities we now have for action. They\u2019ll confront a range of outcomes whose limits were determined by the choices we made. Yet while some degree of warming now appears inevitable, the range of possible outcomes over the next century is wide enough and the worst outcomes extreme enough that there is some narrow hope that revolutionary socio-economic transformation today might save billions of human lives and preserve global civilization as we know it in more or less recognizable form, or at least stave off human extinction. But the range of outcomes decreases every day, shifting month by month toward the more apocalyptic end of the spectrum, and waiting even five years may see the window for saving humanity shut.We live in the gap between the wind and the whirlwind, but taking that gap for a reprieve is a mistake. The catastrophe is now, even if it\u2019s almost impossible for most of us to see it. That very dissonance is perhaps the defining truth of our era, the key to its anxious, bipolar character. The real choice we all face is not what to buy, whether to fly or whether to have children but whether we are willing to commit to living ethically in a broken world, a world in which human beings are dependent for collective survival on a kind of ecological grace. There is no utopia, no Planet B, no salvation, no escape. We\u2019re all stuck here together. And living in that world, the only world there is, means giving up any claims to innocence or moral purity, since to live at all means to cause suffering. Living ethically means understanding that our actions have consequences, taking responsibility for how those consequences ripple out across the web of life in which each of us is irrevocably enmeshed and working every day to ease what suffering we can. Living ethically means limiting our desires, respecting the deep interdependence of all things in nature and honoring the fact that our existence on this planet is a gift that comes from nowhere and may be taken back at any time.

It\u2019s not, actually.\u201cSweat itself is just water with salt; sweat itself does not cause odor,\u201d Dr. Wattenberg said. \u201cEveryone has normal bacteria on their skin, and when the sweat and bacteria mix together, the bacteria cause the odor.\u201d(Our hands, feet, underarms and head have the most sweat glands. Our apocrine glands, which become active in puberty, cause bacterial growth; our eccrine glands produce sweat.) Yellowing of clothing is caused by apocrine glands.So why do some people smell worse than others?Some people have more bacteria than others, so their body odor may be more intense, Dr. Wattenberg said. The makeup of those bacteria is also different from person to person, she added, creating a range of smells.The amount you sweat is largely determined by your genetics, but the way you smell when you sweat can be influenced by genetics, medication and diet. Garlic, cabbage, meat, spicy foods and alcohol, for example, are all known to affect the type and intensity of the odor, Dr. Wattenberg said.What can I do to reduce sweating?Know the difference between antiperspirant (which controls the sweat) and deodorant (which masks the odor); apply not only in the morning but also before bedtime, and not only to your armpits but also to your feet. People with hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating, can be treated with Botox injections, laser procedures or prescription pills.A new Statue of Liberty museum is coming to Liberty Island.In the 1880s, Joseph Pulitzer raised money for the construction of the statue\u2019s pedestal by welcoming donations from New Yorkers in exchange for publishing their names in his newspaper, The New York World.

Gilead Sciences, the company that makes Truvada, maintains a monopoly on the drug domestically.

And this is a key difference between Houellebecq\u2019s characters and criminals like Rodger and Minassian: They recognize that violence will not change their situation. They are victims of generational trends that Houellebecq believes have plunged the West, particularly France, into incurable misery. Houellebecq\u2019s second (and best) book, \u201cThe Elementary Particles,\u201d reiterates his case against \u201csexual liberalism,\u201d while adding a host of new culprits, from New Age spirituality and women\u2019s magazines to social atomization and the decline of Christianity. \u201cIn the midst of the suicide of the West, it was clear they had no chance,\u201d he writes of the characters in the novel, in what could be a slogan for all his fiction.This sounds like a familiar kind of reactionary pessimism. But it is not quite accurate to call Houellebecq a reactionary, since he does not believe that it is possible to return to the sexual regimes of the past \u2014 in particular, arranged marriages \u2014 which he suggests did a better job of providing mates for undesirable men. In his novel \u201cSubmission,\u201d Houellebecq mischievously toys with the idea that such a return could be accomplished by a mass conversion to Islam. After all, a society in which women submit to men while men submit to the divine can be seen as Houellebecq\u2019s version of utopia. \u201cScrew autonomy,\u201d his narrator muses \u2014 though he uses a more vulgar word; autonomy is the root of alienation.In his more serious moods \u2014 as in \u201cThe Elementary Particles\u201d or \u201cThe Possibility of an Island\u201d \u2014 Houellebecq imagines a more radical solution to the problem of sexual inequality. Instead of going backward to an earlier stage of humanity, these books push forward to a posthuman future in which human beings are replaced by a species that has abolished sexual reproduction, and so is immune to the torments of desire and loneliness. This perfected species looks back on us as a \u201cvile, unhappy race, barely different from the apes.\u201d Houellebecq likes to cast his novels as the testimony of the present before the court of the future: To understand why we were so wretched, posterity will have to read him.And it is in this sense, as diagnosis and evidence, that Houellebecq\u2019s novels are now more urgent than ever. The portrayal of hatefulness is part of fiction\u2019s mandate to give a truthful account of the world; there are characters in Dostoyevsky as revolting as anyone in Houellebecq (perhaps more so, because Dostoyevsky is a better writer). Houellebecq is able to give such a convincing portrait of incel-thinking because at some level he seems to share its core assumption, representing sex as something that women owe men.

Or rather, they don\u2019t see anything to forgive. They simply notice that their man is under attack, and they rise to defend him. Welcome to political tribalism in America in 2018.That so many Republicans nonetheless shook them off is about as vivid an illustration as you\u2019ll find of the peculiar and chilling nature of partisanship today. But the picture is more complicated and fuzzier than that.For starters, when these polls were taken, it\u2019s entirely possible that what happened in Helsinki hadn\u2019t sunk in. Most people don\u2019t pay nearly as much attention to the Trump melodrama as those of us lashed to it do, and as we map the confluence of his misdeeds and their moods, we routinely discount the degree to which many of them are tuned out. They have more pleasant things to do than monitor this president. Laundry, for example. Hemorrhoid surgery.On top of which, the volume and velocity of his offenses turn them into a blur, just as the alarms that we in the media sound become white noise. This was true during his campaign, it\u2019s even truer of his presidency, and it\u2019s one of the most unjust, infuriating aspects of his endurance. His shamelessness is actually his saving grace.But not with everyone, and most notably not with some aghast Republicans who, thanks to Trump\u2019s takeover of the party, have strayed from it. There\u2019s a fascinating debate about how much the Republican loyalty to Trump in poll after poll is skewed by an exodus of former Republicans whom he scared off. They may not be showing up as party members in surveys, and Trump\u2019s high marks could be coming from a winnowed, favorable sample.But in a spirited exchange on Twitter with Nate Silver on Monday, Nyhan expressed doubts about the significance of that phenomenon to Trump\u2019s rosy Republican numbers, which have at least as much to do with another dynamic.Forget I\u2019m O.K., you\u2019re O.K. This is: I have problems, you\u2019re repulsive.The ethos extends to the assessment and defense of Trump\u2019s behavior. He may be an odd fit for a tribe that includes usually judgmental religious conservatives and once exuberant free traders, but he\u2019s now their chief, and whatever his flaws, his detractors\u2019 are worse. If they\u2019re agitated, they\u2019re ipso facto overreacting. Regardless, show no weakness. Admit no wrong.I doubt that Democrats, faced with a leader like Trump, would fall this pathetically into line. Bill Clinton and his presidency foreshadowed without remotely matching this. But the impulse to filter out dissenting views, the readiness to regard all political rifts as Manichaean and the quickness to hunker down are bigger than one corrupted party and one cracked president. They bless Trump as he blusters on from Helsinki. They\u2019ll curse all of us for some time to come.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dawning of Sperm Awareness", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMen are embracing sperm health, while society is recognizing that fertility isn\u2019t just about women.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dr. Paul Turek was on his way to speak to employees at a cryptocurrency investment firm one recent afternoon about a growing anxiety for the men in the office: what\u2019s going on with their sperm?Is there enough? Is the existing supply satisfactory? Are we men enough?\u201cThey\u2019re worried, right?\u201d Dr. Turek said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re O.K. with the worry.\u201dDifferent clusters of people \u2014 urologists, anthropologists, men\u2019s rights activists and start-up founders \u2014 became quietly concerned about the state of sperm. Quiet, probably, because Americans are more used to talking about women and fecundity. And also quiet because there has not been much research aimed at discovering if anything is actually happening.Still, the study has had social impact. Some men\u2019s rights communities are gathering around the idea that sperm counts are dropping because men are being feminized by society. There is now growing interest in testosterone replacement therapy, which some believe boosts sperm count. At the same time, smartphone-enabled at-home sperm tests are entering a heated market. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for this for years,\u201d Dr. Turek said. \u201cWe were hoping it existed.\u201d He hopes to turn sperm panic into a tool for preventive health. He sees a moment in which we can convince young men to take better care of their health overall to see their sperm quickly improve. \u201cAs we dive deep into sperm,\u201d he said, \u201cwe find that lifestyle matters most.\u201dThe study has become a foundational text for an online community that believes men are being emasculated by modern culture. In this manosphere \u2014 digital spaces created to discuss and sometimes profit from a counternarrative to feminism \u2014 commenters see this as scientific evidence that modern society is bad for men.Daryush Valizadeh, who runs The Return of Kings, a men\u2019s rights site, called the situation \u201ca biological crisis\u201d and one that women struggle to understand.\u201cTell your editor to stop being an idiot and reassign the article to a man,\u201d he wrote in a direct message on Twitter. \u201cThen get in touch with me.\u201dRollo Tomassi, another leader in the manosphere, who runs a site called The Rational Male, said the sperm count study last year was a watershed moment. To his mind, it showed definitively that modern society was weakening men. \u201cFor guys in the \u2019sphere, there\u2019s finally some sort of barometer to test their overall health from a historical perspective,\u201d Mr. Tomassi said.A common derogatory term in the manosphere is \u201csoy boy.\u201d\u201cEverybody thinks there\u2019s a soy link,\u201d he said.According to Mr. Tomassi, many men are starting to look into testosterone replacement therapy (T.R.T.).\u201cT.R.T. \u2014 it\u2019s a big deal in the manosphere right now,\u201d Mr. Tomassi said. \u201cThat\u2019s the real health news: There\u2019s this sudden revelation and guys are saying, \u2018Oh man, my sperm count is hella low, how can I fix this?\u2019 Then they realize their testosterone is lower than it should be.\u201dCompanies are popping up with at-home sperm tests, sperm health scores and sperm cryobanking services.Greg Sommer, a biodefense researcher at Sandia National Labs, was developing a small portable centrifuge for testing blood after a chemical attack when he realized it could have a consumer application. But he wasn\u2019t sure what.\u201cEarly in the company, we were like, \u2018What are we going to build?\u2019\u201d Mr. Sommer said. Well, what liquid would people want or need to swirl in a small centrifuge? \u201cSemen! It was a game changer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new approach to semen testing that we\u2019ve invented.\u201dSandstone Diagnostics, the company he and his colleagues founded in Pleasanton, Calif., has raised $8 million in funding to bring these mini-sperm-spinning centrifuges into homes across America. The device costs $200, runs on AA batteries and includes four tests. A two test refill pack is $49.99.\u201cThe way it works is, you collect your sample, you put a few drops in, and it spins,\u201d Mr. Sommer said. \u201cWe spin your semen sample at 7,500 r.p.m., and when it\u2019s done it gives you a reading of your sperm count.\u201dA competitor, the Yo Home Sperm Test, which was introduced in April 2017, bills itself as, essentially, a sperm microscope for smartphones. First, the guy collects his sample, then there is a 10 minute wait in the process. \u201cWe have a very nice sperm trivia challenge on the phone during that time,\u201d said Marcia Deutsch, the C.E.O. of Medical Electronic Systems, which created Yo. \u201cI wanted something to keep the guys occupied and not worrying.\u201dNext, using the pipette from the Yo kit (\u201cthe sperm does not touch your phone\u201d), the customer places a drop of the sample on a slide that slips into the \u201cYo Clip,\u201d which is basically a mini-microscope. Then the clip slides onto the smartphone, which uses its camera and light to take a high-resolution video. \u201cOurs tests moving sperm,\u201d said Ms. Deutsch, adding that some competitors \u201ctest just the number of sperm, and they could be dead.\u201d \u201cGuys are concerned about their fertility from the time they reach puberty,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of their basic biological role in life is to impregnate and they\u2019re not sure that\u2019s going to work, and there\u2019s fear of testing to find out.\u201dGabriel del Rio, a 35-year-old publicist in Los Angeles, and his wife were having trouble getting pregnant, but it took a year of fertility doctors for them to consider that he could be the cause.Mr. del Rio took the Yo test and found he had low motility (which can mean not enough of the overall sperm are swimming, or are not swimming quickly enough, or are not swimming in the right manner), which he said felt like a commentary on his masculinity.\u201cIt was just really embarrassing,\u201d he said.The solution turned out to be pretty simple (skip the Jacuzzi, buy loose underwear). Three weeks later, he took the test again and watched his now healthy sperm live-streamed onto his phone.\u201cIt went from like a graveyard to a rave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interactive movie. You can zoom in, zoom out, you can focus in on one of the sperm and see how far it\u2019s traveling.\u201dWithin two months, his wife was pregnant.And for men who do have good sperm, some start-ups are suggesting it should be frozen when one is young and healthy.It bills itself as \u201cthe Swiss private bank for your most valuable assets.\u201dSperm panic began in July 2017, with a headline-grabbing finding: Sperm counts in Western men had dropped 59 percent between 1973 and 2011. Researchers had analyzed 185 studies involving 42,935 men who had provided semen samples. A collaboration between researchers in the United States, Israel, Brazil, Denmark, and Spain, it opened a huge conversation about sperm and what might be happening to it.And then, in terms of research, not much happened.\u201cThe National Institutes of Health has been focused on males for so long, but reproduction was never considered a male problem,\u201d said Shanna Swan, one of the study\u2019s authors and a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\u2019s department of environmental medicine and public health. Of the research community in general, she said, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to know what they\u2019re going to find.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an area that makes people uncomfortable. It\u2019s about sex. It\u2019s about men,\u201d Dr. Swan said. \u201cYou can get a lot further if you have a nice finding on autism or obesity.\u201d\u201cThere is a general feeling of \u2018My God, there\u2019s too many people in the world already, who cares?\u2019\u201d Dr. Swan said. \u201cOne of our answers to \u2018who cares?\u2019 is to point out men with low semen quality die earlier than other men. They have more cardiovascular disease, they have more diabetes, they have more cancer.\u201d\u201cThis is a symbol of our inability to look at the future of mankind, and for what?\u201d Dr. Levine said. \u201cWe may be like the Titanic approaching an iceberg.\u201dDr. Levine said that it seems exposure to pesticides, obesity and smoking could contribute to low sperm count.\u201cOur culture affects our reproductive behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a World Cup game, the winning team testosterone levels go up and those who lose, testosterone levels go down.\u201dHe suggested I talk to Margaret Atwood, the author of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d a novel in which declining fecundity leads to authoritarianism and where sperm health is a taboo topic.\u201cWe tend to think when there are changes, they will be small changes, but from time to time there are shifts,\u201d he said. \u201cMargaret Atwood could imagine if such a shift happened.\u201d (Ms. Atwood did not return a request for comment.)Clinicians are split on how grave the situation is. Sperm tests are notoriously fickle, with counts swinging widely depending on behaviors like an evening in a hot tub or a weekend of heavy drinking.Doctors and researchers who are skeptical of the findings argue that infertility would already be rising if sperm counts were really dropping so precipitously.\u201cIf you had a decrease in sperm count in the 50 to 60 percent range, we would expect the proportion of men with severe male infertility to be going up astronomically,\u201d said Dr. Peter Schlegel, the chair of urology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see that.\u201dOthers say the study\u2019s science was sound and that it should be sounding an alarm.We, apparently, are not.\u201cThere\u2019s no funding. There\u2019s none,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Vij, who specializes in male infertility and andrology at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cWhen we try to develop a study, there just are not a lot of foundations out there looking to fund male fertility projects.\u201dFor men today, Dr. Levine advises something simple. \u201cTake a sperm check,\u201d he said.\u201cEvery 18-year-old at some point takes blood tests \u2014 why not your sperm?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a problem, you change your life accordingly. If you don\u2019t, maybe you freeze it.\u201dOne group of researchers \u2014 Janice L. Bailey, Jacquetta Trasler and Sarah Kimmins \u2014 is working on a study to look at environmental contaminants and sperm in Greenland and South Africa, as well as lifestyle factors like body mass index in Canada.\u201cOddly enough there\u2019s a lot of women in the field,\u201d Dr. Bailey said. \u201cWe sometimes call ourselves Gals for Guys.\u201d Dr. Bailey began studying human sperm after working on farm animal reproduction and noticing that almost all interventions focused on the female animals. \u201cWhenever there was a problem, they always blamed the female, and I said, \u2018For crying out loud, we have to do something to the male,\u2019\u201d she said.\u201cMen with low sperm counts don\u2019t live as long,\u201d Dr. Turek said. \u201cSomething wicked this way comes.\u201dAt his clinic, sports are on TV in the waiting room, and the walls are painted dark. The room Dr. Turek calls the \u201cmasturbatorium\u201d has a lava lamp, framed Playboy magazines and a photo of a vintage Maserati (his own).Dr. Turek thinks the decline in sperm count and quality may be related to relatively inactive, physically noncompetitive modern life, but to him that is probably just fine since he said fecundity seems stable.\u201cOur sperm look terrible compared to most animal species, land or marine. That\u2019s real alpha stuff. Ours looks like crap,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re married and you\u2019re a captive audience, demand is low, and maybe don\u2019t need it. Maybe that\u2019s what the drop is adjusting for. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionarily fine. Maybe the drop plateaus here.\u201d\u201cOver the last 100 years of industrialization, we\u2019re living better, longer, and we\u2019re certainly fatter,\u201d Dr. Turek said. \u201cWe\u2019re not cave men anymore.

{"Headline": "Unshaken by Abuse Scandal, Conservatives Are Sticking With Jim Jordan", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders and a platoon of former wrestlers have come out in support of Representative Jim Jordan as he deflects allegations that he turned a blind eye to sexual abuse as a wrestling coach at Ohio State, an extraordinary show of solidarity that indicates just how much power the conservative stalwart still wields.Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin emerged on Wednesday as the latest prominent House Republican to defend Mr. Jordan. The majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana \u2014 both strong candidates to replace the departing Mr. Ryan \u2014 also backed him this week.Their statements of support have centered on the same message: The Mr. Jordan they know always stands up for what is right.\u201cJim Jordan is a friend of mine,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe haven\u2019t always agreed with each other over the years. But I always have known Jim Jordan to be a man of honesty, and a man of integrity.\u201dMr. Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus who is in his sixth term, had also been floated as a possible successor to Mr. Ryan.Fifteen former Ohio State wrestlers and four former coaches have also come forward to support Mr. Jordan, providing statements that were sent to reporters by the conservative public relations firm Shirley & Banister Public Affairs.It is unclear who is paying for the firm\u2019s efforts \u2014 neither Mr. Jordan\u2019s office nor the firm responded to questions about the relationship. But it appears that his office is assisting the firm\u2019s lobbying on his behalf: Reached by phone, one of the wrestlers quoted in a news release said he had sent his statement of support directly to Mr. Jordan\u2019s office.Some of those messages of support cast doubt on whether Richard H. Strauss \u2014 the doctor at the heart of an Ohio State investigation involving 150 former athletes in 14 sports \u2014 had ever abused athletes. One wrestler denied the allegations entirely, saying that the accusers were \u201cseeing dollar signs.\u201d Others wrote that they had never witnessed or heard of Mr. Strauss acting inappropriately.But the firm also sent along a statement from one wrestler who wrote that in the locker room, there were \u201cdefinitely inappropriate things that in my opinion were pretty disgusting going on all around us,\u201d and another who wrote that he had been abused by Mr. Strauss and never told anyone but his father.Mr. Jordan, an assistant coach on the team in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, has maintained that he never saw or heard of inappropriate conduct occurring in the team\u2019s recreational facility, underscoring the shifting nature of some of the claims offered in his defense.The congressman wavered Friday during his first interview addressing the allegations, on Fox News, first commenting that \u201cconversations in a locker room are a lot different than someone coming up talking about abuse\u201d but later denying that he had ever heard about inappropriate activity.In the interview, Mr. Jordan also staked out what appears to have become a central part of his defense strategy, borrowed from another prominent Republican who has backed him, President Trump: attacking the news media, CNN in particular.Mr. Jordan complained last week on Fox News that CNN had aired interviews with one of his most vocal accusers, Mike DiSabato, a former Ohio State wrestler, saying that the network had \u201crushed\u201d to put someone on TV who has been involved in several lawsuits, including one against the university.In the past few days, Mr. Jordan has evoked his own reputation as a Trump ally and enemy of the so-called deep state \u2014 liberal bureaucrats embedded in the government \u2014 reminding his base of where his loyalty lies.\u201cI stood up to the speaker of the House from my home state, to the I.R.S. and to the F.B.I.,\u201d Mr. Jordan told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cTo think that I would not stand up for my athletes is ridiculous.\u201dMr. DiSabato said last week that he hoped the congressman would eventually start sending a different message to his supporters.\u201cFrankly, he needs to educate himself and his base that this is a serious issue, not just at O.S.U. but at universities all across the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue; this is a parent issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The rule demands physical and financial separation requirements between areas that use Title X funding and those that use nonfederal funds to provide abortion services \u2014 separate physical spaces, accounting records, health records, phone numbers and more \u2014 demands that seem intended to make it impossible for clinics to operate effectively. The proposed rule is clearly an attack on Planned Parenthood, which cares for over 40 percent of Title X patients. But it also violates a more fundamental tenet of medical care: that providers be able to counsel patients about their medical options free from external interference by politically motivated rules that aren\u2019t based on evidence. She also had a history of heart disease. She knew that, for her, a pregnancy presented significant health risks. At our clinic, I was able to counsel this patient on all of her options: These included continuing her pregnancy with dedicated care to address her cardiac risks, and abortion. After careful consideration, she opted for an abortion, and I was able to help her obtain one. Thanks to Title X funding, afterward, she was able to get a safe, effective method of contraception. The availability of these options, and the ability to obtain care, provided this woman with the autonomy to make informed decisions that were best for her. A ban that would have prevented me from counseling and helping her get the care that she needed would have forced me to violate my oath to do what is in the best medical interest of my patients. Title X has helped millions of patients obtain essential reproductive health care. Instead of trying to cripple Title X, the Trump administration would be wise to support it. To do otherwise undermines the practice of medicine and does a grave disservice to patients.

But if another person turns up, it becomes an illegal gathering and the police can make arrests.But after Russia\u2019s win over Spain, a soccer superpower, on Sunday, hundreds of Russians held a raucous, boozy, late-night party not just on any sidewalk, but the sidewalk outside Lubyanka, the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the K.G.B.One man beat out a rhythm on a drum. Soccer fans danced. \u201cDuring the championship, everything is allowed,\u201d said Sofia Mirnaya, 26, a Russian literature teacher who snapped pictures of her boyfriend holding a plastic cup of beer.Defying expectations, geopolitical tensions and a thousand grim years of Russian history, the government has turned the World Cup into an event that is, well, fun.Human rights critics fear the sports event will strengthen the hand of President Vladimir V. Putin, who has made good use of the tournament to smooth over an unpopular pension reform at home and burnish Russia\u2019s image abroad, and bolster his authoritarian, conservative and nationalist approach to governing.On Monday, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, compared the celebratory crowds to those seen in \u201chistorical footage of May 9, 1945,\u201d the date of Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender to the Soviet Union in World War II.President Trump, who will meet with Mr. Putin at a summit on July 16, praised the tournament, saying that Russia was \u201cdoing a fantastic job with the World Cup right now.\u201dExpectations were not high for the World Cup, which Russia won the right to host in 2010, long before annexing parts of Ukraine, intervening militarily in Syria, meddling in the United States presidential election and generally becoming a geopolitical pariah.In fact, holding a World Cup in Russia today seemed like a terrible idea to many. The British royal family, for example, boycotted the event, after the poisoning earlier this year, by nerve agent, of a former Russian double agent in Britain.Not only had Russia been nailed in a state-sponsored doping scandal at the last major international sports event it hosted, the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, its soccer team was widely regarded as a joke, both at home and abroad. As the home team it gained an automatic berth, even though it was ranked 70th in the world, the lowest among participating countries.But on Sunday night, Russia knocked off Spain in an almost unfathomable upset, and is now among the final eight teams. It was this victory that touched off the gigantic alcohol- and pride-fueled street party throughout central Moscow, including, improbably on the doorstep of Lubyanka.Pretty much everything has gone right. Stadium crowds have been enthusiastic and reports of violence and logistical incompetence few. Russia\u2019s soccer hooligans, usually a vicious group, are nowhere to be seen. (The F.S.B. reportedly held \u201cprophylactic discussions\u201d with their leaders beforehand, to discourage unrest.)All of this has played into Mr. Putin\u2019s hand at a pivotal time. With the tournament as a distraction, Russia\u2019s Parliament set to work drafting a law to lift the retirement age, an unpopular measure needed because of economic stagnation brought on by sanctions.The games have also sanded some hard edges off Russia\u2019s reputation as a troublemaker, even as nothing has changed in Ukraine or Syria. Yet rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have tried to use the spotlight of the World Cup to free political prisoners, so far without luck.\u201cAs for \u2018sports is outside of politics,\u2019 forget about it,\u201d Dmitri Dubrovski, an historian at the Center for Independent Social Research in St. Petersburg, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is a success of the Putin regime, regardless of our attitude toward it. The regime will appropriate it regardless, in one way or another.\u201dSoccer success has Russians thinking differently about themselves, even if some spectators around the world, watching the party, reconsider their views on Russia. A capital known for its cold, its money and its raw power is uncoiling and, for a few weeks, relaxing.\u201cWe have a repressive government, but not now, because we\u2019re having a party,\u201d explained Aleksandr Yerofeyev, one of those celebrating Sunday evening.\u201cWhen it comes to politics, it\u2019s banned,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to soccer, it\u2019s allowed.\u201dAt least tens of thousands of people took to the streets Sunday evening. A crowd hoisted a huge stuffed teddy bear in the air. Ballerinas at the Bolshoi huddled backstage to watch the game.Sofia Shevelyeva, 26, a sales manager, watched the upset over Spain at Beer Mood, a bar overlooking Chisty Prudy park, a leafy spot in the city center whose tranquillity today belies its past: It was a site Ivan the Terrible had set aside for crowds to watch mass executions. Now, soccer was on offer.Russians, even those not pleased to see their country militarily menacing small neighbors in Eastern Europe, found a reason to be proud of their team toppling Spain. Russians, to be sure, also erupted with national pride after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, \u201cbut not me or my friends,\u201d Ms. Shevelyeva said.She disapproved of the takeover, she said. Pride in the soccer team is different. \u201cThey are not men with weapons, but men with skill and luck. And we love them.\u201dRussia\u2019s soccer heroes wrapped up the match in a 1-1 tie, went through 30 minutes of nerve-destroying extra time and won when the Russian goalkeeper, Igor V. Akinfeev, saved a penalty kick with an acrobatic leap, knocking the ball out with his foot.In what analysts were calling a miscalculation, Mr. Putin sent his prime minister, Dmitry A. Medvedev, to preside at Luzhniki Stadium over the expected loss to Spain. Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, later clarified that Mr. Putin had watched the entire game on television.As the evening wore on, a layer of clouds turned pink with the deepening sunset and people spilled out onto the sidewalks.Amid a crackdown on domestic political dissent under Mr. Putin, and after street protests toppled governments in other former Soviet states, laws strictly prohibit public gatherings, and large get-togethers became rare other than for sanctioned events, like Victory Day parades.\u201cYessss!\u201d he wrote after the Russian win. \u201cNeed to organize a series of protests demanding that Akinfeev be made a Hero of Russia.\u201dOutside Lubyanka, soccer fans wobbled with drinks in hand. One rowdy group taunted the building, yelling \u201cK.G.B.! K.G.B.!\u201d while a few policemen looked on passively.Mostly, it was just an apolitical, boozy party taking place under the metal bas-relief of Yuri V. Andropov, a former secret police chief and Communist Party general secretary, which is fixed to the building\u2019s chunky stone fa\u00e7ade. Russians fear the building, joking darkly that the nine-story edifice is the highest in Moscow: From the windows inside you can see Siberia. On Sunday, a hundred yards away, around a corner, a man fueled the fun with beer sold from the trunk of an illegally parked sedan.Pavel Rovinsky, 25, an off-duty police officer who joined the party at Lubyanka, beer in hand, said the soccer thaw would not last. \u201cWhen the championship is over, everything will return to its place,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was prohibited will be prohibited again.\u201dLincoln Pigman and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Starts Paying a Price for Scandals", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network.But the Silicon Valley company\u2019s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business \u2014 and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months.In response, Facebook\u2019s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebook\u2019s history.\u201cThis is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform.Facebook reported a 42 percent increase in revenue and a 31 percent jump in profits for its second quarter, compared with a year earlier. But the revenue of $13.2 billion missed Wall Street estimates of $13.4 billion. In addition, Facebook said its daily active users rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 1.47 billion, compared with 13 percent growth in the previous quarter.On a conference call to discuss earnings, Mr. Zuckerberg said profits would most likely take a further hit because the company planned to spend more on security. And the chief financial officer, David Wehner, said revenue growth would substantially decline for the rest of the year, partly because Facebook planned to give people more options with their privacy settings, including letting them limit the kinds of ads they saw.Facebook has also said it wanted to hire 20,000 people by the end of 2018 to help review content posted on the site and to work on its security team. The company\u2019s head count has already risen 47 percent since last year, to 30,275.\u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to invest heavily in security and privacy because we have a responsibility to keep people safe,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on the call.Other factors have also hurt Facebook\u2019s number of users, Mr. Zuckerberg said, including tough European rules that went into effect in May to protect people\u2019s online data. The legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, cost Facebook about one million users in Europe, he said.Facebook is now gearing up to face one of its biggest tests to date: ensuring that no one meddles in the 2018 midterm elections through the social network.Mr. Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that he was hopeful Facebook would be able to limit disinformation and fake accounts, and that the company was able to do so in elections this year in France, Mexico and Germany.\u201cWe are much more confident that we are going to get this right in the elections in 2018,\u201d he said, adding that the company had begun proactively looking for fake accounts.Facebook has other bright spots. Even with its loss of market value after reporting its financial results, it may not lose its spot as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States. The company held a nearly $140 billion lead on Berkshire Hathaway, the sixth largest, at the end of trading on Wednesday. And through Wednesday\u2019s market close, Facebook\u2019s stock had gained 43 percent from its lows in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March.Still, the challenge will be how to stem further losses. Given all the questions about the misuse of the platform, \u201cto explain that there are a couple million people who chose not to continue using Facebook is unsurprising,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.Stephen Grocer and Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Smart TVs in Millions of U.S. Homes Track More Than What\u2019s On Tonight", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe growing concern over online data and user privacy has been focused on tech giants like Facebook and devices like smartphones. But people\u2019s data is also increasingly being vacuumed right out of their living rooms via their televisions, sometimes without their knowledge.In recent years, data companies have harnessed new technology to immediately identify what people are watching on internet-connected TVs, then using that information to send targeted advertisements to other devices in their homes. Marketers, forever hungry to get their products in front of the people most likely to buy them, have eagerly embraced such practices. But the companies watching what people watch have also faced scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates over how transparent they are being with users.Samba TV is one of the bigger companies that track viewer information to make personalized show recommendations. The company said it collected viewing data from 13.5 million smart TVs in the United States, and it has raised $40 million in venture funding from investors including Time Warner, the cable operator Liberty Global and the billionaire Mark Cuban.Once enabled, Samba TV can track nearly everything that appears on the TV on a second-by-second basis, essentially reading pixels to identify network shows and ads, as well as programs on HBO and even video games played on the TV. Samba TV has even offered advertisers the ability to base their targeting on whether people watch conservative or liberal media outlets and which party\u2019s presidential debate they watched.The big draw for advertisers \u2014 which have included Citi and JetBlue in the past, and now Expedia \u2014 is that Samba TV can also identify other devices in the home that share the TV\u2019s internet connection.Samba TV, which says it has adhered to privacy guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, does not directly sell its data. Instead, advertisers can pay the company to direct ads to other gadgets in a home after their TV commercials play, or one from a rival airs. Advertisers can also add to their websites a tag from Samba TV that allows them to determine if people visit after watching one of their commercials.If it sounds a lot like the internet \u2014 a company with little name recognition tracking your behavior, then slicing and dicing it to sell ads \u2014 that\u2019s the point. But consumers do not typically expect the so-called idiot box to be a savant.\u201cIt\u2019s still not intuitive that the box maker or the software embedded by the box maker is going to be doing this,\u201d said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union and a former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cI\u2019d like to see companies do a better job of making that clear and explaining the value proposition to consumers.\u201dAbout 45 percent of TV households in the United States had at least one smart TV at the end of 2017, IHS Markit data showed. Samba TV, which is based in San Francisco and has about 250 employees, competes against several companies, including Inscape, the data arm of the consumer electronics maker Vizio, and a start-up called Alphonso.Samba TV\u2019s language is clear, said Bill Daddi, a spokesman. \u201cEach version has clearly identified that we use technology to recognize what\u2019s onscreen, to create benefit for the consumer as well as Samba, its partners and advertisers,\u201d he added.Still, David Kitchen, a software engineer in London, said he was startled to learn how Samba TV worked after encountering its opt-in screen during a software update on his Sony Bravia set.Enabling the service meant that consumers agreed to Samba TV\u2019s terms of service and privacy policy, the opt-in screen said. But consumers couldn\u2019t read those unless they went online or clicked through to another screen on the TV. The privacy policy, which provided more details about the information collected through the software, was more than 4,000 words, and the terms exceeded 6,500 words.\u201cThe thing that really struck me was this seems like quite an enormous ask for what seems like a silly, trivial feature,\u201d Mr. Kitchen said. \u201cYou appear to opt into a discovery-recommendation service, but what you\u2019re really opting into is pervasive monitoring on your TV.\u201dAshwin Navin, Samba TV\u2019s chief executive, said that the company\u2019s use of data for advertising is made clear through the reference to \u201cspecial offers,\u201d and that the opt-in language \u201cis meant to be as simple as it possibly can be.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty upfront about the fact that this is what the software does \u2014 it reads what\u2019s on the screen to drive recommendations and special offers,\u201d Mr. Navin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken an abundance of caution to put consumers in control of the data and give them disclosure on what we use the data for.\u201dJeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said few people review the fine print in their zeal to set up new televisions. He said the notice should also describe Samba TV\u2019s \u201cdevice map,\u201d which matches TV content to mobile gadgets, according to a document on its website, and can help the company track users \u201cin their office, in line at the food truck and on the road as they travel.\u201dMr. Brookman of the Consumers Union, who reviewed the opt-in screen, said the trade-off was not clear for consumers. \u201cMaybe the interactive features are so fantastic that they don\u2019t mind that the company\u2019s logging all the stuff that they\u2019re watching, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s evident from this,\u201d he said.The Times is among the websites that allow advertisers to use data from Samba to track if people who see their ads visit their websites, but a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said that the company did that \u201csimply as a matter of convenience for our clients\u201d and that it was not an endorsement of Samba TV\u2019s technology.Companies like Samba TV are also a boon for TV makers, whose profit margins from selling sets can be slim. Samba TV essentially pays companies like Sony to include its software. Samba TV said \u201cour business model does subsidize a small piece of the television hardware,\u201d though it declined to provide further details.Smart TV companies aren\u2019t subject to the stricter rules and regulations regarding viewing data that have traditionally applied to cable companies, helping fuel \u201cthis rise of weird ways to figure out what someone\u2019s watching,\u201d said Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University and a former technology adviser at the Federal Communications Commission.The smart TV companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Mayer said, meaning that \u201cas long as you\u2019re truthful to consumers, even if you make it really hard to exercise choices or don\u2019t offer choices at all, you probably don\u2019t have much of a legal issue.\u201dMr. Daddi said the trade commission had held up Samba TV as \u201can exemplary model of data privacy and opt-in policies,\u201d pointing to its participation in a smart TV workshop the agency held in late 2016. A commission spokeswoman said that it invited a diverse array of panelists to events and that \u201can invitation to participate in an F.T.C. event does not convey an endorsement of that company or organization.\u201d She added that the agency does not \u201cendorse or bless companies\u2019 practices.\u201dMr. Daddi added: \u201cWe have millions of viewers who have explicitly opted into our service and have continued to use it for years. So it is a fair argument to make that far more consumers are satisfied with Samba than surprised by it.\u201dSome worry, more broadly, about the TV industry\u2019s increasing ability to use and share information about what people are watching with the internet ad ecosystem.\"I think people have rebelled to the online targeted ad experience,\u201d Mr. Brookman said, \u201cand I think they wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect that from their TV.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the investors that contributed venture funding to Samba TV. It was Time Warner, not Time Warner Cable.An earlier version of this article, relying on marketing materials from Samba TV and comments by its chief executive, said Samba TV could track programs viewers were watching on Netflix. After publication, Netflix said it had agreements with smart TV manufacturers that precluded third-party tracking like that done by Samba TV. Samba TV did not respond to repeated requests for comment about Netflix.Kevin Roose contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Forget a Fast Car. Creativity Is the New Midlife Crisis Cure.", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisWho needs a Ferrari when you can pick up a paintbrush?Ms. Holson is a reporter for The Times.Remember those days? When a midlife crisis meant swapping your hatchback for a sports car, preferably red, or taking up a boozy, illicit affair? More, of course, does not mean more things or the outward trappings of youth. Instead, it\u2019s a look inward, to passions and possibilities long thought to have passed.Creativity helped Ashley Henry, 49, regain an identity tucked away since college. Two years ago, she held a concert in Portland, Ore., to raise money for a mental health organization. \u201cIf you asked my friends in high school, they\u2019d tell you I was \u2018the singer,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy political friends and newer friends didn\u2019t know this.\u201dMs. Henry had thrown herself into a career in nonprofit work and politics. When she reached her mid-40s, though, she longed to sing again. So in 2016, when she learned that her favorite jazz club, Jimmy Mak\u2019s, was closing, she decided to get onstage before it was shuttered for good. \u201cThat was the universe saying, \u2018You have to get this done,\u2019\u201d Ms. Henry said.She rented the club and hired a singing coach. That night she raised $7,000. Her friends cheered her moxie. So much so that a few of them told her they were inspired to pursue creative projects of their own.The challenge is to bring the experience into everyday life. Most people won\u2019t leave their jobs (even if they fantasize about it) and take up painting in Provence. There are bills to pay, after all, and rookie oil paintings rarely cover the mortgage. Then, of course, there is ego. \u201cFear of failure is big if you\u2019re an expert in your field,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201cThey question, \u2018Why am I going to do something new that I\u2019m terrible at?\u2019 There is the psyche that says, \u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d What people want, Mr. Burnett said, is permission.In 2016, Elana Frankel left her job as the creative director of One Kings Lane, a luxury furniture and home d\u00e9cor company. She took photographs, but wanted something more. \u201cWhen I was a kid I absolutely loved painting,\u201d she said. So she bought some acrylics and began to paint, using her photographs as inspiration.Buying more stuff wouldn\u2019t have satiated her curiosity. \u201cFor so many people, when they hit their 40s, probably the most important thing is the inner desire to better themselves,\u201d Ms. Frankel, who is in her 40s, said. \u201cI stopped to focus on my needs. And it does not feel like a selfish pursuit.\u201d Now she paints with her two children.\u201cIt feels like a communal activity,\u201d she said.Ms. Cameron, 70, said she created her 2016 book as a tool kit for her middle-aged friends. \u201cPeople are looking for structure,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need to have encouragement.\u201dI know this from my own experience. Four years ago, I started a group with some friends that became our creativity salon. It was a conscious endeavor to break free from established routines and the rigors of our jobs. We began by reading \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way\u201d and agreed to talk every Sunday by telephone to foster camaraderie and accountability. In one exercise, I asked everyone to paint or draw a scene from a photograph. One member pieced together paper collage trees, which she shared with us. In another task, the group was instructed to hand-color a postcard and mail it to a friend. I even suggested we buy red lipstick. Why? It was an exercise in understanding color.Mr. Weinstein started teaching workshops to pairs of participants. He advertises on social media; the cost for a workshop is $150 per couple. Ashley Henry, the singer who held a charity concert at Jimmy Mak\u2019s, took his workshop.He had a client who started playing the guitar. Doing so made the man feel youthful, and it tapped different parts of his brain. His talent was validated, too.  \u201cI am not hearing people say, \u2018I need to buy one more thing,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weinstein said.Advertisement"}

In some cases, poor dam construction, deforestation and a lack of emergency preparations have worsened the effects.In Myanmar, heavy flooding in eight states has killed at least 10 people since Friday and prompted the evacuation of more than 50,000, officials said.Much of the water from the broken dam has flowed south into Cambodia, flooding homes and farmland there and forcing the evacuation of thousands more.But the all-out effort to save the boys has been rare among the region\u2019s governments. Some flood victims in neighboring countries question why their own governments do not operate in the same spirit.In Myanmar, the heaviest flooding has hit the states of Mon and Kayin, especially along the Thanlwin River, which flows from the Tibetan Plateau through the city of Mawlamyine and into the Andaman Sea. There has also been heavy flooding to the north along the smaller Belin River.The water has engulfed farms, washed out roads and flooded homes. Rescuers go by boat to pull residents from their rooftops. Boats zip down roadways and refuel at gas stations meant for motor vehicles.Monks, maintaining their tradition of collecting alms every morning, wade through chest-deep water with their begging bowls.Environmentalists say that excessive logging and consequent deforestation have made the effects of the flooding much more severe in recent years.\u201cThis time, flooding in our state is the worst,\u201d said Saw Tha Phoe, a coordinator in the state of Mon for the environmental group Karen River Watch. \u201cIt is because of deforestation and we cannot deny it.\u201dMyanmar\u2019s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, Win Myat Aye, said the floods this year had not reached the level of a national emergency.But he acknowledged that the government had been slow in preparing for the rains and rescuing people from flooding.He said the government had been sluggish in its response partly because it anticipated flooding along the Belin River but not the Thanlwin, formerly known as the Salween.He added that his agency did not have enough people to handle a disaster and was relying on local governments to provide assistance.Three of those who died were soldiers attempting to rescue people, he said.The minister blamed heavy monsoon rains and climate change for the recent flooding.\u201cI just want to alert the people that climate is changing all over the world and we all have to be careful about it,\u201d he said.Mr. Kyaw Swa said the government issued its warning by posting it on Facebook the day after the flood had arrived.\u201cThe announcement said residents living near rivers and in low-lying areas should immediately leave their homes, as the water had exceeded the danger level,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our house was already flooded.\u201dSaw Nang reported from Mandalay, Myanmar, and Richard C.

{"Headline": "Does Canada Need Better Gun Control?", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter last week\u2019s mass shooting, the country needs to consider tougher rules on handguns.Mr. Lee is an associate professor of sociology and faculty member at the Center for the Study of the United States at the University of Toronto.However, several gun attacks here this summer have made me, and many Torontonians, question that sense of exceptionalism. Mass shootings are no longer a uniquely American problem.A friend on Facebook posted that she does not feel safe in Toronto anymore. I\u2019ve caught myself ruminating in a similar vein; it\u2019s hard not to, with the news dominated by multiple shootings, a mass van attack and a serial killer investigation. Still, the immediacy of the violence is changing the political conversation in the city. The shooting this past week has prompted some politicians \u2014 including Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory \u2014 to reflect on whether handguns ought to be banned.And that\u2019s a good thing \u2014 because even if Canadian cities are safer than their equivalents in the United States, this country still has a gun problem. The national statistical agency reports that 62 percent of firearm-related homicides in Canada are committed with handguns. This flies in the face of most policy discussions after a mass shooting, which are typically associated with semiautomatic weapons like the AR-15. Even though Canada requires gun buyers to get a license and take a safety training course, guns are still readily available, many of the same guns that you can buy in the United States. There are a few restrictions on magazine sizes and many concealable pistols are prohibited. But many other guns are as available here as they are south of the border.This latest shooting also forces us to reflect on mental illness and the safety nets that exist for troubled young people. Even though Canada has a universal health care system, one that Canadians often hold in high esteem, there are still serious gaps in coverage. Long-term mental health care is often not covered by provincial health care. Many who need long-term support lack access to it (though to be clear, the man identified as the assailant in last week\u2019s shooting was under a professional\u2019s care for depression and psychosis).People are still processing their fear and anger over this year\u2019s violence. My concern is that we will fall back into the comforting stories about how safe Canada is; my hope is that instead, this time, we open the difficult conversation about whether civilians ought to own handguns, and what it would take to provide humane care for those suffering from mental illness.

Daniel Caro, 12, was at the front.He rattled off the day\u2019s planned activities: \u201cMarco Polo, shark attack, \u2018get the goggles,\u2019\u201d then maybe a hot dog or chicken nuggets.After entering, he began scanning the deck to see which of his friends would show today, and the pool came to life around him.Grandmothers rubbed down children with sunscreen. The first cannonballs broke the pool\u2019s placid surface. A young dad with a large back tattoo gently played with kids in the water.Here in Queens, and at city pools across the boroughs, it\u2019s a mix of ages, races, ethnicities, body shapes and even bathing suit styles.\u201cIt was a big problem and I was nervous,\u201d said Ms. Emam, on the left. \u201cBut here everyone has been really good, thank God. I love this city.\u201dAnd despite what you may think, it\u2019s not only families and kids who go.Mike DiJune, 28, a personal trainer, met his girlfriend, Sky Spallone, 27, a doulah and yoga instructor, at the Hamilton Fish Pool on the Lower East Side, after he rode a bicycle from Chelsea.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to come hot off a Citi Bike and jump right in,\u201d he said. (After a shower, he added.)\u201cIt\u2019s so cold it hurts your bones,\u201d she said.On our visits across the city, we discovered that not all pools, or their amenities, are the same. But the vibe is generally similar: laid-back.At the Surf Cafe at Astoria\u2019s pool, Nedy Perez served up orders of wings, fries and burgers to the estimated 2,500 people who use the pool each day.\u201cWe treat everyone like they\u2019re on vacation because not everyone can afford to go to the Mediterranean,\u201d she said. \u201cHere at the pool, everyone is happy.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Saturday Sunday (But of course you knew that already, right?)In the spirit of getting to know our foreign flora and fauna, we spoke with a few invasive species experts about the most annoying pests in the city.An earlier version of this article misstated the species of insect that killed trees in Woodlawn Cemetery.

To take these shadowy conversations out into the open and demystify them.\u201d The Kaleidoscope is one of several social communities and companies that have emerged to help adults talk openly about sex and sexuality, with the explicit goal of teaching them everything they didn\u2019t learn in health class or from their parents. Last summer, Bryony Cole, who produces a podcast and event series called the Future of Sex, held a \u201csextech\u201d hackathon, the first of a quarterly series. The winning idea was an app that uses an interactive \u201cspin the bottle\u201d feature to make the sex talk less embarrassing for families. \u201cPeople relate to hearing others be honest and vulnerable,\u201d said Rob Perkins, 40, a founder of the company, which has previously produced crowdsourced educational videos on female sexual pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s more credible than hearing an expert.\u201d Cycles & Sex focuses on Instagram. Ms. Spivak, 30, and another founder, Lauren Bille, 35, frequently post questions to their nearly 32,000 followers, such as \u201cWhat do you visualize to help you orgasm?\u201d and \u201cWhat are your tips for getting an IUD inserted or removed?\u201dMs. Bille said she was raised by a nurse in a progressive environment. Even so, she felt that conversations about sex were implicitly taboo. And this persisted into adulthood. \u201cAnytime I thought of going into a sex shop or to a sex class, it was a fringe experience,\u201d she said. In 2017, 900 attended the company\u2019s New York City conference, where panels and workshops covered topics including the basics of childbirth, oral sex techniques and bondage 101. At a conference in Los Angeles last November, four cervical exam sessions (participants were given mirrors) were packed.The event started out as a small group discussion in a friend\u2019s New York apartment. At the time Mr. Weiss was getting over a breakup, and thought that hearing other people\u2019s experiences in sex and love might help him. The Touchpoint vibe is part Quaker meeting, part new-age retreat. At one meeting not long ago, 112 people lounged on floor cushions, around a table of flickering candles, sipping coconut water. About 15 attendees spoke during the nearly three-hour session. The evening\u2019s topic was ostensibly about \u201cdefining relationships,\u201d and their stories included a middle-aged woman\u2019s sexual awakening, dating with an S.T.I., and revealing your polyamorous lifestyle to family and friends.  Ingram Drye, 30, an art director at Ralph Lauren, said he was struck by the diversity and relatability of the stories. \u201cL.G.B.T.Q. people go through the same relationship struggles as straight communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together, learning from each other.\u201d Another frequent Touchpoint attendee, Hana Ayoub, 37, was raised in a conservative Christian Arab-American home.

I\u2019m Dai Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco. It\u2019s my turn to write this newsletter, and, as luck would have it, my moment in the sun comes on a light summer news week.The great thing about the summer is that it\u2019s barbecue season. That means lots of casual conversations where I break free from my technology and news bubble and gauge whether the things we write about are reaching a broader audience.This year, more than I can remember in the recent past, it\u2019s clear how ingrained the tech industry has become in our lives and how people are constantly discussing the ripple effects of its influence and money. Tech was central to discussions I had about local and national politics, real estate prices and how to raise children. The company that most people wanted to talk about? Facebook.Last weekend, while I was in Seattle, Facebook was Topic A with a group of non-tech folks. One told me that she had deleted her Facebook account a month ago. I asked if it was because she was upset about the role Facebook played in the 2016 presidential election. It wasn\u2019t really that, she said. Facebook made her feel bad about herself. She found herself being a person she didn\u2019t like when she was scrolling the News Feed, and she decided that she could live without it. She remains on Instagram because she enjoys it.In my limited sample size, the complaints about Facebook were less about misinformation on the platform or the proliferation of ads. They seemed more basic than that: relatives writing distasteful posts about politics or acquaintances oversharing about their personal lives. For the first time, I noticed people were making excuses as to why they were even on Facebook anymore as though it was an embarrassing vice.I\u2019m heading out on vacation soon with the goal of detoxing a little from my tech use. But before I go, I have to order a few last-minute items on Amazon, download kid-friendly shows from Netflix for my iPad, arrange a few social outings with friends on Facebook Messenger and make sure my privacy settings are in order because my family is definitely going to tag me on Facebook in vacation photos.

{"Headline": "Baby Snake Fossil Found Trapped in Amber Offers Clues on Evolution", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobites\u201cThe fossil is the first baby snake and the oldest baby snake to yet be found,\u201d said Dr. Xing. Before this finding, paleontologists had not uncovered a fossilized baby snake even in the rock fossil record, said Dr. Caldwell.Only the bottom half of the baby snake\u2019s sinuous body was preserved in the amber, which is fossilized tree resin. Because the skull was missing, the people who found the fossil thought the tiny creature inside was either a centipede or millipede. But closer inspection revealed its bones. And through the use of a micro-CT scanner and a synchrotron, scientists confirmed that the specimen was a baby snake, a new species they named Xiaophis myanmarensis. It resembles existing species of pipe and grass snakes. The researchers determined the fossilized snake was either an embryo or a newborn based on the development of its spinal cord. Like modern baby snakes, the preserved baby had tiny vertebral bones but a large spinal cord tube, according to Dr. Caldwell. That\u2019s a telltale sign that the snake was still developing, as well as the first direct evidence that the developmental processes seen in a baby snake\u2019s spine were established at least about 100 million years ago and have remained relatively unchanged since then. The researchers could not say whether or not the shed snakeskin belonged to the same species as the baby snake. Scientists aren\u2019t sure where snakes originated from and how they spread throughout the world. The new specimens offer clues for one potential pathway for their prehistoric movement around the planet, said Dr. McKellar. Some 100 million years ago when the snakes became trapped in tree resin, Myanmar was part of a migrating island between present-day Asia and Australia. That island eventually floated to the coast of Laurasia, a supercontinent that then included present-day Europe and Asia. \u201cThese snakes would have been along for the ride,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry.The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions?Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences.This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices.One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights \u2014 not unlike splitting AT&T into eight \u201cBaby Bells\u201d nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission\u2019s verdict on Microsoft\u2019s dominant market position in the 2000s.But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants.In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies \u2014 such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence \u2014 to upend existing industries.\u201cOld economy\u201d companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants.Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase.

Aug. 19 to Aug. 22Distinct person, female hunter, instructed by the moon: These are terms used by people from Utah to Alaska to describe Two Spirits, a term that refers to gender non-conforming Native Americans. Steven Barrios, a.k.a Auntie Steven to younger members of the Blackfeet nation, is an organizer of what he says is the oldest consecutive Two Spirit Gathering in North America, held for 22 years.The year\u2019s gathering on the banks of Flathead Lake will feature ceremonies for healing and cleansing. During one, smoke from a circulating pipe is believed to carry prayers up to a creator; during another, a rite holder surrounded by a circle of participants pours water on hot rocks. The gathering is also is home to a more contemporary ritual: the drag show. In 2015 Rocky Peterson, now 31, known as Akasha Makai in drag, snagged the gathering\u2019s Miss Two Spirit Montana title with a rendition of \u201cDiamonds\u201d by Rihanna. For Mr. Peterson, the best way to pass on history to younger generations is by modernizing it. Recently, Akasha performed a Blackfeet dance at the Haskell Indian Nations University Two Spirit powwow. \u201cShe\u2019s classy, native and fabulous,\u201d Mr. Peterson said of Akasha. \u201cWe\u2019re showing people it\u2019s O.K. to be fabulous.\u201d\u201cTwo Spirit is not an identity or orientation like \u2018gay\u2019 or \u2018transgender,\u2019\u201d said David Herrera, an organizer of the gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s a role tied to this specific cultural history.\u201d Aug. 31 to Sept. 1Last summer, after a wave of sexual assaults at Swedish music festivals, the comedian Emma Knyckare\u2019s Twitter feed was a cacophony. Some commentators blamed the attacks on refugees. Others considered alcohol the culprit. Ms. Knyckare, 31, who jokes about breast-feeding and infant wounds in her stand-up, decided to tweet a provocation of her own: \u201cWhat do you think about doing an awesome festival together where only non-men are welcome until all men learned how to behave?\u201d Ms. Knyckare, along with the dozens of would-be volunteers who, to her shock, emailed her in the wake of the tweet, soon specified that the festival would exclude only cisgender men, whereas everyone else would be welcome. The inaugural Statement Festival will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden, over the last weekend of August. Performers will include the rappers Joy M\u2019Batha and Cleo, the singer-songwriter Frida Hyvonen and the electronic producer Tami T. It has taken plenty of planning, as is typical for a music festival of 7,000, and much philosophical deliberation over the boundaries of manhood, as is less so. \u201cWhat about transgender people who love and embrace their masculinity?\u201d wrote one commentator about similarly delineated parties in Copenhagen. \u201cWe preach that your assigned gender doesn\u2019t determine who one is and then use it as grounds to include people in a separatist space.\u201dFor Ms. Knyckare, the designation is a practical one. \u201cTransgender men also need a safe space from rape culture and sexual assault,\u201d she said, noting that in future years, men will be welcome, regardless of their sex assigned at birth. \u201cThe idea is, for now, that you can\u2019t know who is a rapist and who isn\u2019t. And we won\u2019t be looking over our shoulders.\u201d July 28The festival, founded by Dan Reynolds, the frontman of the band Imagine Dragons, aims to build bridges and foster dialogue between the Mormon and gay communities in Utah, according to Jacob Dunford, the festival\u2019s C.O.O. More than 30,000 people are expected at the event this year, where Mr. Reynolds, a practicing Mormon, as well as Zedd, Mike Shinoda and Grace VanderWaal, will play.\u201cThis was up until recently so taboo,\u201d said Mr. Dunford, 23, who is gay and who left the church in 2015 because of its policies. Soon after, he helped found Utah County\u2019s first L.G.B.T. resource center, with the aim of preventing youth suicide and homelessness.\u201cI want that kid hiding under his bedsheets to be live-streaming this on his iPhone,\u201d Mr. Dunford said of the festival. \u201cThis is nonstop affirmation. We\u2019re not invisible.\u201d Sept. 14 (monthly)\u201cHere those things melt away,\u201d said David Chan, 28, a recent host of the queer Asian dance party Bubble T. He could have meant it literally: Mary J. Blige was playing, the crowd was downing CBD-infused Jell-O shots, and sweaty fishnet bumped against fish-shaped inflatables in the Standard Hotel\u2019s rooftop pool. The occasion was Haute Pot Pride, and the crowd was on theme. One attendee wore a \u201cShowgirls\u201d-esque headdress made of shabu shabu strainers.Bubble T, held monthly, was founded in 2017 by five friends: Stevie Huynh, Karlo Bueno Bello, Nicholas Valite Andersen, Pedro Balneg Vidallon Jr. and Paul Tran. \u201cWe\u2019d been going out in New York for years,\u201d said Mr. Huynh, 34, a makeup artist. \u201cBut this was something we\u2019d never seen.\u201d As its Instagram bio specifies, Bubble T is where \u201cAsianz rule but everybody\u2019s welcome.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something I never would have done, but I had the backing and support of these beautiful people, my chosen family,\u201d he said. July, August and SeptemberThe Reclaiming tradition, named for its emphasis on resurrecting ancient spirituality, originated in the Bay Area in the 1970s among pagans with ties to feminist and anarchist communities. They spell-protested the nuclear plant at Diablo Canyon in the early 1980s and formed a coalition in the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987.Though the movement focuses on goddess worship, Reclaiming in recent years has moved away from binaries. \u201cMasculinity and femininity don\u2019t make sense in a compost heap,\u201d one witch wrote in 2010.Reclaiming witches gather in camps around the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia each summer. Their rituals draw primarily from pre-Christian Europe but often are aimed at supporting the activism of indigenous landholders. \u201cI think there\u2019s a big yearning for spirituality among radical communities on the West Coast,\u201d said Briar Sparkle, 36, who works for an organic farm and had been involved with anarchist and environmental activists in Southern California for years. They first attended Witch Camp while dealing with the trauma of being arrested at a protest. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have fun at festivals \u2014 it\u2019s why any kid loves summer camp \u2014 but where are the levels of political awareness?\u201dAug. 3 to Aug. 5Despite Texas\u2019s 2017 proposed bathroom bill, the hotel in Dallas was ready to accommodate the crowd of masters, slaves, sirs, bois, daddys and puppies in whatever bathroom they would like, according to Mr. Coleman. (It was, after all, also hosting their workshops and oral history discussions.) The leather subculture originated among gay men in the mid-20th century. Early on, women who wanted to participate were often ostracized; today, images of Tom of Finland hunks remain its calling card. Aug. 31Forty suspenseful minutes later, she makes the cut. Two others are eliminated. (One dress is \u201ctoo sexy\u201d; earlier in the episode, a smile with visible braces was accused of revealing a \u201clack of commitment.\u201d More tears!)The live broadcast is an entertainment event for 15 million Thai. Unlike many L.G.B.T. riffs on pageantry, including ball culture and leather- and drag-focused titles, Miss Tiffany\u2019s adheres scrupulously to hetero-normative conventions. There are swimsuits and sparkly evening gowns; contestants are thin, young and gorgeous; any camp seems unintentional. But the effect on Thailand is subversive, said the managing director, Alisa Kunpalin: \u201cYou see that transgender women are pretty, and maybe you want to learn more about their abilities and challenges.\u201dWhen Ms. Kunpalin started Miss Tiffany\u2019s 21 years ago, in the resort city where her family ran a cabaret show of the same name, transgender women were regularly harassed by law enforcement and denied the majority of jobs, she recalled. Today in Thailand, although the service and beauty industries regularly hire them, traveling abroad can be humiliating (it is impossible to legally change one\u2019s gender on passports and official documents). \u201cWe believe if understanding changes, the law will eventually change too,\u201d Ms. Kunpalin said. This year\u2019s Miss Tiffany\u2019s contestants include a doctor, a ballet dancer and a boxer. In July, Spain nominated Angela Ponce for the Miss Universe pageant; she will be the first transgender woman to compete in the pageant. \u201cIf everyone is equal in the future, we\u2019ll stop doing Miss Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Kunpalin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in grouping people more and more. We\u2019re all human beings.\u201dAug. 16 to Aug. 19Dance music has roots in queer Midwestern spaces. Today, a crop of underground house and techno parties in the Rust Belt region is adding a new chapter to that genre\u2019s history. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you can pull something off with this level of diversity in the middle of nowhere,\u201d said Shane Christian, a 22-year-old D.J. from Cleveland, of Honcho Campout, a weekend-long party in the woods of southern Pennsylvania. \u201cEveryone\u2019s there for a reason, and the energy is so palpable.\u201dNow in its fourth year, Honcho Campout has become a cult destination for those who prefer weird and intimate dance spaces, much like the regular parties at Hot Mass, a gay bathhouse turned after-hours club in Pittsburgh, out of which the event was born. Think of it as an antidote to the selfies-in-the-V.I.P.-section festival: cameras on the dance floor are discouraged, booze sales are cut off at midnight while subwoofers go till sunrise, and tickets are kept affordable. Lineup-wise, this year brings D.J.s from Los Angeles\u2019s Spotlight Party and San Francisco\u2019s Honey Soundsystem, as well as from Chicago, Detroit and Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a D.I.Y. annual report of the queer dance scene,\u201d said the organizer Aaron Clark.Early Honcho parties were populated largely by men; for its first two years, the party was held at Roseland, a clothing-optional gay resort in West Virginia. The current location, the Four Quarters Interfaith Sanctuary, was chosen with expanded queer inclusivity in mind. You can still get naked. \u201cI\u2019m not usually at ease with that at queer parties because I\u2019m so self-conscious. I\u2019ve had dysphoria since I was a kid,\u201d said Eris Drew, 42, a house D.J. from Chicago whose music includes references to shamanistic techniques as well as to 1990s rave culture, and who played Campout last year. \u201cBut I felt free dancing with my partner. My body wasn\u2019t ridiculed or even overly focused on. It was the lunar equinox, and you could hear the drone of the insects melding with the kick drums. It was magical and healing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted David Chan. He said that, before attending the dance party Bubble T, he didn\u2019t have \u201cthat many queer Asian friends,\u201d not \u201cany Asian friends.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the status of a Texas bill to restrict transgender bathroom use.

{"Headline": "Facebook Ads Offer Peek at Looming Supreme Court Fight", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven before President Trump\u2019s new Supreme Court nominee is announced, a fight over the choice is raging on social media.The ads, which also appeared on Twitter, show a 30-second video with darkened images of Democratic lawmakers interspersed with bright images of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\u201cExtremists will lie and attack the nominee,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cBut don\u2019t be fooled: President Trump\u2019s list includes the best of the best, and with your help, America will get another star on the Supreme Court.\u201dThese groups, which are classified as 501(c)(4) advocacy groups, are not required to identify their donors or disclose much of their spending. But new Facebook ad policies are for the first time giving a glimpse of how money from these organizations flows through social media.In an attempt to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russian disinformation campaigns successfully exploited flaws in its network, Facebook recently began requiring political advertisers to authenticate themselves as residents of the United States and label every ad with a \u201cpaid for by\u201d indication. The company also began archiving all paid political content on Facebook and Instagram, including promoted news, in a searchable public database, along with information about how much was spent on the ads and basic details about how they were targeted.Until Facebook introduced its ad archive, political advertisers could hide their messages from public view with the use of so-called dark posts, nonpublic ads that are shown only to the subset of users who are included in the ad\u2019s target audience and are invisible to everyone else.\u201cThis is more information than we\u2019ve ever had previously about what dark money groups are doing online,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, a program director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group. \u201cUp until this point, we really had no information whatsoever about how much money a group like Judicial Crisis Network was spending on digital ads, much less what those ads looked like or who they were targeted to.\u201dJudicial Crisis Network was formed in 2005 to promote the judicial nominees of President George W. Bush. Since then, the group has spent lavishly on campaigns to promote conservative nominees and oppose liberal appointments. It said it spent $7 million blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016 and pledged to spend $10 million supporting the nomination of Justice Gorsuch.\u201cWe want to reach people in every venue possible,\u201d said Carrie Severino, Judicial Crisis Network\u2019s chief counsel and policy director. \u201cWe\u2019re doing TV. We\u2019re doing radio. We do a lot of grass-roots work. Of course, social media is a key part of that outreach now.\u201dSocial media advocacy isn\u2019t limited to dark money groups, of course. On Monday, the National Republican Senate Committee began running a Facebook ad campaign that consisted of dozens of images of Mr. Trump, along with the label \u201cSCOTUS Action Alert.\u201d The ads, which were seen mostly by older women in Texas, Florida and Ohio, were not posted on the committee\u2019s public Facebook page, but they appeared in Facebook\u2019s ad archive. One Nation, a conservative offshoot of Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS, also used Facebook ads to target users in states with hotly contested Senate races.\u201cOur rights hang in the balance,\u201d read one ad, which was targeted to users in Montana, where Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, is up for re-election. \u201cTell Jon Tester to help put another great Justice on the Supreme Court!\u201dThe ad was seen fewer than 1,000 times, according to Facebook\u2019s archive.In addition to building grass-roots support with them, political groups often use social media ads as a kind of instant focus group. In a matter of hours, they can test dozens of variations of ads with small numbers of users, see which one drives the most engagement and use the winning message more widely. In the case of a Supreme Court nominee, social media ads allow advocacy groups to figure out which messages are more effective at energizing their supporters.But in many cases, there is no indication of who is funding these campaigns.A Facebook spokeswomen, Elisabeth Diana, said that the company did not require political groups to identify their donors, and that it believed the Federal Election Commission, which monitors political spending, was better positioned to investigate these groups.\u201cThanks to the political ad archive, we now know what ads these groups are running, but we still don\u2019t know where the money is coming from,\u201d Mr. Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very important consideration. Voters might view these messages differently if they knew who was funding them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The push by United States delegates to the World Health Organization to water down or scrap a simple resolution meant to encourage breast-feeding in underdeveloped countries was many things \u2014 bullying, anti-science, pro-industry, anti-public health and shortsighted, to name a few. But it was not surprising. In fact, it\u2019s just one of several recent examples of the Trump administration\u2019s zeal for badgering weaker countries into tossing public health concerns aside to serve powerful business interests. The baby formula industry is worth $70 billion and, as breast-feeding has become more popular in more developed countries, the industry has pinned its hopes for growth on developing nations.In wealthier countries formula is a safe option and can sometimes be a godsend. But it is also nutritionally inferior to breast milk in every way. Among other things, it contains none of the antibodies available in a mother\u2019s milk. In the developing world, those shortcomings can be far more devastating to a child\u2019s health.Ecuador was set to introduce this uncontroversial measure when the United States threatened \u201cpunishing trade measures\u201d and a withdrawal of crucial military aid unless the country dropped it.Common sense ultimately triumphed in this round of bullying, and the measure passed without much alteration \u2014 thanks, oddly enough, to Russia. But American officials are using the same tactics in similar situations, and there\u2019s still concern that they could succeed on those fronts. It\u2019s tempting to call this approach to public health Trumpian, simply because it has all the key hallmarks: an obvious bow to rich and powerful companies, disregard for the needs of people who are poor or sick or both and zero attention to potential long-term consequences. But, while they might not have gone so far when it comes to baby formula, previous administrations were just as guilty as the current one when it came to drugs.Should American officials prevail in the current case, the outcome will be easy enough to guess: People will suffer.

{"Headline": "Thai Team Tells of Cave Rescue, Apologizing for All the Fuss", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Before they were discovered trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand, the 12 members of the Wild Boars youth soccer team and their coach drained much of their energy trying to dig their way out. Using stones to carve a large hole, they scraped at the chamber\u2019s ceiling, even as they became emaciated from a lack of food.\u201cI had no strength at all,\u201d said Chanin Wibulroongreung, 11, at a news conference on Wednesday evening local time, after the teammates were released from the hospital. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about food because it only made me hungrier.\u201dAt the news conference on Wednesday evening, where they first appeared dribbling soccer balls to cheers from the assembled crowd, the Wild Boars admitted that they had acted like normal boys.And they wanted to say that they were very, very sorry.They had not told their parents that they would be visiting the cave, a favored spot for exploration, they said. Instead, their families were under the impression the teammates were only going out to practice soccer.One boy said he had not informed his parents that he was going to Tham Luang because he was sure he would not be given permission.\u201cI would like to apologize to Dad and Mom,\u201d said Phanumas Saengdee, 13, who recounted how he had secretly put a flashlight for a cave adventure in his soccer bag.While the mission to liberate the soccer team trapped by flash floods on June 23 generally followed an improbably successful plotline, the operation claimed the life of Saman Gunan, a 38-year-old retired Thai Navy SEAL. Mr. Saman, who had volunteered to help find the missing boys, died while placing air tanks along an underwater escape route out of the cave complex.The Wild Boars\u2019 25-year-old coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, described his shock at hearing of Mr. Saman\u2019s death.\u201cHe sacrificed his life to protect and save us, the 13 Wild Boars, so we could go back outside and be happy, live a normal life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have caused suffering for Saman\u2019s family.\u201dWhile in the hospital \u2014 where they were monitored for around a week for infection and the aftereffects of a long, dark and hungry stay in Tham Luang \u2014 the boys were photographed with somber faces, holding a portrait of Mr. Saman.Psychiatrists screened the questions at Wednesday\u2019s news briefing to prevent the boys from having to relive the stress of their ordeal. For 10 days, the Wild Boars had sheltered in a cramped cave chamber, licking condensation off the limestone walls to survive.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if it was real or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got out of the water, and I was surprised they were not Thai. I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I said, \u2018Hello.\u2019 \u201d\u201cIt was a miracle,\u201d he added.Expert cave divers protected the teammates by placing them on emergency stretchers and outfitting them with full-face masks for the long underwater journey.Yet the boys had seemed remarkably composed about the life-or-death situation they faced, according to Lt. Col. Phak Lohanchun, an army doctor and diver who stayed with them after they were found. In a Facebook post, he said he was impressed by how orderly and obedient the boys had been.After eating, Colonel Phak said, the soccer players made sure to put any refuse in a trash bag to keep their perch in the cave clean.\u201cEvery boy on the Wild Boar team fully understands the sacrifice everyone went through searching for them,\u201d Colonel Phak said.\u201cI have confidence that the Wild Boar boys will grow into great humans for this country, and be valuable and prominent in Thailand,\u201d he added.The boys\u2019 coach, Mr. Ekkapol, helped the trapped soccer players, ages 11 to 16, to cope using meditation techniques that he had honed during his years as a Buddhist monk.\u201cCoach Ek is a very good-hearted man who sacrifices everything,\u201d Colonel Phak said. \u201cEk would let the boys eat until they were full by sharing his portion with them.\u201dThe boys and Mr. Ekkapol will soon ordain as Buddhist novices to atone for the death of Mr. Saman, they said. In Thai tradition, boys often enter the monkhood for brief periods to meditate and perform charity work.In the news conference, the Wild Boars explained more about their ill-fated expedition to Tham Luang Cave. They had only been planning to explore the caverns for an hour, they said, and had packed no snacks.Mr. Ekkapol had explored Tham Luang\u2019s recesses before, he said, including the ledge where they were eventually found. But a flash flood sent waters rising nearly 10 feet in less than an hour, he said, forcing them to retreat deeper into the cave.After the news conference, journalists have been asked to allow the Wild Boars to return to the business of being normal boys \u2014 something that would be impossible if the media glare around them continued.The search and rescue operation drew journalists from around the world, who descended on the small town of Mae Sai, near Thailand\u2019s border with Myanmar, hungry for a rare tale of mortal danger that had ended with an uplifting conclusion.On Wednesday, three of the Wild Boars said that when they grew up they wanted to become navy SEALS tasked with saving others.\u201cWe are so happy that I don\u2019t know how to describe it in words,\u201d Thanawut Wibulroongreung, the father of Chanin, the youngest Wild Boar, said before Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cAll we can do is to say thank you to the rescuers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orcas of the Pacific Northwest Are Starving and Disappearing", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For the last three years, not one calf has been born to the dwindling pods of black-and-white killer whales spouting geysers of mist off the coast in the Pacific Northwest.Normally four or five calves would be born each year among this fairly unusual urban population of whales \u2014 pods named J, K and L. But most recently, the number of orcas here has dwindled to just 75, a 30-year low in what seems to be an inexorable, perplexing decline.In March, Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order directing state agencies to do more to protect the whales, and in May he convened the Southern Resident Orca Task Force, a group of state, tribal, provincial and federal officials, to devise ways to stem the loss of the beloved regional creature. \u201cI believe we have orcas in our soul in this state,\u201d he said. At another point, he wrote of the whales and Chinook salmon that \u201cthe impacts of letting these two species disappear would be felt for generations.\u201dThe orcas are also facing a new threat. The recent agreement between the Canadian government and Kinder Morgan to expand the Trans Mountain Pipeline would multiply oil tanker traffic through the orcas\u2019 habitat by seven times, according to some estimates, and expose them to excessive noise and potential spills. Construction is set to begin in August, despite opposition from Governor Inslee and many environmentalists.In the late 1990s, there were nearly 100 of these giant whales in the population. Following the salmon, they migrate in the Salish Sea to the northern coast of British Columbia and often surface in the south at Puget Sound within sight of downtown Seattle, especially during the spring and summer months. The males, which can weigh up to 22,000 pounds, typically live about 30 years, and females, up to 16,000 pounds, survive longer \u2014 up to 50 or 60 years, although one J-pod member, Granny, lived to be 105 years old.Not only are there fewer calves in recent years, but signs of inbreeding also point to a weakening population. In the 1970s and 80s, theme parks like Sea World captured nearly 4 dozen orcas from the region, possibly shrinking the pods\u2019 gene pool. In the last three decades, just two males fathered half the calves in the last three decades, and only a third of the females are breeding, just once every decade instead of every five years. Researchers worry that reproducing females are aging out of the population, and won\u2019t be replaced.Much is still unknown about the plight of these orcas, but biologists and conservation managers have zeroed in on several main factors \u2014 and they are all connected.The biggest contributing factor may be the disappearance of big king salmon \u2014 fish more than 40 inches long. \u201cThey are Chinook salmon specialists,\u201d said Brad Hanson, team leader for research at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center here, part of NOAA. \u201cIf they could, they would eat Chinook salmon 24/7.\u201d Orcas gobble 30 a day. Hunting enough smaller prey requires a lot more energy.The underwater world in the region is also getting noisier, especially an area between the San Juan Islands and Vancouver Island called Haro Strait. It is one of the orcas\u2019 favorite foraging grounds in the summer.\u201cIt\u2019s also essentially a big rock ditch where sound bounces off. When you add in commercial vessel traffic going to Vancouver, recreational boaters and whale watching operations, it\u2019s a pretty noisy place,\u201d Mr. Hanson said.In recent years, officials have expanded the distance which vessels, including whale watching boats and kayaks, must keep from the whales. And there is a voluntary no-go zone near the San Juan Islands.\u201cJust the presence of boats can cause the whales to spend less time feeding,\u201d said Lynne Barre, of NOAA Fisheries, recovery coordinator for the orcas. \u201cAnd it\u2019s harder to communicate. They have to call longer and louder when boats are nearby.\u201dAnother factor is the pollution in Puget Sound. Whales that live off the coast of Seattle, Tacoma and other cities are effectively urban whales buffeted by municipal and industrial waste, and the occasional spillage from wastewater treatment plants into the ocean. Killer whales carry some of the highest levels of pollution of any marine animal.Of most concern are the lingering effects of chemicals and pesticides, including the now banned DDT, as well as PCBs and PBDE, widely used in flame retardants and found through the world. The pollutants accumulate in salmon as they feed, and when the whales eat salmon they also ingest PCBs at even higher levels.\u201cIt\u2019s very lipophilic, which means it stays in the fat, and the females transfer a huge proportion of the contaminant burden to their offspring,\u201d Dr. Hanson said. \u201cAbout 85 percent gets transferred to calves through lactation.\u201dAnd while much of the pollution is from the region\u2019s industrial past, Boeing disclosed this spring that over the past five years it had discharged highly toxic PCBs into the Duwamish River, which flows into Puget Sound, thousands of times over the legal limit.These toxins suppress the whales\u2019 immune systems, making them more susceptible to disease. They can also impede reproduction. That may be why tests show a high number of females who have become pregnant have failed to calve.However, the decline of the whales can\u2019t be pegged, experts say, to contaminants alone. A separate population of transient whales near here eat mammals that eat fish, and so consume concentrate contaminants at even higher levels \u2014 many times as high as the resident pods. Yet they are thriving, which has left scientists scratching their heads. Global populations are robust as well.One possible scenario is that the dearth of salmon coupled with the interference of engine noise, which can affect their immune system, too, deprives the orcas of a sufficient diet. Their bodies then draw on fat reserves, which are laced with chemicals that suppress their immune system and reduce fecundity.But experts aren\u2019t sure what is raising their mortality rate. Often, when whales die, their carcasses sink or wash up onto remote beaches and are hard to find and test.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they are sick, we don\u2019t have evidence for that,\u201d said Linda D. Rhodes, a research biologist expert in marine microbes and toxins and part of the study. \u201cIt means they are being exposed. Whether or not the whales get sick is a product of how much of it is present in the environment and how well is the whale able to defend itself.\u201dThere is deep concern that a fatal human or animal disease has, or will, cross the species barrier and find its way into these immuno-compromised killer whales. \u201cI\u2019ve had dreams about it at night,\u201d said Joseph K. Gaydos, a veterinarian with the SeaDoc Society in Eastsound, Washington in the San Juan Islands, who studies the southern residents. \u201cDisease smolders in the environment but can break out. If there were a highly virulent virus to come through here it would take out a large part of the population and totally stop recovery efforts.\u201dDisease threats are myriad. A young killer whale died from a fungal infection last year. Toxoplasmosis is a disease spread by parasites in the feces of cats. It is one of the top threats to the Hawaiian monk seal, killing eight of the remaining 1,400 since 2001. It\u2019s not known, though, to affect whales.Canine distemper from dogs is also a concern. It\u2019s a morbillivirus, which is an RNA rather than a DNA virus. Some 1,500 dolphins were killed by a single outbreak of morbilliviruses on the East Coast several years ago.\u201cRNA viruses can mutate rapidly and cross species lines,\u201d Dr. Gaydos said.Steps are being planned to help the whales persevere. More Chinook salmon are being reared in hatcheries as whale food, but that is far from a certain fix.In the end trying to maintain a population of whales in the shadow of one of the fastest growing cities in the country may not be possible.\u201cIt\u2019s an ecosystem-wide problem,\u201d Dr. Hanson said. \u201cThings are out of whack and we have to get them back to where we can sustain killer whales. And the clock is ticking.\u201dLosing the charismatic, intelligent animals with the distinctive black-and-white \u201cpaint job\u201d and permanent smile would be a blow to the area.\u201cThere would be a great sense of loss,\u201d Dr. Rhodes said. \u201cThey are such a part of our identity here. It would be a real sense of failure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Brad Hanson\u2019s position at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. He is the team leader for research, not recovery efforts. The article also misstated the acronym for polybrominated diphenyl ethers, widely used in fire retardants. It is PBDE, not PPDE.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lost Dogs of the Americas", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExhaustive DNA studies find that the dogs of European colonists completely replaced ancient American dogs.Before Europeans began to colonize the Americas about 500 years ago, the land, north and south, was populated with people who had been here for thousands of years. And their dogs.The devastation visited on the native human inhabitants of North and South America is well known. Whether their dogs survived in some form, perhaps only as a portion of the DNA of some modern dogs, has been a matter of dispute. The available evidence indicated that only traces were present in current breeds and mixed breed dogs, but questions remained.Greger Larson at the University of Oxford, an author of the paper, and the leader of an international effort to investigate the evolution and domestication of dogs, said the study emphasizes how inseparable are the fates of humans and their animals. \u201cThe Europeans come through. They knock out the humans. They knock out the dogs,\u201d he said. Given the necessary caveats that a pocket of dogs with substantial ancient American ancestry could turn up somewhere, Dr. Larson said that he was convinced by the evidence so far that, \u201cIt\u2019s a complete disappearance.\u201d Laurent Frantz, an ancient DNA expert at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research, said that until now, there had not been enough evidence to know \u201cthe story of these dogs and what happened to them after the Europeans arrived.\u201d Now, he said, it is clear that the pre-contact dogs were an identifiable group, separate from any other, and that some combination of disease and European persecution of native dogs led to their disappearance.Fifty researchers collaborated on the study, which included both biological and archaeological evidence. They derived DNA from the remains of 71 ancient dogs from the Americas and Siberia and compared them to genomes of modern dogs.The story they draw from their analysis is familiar, but backed up with more data than ever before. Dogs, which were domesticated at least 15,000 years ago, came over to North America with humans from Siberia, but perhaps not with the first wave of migration.She said the new work provides \u201cstunning\u201d insights into the founder dog, the one animal who first had the tumor, and passed it along to all dogs since. Dr. Murchison said it now seems to have first appeared 6,000 to 8,000 years ago.Geneticists characterize different groups of dogs, or any organisms, on the basis of differences in their DNA, showing how closely they are related. Among modern, living dogs, the closest relatives to the pre-contact dogs are the Arctic breeds, because they shared a common ancestor. But the founder dog is even closer. It falls between the Arctic breeds and the pre-contact dogs.The DNA of the tumor has become jumbled over the course of time. \u201cIf you look at the chromosomes it doesn\u2019t look like a dog at all,\u201d said Dr. Murchison.

She was 49.Her death was confirmed by her cousin Dima Wannous, an author, who did not specify a cause. A colleague, Faris al-Hilou, said she died of a heart attack.Ms. Skaf was jailed, accused of treason and repeatedly harassed after joining peaceful demonstrations against the government beginning in 2011. Fearing further retaliation \u2014 she received death threats \u2014 she escaped to Jordan and then continued to Paris, where she had been living since 2013 in self-imposed exile.\u201cI will not lose hope,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page two days before her death. \u201cIt\u2019s the great Syria, not Assad\u2019s Syria.\u201dThe National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces issued a statement after her death expressing confidence that her \u201chope will continue to be a beacon for all free Syrians.\u201dSupported by Russian air power and Iranian-backed troops, government forces have reclaimed rebel-held territory after killing civilians with sieges, airstrikes and chemical weapons.In a 2013 interview that appeared in Al Quds Al Arabi, an Arabic-language newspaper in London, Ms. Skaf spoke of the impact of the Assad government\u2019s constraints in broad terms.\u201cWhat about the lost dignity?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about poverty, pain and disease? What about marginalization? What about daily humiliation and the daily enslavement of human beings? What about the loss of hope?\u201dWhen she was interrogated after one arrest, she said, an officer demanded: \u201cWhat do you want? Do you want freedom?\u201d To which she said she replied, \u201cMy wish is that my son will not be led by the son of Bashar al-Assad!\u201dMs. Skaf was born on April 13, 1969, in Damascus to a Muslim father and Christian mother. Survivors include her mother and her son, who was a teenager when she fled and later joined her.She studied French literature at Al-Sham Private University in Damascus. Encouraged by an uncle, Saadallah Wannous, a well-known playwright, she began acting while still a student.In 1992, she starred in a Syrian television version of Agatha Christie\u2019s novel \u201cSleeping Murder.\u201d She was cast in her first film, \u201cEchoes of Slides,\u201d in 1993; appeared in the TV series \u201cThe Silk Bazaar\u201d (1996) and \u201cThe Last Days of Al Yamama\u201d (2005); and in 2008 returned to film in \u201cDamascus: The Smile of Sadness\u201d (2008). One of her last appearances was in \u201cOrchidia,\u201d a 2017 Syrian soap opera shot in Tunisia and Romania.Before Ms. Skaf left Syria, she also ran a theater group that gave performances and acting classes.She staged her first protest against the Assad regime in 2011 and was detained. A few years later she was told to fear for her life.Supporters drove her to Beirut, where she was reunited with her son. When she reached Paris, she continued her political advocacy.In 2016, Ms. Skaf symbolically offered herself as fodder for four Libyan tigers at a demonstration in Berlin to protest the rejection faced by refugees fleeing war.Participating in that protest, staged by the Center for Political Beauty, a German artist collective, she said that because European countries had curtailed asylum, \u201cthousands faced the choice between the inevitable death of war and possible death at sea in unsafe ships, guided by charlatans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Show About Slaves, With White Actors, Will Go On After Protests", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile critics of the show have welcomed the closure as a necessary cultural reckoning, several leading theater directors in Quebec rallied behind Mr. Lepage this week, citing their concerns that closing a production by such an internationally acclaimed director could have a chilling effect on artistic expression in Canada. At least four theaters are proceeding with productions of \u201cSlav,\u201d even if that means braving protests.He added that he wasn\u2019t worried about protests, \u201cas long as no one slaps anyone,\u201d as happened in Montreal, where a white audience member slapped a black protester in the face.\u201cIt is a matter of artistic freedom for a theater to show what it wants to show,\u201d she said. Invoking Ms. Bonifassi\u2019s own defense that \u201cSlav\u201d was about slavery in all its incarnations, not just African-American slavery, she added: \u201cI saw the play myself and saw the casting in the context that slavery doesn\u2019t have only one color, it wasn\u2019t just in the cotton fields.\u201dThe expressions of support for Mr. Lepage and Ms. Bonifassi came after the two broke their silence about the closing of their show.Mr. Lepage said that over his long career, he had \u201cdevoted entire shows denouncing injustices done throughout history to specific cultural groups, without actors from said groups\u201d and \u201cwithout anyone accusing me of cultural appropriation, let alone of racism.\u201dBut cultural critics, including black artists, accused Slav\u2019s creators of self-serving narcissism and of failing to address the fundamental question of why they had failed to cast black actors as black slaves in the first place.Several critics of the show, which will be shown in Paris in December and in Quebec in 2020, are already complaining that it has a glaring omission: Canadian indigenous actors.Ex Machina said in a statement that the production consisted of 34 people from multiple backgrounds, and that the show planned to use video testimonials from Canadian indigenous people, including victims of residential schools, and had also consulted widely with indigenous leaders.An earlier version of this article misstated the history of \u201cKanata\u201d performances.

{"Headline": "The Third-Party Option", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNational politics needs a leader devoted to redistributing power downward.Opinion ColumnistIs there room for a third party? If some independent mounted a presidential bid in 2020, would that person have a chance?Those are questions we won\u2019t be able to answer for a few years. If the Democrats nominate somebody like Mitch Landrieu, the answer is no. Landrieu is a progressive former mayor of New Orleans whose personal style would play well with the white working class and whose convictions and history play well with African-Americans and other groups. A Democrat like Landrieu would occupy all the non-Trump space and make a meaningful third-party run impossible. But suppose the Democrats nominate one of the senators who are now sprinting leftward to catch up with what they perceive to be the Democratic base.In that case, there would be room for a third party. But that bid would not work if it were trying to present a moderate or centrist or pragmatic alternative to the two party ideologies. There is no evidence that there are enough centrists or \u201cpragmatists\u201d to threaten the two-party duopoly. But today, the country is diverse, trust in big institutions is low, the federal government is immobilized by partisanship and debt. Now, state and local governments are more effective across many overlapping domains. It\u2019s no wonder that so many, especially millennials (the most diverse generation of voters in our history), have become disillusioned with federal action. In this new context, a third-party candidate might run on what Hais, Ross and Winograd call constitutional localism. The constitutional part means preserving the civil rights safeguards enshrined in the Constitution. The localism part means a radical decentralization of other powers, to the levels of authority people have faith in.All recent presidential candidates have run against Washington, but on the premise that they could change Washington. Today, a third-party candidate would have to run on creating different kinds of power structures at different levels. These local efforts need a national leader in part because while it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cdevolve power,\u201d actually doing it is complicated. For example, civil rights is the area where the national government was once most clearly superior in many parts of the country. But these days, national partisan divisions overlap with our racial divisions, so it\u2019s national demagogues like Donald Trump who most inflame racial animosity to gain political power. Civil rights progress still requires a forceful federal presence to, say, induce local police forces to reform and integrate. But such progress also requires energized local efforts in which people work across racial differences on common loves, like the future of their community\u2019s children.We also need a national leader to tell a different national story. During the 20th century, a superpower story emerged. In that story, the nation moved as one, and a ridiculous amount of attention got focused on the supposed superhero in the White House. A third-party candidate who shifted attention to local people actually getting stuff done might lose, but he or she would begin to define a new and more plausible version of American greatness.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started an investigation into the social network\u2019s public statements about Cambridge Analytica, Facebook said.\u201cWe are cooperating with officials in the U.S., U.K. and beyond,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided public testimony, answered questions, and pledged to continue our assistance as their work continues.\u201dThe widening interest in Facebook by the federal agencies is the latest fallout from revelations in March, when The New York Times and others reported that the world\u2019s largest social network had mishandled the data of millions of its users. The user data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, which used the information to build psychographic profiles of American voters.Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist for the F.T.C., said the broadened federal investigations and additional interest from agencies in the matter were \u201cvery significant because it means the government is not just interested in harms to privacy, but is interested in a broad array of harms.\u201dThe initial federal investigations into Facebook\u2019s user data and Cambridge Analytica largely focused on Cambridge Analytica. But prosecutors from the Northern District of California, along with F.B.I. agents from the San Francisco field office, S.E.C. officials in San Francisco and F.T.C. officials, have recently questioned at least one former Cambridge Analytica employee and the majority of the questioning focused on Facebook, two people familiar with the investigations said.A third person familiar with the investigations said the turn toward Facebook in the inquiries happened in the past four to six weeks.One significant line of questioning focused on Facebook\u2019s claims that it was misled by Cambridge Analytica, the people said. In numerous public statements made by the social network\u2019s executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, after the revelations of the data mishandling, Facebook repeatedly claimed that Cambridge Analytica told it that it was collecting data only for academic purposes.But the fine print of a questionnaire that accompanied a quiz app used to collect user data, which was then provided to Cambridge Analytica, said the data could also be used for commercial purposes, according to a draft reviewed by The Times. Selling user data would have been an outright violation of the company\u2019s rules at the time, yet the social network does not appear to have regularly checked to make sure that apps complied with its rules.The final wording of the questionnaire\u2019s terms of service is most likely unknowable; Facebook executives said they deleted the quiz app in December 2015 when they found out about the data harvesting.Facebook officials have said that the company stands by its previous statements that it cracked down in 2015 on companies and apps that harvested user data, including Cambridge Analytica.Cecilia Kang and Matthew Rosenberg reported from Washington and Sheera Frenkel from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish School Leader Abducted, and Released, in Mongolia", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Turkish educator in Mongolia was briefly abducted on Friday, in what appeared to be the latest episode of a global campaign by Turkey\u2019s president to capture suspected allies of the exiled cleric accused of plotting a 2016 coup attempt.Turkey has maintained that it extradites suspected Gulenists only with the permission of the foreign governments concerned. But the case of Mr. Akcay, who has lived in Mongolia for nearly 25 years, appears to cast doubt on that claim.Mr. Akcay was near his apartment building in the capital, Ulan Bator, on Friday morning when he was bundled into a Toyota minivan, according to a colleague, Ganbat Batbuyan, who was in communication with the Mongolian police. That account was corroborated by two other people, including another colleague and a senior Mongolian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.Mr. Ganbat, the Mongolian general director of the Empathy foundation, which runs the Mongolia-Turkish schools, said the Mongolian police told him that the vehicle had a fake license plate and that three masked people were inside.Several hours later, what the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described as a Turkish-chartered aircraft landed at Ulan Bator\u2019s airport. It was a Bombardier jet with a call sign matching that of a plane operated by the Turkish Air Force, according to an online flight-tracking service, Flightradar24.As word leaked out about the aircraft on Friday afternoon, Mr. Akcay\u2019s friends and family congregated at the airport.Later that afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the Mongolian government had ordered the flight grounded. Any seizure of Mr. Akcay, it added, would constitute an \u201cunacceptable act of violation of Mongolia\u2019s sovereignty and independence and Mongolia will strongly object.\u201dThe jet left before 9:15 p.m., without Mr. Akcay on board. He was released several hours later, officials said.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has pressured foreign countries to shutter schools that it says are allied with the spiritual movement of Mr. Gulen, who now lives in Pennsylvania and has denied involvement in the attempted coup.In 2016, for instance, the Turkish ambassador to Cambodia urged the closure of schools he said were linked to Mr. Gulen, whom he accused of running a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201dThe same year, Turkish diplomats attempted to do the same with the educational network now run by Mr. Akcay, according to his colleagues.The Turkish government accused six Turkish citizens who were deported from Kosovo on March 29, of having connections to Mr. Gulen, whose Islamic movement has garnered support in the Balkans, among other places.This month, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son visited Mongolia and met with high-level officials, according to a post on the Turkish Embassy\u2019s Facebook page.Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.But in its statement, the Mongolian Foreign Ministry said that a Turkish diplomat in Mongolia had \u201creaffirmed that the Republic of Turkey respects the independence and sovereignty of Mongolia, and any illegal activities, including the abduction of persons, have not been conducted on the territory of Mongolia.\u201dFor their part, Mr. Akcay\u2019s friends and family said that the fast response of Mongolian authorities underscored the relative openness of the country\u2019s political system.\u201cI would like to thank the Mongolian police and government for acting so quickly,\u201d Mr. Ganbat said. \u201cWe are a democracy with human rights, and this is not the kind of place where these things normally happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Woodard is the author of \u201cAmerican Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America.\u201d FREEPORT, Maine \u2014\u00a0Contrary to conventional wisdom, the most significant and abiding divide in American politics isn\u2019t between city and countryside, but rather among regional cultures. Rural and urban places certainly have distinct interests and priorities, but in our awkward federation their differences have taken a back seat to the broader struggle between our constituent regions.Sectionalism isn\u2019t, and never has been, as simple as North versus South or an effete and domineering East against a rugged, freedom-minded West. Rather, our true regional fissures can be traced back to the contrasting ideals of the distinct European colonial cultures that first took root on the eastern and southern rims of what is now the United States, and then spread across much of the continent in mutually exclusive settlement bands, laying down the institutions, symbols and cultural norms later arrivals would encounter and, by and large, assimilate into.Tracing our history, I\u2019ve identified 11 nations, most corresponding to one of the rival European colonial projects and their respective settlement zones. I call them Yankeedom; New Netherland; the Midlands; Tidewater; Greater Appalachia; Deep South; El Norte; the Left Coast; the Far West; New France; and First Nation.

Alaska is divided among Left Coast, Far West and First Nation, a vast region of Arctic and sub-Arctic North America where indigenous peoples remained in effective control. Hawaii is part of Greater Polynesia.By The New York Times | Source: Colin WoodardLook at county-level maps of almost any closely contested presidential race in our history, and you see much the same fault lines: the swaths of the country first colonized by the early Puritans and their descendants \u2014 Yankeedom \u2014 tend to vote as one, and against the party in favor in the sections first colonized by the culture laid down by the Barbados slave lords who founded Charleston, S.C., or the Scots-Irish frontiersmen who swept down the Appalachian highlands and on into the Hill Country of Texas, Oklahoma and the southern tiers of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri.The Quaker-founded Midlands, the swing region of American politics that makes up a great swath of the heartland, has often been the physical and political buffer between rival regional coalitions, its pluralistic, community-oriented culture at peace neither with the Yankee\u2019s utopian drive to engineer social improvements nor Southern culture\u2019s emphasis on individual freedom above all else. It played the kingmaker\u2019s role again in 2016.Pundits speak of the \u201csolid South,\u201d but Yankeedom has had stalwart allies as well. The people of the slender Pacific coastal plain from San Francisco to Juneau, Alaska, have backed the same horse as the Yankees in virtually every contest since their states joined the union, and in opposition to the candidate favored by the majority of people in the interiors of their own states. Yankees have long found partners in the Dutch-founded zone in and around New York City and, in recent decades, the sections of the Southwest that were effectively colonized by Spain in the 16th to 19th centuries.The cultural differences between these regional cultures have a greater effect on our politics than the size and density of our communities. I ran the numbers for the past three presidential elections, comparing the voting behaviors of rural and urban counties within each \u201cnation.\u201d In five regional cultures that together constitute about 51 percent of the United States population, rural and urban counties voted for the same presidential candidate, be it the \u201cblue wave\u201d election of 2008, the Trumpist upheaval of 2016 or the more ambiguous contest in between. In the Deep South, Greater Appalachia, New France and the Far West, rural and urban majorities supported Republican candidates in all three elections, whether voters lived in central cities, wealthy suburbs, mountain hollers or the ranches of the high plains. In El Norte, the Spanish-colonized parts of the Southwest, both types of counties \u2014 empty desert or booming cityscapes \u2014\u00a0voted Democratic.In two more regional cultures \u2014 Yankeedom and the Left Coast \u2014 rural counties only recently opposed their urban, Democrat-supporting neighbors. Rural Yankee counties went for Barack Obama by 5.9 percent in 2008 and were split in 2012, with Mitt Romney winning by a razor thin 0.02 percent. The Left Coast\u2019s rural counties went for Mr. Obama in both elections, by 10.5 and 5.6 percent. Donald Trump \u2014 who had some of the most communitarian campaign promises of any Republican nominee in decades \u2014 flipped many rural Yankee and Left Coast counties in 2016 \u2014 he won the Yankee ones by 18.3 points, the Left Coast ones by 2.7 \u2014 tipping Wisconsin and Michigan into his camp.2016 presidential vote by region.+5+15+25Winning marginsin percentage points:TRUMPLEFTCOASTCLINTONYANKEEDOMFAR WESTNEWNETHER-LANDMIDLANDSTIDEWATERGREATER APPALACHIADEEP SOUTHEL NORTESPANISHCARIBBEANNEW FRANCEGreater Appalachia25The regions ranked by partisan vote margins in the 2016 presidential election:New France22Deep South9Far West90.4Midlands8Yankeedom14Tidewater14Spanish Caribbean19El Norte25New Netherland34Left CoastWinning margins in percentage points:+5+15+25TRUMPCLINTONNEWNETHER-LANDLEFTCOASTFARWESTMIDLANDSYANKEEDOMTIDEWATERDEEP SOUTHEL NORTESPANISHCARIBBEANGREATERAPPALACHIANEWFRANCEThe regions ranked by partisan vote margins in the 2016 presidential election:25Gtr.

Only in the Midlands has the split been a stark one. While urban Midlanders preferred Democrats by between six and 18 points in the three elections, their rural counterparts voted Republican by 15.2, then 22.6 and finally a blistering 40.8 in 2016. As in Yankeedom, this dramatic Trump surge among rural voters had an outsize effect on the Electoral College outcome.Nor should cities be assumed to be reliable bastions of Democratic support. The core counties of major metropolitan areas, including Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fla., and Virginia Beach \u2014 and lots of smaller ones, like Boise, Idaho; Colorado Springs; Mobile, Ala.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Wichita, Kan. \u2014 went Republican in all of these presidential elections. Notably, not one of them is in Yankeedom, the Left Coast or New Netherland, even though those nations account for nearly 30 percent of the United States population.Look at counties within medium-size metros \u2014 those with a population of between 250,000 and one million. Instead of being blue strongholds, such counties in four of the \u201cnations\u201d \u2014 Deep South, Greater Appalachia, Far West and New France \u2014 voted for Republicans in all three contests, and those in the Midlands did the same in the latter two. Yet in the reliably \u201cblue\u201d nations, this same county type supported Democrats. Collectively, the very biggest core metro counties do vote Democratic in every nation, but by margins that vary enormously, from nine to 20 points in most \u201cred\u201d regions to 40- and 60-point landslides in \u201cblue\u201d ones.Why the differences? I\u2019ve long argued that United States politics resolves around the tension between advancing individual liberty and promoting the common good. The regional cultures we think of as \u201cblue\u201d today have traditions championing the building and maintenance of free communities, today\u2019s \u201cred\u201d ones on maximizing individual freedom of action. Our presidential contests almost always present a clear choice between the two, and the regions act accordingly.Political handicappers reckon a half-dozen Republican House districts representing these rural areas are within reach for Democrats in November. That southwestern Wisconsin went for the Democrat in April\u2019s state Supreme Court justice election suggests the 2016 tsunami is rolling back toward the deep blue sea.There are many factors that influence political behavior \u2014 race, class, gender and occupation, just to name a few \u2014 and good analysis incorporates several. But ignoring regionalism \u2014 with boundaries more properly defined \u2014 is to miss perhaps the most powerful variable of all.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistOf all the interlocking mysteries of the Trump-Russia scandal, one that I\u2019ve found particularly perplexing is the utter servility of congressional Republicans before a president many of them hate and believe to be compromised by a foreign power. Yes, I know they\u2019re thrilled about tax cuts and judges. Given how Russia has become a patron of the right globally over the last decade, some Republicans might welcome its intervention into our politics, believing that the Democrats are greater enemies of the Republic. And some are just cowards, afraid of mean tweets or base blowback.This week, however, a new possibility came into focus. Perhaps, rather than covering for Trump, some Republicans are covering for themselves.Last Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, indicted 12 members of Russian military intelligence for their interference in the 2016 election.

{"Headline": "Young Jean Lee\u2019s Unsafe Spaces", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "FeatureThe first female Asian-American playwright on Broadway takes aim at identity and watches the audience squirm.Supported by\u201cLong neck,\u201d the director tells her. \u201cHair,\u201d he says. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d She gets hit again.Finally, the director says, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s stop.\u201d Lee sniffles and asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cO.K.,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201dThis exchange takes place in the dark. A screen suddenly lights up, showing Lee with her face swollen and tear-streaked. \u201cOne more,\u201d she mouths.The slapping scene moves into a psychotic Vaudeville. A chorus of Asian and Asian-American women take the stage, speaking a hodgepodge of Asian languages and rehearsing every ghastly stereotype you can imagine. A character called \u201cKorean-American,\u201d wearing a childish pink shirt with a giraffe on it, smiles, doe-eyed, at the audience and delivers a venomous monologue about growing up with tiger parents: \u201cHave you ever noticed how most Asian-Americans are slightly brain-damaged from having grown up with Asian parents? It\u2019s like being raised by monkeys \u2014 these retarded monkeys who can barely speak English and who are too evil to understand anything besides conformity and status.\u201dA ruffle of laughter often follows the speech \u2014 the audience sounding nervous but reassured, it seems, to encounter familiar moorings in an ocean of strangeness: stock stories of intergenerational immigrant conflict and the self-loathing minority. But then Korean-American flips the script: \u201cThe truth is, if you\u2019re a minority and you do superracist stuff against yourself, then the white people are like, Oh, you\u2019re a \u2018cool minority,\u2019 and they treat you like one of them.\u201dThe twisty, turbulent, argumentative work of Young Jean Lee is full of such traps: Do you get the joke, or are you the joke? Your responses become part of the play, part of what you watch with fascination and dread. Nervous laughter, I suspect, means more to Lee than any ovation.This month, Lee will become the first Asian-American woman to have a play on Broadway when \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d starring Kate Bornstein, Josh Charles, Ty Defoe, Armie Hammer, Stephen Payne and Paul Schneider, and directed by Anna D. Shapiro, opens at the Hayes Theater on July 23. Lee has written plays about identity politics and identity crises in the lives of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, feminists and evangelicals. Here she scrutinizes what she calls the new ethnic group on the scene: straight white men. For so long simply the default humans, they now face all the indignities of life with a label. This production will be the largest audience yet for Lee\u2019s ceremonial purgings of stereotype, her brazenly unsafe spaces.Lee used to love eavesdropping on viewers as they left her plays. A common remark: \u201cWhy would the playwright do this to us?\u201d (The motto of Lee\u2019s production company was \u201cDestroy the Audience.\u201d) But her work is also full of tense pleasures and zany physical comedy. An extended gag in \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d has the Asian characters scuttling around like crabs as they defend the stage from two white actors who keep encroaching on it. \u201cUntitled Feminist Show\u201d is an entirely wordless play in which six naked performers, often holding pink parasols, tumble around for an hour in joyous, goofy splendor. Lee calls it \u201c\u2009\u2018The Lion King\u2019 for older lesbians.\u201dThe rigors Lee demands of her audience, she demands of herself too. I keep returning to that recording of her being struck on the face. At first it seems like pure provocation \u2014 or penance, perhaps, for airing such awful characterizations of her community. It might be both. It might also be a third thing: her cracked way of signaling solidarity with the viewer. She writes, she has said, to root out her own smugness, self-righteousness and stupidity.Her plays will make you flinch, but it\u2019s hard to look away. When the stage lights go on, the dialogue from the recording loops in my mind: \u201cLet\u2019s stop.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cOne more.\u201dWe talked over blood-red ribbons of tuna and strawberry shortcake and watched the restaurant from our alcove, our hunting blind. Table after table was being occupied by groups of Asians and Asian-Americans. In the corner, an older Asian woman ate alone, with transfixing slowness; in the middle of the room, a South Asian man and his friends took a large table.When yet another group of Asian patrons was led in, Lee put down her fork. \u201cThis is killing me,\u201d she said, delighted. To enter a situation with certain racial or social expectations and have them turned on their heads is the arc of every single play she has ever written.She has emerged as one of the most fearless experimental playwrights of her generation \u2014 \u201cthe queen of unease,\u201d according to The Village Voice; \u201ca troubling, necessary presence\u201d in American theater, Hilton Als wrote in The New Yorker. She refuses to work from previous knowledge, relying instead on intense research and collaboration.With each production, she begins by asking herself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the last play in the world you would ever want to write?\u201d Then she casts actors and builds a play for them and with them, incorporating their feedback. In 2009, for example, she decided the play she was most reluctant and least qualified to write was a \u201cblack identity-politics show\u201d and proceeded accordingly. \u201cThe Shipment\u201d has two parts. The first is a minstrel show in which the five black actors play the roles they said they were used to getting \u2014 drug addict, criminal \u2014 with a kind of Brechtian awkwardness. For the second part, Lee asked them what roles they always wanted to play. One said a bulimic cake decorator, another Hedda Gabler. She wrote a naturalistic play for them \u2014 with a final twist that upends everything we\u2019ve just seen.Lee\u2019s work is about wrongness: about being the wrong kind of man, woman, Asian; about saying the wrong thing; about getting other people wrong. Her characters are ill at ease in their bodies and in the world and, sometimes, in the very play they\u2019re starring in. In \u201cGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals,\u201d her first full-length play (with a title cribbed from Kant), two characters greet each other, sit in awkward silence, admit they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to be doing and walk off the stage.The plays are oddly constructed; perversely off-kilter; gaudily offensive and random. Their strangeness allows Lee to smuggle in questions about race and gender to an audience distracted by the high jinks \u2014 the sudden appearance of Big Bird in her take on \u201cKing Lear,\u201d a group suicide in \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d accompanied by Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d Early on in \u201cThe Shipment,\u201d a black comic delivers a frenetic standup routine about incest, infanticide, bestiality and the cluelessness of white people. The audience is so jolted by the \u201cjokes\u201d that they actually seem to hear the material about racism, which they might have otherwise glossed over or ignored.Lee looked around the restaurant with quick, practiced curiosity. At 44, she is a study in contrasts \u2014 straight-backed, composed, contained. When she listens, she goes stock-still. But in conversation, she is expansive and trusting and, on occasion, thrillingly indiscreet. There\u2019s an amiable relentlessness to her, a constant churn of intellectual energy. Class is the subject of her new play and her fixation at the moment. She followed up on one of our meetings with an email at 11:27 p.m.: \u201cIdentity politics needs to be more intersectional with class, and if it isn\u2019t, it easily becomes yet another tool of capitalism. I hope I\u2019ve made that clear enough!\u201dLee offered to pay for lunch \u2014 with her \u201cBroadway earnings\u201d \u2014 and relented only when I assured her, repeatedly, that I could expense it. We left the restaurant together, passing through Nougatine, the more casual sister restaurant of Jean-Georges. The guests were an older crowd, and as far as I could see, all white \u2014 the very quarry that eluded Lee. I waited for her to notice. When she did, she laughed, tickled. It was like watching someone open a present.The play follows three brothers, played by Josh Charles, Armie Hammer and Paul Schneider. Their mother, now dead, was determined that her sons grow up without a sense of entitlement. She even retrofitted a game of Monopoly to give them an idea of the advantages they were born into. She called it \u201cPrivilege,\u201d and it featured rules like losing money for being white when you passed Go. Of all her sons, Matt (played by Schneider), the oldest and brightest, took her message most to heart. He was his family\u2019s golden boy, who went to Harvard but has chosen to return home to care for his elderly father (Payne) and take a menial job at a community organization.At dinner, Matt suddenly bursts into tears, which sends his father and brothers into a panic. For all their liberal pieties, we see the full measure of the confusion and disgust with which they view his decisions. Matt is accused of martyring himself to minorities. \u201cAll our lives, guys like us have been told to get out of the way so that \u2018other\u2019 people can have a chance. Matt\u2019s actually doing what they want!\u201d his brother Jake, a banker, says. \u201cYou\u2019re making yourself invisible the way you think we\u2019re supposed to!\u201d Matt stays mostly silent as his family\u2019s arguments crest and crash around him. He responds later, in slightly Bartleby fashion, that he is just trying to find a way \u201cto be useful.\u201d\u201cStraight White Men\u201d looks like an Arthur Miller play and acts a bit like an Arthur Miller play, with its conflict between fathers and sons, between desire and obligation, between self and community. But it withholds some of the key satisfactions for which we go to Miller (or much of theater): motive, psychology, resolution.The play is, in fact, so open, so hospitable to interpretations, that every cast and crew member I talked to described a jarringly different production. For Kate Bornstein, the play drives home how all identities are becoming more capacious and can be transgressed: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who genuinely question their own privilege and do something about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are heterosexual white males who are fabulous \u2014 we\u2019ve got four of them in the play. I wouldn\u2019t call them straight white men.\u201d For Armie Hammer, \u201cthis is an inflammatory play. You\u2019re going to have straight white men who go see this and have to be confronted with the reality of their existence.\u201d Paul Schneider had yet another take: \u201cRegardless of race, gender or sexuality, for me all stories boil down to what our parents did or didn\u2019t do to us.\u201d\u201cStraight White Men\u201d was staged in 2014 at the Public Theater to warm reviews \u2014 Charles Isherwood, writing in The Times, called it \u201cmournful and inquisitive.\u201d But Lee worries about its reception today. The play lands in a season when President Trump\u2019s travel ban has just been upheld, immigrant families are being torn apart at the border, reproductive rights are under attack and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people are being energetically rolled back. The most salient fact about identity politics these days seems less that some straight white men feel diminished by its existence than that the identity politics of some straight white men threaten the existence of so many others.Lee told me she believes that her very decision to write about the plight of middle-aged, upper-middle-class, straight white men \u2014 to \u201ccenter their experiences,\u201d she said \u2014 might be enough to trigger a backlash. Schneider called her one night, wanting to discuss his character, and mentioned that one of his friends, a person of color, had read the play and said it was potentially dangerous. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations, which it clearly already has. But she won\u2019t deny that it feels particularly risky to stage it now, when \u201cthere is something dangerous about not just clearly demarcating the lines of combat, taking a side and fighting on that side.\u201dThe art that seems to speak most to the mood of the moment has that flavor \u2014 of getting in formation, of fighting the power. Take the movie \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d by Boots Riley, the Oakland-based rapper and activist, a science-fiction workplace comedy that\u2019s also a love letter to labor organizing. Or \u201cNanette,\u201d a new Netflix standup special by Hannah Gadsby, a rousing commentary on the #MeToo movement and the price of silence exacted on women and minorities. \u201cThe story is as you have told it \u2014 power belongs to you,\u201d Gadsby says, addressing straight white men. Lee allies herself with these conversations (and Riley is a hero of hers), but she stands slightly apart, asking unpopular questions, like what would really change if power were to simply switch hands. \u201cI don\u2019t hope for a future in which our existing structures stay the same, but I am the one on top,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post about the slogan \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201dHer plays, with their trickster energies, their interest in delicately destabilizing identity, remind me of what the critic Margo Jefferson called James Baldwin\u2019s \u201csyntactical miscegenation\u201d \u2014 the nebulous way he used the words \u201cour\u201d and \u201cyour,\u201d slipping without a signal from addressing his black readers to his white ones, sometimes in the same sentence, mingling them.The \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d in Lee\u2019s plays are always muddled. In \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven,\u201d even the characters\u2019 names continually change. The rudder in her work, and in her thinking, is this aversion to, and constant vigilance against, easy complacencies and groupthink. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d Lee told me more than once. It gave her the language to understand the racism she encountered as a child growing up in small-town Washington State. But its rhetoric has curdled, she feels. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re good or you\u2019re evil; you\u2019re a queer woman of color or you\u2019re some version of entitled privileged person,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like compassion is very out right now. Curiosity is out. What\u2019s in is condemnation and punishment. Now is not the moment for nuance; people do not want it.\u201dPullman was then, as well as now, a small, very white town. When it has made news, it has often been for its racism. Harassment of black students and faculty at the university led to the exit of 17 African-American faculty and staff members in the \u201990s, remembered by some as the \u201cblack exodus.\u201d In more recent years, members of the College Republicans erected a symbolic, Trump-style border wall on campus, and the group\u2019s president marched in last year\u2019s white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.\u201cWhen you talk to the young people now, they can\u2019t conceive the level of racism I experienced,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cI almost wasn\u2019t considered human. I didn\u2019t get to be in that category.\u201d When she was very young, she wasn\u2019t even sure what was behind the hatred: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on. I thought something was really wrong with me.\u201d She rarely discussed it with her parents, but her mother remembered how often Lee was sent home from school with stomachaches.Lee\u2019s relief at leaving Pullman for Berkeley, where she did her undergraduate and graduate studies, was so profound, she wept when she told me about her first day on campus. \u201cThere were so many Asian people, and nobody was making fun of them. My parents came for a visit early on, and they were like, \u2018Oh, my God, people are just eating rice on the street \u2014 there\u2019s no shame.\u2019 We used to hide that we ate rice.\u201d A boy talked to her, which had never happened before, and Lee ended up going on a date with him that night, her first, so stunned was she by the attention. She thrived in the embrace of a community but began to be troubled by certain tendencies. She had never taken to her parents\u2019 Christian faith \u2014 she started questioning it around age 7 \u2014 but she was discomfited by how Christians were summarily disparaged on campus and how easily she joined in. This kind of casual contempt for a group of people reminded her of her treatment at the hands of her classmates in Pullman. Lee\u2019s wariness of the crowd seems to have started there, a way of ensuring she would never become what she once feared.She majored in English and began a dissertation on \u201cKing Lear.\u201d She was attracted to \u201cLear\u201d for its wildness. The 17th-century source text is a taut piece of theater \u2014 beautifully plotted, something you\u2019d see on Broadway today, she told me. But Shakespeare stuffed it with insanity: \u201cHe loved crazy people, he loved fools. He could basically be an experimental playwright.\u201d She married a fellow student, a history Ph.D. But she was increasingly unhappy. Reverting back to childhood consolations, she bought herself a huge dollhouse with handcrafted furniture from Germany. A therapist asked her what she wanted to do, and she blurted out, to her surprise, \u201cBe a playwright.\u201d She discovered that she was studying Shakespeare only because she secretly wanted to write plays herself. \u201cIt was like being a veterinarian who says, \u2018I want to be a dog!\u2019\u2009\u201dHer husband dropped out of his Ph.D. program to go to law school at Yale. Lee followed him to New Haven and read through the work of all the playwrights on the faculty of the Yale School of Drama. One appealed to her the most: Jeffrey M. Jones, a scabrous and very funny experimentalist. She emailed him and asked him how to get started. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard life,\u201d she remembers him telling her. \u201cIf you can do anything else, do that.\u201d But she persisted, and he told her to call Mac Wellman.Since 1998, Wellman has run an M.F.A. program at Brooklyn College that has produced some of American theater\u2019s most innovative playwrights, including Thomas Bradshaw and Annie Baker. He loathes what he calls \u201cthe theater of the already known,\u201d and in the custom curriculum he prepares for each student, he dispenses gnomic advice: Write plays with your nondominant hand; write plays \u201ccovered with fur\u201d; insert, whenever possible, a farting dwarf.\u201cI listened to her on the phone,\u201d Wellman told me. \u201cHer voice was so intense, I thought, I\u2019m going to let her in. I don\u2019t even need to read anything.\u201d Lee separated from her husband and moved to New York (they eventually divorced). She floundered at first. She hadn\u2019t written much, and she was, Wellman recalled, paralyzed by self-criticism. \u201cWrite the worst possible play you can,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a parody. Just something really awful.\u201dThat play became \u201cThe Appeal\u201d (2004), a sendup of the romantic poets, whom Lee had always loathed. \u201cIt was such a pretentious, horrible idea for a play,\u201d she has said. \u201cIt was like a kid playing really sadistically with Barbie dolls. You stick their heads in the toilet, you throw them out the window. The characters were really annoying, and I wrote as badly as I could. When I got bored, I\u2019d restart the scene in the middle without throwing anything away, like a video-game reset.\u201d Wellman showed the play to the head of the Soho Repertory, who decided to stage it \u2014 and asked Lee to direct. She turned out to be a \u201cgenius director,\u201d Wellman said: She had a preternatural understanding of the stage, how to use it, how to talk to actors.In 2003, not yet 30, Lee formed her own theater company. Hwang, the head of the Columbia University M.F.A. program in playwriting, told me that young artists look to Lee \u201cas a kind of model not only aesthetically \u2014 in terms of being able to take risks and play with form \u2014 but also in terms of self-production and the amount of control she\u2019s had over her own work.\u201d In interviews, Lee has identified as a straight white man herself, only slightly tongue-in-cheek. She can echo her own lines from \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m ambitious and want power. ... People think of me as this empowered Asian female, but really, I\u2019m just a [expletive] white guy.\u201dFacebook is \u201ca huge part\u201d of her process, she said, a kind of crowdsourced dramaturgy. She runs lines by her friends, finds readers for scripts, does a little needling. Lately, as she works on her new play on class, her posts have sounded like this: \u201cWho are my Facebook friends who identify as Marxist, Socialist and/or Communist? I\u2019m always a little confused when people identify that way, especially if they are middle to upper class and involved with elite institutions. Does it mean you wish someone would take a bunch of your money away and redistribute it? That you are actively involved in organizing solidarity strikes? Is there any praxis required, or is it a label for an intellectual position? Not trying to be snarky, just trying to figure out if I\u2019m a Marxist or not.\u201dLee\u2019s usual process of teaming up with actors on scriptwriting didn\u2019t work with \u201cStraight White Men.\u201d In previous plays \u2014 on gender, Asian-American and black identity \u2014 the actors gave her more material than she could possibly use. \u201cYou would come to rehearsal and open the floodgates,\u201d she told me. But her straight white male actors were more reserved. \u201cThese men have not spent their entire lives experiencing their own identities; they don\u2019t have a lot of material. A lot of them said, \u2018I don\u2019t really identify as a straight white man because when I think of a straight white man, I think of a jock.\u2019\u2009\u201dWhile writing the play in 2014, Lee ended up interviewing dozens of straight white men and relying on a workshop of diverse college students. She asked them to vent about straight white men \u2014 and then asked them how they would like straight white men to behave. \u201cEveryone at the workshop was like: \u2018I want a straight white man to sit down and shut up. I want him to take a back seat, to take a supporting role. I don\u2019t want him to be aggressive,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018I want him to listen. I don\u2019t want him taking the head role or the biggest job or to be going after the biggest stuff. I want him in a supporting role to me.\u2019\u2009\u201dBut when she created a character according to these specifications, she was shocked to find that the workshop participants hated him. \u201cI realized that the reason they hated him was \u2014 despite all their commitment to social justice \u2014 what they believed in most was not being a loser.\u201dThat word \u2014 \u201closer\u201d \u2014 crops up a lot in Lee\u2019s work. From \u201cPullman, WA,\u201d set in her hometown, featuring three characters desperately trying to give a self-help seminar: \u201cYou are a loser,\u201d one says. \u201cYou\u2019re a loser because you were born that way. You will never be anything other than what you are.\u201d In \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d the brothers use it to goad Matt into action. (Jake: \u201cYou\u2019re just ... giving in to the total hopelessness of everything, being a loser for no reason?\u201d) Jake impatiently tries to school Matt to compete in the world, to master a job interview. The lesson is tantamount to a tutorial in straight white male drag. To earn the trust of other straight white men, Jake says, you must flawlessly pass as one: command space, do not shrink your body, keep your voice low and even, appear always at ease and, above all, conceal weakness.\u201cLoser\u201d is a word from childhood, of the blunt social distinctions of the playground. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite taunt. There\u2019s a particular, almost gendered sting to it \u2014 the way it frames the failure and suffering of men as shameful.Lee has always been interested in exposing how we perform our identities. But in \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d she drills into something more core. Shuck off, subvert, cleave to your gender or race all you like, but a universal horror of weakness remains \u2014 a collective orientation toward status, power, control.\u201cYou have to meet Chris,\u201d Hammer said to Lee. The crowd parted for him; he took Lee over to Chris Rock and promptly appeared to forget about her. He, Riley and Rock began talking animatedly, lovingly yelling into one another\u2019s faces. One of Hammer\u2019s assistants materialized at his elbow, wordlessly put a beer into his hand and vanished. Hammer took a sip from the bottle without seeming to wonder how it got there. Lee kept waiting, hands clasped. But the longer the three men talked, the closer they moved together, blotting out the room, a calyx of celebrity and mutual regard.Lee told me then about the dollhouse from Germany she bought herself while in her Ph.D. program as a reward for a dissertation she would never complete. But she couldn't play with it anymore: \u201cI was too old.\u201d She kept it, though. And even though it was late, and she looked tired and ready to be rid of me, she invited me up to see it.Lee lives with her boyfriend, a reality-television showrunner who is working on a program about people who have been attacked by wild animals. He was not home. Their place had the feel of an airport hotel, cramped and impersonal with only functional necessities: a chair here, a table there. I liked it immensely. It was clearly occupied by people who made things, who slept here but really lived in their minds.Lee pointed out the dollhouse to me, although she didn\u2019t need to. Wedged between the couch and a desk, it eats up a huge amount of space in the living room \u2014 hulking, honey-colored, reaching my shoulder. It has a working elevator.She gestured at it, perplexed. \u201cIt\u2019s this thing I\u2019m hanging onto that I don\u2019t want.\u201d She told me I could play with it, if I wanted to, and sat down at her computer.I knelt and started to play. The facade lifted clean off. It was cobwebby inside, a bit of a crime scene. A doll lay face down on the floor next to the bed. The chairs were toppled, dishes scattered. I restored the candlestick to the mantel and wiped a film of dust off the dining table.What did you play? I asked. There were only two real narrative strands, she told me. Order and disorder. One doll would go crazy \u2014 turn \u201ctoxic\u201d \u2014 and destroy the house. The others would be distraught. Then Lee would set it to rights, putting everything back in its place. The fun, she said, was in being able to corral the disorder. The fun was in putting the people where they should go.Parul Sehgal is a book critic for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s Some Cryptocurrency. Now Please Use It.", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 You may have seen the actor and part-time tech investor Ashton Kutcher present $4 million worth of digital coins called XRP to Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s favorite charity on her talk show. Or maybe you saw Stephen Colbert announce a $29 million donation of XRP to schoolteachers on his late-night show.Ripple, a San Francisco company that is rolling in money thanks to last year\u2019s run-up in the value of cryptocurrencies, was behind the giveaways. And it has quietly become one of the most valuable start-ups of the last decade thanks to the value of XRP, the digital token its founders created six years ago.Now comes the hard part: persuading people to use XRP for something other than speculative trading. It is an issue facing most of the still-young cryptocurrency industry. Digital tokens like Bitcoin and its many imitators (like XRP) were designed to make electronic transactions of all sorts easier. But today almost no transactions are happening, other than on virtual currency exchanges where people bet on their price.Despite a dramatic drop in the value of cryptocurrencies this year, Ripple still owns $30 billion worth of XRP, and the company wants to get some of those digital tokens into the hands of potential users.\u201cIt\u2019s still really, really early days, but we are seeing the vision come to life,\u201d said Asheesh Birla, the head of product at Ripple. \u201cI need to make sure it\u2019s in the hands of the right folks.\u201dBut few cryptocurrency projects have evolved to the point where anyone is using the tokens as anything other than an investment.Many people who bought the digital tokens created by these projects did so in the belief they will one day be useful for real transactions of some sort. If the projects want to keep those investors from selling, the projects have to convince them the tokens will have some long-term value.A company known as Block.One, for example, raised $4 billion from investors before it even had functioning software. Now it is using some of the billions it has raised to create investment funds that will encourage developers to work on making its cryptocurrency, EOS, useful.But no project is sitting on more money than Ripple, because of the unusual structure of the XRP cryptocurrency.Bitcoin and most other well-known cryptocurrencies are slowly created over time and given away to computers on the network, with no company or authority in charge. In contrast, most XRP tokens \u2014 about 60 percent \u2014 are held by Ripple.In January, the value of an XRP token briefly rose above $3, making a co-founder of the company, Chris Larsen, wealthier than Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg for a short time, and Ripple worth more than most banks in the world.Since then, the value of an XRP has dropped about 80 percent. But investors have kept the price around 50 cents and the value of the company\u2019s holdings of XRP around $30 billion \u2014 more than the valuation of WeWork or SpaceX.The company\u2019s business model has drawn in big-name investors, including Mr. Kutcher\u2019s venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, which helps explain his appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in May.But Ripple\u2019s enormous holdings come with significant risks. The biggest legal concern facing many cryptocurrency projects is regulators in the United States categorizing their tokens as investment contracts, or securities.If projects like XRP and EOS get the security label, they will be subject to restrictions on trading and movement, making it even less likely that people will use the tokens for their intended purposes.Ripple\u2019s executives have said they are confident XRP is not a security because XRP could still be used even if the company disappeared. The company hired Mary Jo White, who was chairwoman of the S.E.C. from 2013 to 2017, to defend it against lawsuits from disgruntled XRP investors who claim the company misled them.But the situation is something of a Catch-22 for Ripple: Its efforts to promote XRP could demonstrate how reliant XRP is on Ripple.\u201cCentralized control of a cryptocurrency is the central element to the S.E.C.\u2019s test of whether these tokens are securities,\u201d said Lawson Baker, a lawyer and venture capitalist in the cryptocurrency industry. \u201cAny time you are putting XRP to work to defend it or buy good will, you are going to hurt your case that you aren\u2019t a security.\u201dIf regulators don\u2019t label XRP a security, the focus will return to what kind of traction the cryptocurrency can get in the real world.Ripple has advertised the success it has had with software called xCurrent, which helps banks move money between international accounts more quickly than existing alternatives. But xCurrent doesn\u2019t rely on the XRP token.So who would take a risk on using XRP?Mr. Birla, Ripple\u2019s head of product, is betting the first companies to use XRP will be remittance and money-transfer companies that have to pay banks to move money for them. XRP comes with few of the fees that banks charge and, while bank systems close on nights and weekends, the digital tokens can be moved any time.Ripple announced this year that several big money-transfer companies, including Western Union and MoneyGram, were doing pilot programs with XRP.Currencies Direct is among a handful of smaller companies have also tried out XRP. The British outfit moved money between the United States and Mexico, and found XRP \u201con par or slightly cheaper\u201d than its existing method, said Brian Harris, the company\u2019s chief product officer.But Currencies Direct isn\u2019t planning to integrate XRP into its business right now, Mr. Harris said, because Ripple does not yet serve most of the countries where his company works.\u201cThey aren\u2019t in any of the markets where we need them to be yet,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wait-and-see game as to how they are able to build out that network.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Go Home, South Korea Tells Workers, as Stress Takes Its Toll", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Lee Han-bit helped produce a television series called \u201cDrinking Solo,\u201d in which young adults cramming for a high-stakes civil service exam often drink to relieve anxiety. But working weeks without a break and asking his own employees to work 20-hour days, Mr. Lee was consumed by pressures of his own.\u201cI too was nothing but a laborer,\u201d Mr. Lee wrote. But to them, he added, \u201cI was nothing more or less than a manager who squeezed the laborers.\u201dMr. Lee\u2019s message reverberated across South Korea, a country that has long worked too hard.South Korea\u2019s leaders are trying to change that. A new law that went into effect this month caps workweeks for many employees at 52 hours. The government is pushing companies to let employees go home for the night and to free up their weekends. A call to the Ministry of Labor is greeted with a recorded voice message that says, \u201cOur society is breaking away from overwork.\u201dThe extra time off is especially liberating for young workers, who often don\u2019t share the work-at-all-cost ethos of their parents.\u201cMy colleagues and I say that we would rather go home earlier than work long hours, even if we were paid for working overtime,\u201d Ms. Woo said.South Korea\u2019s feelings about work are complex. Pride in hard work helped propel the once-rural country out of the ashes of war and transform it into an economic power, producing brands like Samsung and Hyundai that are known all over the world.Working long hours also used to be seen as a badge of honor, especially for the male breadwinner in a patriarchal society. But even then, some workers called attention to difficult conditions. The self-immolation of a factory worker at the start of the 1970s labor movement is still evoked by activists today.The incident and workplace deaths \u2014 including the suicide of Mr. Lee, the television producer \u2014 have given new urgency to South Korea\u2019s efforts to change its workplace culture.When a government employee, a new mother, died last year after collapsing at her office on a Sunday morning, President Moon Jae-in, who was still a candidate at the time, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe can no longer be a society where overwork and working until late is a given.\u201dNor are long work hours good for the economy. Labor productivity has slowed considerably, while unemployment among young people has reached 10 percent despite a much lower national rate over all.Mr. Moon, who was elected last year, and labor experts blame outdated workplace practices, including those in government, that allow managers to keep employees on call to complete tasks as they come up. Though that system gives managers more flexibility to assign work, it does not necessarily benefit the organization as a whole.\u201cIt worked in the past when Koreans were hungry,\u201d said Yu Gyu-chang, a professor of human resources management at Hanyang University. \u201cBut times have changed now.\u201d\u201cHabitual long-extended work has been the culprit behind Korea\u2019s low labor productivity,\u201d he said this month after the workweek cap took effect.That message has found a sympathetic audience among the young in South Korea, who have learned to prize their leisure time as old attitudes have loosened. Until a five-day workweek was introduced in 2004, many South Koreans did not experience free Saturdays.Many companies are enacting new policies to comply. More than 700 of South Korea\u2019s 3,672 large companies and public sector organizations have either hired new employees or have plans to do so, the Ministry of Labor said, although it did not track whether these new hires would be working full time.Other organizations have introduced policies to limit routine overtime work. Seoul\u2019s city government began in May to enforce mandatory lights out and computer shutdowns on Fridays at 7 p.m.At the insurance company where Park Jung-min, 46, works, computers are automatically shut off at 6 p.m. Employees are also encouraged to request advance permission to work overtime.\u201cIf we don\u2019t know in advance that we might have to work after 6 p.m., then we have to turn on the computer again after 6 and provide reasons for doing so,\u201d said Mr. Park, who described it as an occasional nuisance. \u201cBut all in all, I think this new 52-hour workweek is good for our work-life balance that Koreans now want more of.\u201dLoopholes still abound, critics say. It isn\u2019t clear whether business trips or entertaining clients would count toward the 52-hour cap. Some industries, like health care and transportation, have received exemptions. Companies could also find other ways to avoid hiring more people.\u201cEmployees would take their work home, which would be an unspoken agreement between bosses and underlings,\u201d said Kim Yu-kyong, a public labor attorney at the Organization for the Human Rights of Workers.The Union for Broadcast Workers, which was formed by freelance employees in the television industry after the new law went into effect earlier this month, said it received more than 30 complaints within the first two days. One employee, it said, worked from 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. and was asked to report to work at 7 a.m. the following day.Though it will be another two years before the maximum work hours are enforced for smaller companies, many see the mandate for reduced work hours as long overdue.\u201cIt has to work,\u201d Mr. Kim of the Union for Broadcast Workers said. \u201cSo far, the existing practice had been too inhumane.\u201dSu-Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Restaurant Takes On the Opioid Crisis, One Worker at a Time ", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere in Lexington, a charming, pasture-draped city known around the world for its horse farms, there hasn\u2019t been a single day since July 2016 when paramedics have not administered Narcan, the lifesaving drug for opioid overdoses, to at least one person, said Lt. Jessica Bowman, a public information officer for the Lexington Fire Department.Cooking, in particular, he sees as \u201c100 percent therapy.\u201d In making bread, for example, \u201cthere is something magic about kneading the dough side by side with someone else, not making eye contact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very tactile and freeing.\u201d\u201cMy guess is that they wanted to meet people where they were,\u201d Mr. Perez said, but \u201cI didn\u2019t see a spark in people\u2019s eyes, or pride in the food. I didn\u2019t see professional behavior. I could always tell who the heroin addicts were.\u201d Many of these places, including one of the couple\u2019s favorites, Blochead Pizza in Cincinnati, ended up closing.The couple also hire from and work directly with treatment centers, adding an additional level of accountability for employees.\u201cWe are not certified experts on this, nor do we claim to be,\u201d Ms. Perez said. \u201cWe are just providing the piece of the puzzle that is giving people a job right away when they are getting clean.\u201d The menu is simple \u2014 sandwiches, salads, eggs, baked goods \u2014 and intended to teach widely applicable cooking skills. Employees greet every guest, bus every table, learn to cook sous vide, and bake their own bread for the sandwiches.Initially, business at DV8 Kitchen was slow: The restaurant, which proclaims its mission on its website and on the front of each menu, lost $30,000 in its first five months. \u201cWhen people heard \u2018second chance,\u2019 they were either concerned with their personal safety, or they were thinking second chance means second rate,\u201d Mr. Perez said.The couple soon realized that they couldn\u2019t offer dinner service, since most of their employees \u2014 18 out of 23 are in what Mr. Perez calls active recovery \u2014 had to attend support meetings at night. The Perezes leaned into breakfast and lunch, pushing the homemade breads and baked goods. By March, they said, the restaurant was turning a profit. It started selling the bread wholesale to other restaurants, and DV8 was one of a few places in town that catered breakfast. The hefty cinnamon rolls, made with croissant dough to add more labor to the process, have drawn a cult following.Marsha Elliott, an office manager at Berea College, south of Lexington, said she originally stopped by DV8 because she had heard the food was good; she only later learned about its purpose. Now, she visits whenever she is in the area. On a recent afternoon, she carried a box containing two cream cheese muffins (her favorite) and four cinnamon rolls.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t pay $4 for a cinnamon roll anywhere else here, but I don\u2019t mind paying a little extra to help people get back on their feet,\u201d she said.Another regular, Jason Johnston, the director of teaching and learning at the University of Kentucky College of Social Work, had the opposite experience: He came because of the social mission, then discovered that \u201cthe food was actually really good,\u201d he said. (Mr. Johnston had two cinnamon rolls on his table for one.)He said he brings friends to DV8, but often doesn\u2019t tell them that the place is staffed by workers recovering from addiction. When he reveals the truth, \u201cthey are always surprised,\u201d he said.After nine months in business, DV8 seems to be serving its dual purpose as restaurant and recovery setting.Dan Rison, 29, who greets customers and serves dishes, among other tasks, said he first started taking pain medication when he was 14, after an operation intended to correct a birth defect. He eventually became an alcoholic, was arrested and pleaded guilty to cashing a forged check, and went to jail.When he got out, he was unable to hold down a job for more than a few months, and once he did find one that he liked, at an antique store, \u201cthere was a lot of drug and alcohol abuse during the workday,\u201d he said. \u201cI stopped caring whether or not I lived.\u201d This is his first restaurant job, and the environment at DV8, he said, builds camaraderie.\u201cIn the darkest part of my addiction, I isolated myself,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, if you withdraw, the guest will notice you aren\u2019t bringing their food or asking how they are doing. Your co-workers will notice if you don\u2019t have a smile on your face.\u201d At DV8, he added, he doesn\u2019t have to hide his past \u2014 everything is out in the open.Mr. Rison is 19 credits away from earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, and would like to earn his master\u2019s in the same subject, so he can give others with addictions the kind of help he received.Jennifer Ratliff, 42, a cashier and cook, used to work at a Cracker Barrel and a Waffle House, \u201cbut a lot of people came in high,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no understanding or togetherness.\u201dWorking the grill, she said, \u201cis a huge coping skill for me.\u201d Making burgers, \u201cadding the spices, the egg on top, making the homemade Dijonnaise,\u201d and then seeing customers\u2019 reaction when they take a bite, brings \u201ca sense of accomplishment,\u201d she said.Hoang Dong, DV8\u2019s general manager, who worked with Mr. and Ms. Perez at their Saul Good restaurants, said he was concerned at first \u201cabout whether or not these people were going to be aggressive, or trainable, or relapse,\u201d he said. Instead, \u201ceveryone is wanting to turn their lives around, and they hold each other accountable.\u201dThe most difficult part, he said, is that the restaurant doesn\u2019t have enough jobs to keep up with the number of applicants. \u201cThere was a guy I had to turn down from employment because we were full, and he died of overdose a week later,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there is not much we could have done, but I felt horrible. What if I had hired him, and he had a chance?\u201dLocal treatment centers are thrilled about their members\u2019 progress, and how closely they are able to work with DV8.Several local restaurateurs who have also had workers with addictions said that approach seemed difficult to sustain.The low turnover rate at DV8 Kitchen suggests it can be otherwise. Only five of the 25 or so recovering people they have hired have left because of a relapse or firing. (The national turnover rate for the hospitality industry, by comparison, was 70 percent in 2016, according to the National Restaurant Association.)Mr. and Ms. Perez have been lobbying the state government for money to help open other DV8 restaurants, and for incentives for businesses to hire people in recovery from addictions.Every Tuesday at 3 p.m., the restaurant holds a mandatory workshop for employees. Lawyers explain how to get criminal convictions expunged from records, accountants talk personal finance and professional athletes discuss teamwork.At one recent workshop, Vitale Buford, a transformational coach who was addicted to prescription drugs, quizzed workers about the everyday troubles they take for granted. \u201cWhat are you tolerating?\u201d Ms. Buford asked.The employees scribbled down their answers: not getting custody of their children, being 50 pounds overweight, having strained relationships with parents. Then Ms. Buford told them to write all their excuses for tolerating these problems on a piece of paper, and toss it into the garbage.As they turned, one by one, toward the trash bin to discard their worries, the backs of their uniforms became visible.Advertisement"}

Al Sharpton told an audience on Saturday at the Harlem headquarters of his organization, the National Action Network.\u201cSome yellow cabs won\u2019t even go uptown or to parts of Brooklyn,\u201d Mr. Sharpton later said in an interview. \u201cIf you are downtown they won\u2019t stop.\u201dThe package of proposed legislation from the Council, which could be voted on as soon as Aug. 8, would stop new for-hire vehicle licenses while the impact of their growing presence was studied. That could lead to a cap on the number of for-hire vehicles, which would be a first for a major American city.There are more than 100,000 for-hire vehicles in New York City, up from 63,000 in 2015, according to the city. More than 80,000 of them are associated with ride-hailing apps.Other bills in front of the Council would set a minimum wage for drivers and authorize the taxi commission to study whether to set a minimum fare; create a new license for high-volume, for-hire vehicle services; and waive the licensing fee for wheelchair-accessible vehicles.\u201cI understand the concerns about people of color being denied service, but I want to make clear that we are not diminishing service,\u201d Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said. \u201cThe vehicles that are out there now will remain out there.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are not saying Uber is bad. They have met a significant need. We are saying the industry needs to be regulated.\u201dMr. Johnson said the legislation would allow vehicles to be added to specific neighborhoods if the taxi commission determined that access to service was being hurt during the yearlong study. Wheelchair-accessible vehicles could also be added.Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents drivers of yellow cabs and for-hire vehicles, said it was important to discuss transportation in the context of civil rights.\u201cRace-based refusal is a serious issue among yellow taxis and in the Uber and Lyft world,\u201d Ms. Desai said. \u201cBut Uber and Lyft don\u2019t have a supply problem, they have an efficiency problem.\u201dFor-hire drivers in the city, many of whom are nonwhite immigrants, are being hurt because the roads are oversaturated with vehicles, Ms. Desai said. Ride-hailing vehicles and yellow taxis were empty a third of the time while in Manhattan\u2019s central business district, according to the 2017 report by Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official.\u201cDefending the oversaturation which has resulted in the deep poverty of a work force made up of immigrants of color is not a civil rights position, it is the antithesis,\u201d Ms. Desai said.\u201cWe are growing fastest in the outer rings of the outer boroughs because we are serving communities that have been ignored by yellow taxis and taken for granted by the M.T.A.,\u201d said Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Uber statistics, he said, show that ridership in neighborhoods such as East New York in Brooklyn and Kingsbridge in the Bronx had more than doubled since this time last year.Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Rice say their nonprofits have received donations from for-hire companies such as Uber and Lyft. The taxi industry has donated money to the campaigns of Mr. de Blasio and members of the City Council, including Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr., chairman of the Committee on For-Hire Vehicles.Mr. Johnson, who was against the 2015 push to cap the growth of for-hire vehicles, now says the concerns are too much to ignore.\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the level of congestion, the explosive, unbridled growth of for-hire vehicles and the number of taxi drivers who have taken their lives,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m for us figuring out a sound public policy solution.\u201dThose assurances are not enough for those who oppose the plan.\u201cThis does not directly deal with the historic and current problem of yellow cabs\u2019 bias of servicing us in our community,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said.The Rev.

{"Headline": "The Legacy of Monticello\u2019s Black First Family", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recently opened exhibit at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Virginia estate gives new recognition to Sally Hemings and the role of slavery in the home \u2014 and in his family.Mr. Staples is a member of the editorial board. Plantation wives in the slave-era South resorted to willful blindness when their husbands conscripted black women as sexual servants and filled the household with mixed-race children who inevitably resembled the master. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s wife, Martha, was several years dead when he set off on this path, fathering at least six children with Martha\u2019s enslaved black half sister, Sally Hemings. The task of dissembling fell to the remaining white Jeffersons, who aided in a cover-up that held sway for two centuries and feigned ignorance of a relationship between Jefferson and Hemings that lasted nearly four decades.We learn from Madison\u2019s account that during that time in France, Sally Hemings became pregnant with Jefferson\u2019s child and considered remaining in the country, where she would be a free woman, instead of returning to slavery in Virginia. She agreed to return only after Jefferson promised her \u201cextraordinary privileges\u2019\u2019 and gave a \u201csolemn pledge\u201d to free any children the two might have once they reached adulthood. Jefferson kept his pledge, making Sally Hemings the only enslaved parent at Monticello to see all of her children freed.Madison refers to Jefferson affectionately as \u201cfather\u201d throughout his memoir, noting that he was \u201cuniformly kind to all about him,\u201d but as the historian Jan Ellen Lewis has written, \u201cThe Hemings children knew \u2026 that they were the disfavored children of a loving and powerful man.\u201d Indeed, Madison depicts his family at Monticello as lying beyond the reach of the warmth and congeniality that Jefferson reflexively extended to his white grandchildren.Madison seemed genuinely and affectionately interested in his white relatives \u2014 who never acknowledged their black relations and referred to them as slaves, \u201cthese parties\u201d or \u201cthe yellow children.\u201d He cast a gimlet eye on James Madison\u2019s wife, Dolley, who was visiting Monticello when he was born and promised Sally Hemings a gift in exchange for naming him Madison: \u201cBut like many promises of white folks to the slaves,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cshe never gave my mother anything.\u201dThis places Sally Hemings at the center of plantation life, where she clearly belongs. It also shows that Jefferson\u2019s baronial mountaintop estate was just like any other plantation when it came to matters of sexual conduct.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dying Organs Restored to Life in Novel Experiments", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe healing edgeAn unusual transplant may revive tissues thought to be hopelessly damaged, including the heart and brain.When Georgia Bowen was born by emergency cesarean on May 18, she took a breath, threw her arms in the air, cried twice, and went into cardiac arrest. Doctors kept her alive with a cumbersome machine that did the work of her heart and lungs. The physicians moved her from Massachusetts General Hospital, where she was born, to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and decided to try an experimental procedure that had never before been attempted in a human being following a heart attack. Mitochondria are tiny organelles that fuel the operation of the cell, and they are among the first parts of the cell to die when it is deprived of oxygen-rich blood. Once they are lost, the cell itself dies. But a series of experiments has found that fresh mitochondria can revive flagging cells and enable them to quickly recover. In animal studies at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and elsewhere, mitochondrial transplants revived heart muscle that was stunned from a heart attack but not yet dead, and revived injured lungs and kidneys. Infusions of mitochondria also prolonged the time organs could be stored before they were used for transplants, and even ameliorated brain damage that occurred soon after a stroke. In the only human tests, mitochondrial transplants appear to revive and restore heart muscle in infants that was injured in operations to repair congenital heart defects. For Georgia, though, the transplant was a long shot \u2014 a heart attack is different from a temporary loss of blood during an operation, and the prognosis is stark. There is only a short time between the onset of a heart attack and the development of scar tissue where once there were living muscle cells. The problem was that no one knew when the baby\u2019s heart attack had occurred. Still, said Dr. Sitaram Emani, a pediatric heart surgeon who administered the transplant, there was little risk to the infant and a chance, though slim, that some cells affected by her heart attack might still be salvageable. \u201cThey gave her a fighting chance,\u201d said the infant\u2019s mother, Kate Bowen, 36, of Duxbury, Mass. Dr. Emani is a pediatric surgeon. Dr. McCully is a scientist who studies adult hearts. Both were wrestling with the same problem: how to fix hearts that had been deprived of oxygen during surgery or a heart attack. \u201cIf you cut off oxygen for a long time, the heart barely beats,\u201d Dr. McCully said. The cells may survive, but they may never fully recover. While preparing to give a talk to surgeons, Dr. McCully created electron micrographs of damaged cells. The images turned out to be revelatory: The mitochondria in the damaged heart cells were abnormally small and translucent, instead of a healthy black.The mitochondria were damaged \u2014 and nothing Dr. McCully tried revived them. One day, he decided simply to pull some mitochondria from healthy cells and inject them into the injured cells. Working with pigs, he took a plug of abdominal muscle the size of a pencil eraser, whirled it in a blender to break the cells apart, added some enzymes to dissolve cell proteins, and spun the mix in a centrifuge to isolate the mitochondria. He recovered between 10 billion and 30 billion mitochondria, and injected one billion directly into the injured heart cells. To his surprise, the mitochondria moved like magnets to the proper places in the cells and began supplying energy. The pig hearts recovered.Meanwhile, Dr. Emani was struggling with the same heart injuries in his work with babies. Many of his patients are newborns who need surgery to fix life-threatening heart defects. Sometimes during or after such an operation, a tiny blood vessel gets kinked or blocked.The heart still functions, but the cells that were deprived of oxygen beat slowly and feebly. But one day Dr. Emani was told of Dr. McCully\u2019s work, and the two researchers met. \u201cIt was almost an \u2018aha\u2019 moment,\u201d Dr. Emani said. Dr. McCully moved to Boston Children\u2019s, and he and Dr. Emani prepared to see if the new technique might help tiny babies who were the sickest of the sick \u2014 those surviving on Ecmo.It was not long before they had their first patient. The baby was on an Ecmo but his heart had not recovered.\u201cWe turned the intensive care unit into an operating room,\u201d Dr. Emani said. He snipped a tiny piece of muscle from the baby\u2019s abdomen. Dr. McCully grabbed it and raced down the hall. Twenty minutes later, he was back with a test tube of the precious mitochondria. Dr. Emani used an echocardiogram to determine where to inject them. \u201cThe spot that is weakest is where we want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to give as much of a boost as you can.\u201dWithin two days, the baby had a normal heart, strong and beating quickly. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Dr. Emani said. The scientists have now treated 11 babies with mitochondria, and all but one were able to come off Ecmo, Dr. Emani said. Still, three of them ultimately died, which Dr. Emani attributes to a delay in treatment and other causes. Two died because their hearts were still so damaged, and one died of an infection. All of the more recent patients survived and are doing well. In comparison, the death rate among a similar group of babies that did not get mitochondrial transplants was 65 percent. And none of the untreated babies recovered any of their heart function \u2014 more than a third of the survivors ended up on heart transplant lists.He and his colleagues are persuaded that these transplants work, but acknowledge that it would take a randomized trial to prove it. The main problem is a scarcity of patients. Even if every pediatric center in the United States participated, along with every infant with injured heart muscle, it still would be hard to enroll enough participants in the trial.But what about adult heart patients? Researchers are hoping that mitochondrial transplants also can repair heart muscle damaged during heart attacks in adults. And finding enough of those patients should not be an issue, said Dr. Peter Smith, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Duke University.Already researchers are planning such a trial. The plan is to infuse mitochondria or a placebo solution into the coronary arteries of people having bypass surgery or \u2014 an even more dire situation for the heart \u2014 having both bypass and valve surgery. The patients would be those whose hearts are so damaged that it would be difficult to wean them from heart-lung machines after surgery. For these desperate patients, mitochondrial transplants \u201care a really intriguing option,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cThe likelihood is very high\u201d that the study will begin next year, said Annetine Gelijns, a biostatistician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.But, to be safe, they put her on a list for a heart transplant. She seems to be improving, though \u2014 she is breathing on her own and can drink breast milk through a tube. Her heart is showing signs of healing. \u201cGeorgia is a miracle who continues to fight daily and persevere through the obstacles she is dealt,\u201d Ms. Bowen said.\u201cIn our hearts, we know she will pull through this and come home.\u201d Because of an editing error, a previous version of this article referred incorrectly to the source of the mitochondria infused into Georgia Bowen. They were taken from neck muscle, not abdominal muscle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Boxing Taught Me About Love", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveAfter being assaulted in a park, a young woman sought refuge in marriage. When that didn\u2019t work, she stepped into the ring. I was 32 and living in Washington Heights the year I should have fallen in love. Something else happened instead: A man tried to rape me on my way home from work.It was mid-October, and I was walking in a park near the George Washington Bridge. I had been caught off guard by how quickly darkness fell that evening and was already feeling spooked when I caught sight of a man running through the bushes beside the path.Despite the fear, I forced myself to stop and stare, to wait for him to see that I had noticed him.Robbed of the chance to take me by surprise, he had to think of another way to play it. So before he attacked me, he walked beside me for maybe 20 yards, saying, albeit clumsily, some of the most romantic things a man can say to a woman: that I was beautiful, that he wanted to be with me forever, that he wanted to marry me.He also said, mixed in with the romantic stuff, that he knew where I lived, that he had been watching me. We came to the bridge over the railroad tracks. As a train passed under, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die tonight.\u201dThen he grabbed my throat, pushed me against the fencing, forced his tongue into my mouth, pulled at my clothes.He was wrong; that wasn\u2019t my night to die. I drove my thumb deep into his eye, made him let go of me and walked away: bruised, breathless, spitting the taste of him from my mouth. Shaking with fear, I forced myself not to run, because I had learned in self-defense class that running makes you prey.I called the police and they came, but they didn\u2019t find him. I went to my apartment and brushed my teeth, but I never slept there again because the stranger had said he knew where I lived.So I called a guy I had started seeing, Ralph, and moved in with him, more or less, that same night. Within a year, Ralph and I were married. Two years later, we had a daughter.I got married, I now realize, because I was afraid.I brought an immense sense of gratitude and relief with me into marriage, and not only because I was recovering from a traumatic attack. Already, in my mid-30s, I had been scared of ending up alone.Gratitude and fear are strong emotions, but they may not be the right ones to sustain a marriage. Ours lasted five years; the divorce, a bitter one, dragged on for three.During those years, I lost touch with that grateful feeling; I wouldn\u2019t remember it at all if I hadn\u2019t written it down. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful to him,\u201d I had scribbled in the pages of a sketchbook, \u201cfor giving me refuge.\u201dIf I had found those pages during the divorce, I might have thrown them out, denied they ever existed. But I only found them recently, when I came to understand that I\u2019m still facing all the same fears.Now, at 47 \u2014 six years after my divorce \u2014 I\u2019m that much closer to ending up alone. You might say I already have ended up that way. I own my home; I have some semblance of a career; my daughter will soon be a teenager. People have started to ask me why I\u2019m single.I tell them I\u2019m not looking for love anymore, but this is a lie. When I see two lovers kissing or hugging, even onscreen, my heart jumps and begs like a dog to treats. But taking the next step seems beyond me. I\u2019ve begun to wonder if that October night is the reason. Those two events \u2014 being attacked, getting married \u2014 happened so close together that they are perhaps too tangled up in my mind to separate.I\u2019m not the first to notice that romantic comedies sometimes hinge on stalker-ish obsession. I have never been the most trusting person, and now I may be so wary that normal signs of interest read as signs of danger.I don\u2019t watch romantic comedies anymore.I have taken up boxing. My trainer tells me I have a tendency to drop my right hand. \u201cThat leaves you open,\u201d he says, aiming a punch that stops short of my jaw. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be open.\u201dHe\u2019s right: I don\u2019t want to be open. Even so, I start dating, mostly because everyone says I should.\u201cYou have to treat it like a job,\u201d a friend\u2019s father tells me. \u201cMake a spreadsheet.\u201d He found his girlfriend on a dating site.My profile describes me as \u201csweet,\u201d \u201cshy,\u201d \u201ca good listener.\u201d The prevailing wisdom says you need good pictures, which I have. Maybe they\u2019re too good. One man complimented me on my pictures, which was nice of him, but then he started sending me porn. This, it seems, is part of dating online: People send porn.\u201cYou need to make a list,\u201d my friend Lisa says. Lisa found love online after listing the qualities she wanted in a man: passionate, funny, close with his family.I don\u2019t have a list. All I want is what I\u2019ve always wanted, to love someone who loves me back the same way.I think about putting that in my profile, but it sounds too sincere, too unguarded. I am not like that anymore; it would be misleading. And what if I were to put that out there and all I got back was porn?I meet men for drinks but sip club soda. In six months of dating I go to dinner only once, drink alcohol only twice. It isn\u2019t that men don\u2019t want to buy me dinner; they do. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t make myself trust these strangers.I make a rule that I\u2019ll only meet people for coffee, but then a guy shows up high for our coffee date and I rule out coffee dates. It starts to seem, admittedly, like I\u2019m finding excuses not to get invested.By now I\u2019m boxing four mornings a week. In a shift from our typical conversations about keeping up that right hand, my trainer tells me one day that he writes love poetry. He knows I\u2019m a writer; he asks if I\u2019ll read it.\u201cOf course,\u201d I say. But I\u2019m unprepared for what he shows me. For one thing, it\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s about a woman he dated; they\u2019re not together anymore.\u201cDid she read this?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d He shrugs.I sit with the shock of this. I try to imagine showing my ex-husband those sketchbook pages about gratitude. It\u2019s an act of vulnerability that, for me, is past imagining. How is this boxer, the embodiment of toughness, more capable of taking emotional risks than I am?I\u2019m not that strong, not yet. If I learned one thing from marriage, it\u2019s that finding a man to protect me isn\u2019t the answer. I don\u2019t need that anymore; maybe I never did. I protected myself that October night, and if anything, I\u2019m tougher now. But maybe there is another kind of strength I need to learn.\u201cYou should stay with this,\u201d I tell the boxing poet. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201dI get better about keeping my right hand up. I change my online profile, taking out \u201cshy\u201d and \u201csweet.\u201d No one reads that stuff, anyway. Instead, I start using \u201cbloodthirsty,\u201d \u201ccapricious\u201d and \u201ctyrannical.\u201dThe number of swipes doesn\u2019t seem to change. Who are these men who look at pictures and don\u2019t read words?My last profile reads: \u201cVicious and frightening ice queen seeks charismatic, indomitable king. Intense qualification process culminates in a fight to the death with my other suitors. Swipe if u dare!\u201dMen swipe as usual, because, well, why not?Still, I go home one night after a pretty normal date \u2014 with a guy who clearly hadn\u2019t read what I wrote \u2014 and delete everything.It doesn\u2019t feel like a major decision. I don\u2019t think much about it until a friend mentions she\u2019s being recruited for a job at a big online dating site. \u201cThey\u2019re rebranding,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s your user experience been like?\u201d\u201cI stopped doing it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t making me feel anything I wanted to feel.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re giving up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201dAnd I\u2019m not. I just don\u2019t want to make spreadsheets and lists. I don\u2019t want to date someone for the sake of dating someone. I want the real thing.Despite everything, I still believe he\u2019s out there. Life isn\u2019t worth living without at least the idea of someone to love. But if he really exists \u2014 my charismatic, indomitable king \u2014 not only will he have to find me, he\u2019ll also have to battle through my defenses.The good news, my love (if you\u2019re reading this), is there isn\u2019t really a fight to the death.

But more about that in a moment.In the meantime, I\u2019d like to present the platform of my new Republican Party. It consists of things formerly believed by, you know, the Republican Party.First, my party supports civil rights. It was Ulysses S. Grant, the second Republican president, who fought for and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which gave African-Americans equal treatment in public accommodations and public transportation and prohibited their exclusion from jury service. In his spare time, Grant also wiped out the earliest version of the Ku Klux Klan. The Trump Party, meanwhile, casts its eyes upon white supremacists and neo-Nazis and declares them \u201cvery fine people.\u201d My new Republican Party believes in some limitations on federal spending, including deficit reduction.The Trump Party has created a budget that is projected for the first time to regularly produce deficits of over a trillion dollars, every year, as far as the eye can see.The Trump Party has decided that, all things considered, it has more trust in the dictator of Russia than in the intelligence officers of the United States of America.Of course, I\u2019m an unlikely savior for the Republican Party, and truth be told I never agreed with much of its politics. But I once respected its stand on issues that mattered, even if I disagreed with how it pursued them. Luckily, there are many people well positioned to act, politicians who, unlike Mr. Trump, have spent decades promoting the principles of the Republican Party as we all used to know it. The Republican Party could be overthrown by the Republican Party and replaced with \u2014 well, the Republican Party. That would require that the people John Boehner described as \u201cnapping somewhere\u201d find their principles and their courage, and wake up.Advertisement"}

But Facebook officials said some of the tools and techniques used by the accounts were similar to those used by the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked group that was at the center of an indictment this year alleging interference in the 2016 presidential election.Facebook said it had discovered coordinated activity around issues like a sequel to last year\u2019s deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Activity was also detected around #AbolishICE, a left-wing campaign on social media that seeks to end the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\u201cAt this point in our investigation, we do not have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind it,\u201d said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy. \u201cBut we can say that these accounts engaged in some similar activity and have connected with known I.R.A accounts.\u201dThe jolting disclosure, delivered to lawmakers in private briefings on Capitol Hill this week and in a public Facebook post on Tuesday, underscored how behind-the-scenes interference in the November elections had begun.Officials at Facebook, which is based in Silicon Valley, said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies on their discovery of the influence campaign. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and other executives also mounted a media blitz to explain what the company did and did not know about the efforts.Those actions were a change from last year, when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference in the 2016 election. It took Facebook executives months to acknowledge the extent of the Russian operation and release information connected with their investigation.Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, did not directly address Facebook\u2019s findings with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, but he said President Trump had \u201cmade it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference into our electoral process from any nation-state or other malicious actors.\u201dEarlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared again on Twitter that there had been \u201cNo Collusion\u201d between his campaign and the Russians, and asserted that, in any case, \u201ccollusion is not a crime.\u201dLawmakers from both parties quickly set aside questions of who had perpetrated the influence campaign and said Facebook\u2019s disclosure only clarified what they had feared since the extent of Russian involvement in 2016 became clear more than a year ago: that social media companies would be unable to keep up with the pace and scope of malicious efforts to abuse their platforms.Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he would make the disclosure a central part of a previously scheduled hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers plan to press outside experts on the pervasiveness of foreign influence on social media networks like Facebook.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, praised Facebook on Tuesday for bringing the activity out into the public, but asked for its cooperation in updating laws to prevent influence campaigns.\u201cToday\u2019s disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation,\u201d he said.Facebook executives characterized the battle with foreign campaigns as a cat-and-mouse game, but said they were making progress to detect suspicious activity more quickly.\u201cSecurity is an arms race, and it\u2019s never done,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in a conference call on Tuesday.Facebook said the recently purged accounts \u2014 eight Facebook pages, 17 Facebook profiles and seven Instagram accounts \u2014 were created between March 2017 and May 2018 and were first discovered two weeks ago. More than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspect pages, which had names like Aztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, Mindful Being and Resisters, the company said.Between April 2017 and June 2018, the accounts ran 150 ads costing $11,000 on the two platforms. They were paid for in American and Canadian dollars. The pages created roughly 30 events over a similar period, the largest of which attracted interest from 4,700 accounts.Finding suspicious activity was harder this time around, Facebook said. Unlike many of the alleged Russian trolls in 2016, who paid for Facebook ads in rubles and occasionally used Russian internet protocol addresses, these accounts used advanced security techniques to avoid detection. For instance, they disguised their internet traffic using virtual private networks and internet phone services, and used third parties to buy ads for them.\u201cThese bad actors have been more careful to cover their tracks, in part due to the actions we\u2019ve taken to prevent abuse over the past year,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said.But there were clues that the suspicious accounts may have been connected to the Internet Research Agency. Mr. Gleicher said an account known to be associated with the agency had been listed as an administrator of one of the pages for seven minutes.Like the 2016 Russian interference campaign, the recently detected campaign sought to amplify divisive social issues, including through organizing real-world events.Among the campaign\u2019s efforts was organizing support for a counterprotest to a conservative rally. Specifically, an account called Resisters, which interacted with one Internet Research Agency account in 2017, created an Aug. 10 event, \u201cNo Unite the Right 2 \u2014 DC,\u201d to counter a planned white supremacist rally in Washington on Aug. 11 and 12 by the same group that organized the racist march in Charlottesville one year earlier.That event page has been taken down, and Facebook has notified roughly 2,600 users who had indicated interest in attending the event, and 600 more who planned to attend, about the suspicious activity behind it.One organizer, Chelsea Manning, the former Army analyst who was convicted of sending archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and whose sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017, said the counterprotest was \u201creal and organic.\u201d She called Facebook\u2019s implication that the Resisters account had started it misleading.\u201cWe started organizing several months ago,\u201d Ms. Manning said. \u201cFolks from D.C. and Charlottesville have been talking about this since at least February.\u201dAfter being caught flat-footed by the Internet Research Agency\u2019s efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Facebook has expanded its security team, hired counterterrorism experts and recruited workers with government security clearances.The company is using artificial intelligence and teams of human reviewers to detect automated accounts and suspicious election-related activity. It has also tried to make it harder for Russian-style influence campaigns to use covert Facebook ads to sway public opinion, by requiring political advertisers in the United States to register with a domestic mailing address and by making all political ads visible in a public database.The American midterms, though, are a major test for the company, which is trying to show that it can handle its role as a global arbiter of conversation and commerce \u2014 even with interference by others.Earlier in July, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned that Russian interference remains an active threat to November\u2019s elections.\u201cThe warning lights are blinking red again,\u201d he said.Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Kevin Roose from New York.

{"Headline": "Picturing Iraq in a Bygone Era", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensWhen his career began in the 1950s, Latif Al Ani captured scenes of Iraqi life in a more innocent time. On some Fridays, Latif Al Ani walks around Mutanabbi Street, the heart of Baghdad\u2019s intellectual life, with its bookshops and cafes. When he does go, he nurtures a faint hope that he will, amid the rows of stalls selling books, maps and photographs, stumble across an old possession: his pictures.Mr. Ani, 86, is regarded as the founder of Iraqi photography, and many prints he had stored with the Ministry of Culture went missing when government buildings were looted after the 2003 invasion. Luckily, though, for Mr. Ani and those concerned with Iraq\u2019s history, not all of his life\u2019s work was lost. \u201cHe became forgotten in his own country,\u201d said Ms. Chalabi, the daughter of the late Iraqi politician Ahmad Chalabi. In a foreword for Mr. Ani\u2019s book, Shwan Ibrahim Taha, a co-founder of Ruya, wrote, \u201clooking at his photos, I long for a place that might have continued being like Latif\u2019s photos, but sadly is no longer possible.\u201dPaging through the book, we look down Rasheed Street, once the city\u2019s grandest boulevard (\u201cIt was the heart of Baghdad,\u201d Mr. Ani said. \u201cYou felt the past.\u201d), and see American cars and men in suits. We see women gathered around a jewelry counter at an upscale shop. It could be Manhattan, but it is Baghdad. And we see pictures of modernist homes built in the 1960s, with clean lines and odd geometry, that have a Southern California vibe. \u201cLife was easy,\u201d said Mr. Ani. \u201cThere was no war, no problems.\u201dTo live in Baghdad as a foreigner, as I did for many years as The Times\u2019s bureau chief, was to always wonder what the city used to be like, before the blast walls and checkpoints circumscribed the urban geography, and before so much violence altered the city\u2019s character, and changed the relationship between citizens and their public spaces. Often, I depended on older men, like Mr. Ani \u2014 who unlike so many other middle-class Iraqis never left for the safety of foreign shores \u2014 as my guides.At his age, he easily slips into memory.The 1940s, when his brother, a shopkeeper on Mutanabbi Street, gave him his first camera, and a Jewish man taught him how to use it. The 1950s, crisscrossing the country as the photographer for the in-house magazine of the British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company. The 1960s and 1970s, covering news, and traveling to Paris with the country\u2019s young vice president, Saddam Hussein.One of his favorite pictures is a simple scene, of his own family at a roadside picnic, in 1970 in Salahuddin Province \u2014 his mother, his young wife, his brother-in-law lounging on the ground, his gleaming late-1950s Pontiac in the background. \u201cNobody asked us what we were doing there,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one asked, are you Sunni or Shia? That was life back then.\u201dAnother favorite is a picture of a naked woman, stretching in the morning. The story of that photo, of a time when an Iraqi man and a European woman could find romance without fear, is a distillation, he said, of all that has been lost in Iraq. Her name was Anna and she was from Spain, and they met dancing in a Baghdad nightclub. The photo was taken at a lakeside resort in Anbar Province, then a place for a vacation, now famous for extreme Islamist politics and terrorism.And back then, America and Iraq were rubbing up against one another in softer ways.The book\u2019s cover shows an American couple from Colorado at the ruins of Ctesiphon, near Baghdad, in 1965. At the time, Mr. Ani said, the United States in the minds of Iraqis meant movies, ideals and cars. On a tour of the United States in the 1960s he stayed with the Colorado couple, and the only color photographs in his book are from San Francisco.\u201cAt that time America cared about freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was our dream to see America. Now what America means is to control and rule the world.\u201dOn many days Mr. Ani spends his time at the courtyard cafe and art gallery of an old friend Qassim Sabti, himself a guardian of Baghdad\u2019s memory who often entertains foreigners at his home over al fresco dinners of masgoof, an Iraqi river fish.Mr. Sabti said Mr. Ani\u2019s photographs show a version of what Iraq could become again, if it can move past its recent torments, of violence, radical Islam and political dysfunction. \u201cIraqis are people who like to drink alcohol, to dance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not radicals. We are not Bedouins. We are not like Saudi Arabia.\u201dThough Mr. Ani insists his \u201cpictures are for the next generation to see what Iraq was like,\u201d his friend sees an immeasurably important purpose. \u201cHaji Latif is part of our history,\u201d said Mr. Sabti. \u201cWe are lucky to have him. If we didn\u2019t have him we wouldn\u2019t have this history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Streaming Niche Sports Dawns", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new generation of niche sports is looking to streaming instead of big networks to find more exposure and new fans. Karate Combat, a full-contact karate league, held its first event in Miami in April.Only a few hundred fans were in attendance, which was intentional for this niche sports organization that launched this year and is far more focused on making money from media deals than putting people in seats. Michael DePietro, Karate Combat\u2019s chief executive, expects 65 to 70 percent of the venture\u2019s revenue to come from media, including streams of events on the Karate Combat website. Sponsorships, dojo franchising and merchandise will produce much of the rest. Attendance revenue contributes a paltry sum, even though it was once the lifeblood of all sports.DePietro said he has traditional television offers in hand, but he is using a new playbook for small sports that no longer see an upside in scraping to get on networks large and small. Instead they are focused on digital streaming, a delivery system that does not require fans to pay for an expensive television subscription at a time when those accounts are becoming increasingly unpopular, especially among younger consumers.\u201cWe want to do something that is engaging to younger audiences over time. Right now it is the video game, flash back to the 80s feel,\u201d DePietro said.Karate Combat fights don\u2019t take place in a ring or a cage, but a sunken pit that allows cameras an unobstructed shot of the karatekas. The goal is to stage fights in exotic locations around the world. The next event will be in the courtyard of the Zappeion in Athens, near the Parthenon and Arch of Hadrian.The events are presented to look almost like a real life version of the video game Street Fighter. The streams of the fights are accompanied by live biometric data and a chat window. Those innovations directly target younger viewers.There are also more than a dozen distribution partners around the world who split ad revenue with Karate Combat. A spokesman said more than one million people viewed at least some part of the Miami event, though the figure could not be independently verified.A decade ago, DePietro would have been forced to rely on attendance, which would have made staging fights in a sunken pit and exotic locations difficult. He would have begged CBS, NBC and ESPN to pay a pittance for the rights to show a few hours of his league in the middle of the night, or paid for airtime himself. Onscreen biometric data and real-time fan interaction would have been nearly impossible.Today, his options, and those of a host of other new niche sports offerings, are almost limitless. Besides the incumbent television companies, tech powerhouses like Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are experimenting with sports rights. Pure streaming plays abound, with television companies like ESPN, with ESPN+, and Turner, with B/R Live, attempting to disrupt themselves.Others, like Stadium, Eleven and FloSports, project bright futures for their well-funded start-ups as they hope to become even fractionally as profitable as ESPN. Leagues can also opt to stream directly on social media platforms like Twitch and Twitter.\u201cIt is the greatest time to be a sports fan in the history of the world,\u201d said Burke Magnus, the ESPN executive in charge of programming. No matter how small or unpopular a league or team is, their games are probably streaming to fans somewhere, he said.To be sure, even with an energetic promotional campaign, streaming services and the niche sports they show face plenty of significant challenges before they become a viable alternative to broadcast or cable television.Most important, they need more exposure and more eyeballs. A relatively small amount of people know these sports and services exist. The number of subscribers to the services is a fraction of the 607,000 daily viewers ESPN averaged last quarter or the 87 million homes who receive the network. Far more people would stumble across Karate Combat on ESPN than stream it on karate.com.Streaming services also have yet to figure out a way to take advantage of the economics of bundling. Pay television distributors pay nearly $8 each month for each subscriber who receives ESPN \u2014 and more than a dollar each for the NFL Network and FS1, as well as other regional sports networks, even though a small percentage of their customers watch these channels. Streaming services only receive revenue from customers who actively choose to subscribe or watch.No sports streaming service has nearly the portfolio of rights of even a second-tier cable sports channel \u2014 acquiring those rights would take billions of dollars they do not have. With the recent proliferation of digital sports streaming services, it is possible that many, perhaps even the majority, of the services and the sports they show will fail.And yet, optimists abound. Consider arm wrestling. Steve Kaplan earnestly believes arm wrestling is the sport of the future. It is also a sport of the past. Arm wrestling\u2019s World\u2019s Strongest Man competition was a pillar of the so-called \u201ctrash sports\u201d craze in the 1970s that included shows like \u201cThe Superstars\u201d and \u201cSurvival of the Fittest.\u201dKaplan, president of the World Armwrestling League, insisted arm wrestling was ready for a reboot.\u201cIt\u2019s ordinary people doing extraordinary things,\u201d he said. To succeed, the sport has to migrate from the raucous bars that host its competitions to the television or the phone.Enter B/R Live, the new streaming service from Turner Sports, which signed a multiyear agreement with the World Armwrestling League. Kaplan declined to disclose details of the deal but the league and the streaming service will share revenue. That will give both parties incentive to promote the World Armwrestling League as much as possible.The World Armwrestling League previously had an agreement with ESPN to televise eight hours of competition. Kaplan praised ESPN, but he said the sport needed more exposure, and B/R Live offered heavy promotion.In Austin, Tex., FloSports encompasses all of the possibilities and pitfalls of this business. Launched more than a decade ago with the goal of becoming the ESPN of the digital age, it followed ESPN\u2019s early playbook: Begin by buying rights to niche sports, and slowly work toward more mainstream ones.FloSports is mostly known for its running and wrestling coverage, but it is rapidly expanding. Mark Floreani, the chief executive, said FloSports has signed more than 100 rights agreements this year already, though none is with a major sports organization. He argued that streaming allows FloSports to show niche sports better than a traditional television channel would.He gave the example of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship, held in May. In the early rounds there were as many as 20 near-simultaneous matches on different mats. A traditional broadcaster would have had to designate one the most popular and important to show, and then cut to other mats as warranted, similar to how tennis tournaments are usually broadcast.Instead, FloSports had a sparse setup of camera, graphics, and a play-by-play commentator on each mat, allowing fans to pick which they wanted to watch, as well as the FloZone, a whip-around option showing parts of the most interesting matches, similar to NFL RedZone channel. As competitors were eliminated and the number of mats reduced, additional cameras and personnel were assigned to those remaining.FloSports aims its coverage at the core fan, and hopes to grow the sport\u2019s fan base. The result is far less money than an established league gets for being on ESPN, but the inventory still pulls in viewers.That does not mean FloSports will topple the legacy networks tomorrow, but the company is already serving as an alternative in a market that craves them.\u201cTo be able to get all of that in one place,\u201d he said, \u201cis really the proposition that we are selling to at this point in our evolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Was My Obscure Interest. Now Everyone Is Paying Attention.", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gessen was born in Moscow and frequently writes about Russia.For someone like me, who has been writing and thinking about Russia for most of my life, the past few years have made for a strange experience. I read the news like everyone else and am horrified. Then I visit Russia and find myself conflicted and confused.I was born in Moscow in 1975, in what was then the Soviet Union, and came to the United States with my family when I was 6 years old. We moved to the Boston area and lived with some friends from back home, the Moshkeviches. Then, with some help from a local charity, we were able to rent a place of our own.My parents loved Russian culture, Russian literature, Russian films, but they did not like Russia, at least as it was then. They did love America \u2014 for its freedom and its plenty. People we knew told the story of the Soviet immigrant who burst into tears the first time she saw an American supermarket with its mind-boggling abundance. They did not tell the story to laugh at the immigrant; they told it because they felt the same way. How could a place have so many brands of mayonnaise? So many different fruits? So many kids\u2019 cereals?As for me, I wanted to fit in. Month by month, year by year, I shed my Russianness; as Chekhov once said about his serf parentage, I squeezed my Russianness out of myself drop by drop. My parents had left, and that was that. We were Americans now.My mother died of cancer when I was a senior in high school. She was a literary critic who focused on Russian literature and had been in our family the person most attached to Russia. Her death could easily have severed our Russian connection; instead, for me, it did the opposite. I decided as a college freshman to take classes in Russian history and literature as a way of staying connected to her somehow. I was going to do it for a semester and then move on. This was the early 1990s, just after the Soviet Union collapsed; getting a spot in the Russian history and literature seminar was not exactly difficult.But instead of moving on, I stayed. Before I knew it, I was off to Russia for my junior year abroad. As soon as I graduated, I started writing about Russian culture and politics and translating Russian texts.It seemed I had arrived too late. By the time I started publishing on Russia, the Boris Yeltsin era had collapsed in ignominy and Mr. Yeltsin himself had been replaced by a small gray ghoul named Vladimir Putin. Interest in Russia declined, then cratered. For years the only reliable way to sell an article about Russia was to focus on someone who had been killed or arrested, or to find some other creative way of underscoring how evil Mr. Putin was.I remember an editor emailing me in 2009 to ask if there was any truth to the story that Mr. Putin preferred Dostoyevsky to Tolstoy. I was perplexed. A quick Google search revealed that a desperate colleague had, in fact, produced an article about how the Tolstoy estate at Yasnaya Polyana was being neglected, surely the result of some nefarious Putinist plot.That was depressing. It was depressing because the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to thousands of deaths, and it was also depressing because of what Russia would now inevitably become: a pariah among nations, locking itself into Fortress Russia, fearing the world around it.I was depressed, too, by the news coverage in the United States, especially postelection. It almost entirely neglected the long history of American meddling in the internal affairs of many, many countries, including Russia itself. Some of it was perfectly understandable anger at Russia\u2019s role, however marginal, in electing Mr. Trump; but much of the Russia talk threatened to crowd out an examination of all the other reasons Mr. Trump was elected.As for me, as a Russia watcher, it was good for business. At the university where I teach, I got the green light for a new class on Russia, and students even signed up. This would not have happened a few years earlier. So why did I feel so bad about the whole thing?Perhaps it is simply this: Having lived in Russia, I know in my bones how complicated a place it is. Living in Russia is not a nonstop exercise in getting arrested, tortured, shot. People go about their lives. They buy groceries, look at their phones, go on dates, get married. They go to work in the morning, look for parking, try to get to the gym. They tell jokes. And in the meantime, yes, people are getting arrested; some are being tortured; some are being killed.In Moscow last spring, I experienced this cognitive dissonance all over again. I hadn\u2019t been there in a few years, and I was surprised by the changes I saw. There were many more subway stations \u2014 since 2009, the city has opened more than 20 new stations. In that same time, New York, to great fanfare, has opened four. There were numerous new coffee shops, affordable small restaurants and people bustling about. No one would mistake it for Paris, but still, the city would have been barely recognizable to someone transported there from, say, 1998.At the same time, as soon as you turned on the television, there it was: total paranoia about NATO bombers; aggressive, ill-informed arguments about geopolitics; bad movies about World War II. The political atmosphere is poisonous. Mr. Putin is in charge for six more years and has convinced himself and those around him that the country would collapse if he left. Russia has entered another dark period in its history, and there is no end in sight.But if there\u2019s one thing we have learned in the past year and a half of the Trump presidency, it\u2019s that people do not exist in the political atmosphere constantly, or even most of the time. On Facebook and Twitter they may; while watching cable news they do. The rest of the time, though, most of us are able to do other things.That\u2019s not necessarily good \u2014 in times of emergency, it\u2019s bad. But it can\u2019t be an emergency all the time, not even in Mr. Trump\u2019s America, not even in Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia. There are many aspects of Russian life, Russian thought, even Russian politics, that are not under the purview of Vladimir Putin.So what is it like for a longtime Russia watcher? I guess it\u2019s like having your favorite obscure band become famous for some stupid act, like destroying a hotel room \u2014 the hotel room being, in this case, the postwar global order. But I don\u2019t know. I never really had a favorite obscure band. Russia was the closest thing I had to an obscure interest. I was a fan of their early albums \u2014 \u201cLate Socialism,\u201d \u201cPerestroika,\u201d \u201cDeindustrialization\u201d \u2014 but everyone listens to them now.An earlier version of this article gave incorrect information about the number of subway stations that New York has opened since 2009. It is four, not three.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swift Gene-Editing Method May Revolutionize Treatments for Cancer and Infectious Diseases", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScientists report that they have discovered a way to tweak genes in the body\u2019s immune cells by using electrical fields.For the first time, scientists have found a way to efficiently and precisely remove genes from white blood cells of the immune system and to insert beneficial replacements, all in far less time than it normally takes to edit genes.If the technique can be replicated in other labs, experts said, it may open up profound new possibilities for treating an array of diseases, including cancer, infections like H.I.V. and autoimmune conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But because the technique is so new, no patients have yet been treated with white blood cells engineered with it. That test may not be far away. The researchers have already used the method in the laboratory to alter the abnormal immune cells of children with a rare genetic condition. They plan to return the altered cells to the children in an effort to cure them. Currently, scientists attempting to edit the genome often must rely on modified viruses to slice open DNA in a cell and to deliver new genes into the cell. The method is time-consuming and difficult, limiting its use.Despite the drawbacks, the virus method has had some success. Patients with a few rare blood cancers can be treated with engineered white blood cells \u2014 the immune system\u2019s T-cells \u2014 that go directly to the tumors and kill them. This type of treatment with engineered white cells, called immunotherapy, has been limited because of the difficulty of making viruses to carry the genetic material and the time needed to create them.\u201cWhat takes months or even a year may now take a couple weeks using this new technology,\u201d said Fred Ramsdell, vice president of research at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy in San Francisco. \u201cIf you are a cancer patient, weeks versus months could make a huge difference.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a huge breakthrough,\u201d he added.The Parker Institute already is working with the authors of the new paper, led by Dr. Alexander Marson, scientific director of biomedicine at the Innovative Genomics Institute \u2014 a partnership between University of California, San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 to make engineered cells to treat a variety of cancers. In the new study, Dr. Marson and his colleagues engineered T-cells to recognize human melanoma cells. In mice carrying the human cancer cells, the modified T-cells went right to the cancer, attacking it.The researchers also corrected \u2014 in the lab \u2014 the T-cells of three children with a rare mutation that caused autoimmune diseases. The plan now is to return these corrected cells to the children, where they should function normally and suppress the defective immune cells, curing the children.The technique may also hold great promise for treating H.I.V., Dr. Wherry said. Previous research has shown it might be possible to treat H.I.V. in this way. \u201cBut now there is a really efficient strategy to do this,\u201d Dr. Wherry said.The idea of engineering T-cells without using a virus is not new, but the immune cells are fragile and hard to keep alive in the lab, and it has always been difficult to get genes into them. Scientists usually introduced replacement genes into T-cells with a type of virus that was disarmed so that it would not cause disease and that can insert new genes into cells. But when these viruses insert the genes into a cell\u2019s DNA, they do so haphazardly, sometimes destroying other genes.\u201cWe needed something targeted, something fast and something efficient,\u201d Dr. Marson said. \u201cWhat if we could just paste in a piece of DNA and avoid the viruses altogether?\u201dThe idea would be to slip a type of molecular scissors, known as Crispr, into cells that would slice open DNA wherever scientists wanted a new gene to go. That would avoid the problem of using a virus that inserts genes pretty much at random. And along with the scissors, they would add a piece of DNA containing the new gene to be added to the cells.\u201cHe tested thousands of conditions,\u201d Dr. Marson said. \u201cOur intent is to try to apply this as quickly as possible,\u201d Dr. Ramsdell said.So when they knew they had a system that worked, did they break out the champagne? Have a party? Well, no, Mr. Roth said in an interview. He just took the data to Dr. Marson. \u201cWe certainly had an exuberant walk to Alex\u2019s office,\u201d he recalled. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Democrats Aren\u2019t Ruining Their Midterm Chances", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican history demonstrates that party conflict does not necessarily hurt electoral success.Mr. Grossmann hosts the podcast \u201cPolitical Research Digest.\u201d Mr. Hopkins blogs about politics at Honest Graft.More recently, the growth of the Tea Party movement during the presidency of Barack Obama produced notably sharp fractures among Republicans that ended the careers of several leading politicians, but it did not prevent Republican candidates from netting 70 House seats and 14 Senate seats between 2010 and 2014.Political commentators often suggest that national parties maximize their electoral effectiveness when they push a single policy program or message. But the Democratic Party is organized as a coalition of social groups and best served when candidates are free to shape individual campaign appeals tailored to the interests of their own constituencies. Rather than acting as a single party \u201cbase\u201d with a common set of policy goals or ideological commitments, Democratic supporters are made up of a diverse array of social groups strewn across state and district boundaries, each with its own agenda of political concerns and quest for representation among the party leadership. Mobilizing the collective Democratic faithful from coast to coast therefore requires a variety of distinct campaign messages \u2014 and messengers.The differing complexion of the Democratic electorate from one place to another also helps to explain why pressure from party liberals for greater ideological purity (and a more confrontational approach toward the Trump administration) is not evenly distributed across the nation. While veteran blue-state officeholders like Mr. Crowley, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California face intraparty challengers from the left, moderate Senate Democrats facing re-election in red states have all either won their primaries or appear on the way to renomination without fear of serious contestation. These demographic changes will have substantive implications as well. Research has shown that female and nonwhite representatives tend to concentrate on different issues than white men of the same party. Although the next opportunity to regain control of the elected branches in Washington is still at least two years away, an internal Democratic debate has already begun over how to prioritize initiatives championed by different elements of the party. The renewed energy on the American left and the evolution of the party\u2019s chief sources of mass support have added a number of new concerns to an already long wish list of policy changes.But while the 2018 midterms have produced a diverse cast of Democratic candidates running on a mix of issues all over the country, the presence of Mr. Trump in the White House and the procedural rules in the Senate ensure that the actual policy effects of this year\u2019s election are likely to be minor even if the party succeeds in capturing control of Congress. The full consequences of the debates that have separated Democrats along racial, gender and generational lines in the current campaign will emerge only once the party returns to power in future years. Is health care affordability the most critical problem that the government should address, or is it gun violence, or child care, or immigration reform? To achieve legislative success, future Democratic leaders will need to broker agreements among party factions over policy priorities as well as policy details. Party unity may not help win elections, but it becomes quite valuable once the time to govern has arrived.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Giants Take Their Talent Hunt to Cambridge", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "A boom in artificial intelligence research has drawn the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies and their checkbooks to the storied English city.Supported byCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 When you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station, you will not see the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel or the turrets atop the Trinity Great Court. The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Snail Goes Through Metamorphosis. Then It Never Has to Eat Again.", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe transformation of a deep sea mollusk is comparable to an average person growing as much as 60 feet tall with a giant sac of bacteria filling its guts.Once the snail reaches a certain body length, its digestive system stops growing. Its teeth, stomach and intestine make way for an expanding esophageal gland. The organ gets so big, it takes up most of the snail\u2019s body, and basically becomes a new organ. Bacteria colonize it, and the snail, which grazed for food when it was smaller, no longer needs to eat. Instead it just sits there getting bigger, surviving on energy the bacteria produces inside the snail\u2019s cells. To make a human comparison, imagine growing from an average size adult to one 30 to 60 feet tall, with a giant sac of bacteria living inside you. Not all animals eat. Some shallow water corals, for example, have algae living inside their tissues that take in sunlight and convert it to energy that provides the corals with nutrients. In the deep sea, there is no sun, but vents provide chemicals that bacteria break down. This is the basis of the deep sea food chain. Gigantopelta chessoia, instead of algae, have bacteria living in some of their cells that convert hydrogen sulfide and oxygen the snails absorb from the vents into energy. Because their guts and their radula, or snail teeth, were kind of small, and they seemed to be fine relying on bacteria, Dr. Chen and his colleagues originally thought these snails didn\u2019t feed. \u201cBut when we looked at the small guys, they had a very different anatomy,\u201d said Dr. Chen. \u201cTheir internal organs were much more like a normal snail.\u201d And there was no bacteria inside them.This was weird. The team wanted to see if this transition from grazing to relying on bacteria was gradual \u2014 like how humans shift from breast milk to solid food as they grow \u2014 or sudden \u2014 like how a caterpillar may switch from eating plant matter to sipping nectar when it becomes a butterfly. To find out, they gathered snails from their homes, 9,000 feet below the surface, and preserved their bodies so they could scan them and reconstruct the internal organs on a computer. By evaluating the relative size of these organs, they determined that the change was sudden. Just as the snail\u2019s body length reached 5 to 8 millimeters, the esophageal gland expanded dramatically and was teeming with bacteria. Indeed, this was a new type of metamorphosis, only visible from the inside. However this change occurs, the snails gain an advantage by producing their own energy. They can grow bigger and make babies instead of searching for food. Knowing about this change will also help researchers make more accurate calculations about the flow of energy in deep sea ecosystems. And in the future, looking at anatomy could prove useful in other ecosystems too. \u201cWe think this crypto-metamorphosis could be common in other animals,\u201d Dr. Chen said. \u201cIf we look closely enough, maybe it\u2019s even present in systems like forests or coral reefs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Opposition to Breast-Feeding Resolution by U.S. Stuns World Health Officials", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA resolution to encourage breast-feeding was expected to be approved quickly and easily by the hundreds of government delegates who gathered this spring in Geneva for the United Nations-affiliated World Health Assembly.Based on decades of research, the resolution says that mother\u2019s milk is healthiest for children and countries should strive to limit the inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes.Then the United States delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations.American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to \u201cprotect, promote and support breast-feeding\u201d and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.When that failed, they turned to threats, according to diplomats and government officials who took part in the discussions. Ecuador, which had planned to introduce the measure, was the first to find itself in the cross hairs.The Americans were blunt: If Ecuador refused to drop the resolution, Washington would unleash punishing trade measures and withdraw crucial military aid. The Ecuadorean government quickly acquiesced.The showdown over the issue was recounted by more than a dozen participants from several countries, many of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the United States.Health advocates scrambled to find another sponsor for the resolution, but at least a dozen countries, most of them poor nations in Africa and Latin America, backed off, citing fears of retaliation, according to officials from Uruguay, Mexico and the United States.\u201cWe were astonished, appalled and also saddened,\u201d said Patti Rundall, the policy director of the British advocacy group Baby Milk Action, who has attended meetings of the assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, since the late 1980s.\u201cWhat happened was tantamount to blackmail, with the U.S. holding the world hostage and trying to overturn nearly 40 years of consensus on the best way to protect infant and young child health,\u201d she said.In the end, the Americans\u2019 efforts were mostly unsuccessful. It was the Russians who ultimately stepped in to introduce the measure \u2014 and the Americans did not threaten them.The State Department declined to respond to questions, saying it could not discuss private diplomatic conversations. The Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency in the effort to modify the resolution, explained the decision to contest the resolution\u2019s wording but said H.H.S. was not involved in threatening Ecuador.\u201cThe resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children,\u201d an H.H.S. spokesman said in an email. \u201cWe recognize not all women are able to breast-feed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatized for the ways in which they are able to do so.\u201d The spokesman asked to remain anonymous in order to speak more freely.Although lobbyists from the baby food industry attended the meetings in Geneva, health advocates said they saw no direct evidence that they played a role in Washington\u2019s strong-arm tactics. The $70 billion industry, which is dominated by a handful of American and European companies, has seen sales flatten in wealthy countries in recent years, as more women embrace breast-feeding. Over all, global sales are expected to rise by 4 percent in 2018, according to Euromonitor, with most of that growth occurring in developing nations.The intensity of the administration\u2019s opposition to the breast-feeding resolution stunned public health officials and foreign diplomats, who described it as a marked contrast to the Obama administration, which largely supported W.H.O.\u2019s longstanding policy of encouraging breast-feeding.The confrontation was the latest example of the Trump administration siding with corporate interests on numerous public health and environmental issues.During the same Geneva meeting where the breast-feeding resolution was debated, the United States succeeded in removing statements supporting soda taxes from a document that advises countries grappling with soaring rates of obesity.The delegation\u2019s actions in Geneva are in keeping with the tactics of an administration that has been upending alliances and long-established practices across a range of multilateral organizations, from the Paris climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal to Nafta.Ilona Kickbusch, director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said there was a growing fear that the Trump administration could cause lasting damage to international health institutions like the W.H.O. that have been vital in containing epidemics like Ebola and the rising death toll from diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the developing world.\u201cIt\u2019s making everyone very nervous, because if you can\u2019t agree on health multilateralism, what kind of multilateralism can you agree on?\u201d Ms. Kickbusch asked.A Russian delegate said the decision to introduce the breast-feeding resolution was a matter of principle.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be a hero here, but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world,\u201d said the delegate, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.He said the United States did not directly pressure Moscow to back away from the measure. Nevertheless, the American delegation sought to wear down the other participants through procedural maneuvers in a series of meetings that stretched on for two days, an unexpectedly long period.In the end, the United States was largely unsuccessful. The final resolution preserved most of the original wording, though American negotiators did get language removed that called on the W.H.O. to provide technical support to member states seeking to halt \u201cinappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children.\u201dThe United States also insisted that the words \u201cevidence-based\u201d accompany references to long-established initiatives that promote breast-feeding, which critics described as a ploy that could be used to undermine programs that provide parents with feeding advice and support.Elisabeth Sterken, director of the Infant Feeding Action Coalition in Canada, said four decades of research have established the importance of breast milk, which provides essential nutrients as well as hormones and antibodies that protect newborns against infectious disease.Scientists are loath to carry out double-blind studies that would provide one group with breast milk and another with breast milk substitutes. \u201cThis kind of \u2018evidence-based\u2019 research would be ethically and morally unacceptable,\u201d Ms. Sterken said.Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago-based company that is one of the biggest players in the $70 billion baby food market, declined to comment.The United States Embassy in Quito declined to make Mr. Chapman available for an interview.\u201cWe were shocked because we didn\u2019t understand how such a small matter like breast-feeding could provoke such a dramatic response,\u201d said the Ecuadorean official, who asked not to be identified because she was afraid of losing her job.Wesley Tomaselli contributed reporting from Colombia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Soccer Team Is Found Alive in Thailand Cave Rescue", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAE SAI, Thailand \u2014 The scrawny boys were huddled on the floor of the cave when the British divers emerged from the murky water.As his light flickered from one boy to another, one diver called out, \u201cHow many of you?\u201d\u201cThirteen,\u201d a boy answered.\u201cBrilliant,\u201d the diver said.After 10 days trapped in a flooded cave complex in northern Thailand, and after an enormous search effort that had transfixed Thailand, the missing 12 boys and their soccer coach had finally been found in Tham Luang Cave on Monday.Food was foremost on their minds. \u201cEat, eat, eat,\u201d one of the boys can be heard saying in English.The group had been the focus of a search-and-rescue operation ever since the boys and their coach went into the cave complex after soccer practice on June 23 and were caught inside by rising floodwaters. While the cave is a popular spot to visit, a sign outside warns that in the rainy months starting in July, it is unsafe to go inside.The two British divers who were the first to reach the boys were John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, both experts on cave rescues, according to Bill Whitehouse, the vice chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council.The next challenge will be getting the soccer team out of the flooded cave in their weakened condition and without scuba training. The boys range in age from 11 to 16, and their coach is 25.\u201cI\u2019d expect these children to be physically in fairly rough shape, and psychologically terrified,\u201d said Dr. Eric Lavonas, an emergency physician and trained diving medicine specialist from Denver Health Medical Center and a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.The governor of Chiang Rai Province, Narongsak Osottanakorn, who is overseeing the search-and-rescue operation, said a medical team would treat the team members and evaluate them to determine when they could be moved.\u201cI assure you we found them,\u201d Mr. Narongsak told reporters. \u201cAfter we have the doctor assess their condition, they are going to give them treatment for them to be able to move. Then we are going to decide next how to move them.\u201dOfficials said that infection was a central worry, and that antibiotics and pain killers were included \u2014 along with food and electrolyte drinks \u2014 in the supplies being brought to the team.Divers were finally able to reach the group after enlarging a narrow, submerged passageway that had been too small for them to get through while wearing air tanks.King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun had indicated he was following events closely, helping to focus the attention of government officials.The boys\u2019 first question when the divers arrived was whether they could leave right away. They also wanted to know how long they had been in the cave.One of the divers explained that the cave was flooded and that it would take some time to get them out. But he assured them that other divers would soon be bringing food and supplies.\u201cMany people are coming,\u201d the diver, believed to be Mr. Volanthen, said. \u201cWe are the first.\u201dBecause the boys and their coach went to the cave after soccer practice, it is unlikely they would have had much, if any, food with them. But given how long they survived and the condition in which they were found, health experts say it is certain they had drinkable water, whether from within the cave or brought with them.\u201cFood is not the priority,\u201d Dr. Lavonas said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting them to a safe place. The human body is pretty good at dealing with short-term starvation.\u201dKham Phromthep, whose 13-year-old son, Duangpetch Phromthep, was among the boys trapped in the cave, said he was ecstatic when he saw his son in the video.\u201cI am very happy to see his face among the other faces,\u201d he said.Like other relatives of the missing group, Mr. Kham has been going to the cave every day to follow the rescue operation.He was at home Monday evening when he heard the news and hurried back to the cave on his bicycle.\u201cI\u2019m very happy, very relieved,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s lost some weight. And he looks tired. But still, I am very happy to see him.\u201dHundreds of officials from more than 20 government agencies, along with private companies, were involved in the search. Rescuers came from at least six countries, including members of the United States military.\u201cThis is an absolute humongous success for Thailand,\u201d said Capt. Jessica Tait, the spokeswoman for a United States Air Force team assisting in the operation.Searchers had believed the boys and their coach would go to a large cavern known as Pattaya Beach, which they thought would be dry and have more air than other parts of the cave.But Pattaya Beach was flooded, too, and the group went another quarter-mile inside the cave complex to another chamber, said Mr. Narongsak, the governor.The group was found about three miles from the cave entrance.Officials had been trying numerous approaches to reach the boys, including attempting to find other entry points into the seven-mile-long cave complex and possibly drilling through the mountaintop into the roof of the cavern where the group was believed to be.But the most significant breakthrough came on Monday when the divers, coping with mudslides and limited visibility, painstakingly enlarged the small passageway that had blocked their underwater progress.The divers came close to reaching the group last Tuesday when the water level was lower and they were able to get around the narrow opening. But they had to make a quick retreat when the water began rising and threatened to trap them in the cave, too.Since then, heavy rains continued to flood the cave, hindering divers\u2019 efforts to reach the group, despite the operation to pump out the water. For several days, the water in the cave system rose faster than it could be extracted.Ben Reymenants, the Belgian owner of a diving school in Phuket, has been helping with the rescue and said he spent eight hours in the water Monday extending the guidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now the real work starts, how to get them out. That\u2019s the real challenge. Of course it is fantastic news, but they are very weak.\u201dOf the evacuation options, drilling to reach the boys is the least viable, as getting the necessary drilling equipment to the mountain atop the cave would be daunting and the process time-consuming. Despite more than a week of searching, no other entry to the cave has been found.\u201cMy main priority is still pumping out the water,\u201d said Mr. Narongsak, the governor, at a Tuesday morning news conference. But so far the water levels have proved hard to lower.That leaves bringing the group out using scuba equipment, and even in the best circumstances, diving in caves is difficult and dangerous.\u201cYou may have unusual current, you may have conditions which make it extremely difficult to navigate dangerous water with low visibility,\u201d said Dean Wiseman, the spokesman for the National Speleological Society and a cave explorer for about 30 years.For boys in a weakened state, who are unlikely to have dived before, the evacuation will pose significant risks.\u201cTrying to take nondivers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,\u201d Anmar Mirza, a leading American cave rescue expert, told The Associated Press.But the challenges can be surmounted.\u201cEven if they can\u2019t swim, a rescue diver should be able to guide them along,\u201d Dr. Lavonas said. \u201cThe diver will have lights. Obviously, these are young boys and they\u2019re terrified. It\u2019s not going to be an easy rescue, but it should be O.K.\u201dHe said each rescue diver would take one child and would almost certainly use a harness to keep a grip on the child, whose regulator, a breathing device, would most likely be attached to the tank worn by the rescue diver.One serious concern is the possibility that the boys could be at risk for decompression sickness, or the bends, if the air they have been breathing in the cave has been under pressure from the rising water.In that case, the best solution, Dr. Lavonas said, \u201cwould be to bring a portable hyperbaric chamber to the mountainside by helicopter, or to place the children on oxygen and move them quickly to a hyperbaric chamber.\u201d\u201cWe have to come up with a plan immediately,\u201d the governor said Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are still racing against the water. If you look at the weather forecast, it is said that it will be raining the whole week.\u201dOver the past 10 days, the rescue operation has brought Thais together in this politically polarized country, in the hope that the boys and their coach would be found alive.The king sent three kitchen trucks and staff members to help feed the search crews. He also donated 2,000 raincoats to help protect them from the heavy rains.It was about 10:30 p.m. Monday when word reached the command center at Tham Luang-Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park that the boys and their coach had been found, about 45 minutes earlier.Some family members were waiting by themselves in a room at the park headquarters. When the news was announced, they jumped up, cheered and screamed with joy.In the video of their discovery, the boys are alert as they talk to the divers.\u201cTell him we are hungry,\u201d one boy says in Thai. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anything to eat.\u201dThey discuss what day it is, and the diver tells them that it is Monday.\u201cYou have been here 10 days,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are very strong.\u201dLater, one of the group says that he is very happy to see the divers arrive.\u201cWe are happy, too,\u201d the diver says.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d one boy says. \u201cThank you so much.\u201dDenise Grady and Satoshi Sugiyama contributed reporting from New York, and Stephen Castle from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Localist Revolution", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometimes, it pays off to sweat the small stuff.Opinion ColumnistWe\u2019ve tried liberalism and conservatism and now we\u2019re trying populism. Maybe the next era of public life will be defined by a resurgence of localism. Localism is the belief that power should be wielded as much as possible at the neighborhood, city and state levels. Localism is thriving \u2014 as a philosophy and a way of doing things \u2014 because the national government is dysfunctional while many towns are reviving. Politicians in Washington are miserable, hurling ideological abstractions at one another, but mayors and governors are fulfilled, producing tangible results.Localism is also thriving these days because many cities have more coherent identities than the nation as a whole. It is thriving because while national politics takes place through the filter of the media circus, local politics by and large does not. It is thriving because we\u2019re in an era of low social trust. People really have faith only in the relationships right around them, the change agents who are right on the ground.Since it will probably be the coming wave, I thought it might be useful to make a few notes on localism:But under localism, the crucial power center is at the tip of the shovel, where the actual work is being done. Expertise is not in the think tanks but among those who have local knowledge, those with a feel for how things work in a specific place and an awareness of who gets stuff done. Success is not measured by how big you can scale, but by how deeply you can connect.The federal person sees things that can be reduced to data. The local person sees things that can be reduced to data but also things that cannot.The second difference is relational. Federal power is impersonal, uniform, abstract and rule-oriented. Local power is personalistic, relational, affectionate, irregular and based on a shared history of reciprocity and trust. A national system rewards rational intelligence. A local system requires emotional intelligence, too.I\u2019d highlight two other social roles. Elders are the city mothers and fathers who hold sway in the town because of their established positions. The Elders support the Walk Outs, make room for them and reform old systems. Then there are Network Entrepreneurs. They link the Walk Outs, who tend to be lonely, overworked and short-staffed. They help the Walk Outs build a support system and a way to exchange knowledge and care.Change in a localist world often looks like a renewal of old forms, which were often more intimate and personalistic than the technocratic structures of the past 50 years. Localism stands for the idea that there is no one set of solutions to diverse national problems. Instead, it brings conservatives and liberals together around the thought that people are happiest when their lives are enmeshed in caring face-to-face relationships, building their communities together.

Says", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthThe outbreak, the first in which a new vaccine was quickly rolled out, was extinguished in less than three months, with 33 deaths.The Ebola outbreak that began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in April was declared officially over on Tuesday in what appeared to be twin triumphs for a new vaccine and rapid response.Just 33 people died, even though the outbreak reached Mbandaka, a river port city of over one million people. At one point, experts had feared the virus might spread throughout Central Africa. Three years ago, an Ebola outbreak in West Africa cost more than 11,000 lives. Health agencies were slow to respond, and no vaccine was available until it was nearly over.The organization released $2 million from its emergency fund and sent its first support team from Geneva. As of Tuesday, the agency had asked donors for $57 million to fight the outbreak, and donations to all entities involved in containing the outbreak amounted to $63 million, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Even though Congo is familiar with Ebola \u2014 this was the country\u2019s ninth outbreak since the disease first appeared in 1976 \u2014 more than 350 support personnel were deployed there. They included vaccinators from Guinea, where a novel Ebola vaccine was first field-tested. The Congo outbreak marked the first in which an Ebola vaccine was readily available. In addition to giving injections to all front-line health care workers, experts used \u201cring vaccination\u201d to protect all contacts of each person with the disease. More than 3,300 people were vaccinated.The vaccine, made by Merck and known as rVSV-ZEBOV, must be kept at 80 degrees below 0 Celsius (-112 degrees Fahrenheit), so advanced freezers and storage containers had to be deployed to Mbandaka and to Bikoro, a market town closer to the outbreak\u2019s epicenter.The outbreak began in villages in the Ikoko-Impenge area, some of which were reachable only by motorbike or foot.Four experimental treatments consisting of antiviral drugs or cloned antibodies were also made available, but the outbreak was contained before they could be used.The rapid success against Ebola \u201cshould make the government and partners confident that other major outbreaks affecting the country, such as cholera and polio, can also be tackled,\u201d Dr. Tedros said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It Takes a Lot of Skill to Make a Restaurant Seem So Casual", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith their simple dining room and small menus, the three women behind King in SoHo have a way of projecting ease \u2014 which belies their energy, creativity and ambition.\u201cWe\u2019ve got rabbit,\u201d said Jess Shadbolt, one of the chefs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it off the bone, do rabbit and pappardelle for lunch?\u201dClare de Boer, the other chef, nodded. \u201cAnd you know what I was thinking?\u201d she said. \u201cThat quail with a nice panzanella. With loads of anchovies and a vinaigrette and all of the pan juices.\u201dAnnie Shi, who manages the dining room, reached for a bottle of wine. \u201cIs it too early to taste?\u201d After 20 minutes of riffing, writing things down and scratching them out again, they had outlined two menus for their slightly French but mostly Italian restaurant in SoHo. \u201cThe Da Vinci Code, cracked!\u201d Ms. Shadbolt said.Every morning, she and Ms. de Boer draw up the day\u2019s lunch and dinner menus with the ingredients they have on hand, then type them up on a fractured laptop in a mix of Italian and English, occasionally peppered with French.\u201cThe menu should read like a poem,\u201d Ms. de Boer said. \u201cYou should seduce the diner. People don\u2019t know they want to eat deep-fried mackerel with aioli, so you\u2019ve got to tell a story and get them on your wavelength.\u201d With constantly changing menus and a straightforward, seemingly effortless style, King draws in those who want to eat well, but chafe at the pretensions of New York\u2019s high-end restaurant culture: Trending ingredients. Instagram-baiting presentations. Absentee chefs with their names on the door. \u201cWe cook for every service as if we were just cooking at our homes and Annie was serving the drinks,\u201d Ms. Shadbolt said, \u201cbut for a few more people than we\u2019d normally cook for.\u201d The restaurant, running at full capacity, can serve about 135 diners over the course of a few hours.Ms. de Boer added: \u201cWe\u2019re not really trained chefs. We\u2019re people who love eating and love cooking.\u201d That self-effacement almost obscures the high levels of creativity and skill required to make everything at King appear so simple.As Ms. Shi put it, \u201cTo be able to do simple to high standards, it has to be intentional.\u201d\u201cWe had this idea of a restaurant as a magical space where the food doesn\u2019t get in the way,\u201d said Ms. de Boer, describing the three partners\u2019 vision for King. \u201cWhere the food doesn\u2019t detract your attention from the real reason you\u2019re there: to commune with people you enjoy.\u201dAs the chefs prepped for lunch back in the kitchen \u2014 browning rabbit legs and pur\u00e9eing warm beans with their cooking water and olive oil \u2014 Ms. Shi set up in the dining room. She tasted a few new bottles of ros\u00e9 that she was considering, and jotted notes on the table\u2019s paper.\u201cYour wine by the glass is a weird kind of calling card,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it should be symbolic of the list, and the heart of the wine program.\u201d\u201cThat wine is just everything we wanted to be,\u201d she said. \u201cA beautiful sunny day under olive trees, drinking a glass of Tempier and having grilled toasts with butter and anchovies.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s so simple, it really matters,\u201d said Ms. Shi, whose approach in the dining room mirrors the one in the kitchen. (The chefs pluck out the green germ from inside every single clove of garlic, to mellow its flavor. \u201cWe don\u2019t do much to the food, so that kind of thing is so important,\u201d Ms. de Boer said.)Tables at King are deliberately set without silverware. This is to encourage diners to use their hands to pick up salami slices and pieces of a crackerlike flatbread called carta di musica, which usually arrive first to the table.The kitchen buys boxes of that flatbread from Italy, and each piece is warmed right on the flames of the grill until its edges char. Like most dishes at King, the carta di musica is finished with big glugs of olive oil \u2014 never drizzles. Sometimes, the server carrying it to the table will place a cupped hand on one side of the plate to catch the green and gold drips before they hit the floor.\u201cWe want to see olive oil running down your chin!\u201d Ms. Shadbolt said.In the basement prep space, Angeles Chavarria, who has cooked at King since January, rolled out fresh pasta and cut it with a knife into wide, flat ribbons.The pasta would be tossed with melted butter at dinnertime, and twirled on top of wine-braised rabbit legs, still on the bone. This dish would appear on the menu as \u201crabbit au riesling with buttered noodles.\u201d On another day, the pasta might go with rabbit saddles braised in milk, described as \u201cpappardelle con coniglio al latte with lemon peel and sage.\u201dMs. Chavarria would not be prepping pasta tomorrow. In fact, she said she had no clue what she\u2019d be doing tomorrow. She likes it that way. \u201cAs a cook, you have this idea that it\u2019s by making something the same way over and over that you can get to perfection,\u201d said Ms. Chavarria, dusting the pasta with semolina, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true anymore.\u201dIn the kitchens she had worked in before, chefs kept the same dishes on the menu for months, years even. Uniformity and consistency were valued. At King, where the menu changes from lunch to dinner, presentations can transform and evolve rapidly throughout a single service. Every kitchen has its own fundamental way of doing things, from prepping garlic to blanching. At King, the cooks don\u2019t boil vegetables for just a moment or two and then transfer them, still crunchy, into a bowl of ice water to halt the cooking and preserve the color. Here, blanching is typically long and luxurious: Vegetables are pulled from the water and drained when they\u2019re cooked through and tender. While still warm, inclined to soak up flavors, they are left to marinate in aromatics, or braised again until creamy.\u201cMaybe the vegetable is like mush,\u201d said Ms. Chavarria, who was initially startled by the technique. \u201cBut you taste it and it\u2019s stupid sweet. It tastes like what it is.\u201d As Ms. Shadbolt put it, \u201cWe prize flavor over aesthetics.\u201d The kitchen avoids most of what might be considered luxury ingredients, though bottarga, the salt-cured mullet roe, is a year-round staple. It is grated onto fennel and celery salads and that warm, buttered carta di musica. And there is always Tenuta di Capezzana olive oil on hand, along with Maldon sea salt, which the kitchen uses for almost everything, including seasoning raw meat and fish. At the staff meeting before dinner, one server had a question about that. \u201cIs it structured? Is it layered?\u201d he asked. \u201cMore like, it\u2019s all bashed up and then dumped in a bowl and mixed up together,\u201d said Sade Zimmerman-Feeley, the sous-chef.She was describing an ideal way to meld the flavors of ripe strawberries, crumbly meringue and softly whipped cream, of smearing them into one another so that every spoonful would hold the best of each. \u201cIt looks like a blob,\u201d said Maya Rucker, another cook. A few servers nodded. They knew that on a summer night at King, it would be the first dessert to sell out.Advertisement"}

The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity.Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J.Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I\u2019m not the only young conservative here. It\u2019s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism.What does \u201cconservative\u201d mean to you?I\u2019m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you\u2019re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves.Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier?A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I\u2019m in a class and I share my political opinion, I\u2019m basically the bigot, that\u2019s what I\u2019m called. In my literature class we were reading \u201c1984,\u201d and my teacher compared \u201c1984\u201d to President Trump\u2019s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down.Where do you get your information from?I watch a lot of Fox News. I try to get a lot of news from sources that aren\u2019t controlled by big corporations. Sometimes I get news from the internet. I like Rebel Media \u2014 it\u2019s not controlled by a big company.What have you learned from the summit?It\u2019s making me more confident to go back to school. There are lots of liberals at my school, and I\u2019ll feel less embarrassed about saying what I believe and really standing for it. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, I like that he can\u2019t be controlled. Trump communicates directly with the people. He tells the people exactly what they want, he hears their concerns, and he\u2019ll deal with it.Mason Scioneaux, 18, is from Vacherie, La., and will be a freshman this fall at the University of Mississippi.Why did you come here?A friend and I started a political science group during our junior year of high school. We saw a lack of political interest on both sides. It was the 2016 election, a huge time to voice your political opinions. We\u2019ve been very active in south Louisiana, making connections with local politicians. We saw the opportunity to attend the summit, and the slate of speakers was very impressive.It\u2019s important to be politically open-minded, not necessarily to subscribe to a certain person, whether it\u2019s President Trump or Hillary Clinton. For me, it\u2019s important to listen and decide for myself what I believe to be right and true.What were the political beliefs of your classmates? Our high school was kind of split between conservatives and liberals. Our community was like that, too. The parish my high school is in is very liberal, and the parish I live in is split. It\u2019s an area you can\u2019t really define, between conservative Baton Rouge and more liberal New Orleans. My high school is about 70 percent white. The friend I\u2019m here with is a conservative Latino.I think this generation is now getting more opinionated than any generation before. We\u2019re more politically aware, and it\u2019s definitely because of social media. People go on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and have access to so much direct information, like what President Trump tweeted. They\u2019re not just voting as their parents vote. Young people are being fed information, they don\u2019t have to seek it. On one hand, it\u2019s an era of conservatism aligned with Trump. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, but I\u2019m going to criticize him. You get more moderate conservatives who are more open-minded than others, fiscally conservative but more socially liberal. Blindly following any person is what gets us into trouble.What is your vision for America?The biggest problem in America is polarization. It would be refreshing to see people on both sides come together to discuss how to fix our problems. Today it seems everyone is either on the deep right or deep left, with just name-calling and personal attacks. We need less politics and more problem-solving. We have to be willing to compromise, both sides have to give and take. One thing I\u2019d like to see is term limits on members of Congress. It would put pressure on them not to be complacent and to work for the people\u2019s interests, rather than political lobbyists.Where do you get your information?I\u2019ll go on Google News and open articles from Fox News, CNN, Politico and The New York Times. If you\u2019re always getting news from CNN, that\u2019s going to make you a liberal. If it\u2019s from Fox News, that\u2019s going to make you conservative. I try to stay aware. Writing off climate change, that it\u2019s a hoax, is over the top. Ignoring the problem and denying it isn\u2019t going to do anything.Grace Klassen 18, will be a freshman this fall at North Dakota State University. Her best friend, Clare Hillen, also 18, will be a freshman at George Washington University.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong May Ban Political Party That Seeks Independence From China", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Hong Kong authorities said Tuesday that they were considering banning a political party that advocates the city\u2019s independence from China, an aggressive move against separatist sentiments that added to concerns about growing restrictions on political freedom in the territory.The two-year-old political party targeted by the government, the Hong Kong National Party, is small, claiming at most a few dozen members and no elected lawmakers.John Lee, the Hong Kong security secretary, said on Tuesday that the government was reviewing whether to ban the party under the territory\u2019s societies ordinance, which authorizes the prohibition of groups for reasons such as national security, public safety and public order.\u201cIn Hong Kong we have freedom of association, but that right is not without restriction,\u201d he said.Mr. Lee said he was still considering whether to impose the ban, and had given the party 21 days to respond.When it was a British colony, Hong Kong prohibited branches of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the party that had long ruled Taiwan.But since the 1997 handover of the territory to China, the law has been mostly used in crackdowns on organized crime. Mr. Lee said this would be the first time since the colonial era that the societies ordinance would be used against a political party.\u201cToday we Hong Kongers stand in opposition to our enemies, these Chinese colonizers and their puppets in the current Hong Kong government, and it is this antagonism that defines our movement,\u201d the group said.Hong Kong maintains its own local political system, with far greater freedoms of speech, assembly and association than exist in mainland China.But many Hong Kong residents fear that those freedoms, which exist under a model known as one country, two systems, are deteriorating under China\u2019s authoritarian government under President Xi Jinping.The failure of large-scale street protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement, to force the government to expand direct elections helped stir calls for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China by some activists.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said she believed the decision to ban the party was a foregone conclusion, and warned it would cast a chill over all political expression in Hong Kong.\u201cIt\u2019s a blatant decision on the part of the government to tell Hong Kong people and the rest of the world that this is the end for Hong Kong; there\u2019s no more one country, two systems,\u201d she said.\u201cThe law is in their hands, and they can do whatever they want with it,\u201d she said.Angie Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

By day they discuss \u201cvibes\u201d and analyze where the boys\u2019 \u201cheads are at\u201d; after dark, night-vision cameras watch their bodies scrabble rhythmically under duvets. Those who manage to couple up compete for a prize of \u00a350,000; those left single are sent home, though the public can occasionally weigh in to vote people off, too. It\u2019s Tinder made flesh, with all the horror that suggests, but also with sociological insights.Because it\u2019s not just the porny appeal of the contestants, with their bodies spread across plastic furniture like butter. Not just the women, all perfectly cast as the first to be killed in a horror film, barely a body hair between them, teetering in heels at 9 a.m. Not just the men, with their buffets of abs, skin the gentle teak of midcentury furniture, indistinguishable but for their banter. (Yes, this is a festival of banter, that ancient language of British men.) Not the contest itself, with its dystopian coupling ceremonies, where the crackle of hearts breaking is audible against the soundtrack of uplifting house music. It\u2019s not even the sex, performed nightly in the communal bedroom after the tumescent heat of a Spanish afternoon. No, the pull of \u201cLove Island\u201d is in the very contrast between the show and the politics of 2018. They are not at odds; they work in tandem. 2018 provides the vocabulary, the tools for a satisfyingly enlightened discussion of what we\u2019re seeing on screen; \u201cLove Island\u201d provides the raw material for our growing sense of righteous indignation. Together they are more than the sum of their parts, allowing \u201cLove Island\u201d to function as a sort of technicolor locus of all Britain\u2019s gender and sexual anxieties.A lot of dynamics burble to the surface when you barricade a group of young people in a house and tell them to mate. Alex George, an emergency room doctor distinctive initially for his worthy job and lack of fake tan, at first failed to couple up. Rejected by every woman on the show, Mr. George found an unexpected fan base in incels, who gathered on Reddit, 4chan and other message boards to support \u201cour boy,\u201d a sunburned, mainstream mascot for their cause. \u201cThey won\u2019t kiss him, but when they need hospital treatment, they will go to him and expect to be treated,\u201d wrote one user, Lonelycel, suggesting, radically, that medical care should be repaid with romance. He then went on to call the women on the show \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cfemoid.\u201dSitting as it does at the intersection of trash and politics, coming, as it does, at a time when British viewers are hungry for lessons on modern gender politics, gaslighting and the limits of masculinity, \u201cLove Island,\u201d perhaps unexpectedly, is mainstreaming some complicated debates. Yet for all the ways the show reaches into the cracks in the culture to create space for important conversation, it does all seem a bit \u201cEt in Arcadia Ego,\u201d doesn\u2019t it? Even on Majorca, especially on Majorca, there is no respite from 2018. But it makes for excellent television. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Seeks Release of Woman Accused of Being Covert Agent", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia\u2019s foreign minister told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday that charges against a woman accused of infiltrating American political organizations as a covert Russian agent were \u201cfabricated\u201d and she should be released.The State Department had no immediate comment on Saturday\u2019s exchange, though it\u2019s unlikely that the United States would suddenly release Ms. Butina. In a detailed indictment, the Justice Department has accused her of engaging in a series of deceptions over a number of years.The phone conversation on Saturday also touched on what the Russian Foreign Ministry described as efforts to improve conditions in Syria.The call came after a week in which Moscow seemed to move forward with what officials here said were \u201cagreements\u201d reached at Monday\u2019s summit meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump.With Mr. Trump slow to offer an account of his closed-door discussion with Mr. Putin, details have instead flowed from Moscow on issues involving the security of Israel and the wars in Syria and Ukraine. The trickle of statements, hints and leaks from Moscow gave the impression that Russian officials were taking the lead in following up on the summit meeting.Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, for example, said on Friday that it had sent to the United States a proposal to expand cooperation in Syria beyond military \u201cde-conflicting\u201d \u2014 ensuring Russian and American forces do not inadvertently target one another \u2014 to include the repatriation of refugees and the financing of reconstruction.\u201cProgress in this area was enabled by an agreement, reached by the presidents of Russia and the United States, during the meeting in Helsinki,\u201d Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev told journalists in a briefing at the Russian general staff headquarters.The Russian proposal calls for creating a Russian-American group to work on the return of Syrian refugees from Jordan and Lebanon. General Mizintsev said the \u201cAmerican side is now working on the Russian proposal\u201d though there was no immediate response to the idea from Washington.The flow of statements from Moscow at times appeared to catch United States officials unaware, and in some instances seemed at odds with American positions.The American general overseeing operations in Syria, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, said on Thursday that he had received no new directions from Washington. And the United States and its European allies have long insisted they will not pay for postwar reconstruction in areas controlled by the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Russian officials have also spoken openly of a diplomatic effort to manage the defeat of rebel groups in southern Syria that were once backed by the United States. Mr. Trump has offered only hints about that effort.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe discussed Israel and the security of Israel, and President Putin is very much involved now with us in a discussion with Bibi Netanyahu\u201d \u2014 Israel\u2019s leader \u2014 \u201cin working something out surrounding Syria.\u201dMr. Assad\u2019s army, with Russian backing, has pushed into a southern region of Syria along the border of the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Russians have suggested the diplomacy has focused on excluding troops and proxies of Iran, another ally of Mr. Assad, from newly seized land along that border.Russia\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Anatoly Viktorov, said Friday that Moscow and Israel had discussed the border region and had \u201creached an understanding on how it will look\u201d after the rebels\u2019 defeat. He said the agreement specified that \u201ccertain units will abandon the territory,\u201d an apparent reference to Iranian paramilitaries.In the run-up to the summit, Mr. Putin and his diplomats met the leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Qatar; senior diplomats from Oman and Jordan; and two close advisers to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.But it was unclear what assurances Mr. Putin could have offered Mr. Trump. Russian Middle East experts said Moscow\u2019s leverage in the messy Syrian civil war was limited despite its efforts to position itself as a broker.Russian officials also described a proposal by Mr. Putin to hold a referendum on the future of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, a coal mining and steel-smelting region that has been gripped by four years of war between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government.The Ukrainians say any such vote would be manipulated and meaningless as long as Russian troops and Russian-backed paramilitaries control the territory. An election in the war zone would also have to address a thorny issue of voting rights for refugees and internally displaced people.While American officials were silent about the proposal until Friday, there seemed to be little effort to keep it under wraps in Moscow.Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, told a conference in Moscow on Friday that Mr. Putin had offered Mr. Trump, \u201cspecific proposals for resolving this question,\u201d and a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said it was time to \u201cdiscuss other options\u201d in Ukraine, apparently a reference to a referendum.In a sign of how unnerving Russia\u2019s statements had become, Ukrainian politicians pleaded publicly with the administration to take a stand against the referendum.\u201cPresident Putin\u2019s proposals are always deceptive,\u201d Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a former prime minister, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is a negotiating trap.\u201dOnly on Friday did a spokesman for the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis, finally dismiss the idea. \u201cThe administration is not considering supporting a referendum in eastern Ukraine\u201d he said.Tymofiy Mylovanov, a professor at the Kyiv School of Economics, said the proposal and initial American silence on the matter was dangerous for Ukraine by allowing Russia to appear to \u201ccontrol the narrative,\u201d in Ukraine as elsewhere.Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I can only assume that he availed himself to these after they had been left outside the doors of local diners and coffee shops by bakers making their early morning deliveries. This is a common sight in early morning Melbourne. The honor system usually prevails with the bakers\u2019 goods remaining undisturbed on their doorsteps until the shop owner opens for business. Well apparently not this time. Allegedly of course!\u201cWhat do ya think you\u2019re doing ya silly old bugger,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mess of the streets. Go and give that bread back ya thieving bastard.\u201dOur irate breadstick bloke then attempted an aggressive fighting stance. Unfortunately this attempt at pugilism seemed to be affected by foreign substances as his body swayed from side to side and he stumbled into the gutter.Seizing upon this weakness, his opponent threatened, \u201cI\u2019ll bloody call the cops if ya keep that up!\u201d He then decided that discretion was the better part of valor and departed the scene.But breadstick bloke wasn\u2019t going to be denied his retribution. As his protagonist walked to his car, the old bugger showed his true athletic prowess by hurling the breadsticks at him, javelin and circus knife-thrower style. The streets of East Melbourne were now awash with foot-long breadsticks, coffee scrolls, jam buns and even the occasional Dame Edna Everage Lamingtons not previously visible in his many bags of tricks.His opponent cowered in fear and attempted to deflect the fuselage of bread bombs from the crusty curmudgeon. Meanwhile the crowd of amazed onlookers either doubled over in laughter or yelled abuse, which further enraged our aggrieved homeless warrior. Once his ammunition of purloined pastries was spent, he grabbed his bags and went on his way with nary a policeman in sight. Another fugitive of justice on the streets of Melbourne! Our civic-minded hero appeared to emerge unscathed but nevertheless this random act of carbohydrate carnage left me wondering.What could I and my fellow citizens have done to prevent this? If only we had been carrying our own legally purchased breadsticks we could have stopped the crusty old bugger in his tracks. As the old saying goes, \u201cThe only thing stopping a bad guy with a foot-long breadstick is a good guy with his own foot-long breadstick!\u201dAfter witnessing this scene I vowed to take a proactive stance. From now on I will be carrying my own concealed foot long strapped to my thigh, or perhaps a smaller hot dog bun will do the trick.Of course this event made me come to another very important realization.Maybe I have lived in U.S.A. way too long?!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Clues to How the Biggest Dinosaurs Got So Big", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesA fossil found in Argentina that is more than 200 million years old suggests the most giant of dinosaurs existed earlier than paleontologists believed.No creatures ever stomped across the planet quite like the creatures scientists call sauropodomorphs. In 2015, Dr. Apaldetti and her colleagues discovered the new species while looking for Triassic Period fossils in northwest Argentina. They called it Ingentia prima, meaning \u201cthe first giant.\u201dBut the prehistoric beast they found weighed an estimated seven to 10 tons \u2014 more than an African elephant \u2014 and measured about 33 feet long. It lived from 201 million to 237 million years ago, which was about 47 million years before its colossal cousins, the Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus, and 30 million years before the titanosaurs.Back at the lab, they spent months cleaning the fossil and comparing it with other dinosaur species. Dr. Apaldetti and her colleagues studied the Ingentia prima fossils along with remains from a previously known and closely related species called Lessemsaurus sauropoides. Together the two species belong to a group known as \u201clessemsaurids.\u201dIn studying the dinosaurs\u2019 anatomies, she found that like the later Jurassic period giants, Ingentia prima had an avian-like respiratory system, meaning it had air sacs in its neck. But she also found differences.\u201cJust as growth seasons can be observed in a tree, the bony cuts in lessemsaurids show that it had cyclical, seasonal growth,\u201d said Dr. Apaldetti. \u201cBut the style of the bone deposition during these periods of growth is different from the other sauropods or eusauropods we knew so far.\u201dThe lessemsaurids grew through quick bursts that occurred seasonally, she said, while their later counterparts grew at a consistent rate until they became adults.\u201cThe giant sauropods like the titanosaurs of the Jurassic or Cretaceous acquired big bodies through a slow and more complex way,\u201d said Dr. Apaldetti. That included developing extremely elongated necks and forelimbs, smaller skulls and thick, trunk-like limbs. In contrast, Ingentia prima did not have a greatly elongated neck and its legs were more flexible and bent rather than straight and pillar-like. These early giants showed that there was more than one way to climb to the top of the dinosaur world.Advertisement"}

Gregory Hines brought tap dancing back to movies and Broadway; more recently, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Savion Glover and the \u201cit-girl of dance festivals\u201d Michelle Dorrance have given it new life, Mr. Seibert said.\u201cIt used to be in every show in the 1920s to 1940s \u2014 you couldn\u2019t escape tap dancing \u2014 and that\u2019s nowhere near the case anymore,\u201d Mr. Seibert said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not anywhere near dead, and it\u2019s still a thriving, changing form.\u201dMr. Seibert can also be seen tapping along Seventh Avenue\u2019s F-train subway platforms.Here\u2019s what else is happening:A storm is brewing, but it won\u2019t cool us off.Until then, the sun will be out in full force.Who is the New York woman?The Quad Cinema is exploring her complexities \u2014 \u201cfrom a nurturing parent to a fickle mate to a bohemian relative\u201d \u2014 in its largest retrospective of films yet.Here\u2019s a sample of what\u2019s showing this week:Advertisement"}

They used pliers to bend skin of several citrus fruits and found that at a certain point, the stress on the skin causes a break and the oil reservoir empties in a burst.Micro-jets are found in other plants and in animals as well, such as spitting termites and spiders. Why citrus plants show this action when the skin is bent in an extreme way isn\u2019t known, although the oils are toxic to some insects, plants and microbes. The micro-jet phenomenon is the reason that bartenders twist an orange or lemon peel to release the flavor, but that is not likely to have played a part in their evolution.That\u2019s speculation. Dr. Dickerson said that he had undertaken the investigation because of conversations eight years ago with David Hu of Georgia Tech when Dr. Dickerson was an undergraduate working in Dr. Hu\u2019s lab.

{"Headline": "China Said to Quickly Withdraw Approval for New Facebook Venture", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For Facebook, success in China was brief. Very brief.Then the registration disappeared, and references to the subsidiary were partly censored in Chinese media.Now the approval has been withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named because the person was not authorized to speak on the record.While the about-face does not definitively end Facebook\u2019s chances of establishing the company, it makes success very unlikely, the person said. The decision to take down the approval, the person added, came after a disagreement between officials in Zhejiang and the national internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, which was angry that it had not been consulted more closely.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to respond to a request for comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the Zhejiang provincial government and the municipal government in Hangzhou, Zhejiang\u2019s provincial capital, did not respond to requests for comment.The strange incident underscores how much of a challenge it has become for the globe-spanning social network to get into China \u2014 even just to open an innovation center.Its main platform has been blocked in China for almost a decade. Its other services, such as Instagram, were once popular in China, but have since also fallen behind the government\u2019s filters. While Facebook had hoped to dip a toe in the market and work with Chinese developers, its very presence appears to have become a large, and incendiary, political question here.The kerfuffle also illustrates how complicated China\u2019s bureaucracy can be. Foreign companies seeking to expand here must navigate a vast and decentralized government in which provinces, cities and ministries all vie for influence and power. While one part of the government may be happy to support a foreign company like Facebook, that could ruffle feathers elsewhere. Facebook seems to have fallen victim to such a case.The government turnaround is only the latest incident in the long, strange history of relations between the world\u2019s largest social network and its largest internet market.For Facebook, angering officials at China\u2019s internet regulator could make progress particularly difficult, especially as new personnel have just taken over managing the relationship with the Chinese government.Stepping in to replace her has been Zhang Jingmei, who created the company that ran the anonymous Colorful Balloons app, and William Shuai, who was once a low-level Chinese official. Both were listed on the board of the newly created, and quickly disappeared, subsidiary in Zhejiang.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Not until 1755 did it appear in a savory sauce recipe in a Spanish pastry cookbook written by Juan de la Mata, the pastry chef for King Philip V and King Ferdinand VI.The videos discuss the recipes and weave in commentary by historians and chefs to explain the context in which such gastronomy developed, and how modern cooks can draw inspiration from old ways of preparing food. The library has also been creating digital versions of its most important works, including about 200 gastronomy books.\u201cWe have an enormous wealth of data, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can easily attract a huge public,\u201d said Elena S\u00e1nchez Nogales, who oversees the library\u2019s digital section. \u201cThe library has always been a natural habitat for researchers, but food is clearly interesting more and more people, so we just needed to find the right language to reach them.\u201dAlmudena Villegas, a Spanish food historian who participated in the project, said the effort was well timed: \u201cWe\u2019re only now beginning to appreciate how much food tells us about our social history, as well as how much food is a linkage between different sciences that we have long cared about, from chemistry to biomedicine and agronomy.\u201dHe said he enjoyed working with older recipes that offered general guidance rather than the step-by-step instructions of modern cookbooks.\u201cWe\u2019ve become much more technical, so that we treat the preparation of food as if it was some sort of scientific dissection in which everything should also be measured,\u201d Mr. Est\u00e9vez said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think cooking should be like mathematics. I personally much prefer trial and error.\u201dThe cake is made with eggs and caramelized sugar, and topped with lemon and orange zest. \u201cThe buzzword today is creativity, but in the context of great kitchen technology,\u201d he said. In the past, \u201ccooking was all about ingenuity, the art of doing a lot with little.\u201dLike other chefs involved in the library project, Mr. Sa\u00e9nz is in love with the past. He even plans to build an ice well next to his shop, a smaller replica of 17th-century wells built in central Madrid, in which the city stored snow collected during the winter from the surrounding mountains.\u201cI\u2019ve traveled 120 years back in time to discover how much more enjoyment you can get from some basic ingredients than from a lot of what we now call traditional ice cream,\u201d Mr. Sa\u00e9nz said. He followed the original poundcake recipe and used the same ingredients, but decided to caramelize the sugar to evoke the smell of baked bread coming out of the oven.\u201cI really feel that our Western food culture has become obsessed with always finding the latest innovation, instead of really valuing the wealth of our past,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that so much of what we consider new and fashionable already existed a long, long time ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Soros Bet Big on Liberal Democracy. Now He Fears He Is Losing.", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "FeatureHis enemies paint him as all-powerful, but the billionaire philanthropist believes that his political legacy has never been in greater jeopardy.Supported byWearing a dark suit, tieless and with the collar of his blue shirt outside the lapel of his jacket, Soros took the stage with the determined stride of an 87-year-old who still plays tennis a few times a week. But there were some concessions to age. He gave his speech sitting down and used a desk lamp to illuminate the text. (In fairness, the hotel conference room hosting the event was morosely dark.) He turned the pages with his right hand while keeping his left hand on his left knee, as if propping himself up. There were moments when he seemed on the verge of losing his place, although he never did.In person, Soros is quite charming, with a wry sense of humor. But his writings \u2014 he has published 14 books \u2014 and speeches can be a little wooden, and this occasion was no exception. He barely acknowledged the audience, which included the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Albania, except to say, \u201cI think this is the right place to discuss how to save Europe.\u201d But apart from urging the European Union to direct more aid to Africa, which he said would ameliorate the refugee crisis that has led to so much of the recent political upheaval in Europe, his remarks were more descriptive than prescriptive. The European Union, he said, faced an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201dBriefly touching on Europe\u2019s economic outlook, he said, \u201cWe may be heading for another major financial crisis.\u201d Partly in response to his warning, the Dow fell nearly 400 points that day. Soros is generally considered the greatest speculator Wall Street has known, and though he stopped managing other people\u2019s money years ago, the reaction was a real-time display of his continued ability to move markets. The attention given to that comment also underscored, in a subtle way, an enduring frustration of his life: His financial thoughts still tend to carry more weight than his political reflections.Yet the political realm is where Soros has made his most audacious wager. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, he poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the former Soviet-bloc countries to promote civil society and liberal democracy. It was a one-man Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, a private initiative without historical precedent. It was also a gamble that a part of the world that had mostly known tyranny would embrace ideas like government accountability and ethnic tolerance. In London in the 1950s, Soros was a student of the expatriated Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, who championed the notion of an \u201copen society,\u201d in which individual liberty, pluralism and free inquiry prevailed. Popper\u2019s concept became Soros\u2019s cause.It is an embattled cause these days. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has reverted to autocracy, and Poland and Hungary are moving in the same direction. With the rise of Donald Trump in the United States, where Soros is a major donor to Democratic candidates and progressive groups, and the growing strength of right-wing populist parties in Western Europe, Soros\u2019s vision of liberal democracy is under threat in its longtime strongholds. Nationalism and tribalism are resurgent, barriers are being raised and borders reinforced and Soros is confronting the possibility that the goal to which he has devoted most of his wealth and the last chapter of his life will end in failure. Not only that: He also finds himself in the unsettling position of being the designated villain of this anti-globalization backlash, his Judaism and career in finance rendering him a made-to-order phantasm for reactionaries worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m standing for principles whether I win or lose,\u201d Soros told me this spring. But, he went on, \u201cunfortunately, I\u2019m losing too much in too many places right now.\u201dParis was the first stop for Soros on a monthlong spring trip to Europe. He normally would have visited Budapest, but not this time. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a former Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was re-elected in April after running a campaign in which he effectively made Soros his opponent. Orban accused Soros, who is an American citizen, of plotting to overwhelm Hungary with Muslim immigrants in order to undermine its Christian heritage. He attacked Soros during campaign rallies, and his government plastered the country with anti-Soros billboards. In the aftermath of the election, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office because of concerns for the safety of its employees. The fate of the Soros-founded Central European University, based in Budapest, was also in doubt.Soros said he couldn\u2019t visit Hungary under present circumstances: \u201cIt would be toxic,\u201d he said. He told me that Orban\u2019s campaign was \u201ca big disappointment,\u201d but quickly added, \u201cI think I must be doing something right to look at who my enemies are.\u201d Last autumn, he signaled that same sense of defiance when he announced that he was in the process of transferring the bulk of his remaining wealth, $18 billion in total at the time, to the O.S.F. That will potentially make it the second-largest philanthropic organization in the United States, in assets, after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is already a sprawling entity, with some 1,800 employees in 35 countries, a global advisory board, eight regional boards and 17 issue-oriented boards. Its annual budget of around $1 billion finances projects in education, public health, independent media, immigration and criminal-justice reform and other areas. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood are among its grantees.Soros originally planned to close the O.S.F. in 2010. He didn\u2019t want it to outlive him, because he feared it might then lose its dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit. But he changed his mind when he realized that, as he put it, \u201cI had more money than I can realistically or usefully spend in my lifetime.\u201d He also saw that, with liberal values and civil society fragile in so many places, the O.S.F.\u2019s work was becoming ever more essential. \u201cI found a mission, a niche, that I felt could be carried on,\u201d he said as we finished dinner.A few minutes later came an unexpected reminder of what he and the O.S.F. are up against. A Soros aide and I took the elevator back down together, and when we stepped into the Bristol\u2019s lobby, we found ourselves in the middle of a reception line that stretched the length of the room. It had formed there to greet one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving autocrats, Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of Congo. The next day, a few hours after Soros spoke to the European Council on Foreign Relations, Roseanne Barr went on a Twitter rant that served as a vivid demonstration of what he is up against personally. Soros was maneuvering to bring about \u201cthe overthrow of us constitutional republic,\u201d Barr tweeted. She also claimed that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, had actually been a Nazi. Among those who retweeted the Nazi gibe was Donald Trump Jr.In 1946, as Communists were rising to power in Hungary, Soros fled to England. He earned a degree from the London School of Economics, where Karl Popper was a professor. In 1945, Popper published a political treatise, \u201cThe Open Society and Its Enemies,\u201d a fierce assault on totalitarianism, in both its fascist and Marxist forms, and a ringing defense of liberal democracy. Soros left Popper\u2019s classroom with not only the idea that would later animate his philanthropy but also the desire to live a life of the mind. He had to make money first, though. When he moved to New York in 1956 to take a job on Wall Street, his goal, he told me, was to sock away $100,000 in five years, which would allow him to quit finance and turn to scholarly pursuits. But instead, he quipped during our dinner, \u201cI overperformed.\u201dIn 1969, Soros formed what would become the Quantum Fund. It was one of a new breed of investment vehicles known as hedge funds, which catered to institutional investors and wealthy individuals and which used leverage \u2014 borrowed money \u2014 to make huge bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Quantum was wildly successful from its start, delivering 40 percent annual returns. Soros would later attribute his knack for playing the markets to what he called his \u201ctheory of reflexivity\u201d \u2014 basically, the idea that people\u2019s biases and perceptions can move prices in directions that don\u2019t accord with the underlying reality. Soros claimed his strength as an investor was in recognizing and acting on what he referred to as \u201cfar from equilibrium\u201d moments. (His oldest son, Robert, once claimed the \u201creflexivity\u201d explanation was bunk; he said the tip-off for his father that the market was nearing a major move was when his bad back flared up.)By the late 1970s, Soros had become a very wealthy man. Now he had the means to make himself an agent of history. He was frank about his ambition, though also self-deprecating. As he wrote in his 1991 book, \u201cUnderwriting Democracy\u201d: \u201cI was a confirmed egoist but I considered the pursuit of self-interest as too narrow a base for my rather inflated self. If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me into trouble. But when I had made my way in the world I wanted to indulge my fantasies to the extent that I could afford.\u201dHe decided that his goal would be opening closed societies. He created a philanthropic organization, then called the Open Society Fund, in 1979 and began sponsoring college scholarships for black South African students. But he soon turned his attention to Eastern Europe, where he started financing dissident groups. He funneled money to the Solidarity strikers in Poland in 1981 and to Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia. In one especially ingenious move, he sent hundreds of Xerox copiers to Hungary to make it easier for underground publications to disseminate their newsletters. In the late 1980s, he provided dozens of Eastern European students with scholarships to study in the West, with the aim of fostering a generation of liberal democratic leaders. One of those students was Viktor Orban, who studied civil society at Oxford. From his Manhattan trading desk, Soros became a strange sort of expat anticommunist revolutionary.In the meantime, Quantum grew into a multibillion-dollar colossus. Soros made his most famous trade in 1992, when he bet against the British pound. The currency was vulnerable because it had been pegged at what seemed an unsustainably high rate against the German mark; with Britain in recession, Soros reasoned, the British government would ultimately choose to see the pound devalued rather than maintain the high interest rates needed to defend it from speculative investors. Soros\u2019s terse command to his head trader, Stanley Druckenmiller, was to \u201cgo for the jugular.\u201d Druckenmiller did, and on Wednesday, Sept. 16 \u2014 Black Wednesday, as it came to be known \u2014 the Bank of England stopped trying to prop up the pound\u2019s value. It promptly sank against the mark, falling out of Europe\u2019s Exchange Rate Mechanism and dealing a setback to the push for greater European integration. The sterling crisis turned hedge funds into the glamorous rogues of finance and demonstrated the punitive power that they could wield against policymakers in a world of free-flowing capital. The trade made $1.5 billion for Quantum, and Soros, whom the British tabloids dubbed \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England,\u201d became a household name.By then, the Soviet empire had collapsed, and Soros was devoting huge sums of his own money to try to smooth its transition from Communist rule. For example, he donated $100 million to support Russian scientists and keep them from selling their services to countries hostile to the West; he spent $250 million on a program to revise Russian textbooks and train teachers to promote critical thinking. While the era was one of Western triumphalism, when it was widely assumed that Russia and other newly freed countries would inevitably embrace liberal democracy \u2014 a view most famously expressed in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1989 essay, \u201cThe End of History\u201d \u2014 Soros did not share that certitude. This part of the world had little tradition of civil society and liberal democracy, and in his view these needed to be nurtured if the region was to avoid backsliding into autocracy. \u201cI generally have a bias to see the darkest potential,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is something that I have practiced in the financial markets to very good effect, and I have transferred it to politics.\u201dDuring the 1990s, Soros toggled between his day job and his philanthropy, and it was not always easy to disentangle his dual roles. For a time, Quantum and O.S.F. were run out of the same offices. In December 1992, three months after his bet against the British pound, Soros announced a $50 million donation to build a water-treatment facility in war-ravaged Sarajevo, and it was hard not to see that money as having been sucked straight from the British treasury. Soros once described his bifurcated existence rather graphically, writing that he \u201cfelt like a giant digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other.\u201dIf that was the case, indigestion was inevitable, and it came in 1997, when Quantum was at the center of a speculative attack on the Thai baht. The episode was a nearly identical reprise of what happened to the British pound. (Quantum made roughly $750 million this time.) There was one critical difference, however: While Britain was a major industrialized country that ultimately had little trouble absorbing the blow to its currency, Thailand was an emerging economy for which the consequences were devastating. Economic output plunged, banks and businesses folded and huge numbers of people were thrown out of work. The baht crisis rippled into other Asian economies. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, called Soros and other speculators \u201cunscrupulous profiteers\u201d whose immoral work served no social value. Soros publicly rejected the criticism, but when investors took aim at the Indonesian rupiah in the fall of 1997, Quantum was not among them. Nor did it join other hedge funds when they targeted the Russian ruble the following year. Having already invested hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stabilize Russia, Soros would have been undercutting his own work by betting against the Russian currency. He ended up taking a $400 million loss.\u201cThat was where the crossroads between the philanthropist and the investor became difficult,\u201d says Rob Johnson, a longtime Soros associate who worked as a portfolio manager at Quantum in the 1990s. But by then, according to Johnson, the only reason that Soros was still running a hedge fund was to generate more money for his causes.During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soros also cultivated a number of young activists he believed could advance his dream of remaking Hungary as a place he would never again feel compelled to leave. Among them was Viktor Orban, a bright, charismatic student who was ardently pro-democracy, or so it seemed. In addition to providing Orban with a scholarship at Oxford, Soros donated money to Fidesz (the Alliance of Young Democrats), a student organization that Orban helped found and that evolved into his political party.But during the 1990s, Orban drifted to the right. Elected prime minister in 1998, he governed as a mainstream conservative, emphasizing patriotism and traditional values. Outwardly, he remained pro-Western. Under his leadership, Hungary entered NATO, and he also laid the groundwork for its admission to the European Union. But a shock defeat in the 2002 election seemed to radicalize Orban. When he reclaimed the prime minister\u2019s office in 2010, he began ruthlessly consolidating power. He packed the courts with Fidesz loyalists, and various independent media were bought out by Orban supporters. At the same time, he turned away from the West and drew close to Vladimir Putin. Orban was re-elected in 2014. The following year, the European refugee crisis hit. Tens of thousands of refugees passed through the Balkans and arrived on Hungary\u2019s border. Orban\u2019s government erected a 109-mile fence in order to keep them out, and it later refused to comply with a European Union quota plan that would have required it to take in asylum-seekers.Groups that received financial support from the O.S.F. were providing assistance to the refugees massed along Hungary\u2019s border, and this became a pretext for Orban\u2019s war on Soros. The Hungarian Parliament enacted legislation requiring NGOs to register with the government and disclose foreign sources of income above a certain threshold; it passed a bill that would have stripped Central European University of the right to award diplomas in Hungary. Orban\u2019s government introduced what it called the \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill making it a crime to assist illegal immigrants. (Parliament passed the bill last month.)In one campaign rally in Budapest, Orban referred to Soros as \u201cUncle George,\u201d telling tens of thousands of supporters that \u201cwe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the world.\u201d Along with the fiery speeches, there were the billboards, which featured a picture of a smiling Soros and the message, \u201cLet\u2019s not let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d The laughing Jew had been a trope of Nazi propaganda, but Orban denied that the billboards were anti-Semitic.Orban\u2019s coalition won 49 percent of the vote, enough to give it a supermajority in Parliament. But the anti-Soros campaign didn\u2019t end with the election. Days after the vote, a magazine owned by a pro-Orban businesswoman published the names of more than 200 people in Hungary that it claimed were Soros \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The list included representatives of human rights groups, anticorruption watchdogs and Central European University faculty members and administrators. In mid-May, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office, which was responsible for almost half its international grants. Patrick Gaspard, the O.S.F.\u2019s president, says that the language and imagery Orban used to go after Soros was \u201cnothing short of violent\u201d and that the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s threat to turn the country\u2019s intelligence services on the O.S.F. made it impossible to remain in Budapest. \u201cI have the habit of taking autocrats at their word,\u201d Gaspard says. \u201cWe have to protect the security of our staff and of our data.\u201d The office is relocating to Berlin.In recent years, governments throughout Eastern Europe have attacked Soros. But why Orban, personally popular and facing hopelessly divided opponents, chose to make Soros-bashing the centerpiece of his campaign puzzled many observers. Orban \u201cis extremely successful,\u201d Michael Ignatieff, the president of Central European University and the former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party, told me in London in April. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better politician than any of his opposition. He has intelligence and charm. He\u2019s funny and reads a room well. What\u2019s crazy is that he feels he needs to delegitimize Soros in order to win an election.\u201d Some observers offered a psychological explanation: Noting that Orban had had a turbulent relationship with his own father and a tendency to chafe under authority, they suggested that bludgeoning Soros was a form of patricide, a way of slaying his political godfather. But Thomas Carothers, a senior vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes that Soros was simply a useful cudgel for Orban. Civic groups were the last source of potential opposition, he says, and because some of them were backed by the O.S.F., going after Soros was a way to undermine their credibility. \u201cStrongman leaders want to de-universalize human rights and civic liberties,\u201d says Carothers, who has served on various O.S.F. advisory boards. \u201cIt is much harder for Orban to say that he rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is much easier to say, \u2018I push back against this intrusive man sitting in New York.\u2019 Soros is a very convenient bogeyman.\u201dBut Fukuyama went on to say that it takes events and skillful manipulators to rouse the forces of intolerance. In Hungary, the global financial crisis and the refugee crisis were the fuses, and Orban proved very adept at providing the spark. Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., made a similar observation. He said resentment of the European Union, which came to be seen as an \u201cemasculating force of Hungarian identity,\u201d as he put it, coupled with economic anxiety, left Hungarians receptive to Orban\u2019s appeal. \u201cHungarians are not irredeemably racist,\u201d Benardo said. \u201cEthnic entrepreneurs like Orban play upon the darkest fears of people to produce political support and an us-versus-them mentality.\u201dIn contrast to Benardo, my grandfather was not a social scientist. But like Soros, he was a Hungarian-born Jew who ended up in the United States, and he believed that anti-Semitism was a habit of mind that Hungarians would never kick. He admired Soros, but thought he was wasting his money in Hungary. When I told Soros about my grandfather, he smiled and shook his head knowingly. He said that his brother, a shipping magnate, had felt the same way. Soros did not.\u201cI don\u2019t blame the Hungarian people at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I admire them for their willingness to stand up to oppression and to fight for their freedom.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to distinguish between the people and the government.\u201dHe then told me a story from 1944, about a Nazi officer his father met in a cafe. During the course of the conversation, the officer quietly admitted to misgivings about the orders he was obliged to carry out. His father, a Jew in hiding and virulently opposed to the Nazis, tried to comfort the officer, telling him that it was a difficult situation. Throughout his life, the elder Soros shared this story to make the point that circumstances matter and that how people act isn\u2019t necessarily how they feel, a lesson that his son was now applying to Orban\u2019s Hungary. I asked him if he expected to visit Hungary again in his lifetime. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, but without much conviction.Two weeks later, President Trump called Orban to congratulate him on his re-election.Soros was an early backer of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. In Paris, Soros told me that Obama was \u201cactually my greatest disappointment.\u201d Prompted by an aide, he immediately qualified himself, saying that he hadn\u2019t been disappointed by Obama\u2019s presidency but felt let down on a professional level. While he had no desire for a formal role in the administration, he had hoped that Obama would seek his counsel, especially on financial and economic matters. Instead, he was frozen out.After Obama was elected, \u201che closed the door on me,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.\u201d He suggested that he had fallen victim to an Obama personality trait. \u201cHe was someone who was known from the time when he was competing for the editorship of The Harvard Law Review to take his supporters for granted and to woo his opponents,\u201d Soros said.During the 2016 election cycle, Soros contributed more than $25 million to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates and causes. While he had foreseen the possibility of a Trump-like figure emerging (\u201cThe American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth, which increasingly dominates the country\u2019s political discourse,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian in 2007), he was as surprised as everyone else that the Trump-like figure turned out to be Donald Trump. Soros told me that he had known Trump casually and had even socialized with him (about 30 years ago, a friend of Soros\u2019s dated one of Trump\u2019s senior people, and they all went out for dinner a few times). \u201cI had no idea he had any political ambition,\u201d Soros said. Trump had tried to coax him into becoming the lead tenant in one of his commercial buildings, he said. \u201cI told him I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Soros recalled with a chuckle.He said that he had been \u201cvery afraid\u201d that Trump would \u201cblow up the world rather than suffer a setback to his narcissism\u201d but was pleased that the president\u2019s ego had instead led him to reach out to North Korea. \u201cI think the danger of nuclear war has been greatly reduced, and that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d In his annual state-of-the-world speech in Davos this year, Soros said Trump \u201cwould like to establish a mafia state, but he can\u2019t, because the Constitution, other institutions and a vibrant civil society won\u2019t allow it.\u201d He also characterized Trump as a \u201cpurely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020, or even sooner,\u201d and predicted a Democratic landslide in the 2018 midterm elections. Five months on, he was sticking by those predictions. \u201cFor every Trump follower who follows Trump through thick and thin, there is more than one Trump enemy who will be more intent, more determined,\u201d Soros told me. He is doing his part to shorten the Trump era: In advance of the midterm elections, Soros has so far contributed at least $15 million to support Democratic candidates and causes.Asked if he would support Bernie Sanders if the Vermont senator won the Democratic nomination in 2020, Soros said it was too soon to say. He expressed displeasure with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, another possible candidate, over her role in ousting Al Franken from Congress: \u201cShe was using #MeToo to promote herself.\u201d He said his main goal as a political activist was to see a return to bipartisanship, a surprising claim in light of his lavish support for the Democrats. It was the extremism of the Republican Party that had prompted him to become a major Democratic donor, he said; he wanted the Republican Party to reform itself into a more moderate party. He said he was not especially partisan himself: \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be a Democrat.\u201d He spoke of his respect for John McCain. He even said he would be inclined to give financial support to moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, although he quickly walked back that comment: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that. That would hurt them.\u201d And while the Republicans had made bipartisanship impossible, he didn\u2019t want to see the Democrats become more ideologically rigid and confrontational.If Soros views his relationship with the Democratic Party as mostly transactional, for some Democrats the feeling appears to be mutual. While his money is welcome and needed, there seems to be a certain ambivalence about Soros within Democratic circles. It is partly because of his outspokenness. As Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Democratic strategist, puts it, \u201cThe best donors are silent donors; not talking is good.\u201d A bigger issue is that the Democratic Party remains committed to campaign-finance reform and abhors the effect that the Citizens United decision has had on American politics. That 2010 Supreme Court ruling gave billionaires like Soros the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns. Kamarck says that in the post-Citizens United world, Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t unilaterally disarm\u201d and spurn donations from plutocrats like Soros, but they are conflicted about billionaire donors in a way that the Republicans are not.Although Soros is squarely on the left on many issues \u2014 he supports a single-payer health care system and is a longtime advocate of criminal-justice reform \u2014 some on the left have long been dubious of him. In the 1990s, he was portrayed by the far left as an agent of American imperialism, helping to foist the so-called neoliberal agenda (mass privatization, for example) on Eastern Europe. For some critics, Soros\u2019s Wall Street background has always been a mark against him. There is also discomfort with his philanthropy \u2014 not its goals, certainly, but what it is seen to represent. Soros is at the vanguard of what has come to be known as \u201cphilanthrocapitalism,\u201d essentially large-scale social investing by billionaires like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Soros. (Last year Forbes magazine ranked Soros the 20th-richest American.) To those who object, this represents the privatization of social policy and, through the substantial tax benefits that charitable donations receive, it deprives the public sector of money that could be used to promote social welfare.When I asked Soros to describe himself ideologically, he laughed. \u201cMy ideology is nonideological,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the club of nonclubs.\u201d When I suggested that \u201ccenter-left\u201d might characterize his views, he demurred; he said it wasn\u2019t clear where he stood now because the left had moved further left, a development that did not please him. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to the extreme left,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should stop trying to keep up with the extremists on the right.\u201dBut Soros\u2019s Jewish identity, coupled with his status as a Wall Street billionaire, gave those disinclined to support his agenda an easy means to foment suspicion and resentment, and from the moment that he became involved in Eastern Europe, he was confronted with anti-Semitism. The dog-whistling has not abated with time; some would argue that anti-Semitism directed at Soros has become, at least under Orban, a state-sponsored contagion. But it has also lately taken some bizarre twists. Last year, a son of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon of Soros on his Facebook page. (Netanyahu has frequently disparaged Soros because of his financial support for groups critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.) And, of course, Soros is also routinely accused of having been a Nazi.Anti-Soros sentiment is a more recent phenomenon in the United States. Soros became a focal point of right-wing vitriol when he started contributing to the Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News in 2004, Dennis Hastert, who was at the time the speaker of the House, suggested that Soros was involved with drug cartels, telling Chris Wallace that \u201cI don\u2019t know where George Soros gets his money. I don\u2019t know where \u2014 if it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes from.\u201d The effort to demonize Soros has been unrelenting and quite successful. In suggesting that Soros was plotting a coup against the American government, Roseanne Barr was repeating a claim made by, among others, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had posted a meme on her Facebook page suggesting that Soros was conspiring to topple President Trump and \u201cour constitutional republic.\u201dSoros is regularly portrayed as the deus ex machina of American politics, a vast left-wing conspiracy unto himself. His wily hand \u2014 and wallet \u2014 have been blamed for the national-anthem protests in the N.F.L.; the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.; and the violence in Charlottesville. On Twitter, Soros haters trace virtually every national trauma, as well as every setback for conservatives, to him, or anything with the flimsiest connection to him. This stuff isn\u2019t confined to the digital fringes either. The claim about Charlottesville, for instance, was leveled by Paul Gosar, a Republican member of Congress. After news broke of a sex scandal involving the former governor of Missouri, Eric Greitens, that state\u2019s Republican Party issued a statement claiming that he had fallen victim to a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d orchestrated by Soros.At this point, it is fair to say that \u201cSoros\u201d has eclipsed even \u201cHillary\u201d as a trigger for a certain large subset of Republicans and conservatives. In April, conservative media outlets reported that Kimba Wood, the judge presiding over the case of President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had officiated at Soros\u2019s third wedding, in 2013. None of them attempted to explain why this was a problem; it was apparently self-evident. In 2014, Mark Malloch-Brown, a former United Nations deputy secretary general and a longtime Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, became head of a company called Smartmatic, which specializes in electronic voting technology. Soros obsessives eventually seized on this as proof that he was now intent on manipulating election outcomes. In response, the company felt obliged to post a disclaimer on its website stating that Soros had no stake in Smartmatic and that its technology was not used during the 2016 United States presidential election. When I spoke with Malloch-Brown, he told me that this was the price of being associated in any way with Soros. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge I wear with honor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it attaches to everything I do.\u201dMuch of what is said about Soros on Facebook, Twitter and in right-wing media outlets is not overtly anti-Semitic, and it is possible that some of the people pushing these views are not even aware that he is Jewish. But the echoes are there. Glenn Beck used his show on Fox to peddle wild conspiracy theories about Soros. In 2010, he aired a multipart special called \u201cGeorge Soros: The Puppet Master,\u201d which was widely condemned for its anti-Semitic overtones, beginning with its title (the Jew as puppet master, pulling the strings of humanity, is another age-old anti-Semitic trope). In recent years, the so-called alt-right has become a key driver of Soros paranoia. Breitbart portrays him as an arch-\u201cglobalist\u201d who backs unrestricted immigration and a border-free world. (Neither claim is true.) Soros was one of the prominent Jews featured in the last ad of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, which many regarded as anti-Semitic. Steve Bannon, formerly the head of Breitbart, led Trump\u2019s campaign at the time. On a trip to Europe in March, Bannon lauded Viktor Orban as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cthe most significant guy on the scene today.\u201dAlthough the broadsides at Soros are often highly suggestive, the people behind them are usually careful to maintain a degree of deniability when it comes to the question of anti-Semitism. But not always. On his radio show last year, Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy website Infowars, told listeners, \u201cthere is undoubtedly a Jewish mafia\u201d and that it was headed by Soros. Offering the same twist that would later appear in Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet, Jones said that \u201cone of the biggest enemies of Jews was the Jewish mafia\u201d and that Soros was \u201cout to get Jews.\u201dIn April, I met with Lamont. Now a member of the House of Lords and an ardent Brexit supporter, he insisted that he bore no ill will toward Soros because of Black Wednesday. But he regarded Brexit as a domestic political matter in which foreign money should play no part. That Soros had a home and office in London was irrelevant. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote here,\u201d Lamont said. In his view, Soros\u2019s effort to get a do-over vote was undermining British democracy. \u201cI think there would be incredible disillusionment with the political process if this vote was annulled,\u201d he said.During my dinner with Soros, I pointed out that some political observers drew a straight line from Black Wednesday to Brexit, in that the 1992 crisis strengthened the position of the Euroskeptics in Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, the faction that ultimately pushed for and prevailed on the vote to leave the European Union. I asked Soros what he would say to a Brexit supporter puzzled by his seemingly contradictory roles in Black Wednesday and Brexit. His reply suggested he thought the answer was obvious. \u201cThis is the difference between my engagement in the markets, where my only interest is to get it right and make money, and my political engagement, where I stand for what I really believe in,\u201d he said.It is a comment that gets to the heart of the Soros conundrum. Even if you concede that policymakers are ultimately to blame for the income inequality that has fueled so much of the current backlash against globalization, the financial sector has had a major role in worsening it, and hedge-fund titans like Soros are powerful symbols of that inequality. And while Soros has written very candidly and persuasively about the pitfalls of casino capitalism \u2014 most notably in a 1997 Atlantic essay, subsequently expanded into a book called \u201cThe Crisis of Global Capitalism,\u201d in which he acknowledged the destabilizing effect of financial markets \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make him any less of a symbol. When pressed, Soros has said that if he hadn\u2019t gone after the British pound or the Thai baht, someone else would have. That is unquestionably true (and in fact, Quantum was not the only hedge fund targeting those currencies). But that is not a particularly satisfying answer, and certainly not after the Great Recession, in which investment banks and hedge funds played such a destructive role. The industry that made him a billionaire contributed significantly to the circumstances that now imperil what Soros the philanthropist has tried to achieve.On the other hand, if Soros\u2019s riches had gone to someone else, would that person have put the money to the same use? It might have gone to a noble cause, but almost certainly not to something as ambitious and quixotic \u2014 or as dangerous \u2014 as the promotion of liberal values and democracy. (As Putin and Orban have shown, independent civil society is inevitably regarded as oppositional by governments that don\u2019t want their powers checked.) Most plutocrats measure progress in numbers, but the kind of work that Soros, through the O.S.F., has done generally defies quantification. And as Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., noted when we spoke a few months ago, that work can be unpopular in the countries where it is done.Soros\u2019s efforts on behalf of one group in particular, the Roma, seem especially germane right now. In June, the new Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League party, commissioned a census of the country\u2019s Roma. As an \u201canswer to the Roma question,\u201d as he menacingly phrased it, Salvini vowed to expel all non-Italian Roma and added, \u201cUnfortunately, we will have to keep the Italian Roma.\u201d Even in the age of Trump, his words were shocking, but he has refused to disavow them or back down. Improving the status of Europe\u2019s estimated 10 to 12 million Roma has been a major priority for Soros and the O.S.F. since the early 1990s. The organization has contributed more than $300 million to projects combating discrimination against the Roma and providing them with greater education, employment and civic opportunities. It is a struggle because anti-Roma sentiment remains a potent force, a reality underscored by Salvini\u2019s actions and statements. Given the political currents in Europe, this is another battle that Soros may well be losing. Salvini\u2019s popularity has soared.But it is also a clarifying battle. Setting aside all of the complications that come with being George Soros, would you rather live in the world that he has tried to create, or in the world that Salvini and Orban (and, for that matter, Trump) seem to be pushing us toward? In the aftermath of the Great Recession, it can certainly be argued that how Soros earned his money, and the fact that he accumulated such wealth, ought to carry more moral opprobrium in 2018 than maybe it did in 2008. But there is also a case to be made that in the present moment, with its echoes of the 1930s, how he amassed his fortune matters a lot less than what he has chosen to do with it.There have been mistakes; by his own admission, Soros erred in championing Mikheil Saakashvili, the mercurial former president of Georgia, and also became too directly involved in the country\u2019s politics in the early 2000s. He clearly misjudged Orban. But as Victoria Nuland, a former American diplomat who worked for both Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, put it when I spoke to her recently, \u201cGeorge is a freedom fighter.\u201dA household employee showed me to a table in the dining room and offered me some ginger tea: \u201ca specialty of the house.\u201d A few minutes later, Soros walked in. He was dressed in a white linen shirt, dark trousers and sandals. He hadn\u2019t been on the tennis court that morning; he was busy with phone calls instead.In the five weeks since I had seen Soros in Paris, the Trump administration had slapped new trade sanctions on China and imposed tariffs on goods from Canada and the European Union. I asked why the markets and the broader economy were holding up so well in the face of a possible global trade war, the breakdown of the trans-Atlantic alliance and the political turmoil in Washington. Soros said these developments would eventually drag down the market, but he couldn\u2019t say when. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my capacity to anticipate the markets,\u201d he said, adding with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m an amateur now.\u201d It was like hearing Roger Federer saying he had lost his touch around the net. Soros claimed that because the financial world was no longer his main focus, he was unable to time the markets the way that he used to. Politics now commanded his attention.Soros was in a reflective mood. He said democracy was in trouble because in many countries it had become sclerotic, insufficiently responsive to the public\u2019s needs. \u201cIt\u2019s losing out,\u201d he said. Illiberal democracy, of the sort that Orban had fashioned in Hungary, was proving to be \u201cmore effective,\u201d for the time being at least. The new-age autocrats had shown themselves to be particularly cunning in going after civil society as a means of consolidating their power. \u201cIt\u2019s a less abrasive way of exercising control than actually killing people who disagree with you,\u201d he said.It had become clear to him that his mentor and inspiration, Karl Popper, had been wrong in one critical respect. In a democratic society, politics wasn\u2019t ultimately a quest to arrive at the truth; it was about gaining and holding power and manipulating public sentiment in order to do that. \u201cHe was a philosopher of science, and science is a search for reality,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe did not understand politics. In politics, you are spinning the truth, not discovering it.\u201d I asked what Popper, who died in 1994, had thought of his political philanthropy. \u201cHe was very supportive, which means he didn\u2019t take me seriously,\u201d Soros said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Popper would be so happy with my current position, because I\u2019m critical of him.\u201dSoros acknowledged that he had said things in the past that he now regretted \u2014 not necessarily the sentiments, but the way he had expressed them. Referring to the Nazi comments that he made during the Bush years, he said, \u201cThat was probably a mistake.\u201d He told me that he was now choosing his words more cautiously, eschewing comparisons to the Third Reich and the use of the word \u201cfascism\u201d to describe political conditions in the United States and Europe.In Paris, Alex Soros had told me that his father, while an excellent parent, had been emotionally distant. It was, he said, a defense mechanism born of his wartime experience: \u201cTo be emotional, to give off emotion, could be a sign of vulnerability.\u201d But he said his father had started to open up in recent years.As my conversation with Soros in Southampton drew to a close, I thought I picked up a little vulnerability. He was talking about his wealth and the opportunities it had given him. \u201cFor me, money represents freedom and not power,\u201d he said. For a long time, money had given him the freedom to do and say what he pleased, and also the freedom not to care what other people said and thought about him. But he conceded that he had started to care. \u201cI have become a bit more concerned about my image, because it is disturbing to have those lies out there,\u201d he said, citing Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet as an example. He also admitted that being the anointed villain for so many people around the world was unpleasant. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to have that many enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I had more friends.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Viktor Orban was elected to a second term as prime minister of Hungary. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}

My boyfriend wanted her to get them; his ex did not. After much negotiation (and tears from the girl), his ex capitulated, and their daughter\u2019s hair is now colored. The problem: My boyfriend told me that the little girl is dying for me to \u201cnotice\u201d her highlights. I haven\u2019t said anything yet. I agree with her mother, and told my boyfriend so. What should I say to the girl?ANONYMOUSAll week, I\u2019ve been trying to coax myself into seeing these highlights as playful and temporary. Are they really so different from the dress-up trunk I had as a kid? But I failed. All week, I kept coming back to: What kind of parent encourages a little girl to dye her hair? (Judgy, I know.)But it sends a terrible message to the child: \u201cYou aren\u2019t good enough the way you are.\u201d And it strikes me as too adult. The little girl has the rest of her life to worry about her appearance. A parent\u2019s job is to suppress that pressure for as long as possible. Ten years isn\u2019t even close!

What do you think?\u201d (Please get back in touch the minute your boyfriend starts talking about smoothing out his daughter\u2019s laugh lines.)When my stepson married 25 years ago, I was excluded from the receiving line at the reception.

Should I make my stepson aware of this or let it go?FRANCESCAYou\u2019ve kept this bottled up for 25 years? How terrible! Your stepson probably doesn\u2019t even remember his receiving line anymore. It may have been a simple omission or miscalculation by the bride (or wedding planner) that your presence would upset the groom\u2019s mother. Or maybe it would have upset the groom\u2019s mother. There\u2019s no fixed rule here, but you were entitled to a conversation. But there\u2019s a new rule \u2014 starting now! \u2014 that you are not allowed to keep hurt feelings hidden like this. It\u2019s a huge waste of energy. \u201cLetting it go\u201d seems unrealistic. So, tell your stepson: \u201cIt may seem silly to bring this up now, but it hurt me to be excluded from the receiving line at your wedding.

{"Headline": "PayPal Apologizes for Letter Demanding Payment From Woman Who Died of Cancer", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree weeks after a British man told PayPal that his wife had died at 37 and that her credit account should be closed, he opened a letter from the company: Her death, it seemed, was in violation of the company\u2019s contract rules.Her husband of nearly 10 years, Howard Durdle, 40, of Bucklebury, read the company\u2019s list of potential consequences: shutting down her account, requiring repayment of more than $4,000 in debt, and even legal action.\u201cWith grief, there are ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are days when you are very fragile, and there are days when you are feeling stronger. We are lucky that this week I was feeling quite strong.\u201dPayPal said in a statement on Wednesday that it apologized \u201cfor the understandable distress this letter caused\u201d and that it had \u201cquickly performed a thorough investigation.\u201d\u201cAs soon as our teams became aware of this mistake, we contacted Mr. Durdle directly to offer our support, cleared the outstanding debt and closed down his wife\u2019s account as he requested,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have also urgently reviewed the company\u2019s internal processes and have made changes to ensure that an insensitive error of this nature never happens again.\u201dA PayPal spokesman declined to specify how such a letter was sent in the first place or what changes had been made since the episode. Mr. Durdle said a representative for the company told him by phone that the letter possibly stemmed from a software glitch, a poor letter template or a human mistake.\u201cI believe they want to fix that and make it good,\u201d Mr. Durdle said.The letter highlighted a continuing debate over how sensitive companies should be to the bereaved.Companies should think about how, when targeting potential customers, to better take into account unexpected personal tragedies like death, said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School. He called the PayPal letter an \u201cegregious failure.\u201d\u201cIt can create a strong backlash against companies,\u201d he said.Robert Weissman, the president of the nonprofit group Public Citizen, which advocates consumer rights, said companies could continue to face public relations problems surrounding sensitivity as they increasingly use algorithms to dictate outreach and marketing.\u201cIt would be a fair bet that the increasing reliance on them is going to lead to more mistakes,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s too high profile, it\u2019s too newsworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that makes it hard for companies to get away with this without facing a lot of pushback.\u201dMr. Durdle said he wanted companies like PayPal to do better.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m making the noise about it that I am is to try to draw some attention to it so that doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be hugely damaging for people who are trying to recover.\u201dMr. Durdle, an information security executive, said he met his wife on Match.com in 2006, and they married three years later. They bonded over video games, often playing Xbox together. Mrs. Durdle, a strategy analyst for a water utility, first learned she had cancer more than a year and a half ago, but last summer, it seemed as if she had beaten the cancer back.The two bought a home in Bucklebury, about 50 miles west of London, before the cancer returned.Mr. Durdle said that his 40th birthday, at the end of June, was the date Mrs. Durdle had been \u201ctrying to hold out for.\u201d\u201cShe died just a month shy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Los Angeles and Its Newspaper, Explained by Three Buildings", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Three important buildings, designed by three important architects, tell the story of modern Los Angeles and its newspaper.The first was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann and built in 1935 as a new and modern home for The Los Angeles Times, and its distinctive Art Deco style has been an iconic fixture of the city\u2019s skyline.The second, designed by Rowland H. Crawford, is an office tower built in 1948 as the home for a new afternoon newspaper. That project failed, partly because the old street cars went away as the city embraced the automobile, but the building endures.The third was designed by William L. Pereira, a 1973 office building to accommodate the top brass of the Times Mirror Co., the newspaper\u2019s corporate parent. It was built at a time when the paper was growing under the publisher, Otis Chandler, who expanded the paper\u2019s coverage, elevating it into the upper echelon of the country\u2019s great newspapers.Mr. Schave has spent the last 10 years, working alongside Harry Chandler, Otis Chandler\u2019s son, preparing an application to gain monument status for the buildings, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent Omni from developing the site, but would restrict it.He said he started the process shortly after Sam Zell, the Chicago businessman, took ownership of the paper. He immediately sensed that paper \u2014 and the building \u2014 was not in good hands.It was just a coincidence that the city\u2019s Office of Historic Resources accepted the application only recently, just as the newspaper was packing up to move. (The city\u2019s Cultural Heritage Commission will hear the case on July 19.)Struggles over the future of old buildings in Los Angeles can be long, nasty and complicated affairs, pitting historians and conservationists against deep-pocketed property developers.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)This week the Times Magazine tackles one of the fundamental issues of our age: Have the giant tech companies grown too powerful?The article offers the first easy question to ask of the big tech companies: What are they, really?

{"Headline": "How to Talk to a Racist", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "OpinionWhite liberals, you\u2019re doing it all wrong.Supported byContributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 There are still white Southerners who honestly believe that American culture worked better for everyone, white and black alike, under segregation. There are still white Southerners who question how bad slavery really was. When an enslaved black person\u2019s health and strength are needed to guarantee the slaveholder\u2019s livelihood, this argument goes, it just wouldn\u2019t make sense to whip them or starve them or rape them or work them to the point of collapse. Maybe this is what happens when a person\u2019s only \u201cnews\u201d source is the alternative universe of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Or maybe they\u2019re all just racists.O.K., they\u2019re definitely all racists. But here\u2019s the thing: They don\u2019t believe they are. And the problem with writing off people who don\u2019t recognize this country\u2019s pervasive and enduring culture of white supremacy, much less the ways in which they themselves benefit from it, is simple: Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to wake up. Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to say, \u201cOh, wow, you\u2019re right.\u201d I get that it\u2019s hard not to scream \u201cRacist!\u201d at a racist. If you\u2019re a white person who wants to be an advocate, it\u2019s both infuriating and demoralizing to know that the people causing all this suffering are people who look just like you. That much is true about being a white liberal in a culture of white supremacy. But it\u2019s not the only truth.We are hard-wired to recognize difference and to view it as an aberration. Noticing difference is not the same thing as hating difference, of course, but I\u2019m not talking about vicious white supremacists here. I\u2019m talking only about garden-variety prejudice, the kind that operates at an unconscious level in everyone. And the difference between an unconscious liberal racist and an unconscious conservative racist is only a matter of degree, not a matter of kind.But the grumpy old neighbor who voted for Donald Trump out of frustration with Washington? The high-school classmate who posts an Obama joke on Facebook? The white woman on the plane who tenses up when a Middle Eastern man sits down in the seat beside her? Try not to give up on them yet. These folks are your sisters and brothers. You belong to one another in exactly the same way that you and the targets of their racism belong to one another. Welcome to the Hotel California: You are at the most uncomfortable family reunion ever, and you can never leave.If you\u2019re a white liberal whose goal is to feel morally superior to such people, go right ahead and urge them to check their white privilege. Call them stupid rednecks. Get online and tweet your feats of moral derring-do in the cause of a more just society. You haven\u2019t made a single thing better for anyone suffering the actual effects of racism, but when has that ever stopped a white person from airing a little righteous indignation? If, on the other hand, you\u2019re a white liberal whose goal is to foster a more equitable culture, you need to stop yelling \u201cRacist!\u201d at anyone who doesn\u2019t see the world exactly as you do. Somehow you need to find enough common ground for a real conversation about race. Very few people are stupid or irredeemably mean. They\u2019ll listen to what you have to say if they trust you\u2019ll listen to what they have to say back.So take a breath. When you encounter a person who believes he\u2019s merely honoring his ancestors by driving a car with an image of the Confederate battle flag on the tag, when a Facebook friend announces that it\u2019s disrespectful to take a knee during the national anthem, when you sit down next to someone at the church picnic who genuinely loves and respects the black people they know but who consistently votes for politicians with overtly racist policies, stop for just a moment and take a breath. Before you say a single word, think of all the times you made an assumption about a stranger that proved to be untrue. Think of the times you found yourself feeling uneasy in the company of strangers of another race \u2014 think about how you were forced to interrogate that uneasiness. Think of the plank in your own eye. To begin a real conversation about racism, start there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ridgefield Park, N.J.: A 21st-Century Mayberry ", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving inWith its vintage housing stock and close-knit community, residents say making a life in this village of 13,000 is \u201clike living in the \u201950s.\u201d 11 PhotosAt this spring\u2019s Earth Day celebration in Ridgefield Park, N.J., a bluegrass guitarist strummed the theme from \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d \u2014 a fitting anthem for a Bergen County community easily compared to the fictional Mayberry. The trappings of small-town life are evident in working-class Ridgefield Park, one of four official villages in New Jersey. Front porches and fluttering flags abound on cozy, tree-canopied streets, many one-way. The elaborate Fourth of July parade, first staged in 1894, is the state\u2019s oldest. The supermarket, with four aisles and a painted tin ceiling punctuated by spinning fans, is more like the grocery where Aunt Bee shopped. Even Ridgefield Park\u2019s most famous native \u2014 strait-laced Ozzie Nelson, from another black-and-white TV classic, \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\u201d \u2014 underscores the suburb\u2019s old-fashioned, unhip, Starbucks-free image. \u201cIt\u2019s like living in the \u201950s here,\u201d said Karen Purpura, a 69-year-old flutist who moved to Ridgefield Park with her partner, Tom Olcott, from nearby Englewood last year after inheriting a house from a friend. \u201cPeople look out for each other; the neighbors even snow-blow our property. It\u2019s a family town. You feel grounded.\u201d The couple\u2019s rambling 1908 colonial, with its wraparound porch, is representative of the housing stock, 60 percent of which is at least a century old. Ms. Purpura said she and Mr. Olcott, a 66-year-old musicians\u2019 union official, put more than $100,000 into repairs and upgrades. \u201cWe retained the integrity of the house, restoring it back to the original wood floors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to live any other place. This is our home, where the grandkids come. We love the house and we love the neighborhood.\u201d Beyond ambience, home buyers have pragmatic reasons for choosing Ridgefield Park, which has 13,000 residents in less than two square miles. Located at the nexus of highways, the village offers a short commute to New York, just five miles from the George Washington Bridge and 11 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel. And home prices are markedly lower than in other Bergen County towns like Ridgewood, with which Ridgefield Park shares village status and an inventory of turn-of-the-century houses.Ayse and Firat Okcu paid $400,000 for a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath colonial in Ridgefield Park in 2016 after considering two towns farther north in Bergen County, Emerson and Oradell, for their strong school systems. But accessibility won over the couple, parents of a 1-year-old. Mr. Okcu, 41, has a 35-minute early-morning bus ride to Manhattan, where he works at a Times Square hotel, and Ms. Okcu, 37, has a reasonable drive to the Weehawken hotel where she works. \u201cPlus, the type of house we bought would have cost $50,000 to $100,000 more\u201d in the other towns, said Ms. Okcu, who described Ridgefield Park as friendly and secure. Janice Cima, a broker associate with Keller Williams Village Square Realty in Ridgewood, grew up in Ridgefield Park and said locals have long invoked Sheriff Andy Taylor\u2019s idyllic hometown when describing their own. \u201cRidgefield Park is similar to Mayberry in that it\u2019s picturesque and tight-knit,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople move here and stay through multiple generations. You can\u2019t say that about many towns.\u201d While many prize Ridgefield Park for its proximity to Manhattan, Ms. Cima said, the vintage homes \u2014 the oldest of which was raided by the British during the Revolution \u2014 are also a draw. \u201cBuyers appreciate the uniqueness of the houses \u2014 the crown moldings, the original woodwork,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come to Ridgefield Park for new construction.\u201dSituated just north of the Meadowlands, Ridgefield Park occupies a peninsula bordered by the Hackensack River to the west and Overpeck Creek to the east. Interstate 80 is the northern border, with Teaneck and Bogota on the other side; Route 46 slices through the village\u2019s southern flank. Mayor George Fosdick described his town as \u201cever-changing, yet eternally the same,\u201d and said commercial development east of the turnpike keeps things that way. Homeowners benefit, he added, because \u201cour future, in terms of economic development, lies in the area of Ridgefield Park where people don\u2019t live,\u201d ensuring that the village proper maintains its traditional appearance.Between June 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018, 70 single-family houses sold at a median price of $324,500, up from $310,000 during the previous 12-month period, according to the listing service. The median price of a co-op was $83,500, and that of a condominium or townhouse, $184,950.\u201cRidgefield Park has always had a countrified air about it,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cCompared to other places, we\u2019ve maintained our small-town character.\u201dStudents in kindergarten through sixth grade attend one of three neighborhood elementary schools: Grant, Lincoln or Roosevelt. Ridgefield Park Junior-Senior High School enrolls 1,240 in grades seven through 12. Average SAT scores for 2016-17 were 515 in reading and writing and 511 in math, compared with 551 and 552 statewide. Sixty-nine percent of the class of 2017 went on to college, versus 71 percent statewide. Mark Hayes, the interim superintendent, said the school district is \u201cturning a corner\u201d three years after a $2.5 million budget shortfall necessitated the appointment of a state fiscal monitor.There is no train station in Ridgefield Park; most commuters take the bus instead.

{"Headline": "In Daring Underwater Cave Rescue, 4 of 13 Thai Are Freed", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAE SAI, Thailand \u2014 When the wail of the ambulance siren first reached the Thai village, people started cheering: The sound meant one of the boys trapped in a cave for more than two weeks was out at last and on his way to the hospital.Nine remained behind, waiting their turn to escape, as of early Monday morning. The boys on the team range in age from 11 to 16, and the coach with them is 25.One by one, the first four to be rescued emerged after a treacherous, hourslong journey through the tight, underwater passageways of Tham Luang Cave. Skilled cave divers, part of a team assembled from around the world, hugged the four to their bodies as they swam through the dark.\u201cThe 4th wild boar is out of the cave,\u201d said a posting Sunday evening on the Facebook page of the Thai Navy SEALs, who are aiding in the rescue. The Wild Boars is the name of the boys\u2019 soccer team.After the first four were rescued, however, the evacuation came to a halt. There was no choice: The rescuers had used up all the air tanks divers had placed along the route, said Narongsak Osottanakorn, the head of the search operations. It would take divers 10 to 20 hours to replace the tanks for the next rescue attempt, he said.Divers navigated flooded passages, with some openings as small as 3 feet wide, to rescue the soccer team.The rescue was far from over \u2014 but it was a remarkable turn in the 16-day drama that has captivated Thailand and the world.\u201cToday, everything was very smooth,\u201d Mr. Narongsak told a throng of reporters at a news conference. \u201cToday is the best day, with the best situation of the weather, the health of the boys and the water level.\u201dNone of the options were easy: Drill through a mountain. Wait months for the floodwaters to recede. Or escort scared and exhausted young people, few if any of whom could swim, through an underwater maze that was daunting even for the world\u2019s best cave divers.After considering several alternatives, Thai officials settled on a tandem dive arrangement with the boys wearing full face masks so they could breathe normally.Underscoring just how dangerous getting the boys out of the cave could be, the operation suffered its biggest setback on Friday, when a volunteer diver, Saman Gunan, 38, a former Thai Navy SEAL, died after losing consciousness while underwater. He had been placing air tanks along the route \u2014 the same task that other divers must now hurry to complete.But Sunday\u2019s rescues went more quickly than expected, offering hope that the remaining nine team members could be extracted soon and safely.With most of the team still in the cave, the rescuers were racing against time, and the weather. Dark clouds shrouded the mountains above the cave much of the day Sunday, bringing heavy rains and threatening to raise the water level in the cave once again.Mr. Narongsak said 90 divers assisted in Sunday\u2019s rescue, about 50 of them from overseas. He said 18 divers \u2014 13 foreigners and five Thais \u2014 made up the team that brought out the four.He did not say which countries the foreign divers came from, but British cave divers have played a key role in the operation, and the United States, Australia and China have all sent teams to help. Divers from several other countries have also volunteered.The divers entered the cave at 10 a.m., and Mr. Narongsak said at the time that he expected the first rescue to be done by 9 p.m. In fact, it was three hours earlier than that. The last of the four was taken from the cave before 8 p.m.All four were quickly transported to a hospital in Chiang Rai, the nearest large city.Before the mission began, expert divers said the first mile of the journey out of Tham Luang Cave would be the most dangerous.The tandem divers could expect to face strong currents and pass through perilous tunnels, without any air pockets for safety in an emergency.\u201cEveryone knows exactly what they have to do, because any confusion in there would be really bad,\u201d Mr. Narongsak told reporters shortly after the operation began.Only a day earlier, on Saturday, Mr. Narongsak had told reporters that a rescue attempt was not imminent. But the weather worsened suddenly overnight, prompting officials to move quickly.\u201cWe believe there are no days when we have been readier than today,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said on Sunday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do the rescue on the day when we are readiest, we might lose the opportunity to carry out this mission.\u201dThe cavern where the group took refuge is about 2.5 to three miles from the cave\u2019s lone entrance. When the cave is flooded, it can take skilled divers more than five hours to make the trip from the entrance to the cavern.Crews have been pumping huge amounts of water out of the cave, which has helped improve access to the area. But water levels farther from the entrance have dropped more slowly.Residents of the region were jubilant over the rescue of the first four.In the town of Mae Sai, where the trapped boys\u2019 soccer team is based, residents and family members celebrated the sound of every helicopter and ambulance they heard, proof that some boys had left the cave and were being rushed for treatment. The medical conditions of the four people rescued were not known.\u201cI am so happy!\u201d said Kamon Chanthapun, an adviser to the boys\u2019 team. \u201cI was so worried because they are just children, stuck for so long in the dark.\u201dOne of the team members, Adul Sam-on, is a student at the Ban Wiang Phan school here. Inside, students had written messages on heart-shaped sticky notes placed in a big heart shape on a bulletin board with optimistic messages. \u201cHopefully our friend can come out safely,\u201d read one.Many family members have spent every day and night at the command center near the cave, praying for the boys to come out alive.Relatives said they were not angry with the coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, for taking the boys into the cave. Instead, they praised his efforts to keep them alive during the ordeal.\u201cHe loves the children,\u201d said Nopparat Khanthawong, the team\u2019s head coach. \u201cHe would do anything for them.\u201dThe vast cave complex was mostly dry when they entered. But the cave is, in essence, a seasonal underground river, and rain began falling soon after they arrived. Within hours, they were trapped by rising water.Their discovery after 10 days inside the cave, and the successful evacuations on Sunday, beat what many had seen as discouraging odds.A United States Air Force rescue specialist and cave diver who is assisting in the operation said conditions in the cave complex were so challenging that finding the boys was akin to climbing Mount Everest. And bringing them all out safely, officials said, would be even harder than locating them.Two British divers discovered the group on Monday evening just as they were laying down the last of their guidelines and were about to turn back.Since then, the boys have been regaining their strength and learning how to use diving gear in preparation for their escape.Four Thai Navy SEAL members have stayed with the group, including a Thai Army doctor who is also a SEAL, who was seen on a video clip treating their scrapes and cuts.In Thailand, the plight of the boys brought together, at least temporarily, a country that has long been divided between the urban elite and the rural poor.The country also has a relatively new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who ascended the throne in 2016. He has let it be known he is closely monitoring the search and rescue operation. He donated supplies to the rescue effort and urged officials to bring out the boys as soon as possible.On Monday, divers are expected to try to rescue as many of the remaining boys as they can.\u201cI\u2019m really happy now,\u201d said Mr. Nopparat, the head coach. \u201cBut I\u2019m still rooting for the rest of the team.\u201dMuktita Suhartono and Navaon Siradapuvadol contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Instead, the Trump administration deported him and put his son in a shelter. Now the family cannot get the boy out.Ms. Cornejo Villavicencio is an Emerson Fellow and a graduate student at Yale University.Rosa also has an 8-year-old daughter with her former partner, which the social worker said could be used as grounds to deny her custody of Brayan. So she got a notarized letter from the girl\u2019s father saying he would take full financial responsibility for the girl. Then the social worker left the case for a month, only to be reassigned to it recently. Officials with the shelter said it has strict rules on reuniting children with relatives to make sure they are not released to human traffickers, which was a concern in 2014 with unaccompanied minors. But many if not most of the children who have been placed in shelters by the Trump administration did not arrive unaccompanied; they were forcibly separated from parents who have since been jailed or deported. And for those, like Brayan, who do have relatives in the United States, odds are those relatives are low-income, undocumented and do not have access to legal representation. \u201cUndocumented children with representation are five times more likely to be successful in their cases, but the financial hardship these cases pose are often out of reach for low-income and undocumented families,\u201d Jennifer K. Falcon, communications director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services said. (The group, known as Raices, has agreed to give Brayan\u2019s grandmother legal assistance.)In a recent phone call, Brayan described the living conditions at his shelter. He has a room of his own with a bed, dresser and radio. He said that many of the children shut themselves in their rooms to cry after their twice-a-week phone calls with their parents. Meals consist of cornflakes for breakfast and ham sandwiches for lunch and dinner. When I called Brayan, I could hear children crying in the background. Brayan sounded tired, perhaps because he is depressed or exhausted from crying. He said all the children were given a pill each day \u201cso they wouldn\u2019t get sick.\u201d His grandmother said she was worried the pills were sedatives because he had been anxious about sleeping alone since his mother\u2019s death, but he seemed to be sleeping well at the shelter. Shelter officials denied giving the children drugs. Jos\u00e9 described how in Honduras he\u2019d walk home from work and begin to smile to himself as he anticipated seeing Brayan at the door, waiting to hurl himself at his father for a hug. He replays this image over and over in his head. He had dreamed of a new life with his son. Now separated by borders, he hopes his son will have a shot at a promising life with his grandmother. But the thought that he might not see him again is painful.\u201cBrayan is sad. He\u2019s in despair,\u201d Jos\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd I feel guilty. I threw my son away.\u201d I tell him that he didn\u2019t, that Brayan was taken from him. \u201cI feel like crying, but what good is crying?\u201d he replied. \u201cSo even though I am not religious, I pray. If only I could see him at the door now, it would make me so happy.\u201dKarla Cornejo Villavicencio is an Emerson Fellow and a graduate student at Yale University.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.First, the awful lot: Judge Kavanaugh would shift the balance of constitutional jurisprudence to the right, creating a solid right-wing majority on the court possibly until the second half of the 21st century. While the somewhat unpredictable Justice Anthony Kennedy once served as the fulcrum for the court, that role will now go to Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., a far more ideological conservative. One proposal would limit justices to 18-year terms, which would create an opening on the court every two years, and reduce some of the political gamesmanship that surrounds open seats today. But any change to the justices\u2019 tenure would require a constitutional amendment, and so is a longer debate for another day.In the meantime, what should senators ask Judge Kavanaugh?The Federalist Society claims to value the so-called strict construction of the Constitution, but this supposedly neutral mode of constitutional interpretation lines up suspiciously well with Republican policy preferences \u2014 say, gutting laws that protect voting rights, or opening the floodgates to unlimited political spending, or undermining women\u2019s reproductive freedom, or destroying public-sector labor unions\u2019 ability to stand up for the interests of workers.In short, Senate Democrats need to use the confirmation process to explain to Americans how their Constitution is about to be hijacked by a small group of conservative radicals well funded by ideological and corporate interests, and what that means in terms of the rights they will lose and the laws that will be invalidated over the next several decades.Americans who care about the court\u2019s future and its role in the American system of government need to turn to the political process to restore the protections the new majority will take away, and to create an environment where radical judges can\u2019t be nominated or confirmed. As those tireless conservative activists would be the first to tell you, winning the future depends on deliberate, long-term organizing in the present, even when \u2014 especially when \u2014 things appear most bleak.Advertisement"}

Now he is on the front lines of the culture wars.\u201cI believe in social justice and fairness,\u201d Mr. Allison said.Since September 2017, he has filed three suits, including one last month against Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit that helps the financial services industry with physical security and cybersecurity. In 2016, the organization started a \u201cDiversity Scholarship\u201d that awards female recipients $5,000 apiece, along with covering the costs of attending an industry conference.\u201cCybersecurity is made up of well over 90 percent men and the idea is that diversity of thought, including from gender, will really improve our cybersecurity as a nation,\u201d said Bill Nelson, the organization\u2019s president and C.E.O. \u201cWe saw this lawsuit and felt like, \u2018No good deed should go unpunished.\u2019\u201dThe use of Unruh by men\u2019s rights activists reflects \u201ca gross misunderstanding of the nature of our sexist society and of what is specifically going on in the state of California,\u201d said Larry Organ, the lead lawyer at the California Civil Rights Law Group, whose headquarters are in Oakland, Calif. Yet it is also revealing potential legal holes in certain current feminist strategy.On a sunny Thursday in June, Mr. Allison walked slowly down the stairs of a strip mall commercial center in downtown San Diego to talk about his efforts. Mr. Allison was sitting with Allan Candelore, 34, another N.C.F.M. member and frequent plaintiff, and Harry Crouch, 68, the coalition\u2019s president. Mr. Crouch, who grew up in Anchorage, said he began working in men\u2019s rights after a relationship with an abusive woman led him to seek state funding for a program for abused men. He was told men don\u2019t qualify for such grants, he said.After moving to Southern California, Mr. Crouch met Philip W. Cook, the author of \u201cAbused Men,\u201d who told him about N.C.F.M., which emerged from men\u2019s rights groups that formed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the wake of feminism\u2019s second wave. Mr. Crouch attended a meeting in Los Angeles and joined. He started a paternity-testing business in San Diego, but it didn\u2019t take off. He then opened a space called the California Men\u2019s Center, which he hoped would become a shelter for men. When he learned that the coalition\u2019s president was seeking a successor, Mr. Crouch raised his hand and turned the California Men\u2019s Center into N.C.F.M.\u2019s headquarters.Swag includes bracelets that say, \u201cSave the Males.\u201d\u201cIf you took the flip side and said, \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s a girl,\u2019\u201d Mr. Candelore said, \u201cwe\u2019d be up in arms.\u201dMr. Candelore works for his father\u2019s law firm, Men\u2019s Legal Center, in the same building as the N.C.F.M. office. It largely represents men in divorce, custody and paternity cases. (The firm has female clients as well, Mr. Candelore said, including paternal grandmothers fighting for visitation rights.) Mr. Allison is the graduate of a boys\u2019 prep school in Connecticut who attended the University of Southern California and has worked in information technology. He traces his interest in discrimination cases to his military service, during which he was stationed with his family in Japan.\u201cI just think I was a little bit more sensitive when I was back here toward fairness,\u201d Mr. Allison said. \u201cYou see who\u2019s putting the load on things, who\u2019s contributing back to society.\u201d Getting involved in the N.C.F.M. and filing Unruh cases have helped him channel difficult emotions into positive action, he said.\u201cIt gave a purpose to some of the things that I was feeling instead of basically complaining and it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. At least you can focus on things instead of internalizing it,\u201d Mr. Allison said. \u201cI think as men we have a tendency to internalize a lot of things and it puts some people over the edge, where they may do something to harm themselves and harm others.\u201dThe coalition members have become known around town as men who want to know when a bar or club is offering a discount on admissions or drinks only to women.\u201cI get feedback from people saying, \u2018Hey, look, someone\u2019s having this event,\u2019\u201d Mr. Allison said. \u201cOr I get something from a promoter, telling me, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re trying to do this\u2019 or \u2018This business is doing this thing, we\u2019re being honest and then these other guys are being underhanded by letting women in free to a place.\u2019\u201dThen Mr. Allison and his associates will go \u201ctest out\u201d the place, meaning they will go to an establishment or event and seek the special access or price being offered to women, sometimes with a cover story. After being turned away or charged more, the plaintiffs work with a lawyer and decide whether to sue. \u201cI have never filed a case that has been frivolous or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Allison said.He did not want to discuss the specifics of any actions, but here is a sampling:All of these cases were settled, and the defendants wouldn\u2019t comment.In a more recent case, Mr. Allison sued Poway Weapons & Gear, Inc. for providing, once a month, free use of its shooting range to female patrons, as well as a lounge and raffle.\u201cI emphatically deny the allegations, and it will be easily proven in court,\u201d said John Phillips, the owner of Poway. \u201cWe have pictures of men in the so-called women\u2019s lounges, and we actually have had complaints from women that men were winning too many of the raffles.\u201dMr. Allison, Mr. Candelore and Mr. Crouch all say that their court actions benefit women\u2019s rights because special-drink offers and differences in cover charges, in particular, are often intended to draw female customers as a bait for men. When Mr. Allison, Mr. Crouch or other would-be plaintiffs go to establishments to test them, they on occasion have brought Ms. Bell, 51, because they need a woman, she said, to prove different treatment. She had tested establishments five or six times before she made the case to the men that she should be included as a plaintiff so she could share in the financial rewards.Ms. Bell said she received about $1,500 from the El Mundo Del Tango suit. \u201cI didn\u2019t get equal pay,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept joking that I should sue them.\u201d Founded in 2016 by Claire Wasserman, a former marketing director, Ladies Get Paid was intended as a \u201csafe zone,\u201d she said, where women could speak openly about money and issues contributing to pay disparities and \u201cuncomfortable gender dynamics at work.\u201d Events of different sizes have cost from $15 to $60 and have featured professional coaches and other speakers.A second suit against Ladies Get Paid was also filed, on behalf of a man named George St. George, who, the complaint said, was turned away from an event in Los Angeles.Ms. Wasserman was stunned to find herself on the wrong side of discrimination suits. \u201cAt first I felt really guilty and just thought, \u2018How could I have been so stupid for starting something that keeps some people out?\u2019\u201d \u201cThen I got over my guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I got mad.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money to fight it,\u201d Ms. Wasserman said. \u201cThese guys are winning. We are rolling over and funding them.\u201dBehind almost all of this litigation is a lawyer named Alfred G. Rava, 62. Formerly a secretary of N.C.F.M., he has filed some 300 Unruh cases. For the last three years, he has filed at a rate of about one per month. Citing a disability, he declined to meet in person for an interview, or to speak on the phone, but was a willing email correspondent. Mr. Rava wrote that his desire to hold companies accountable for differential treatment came from growing up in the anthracite fields of northeastern Pennsylvania, where he saw \u201chow the wealthy mine owners mistreated the poor Polish, Italian and Irish immigrant coal miners, such as my grandfathers, uncles and father.\u201d Mr. Rava also noted that he served as consultant to the lawyer representing a woman who in 2009 filed a suit against MasterCuts, a chain of hair salons, for offering coupon discounts only to men. Mr. Rava graduated from Penn State with a degree in environmental science and helped design wastewater treatment equipment and other environmental products in Houston. He sued two former employers for nonpayment of commissions and won a jury verdict against an insurance company after it denied a $6,500 claim on a damaged car.Motivated, he said, to \u201chelp other people who got screwed,\u201d he enrolled at California Western School of Law, in San Diego. In 2002 he went to a bar in San Diego\u2019s Gaslamp Quarter and was charged a $10 admission fee that women didn\u2019t have to pay. \u201cI asked the bouncer if I could get in for free, and he told me he would do so if I went home and put on a skirt and some lipstick,\u201d Mr. Rava wrote.Not all of the businesses Mr. Rava sues concede. In 2011, a client took on the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., claiming that it discriminated against men by offering female golfers a 25 percent discount and partial donation of their greens fees to research during Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Mr. Rava has a new client: Lawrence Pollister, known as Abe, a self-described \u201cliberal, pro-gender equality feminist.\u201d In May, Mr. Rava filed a class action Unruh lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Pollister, 29, after a November 2017 comedy show for a female-only audience performed by Iliza Shlesinger at a theater in Los Angeles. Ms. Shlesinger; a production company and its owner; and United Talent Agency, which booked the gig, are cited as defendants. But when he and a female friend showed up at the club and went to the will-call booth to retrieve their tickets, Mr. Pollister was denied entry by a club employee, he said, because he is a man. \u201cOh no, honey, I\u2019m just one of the girls! I\u2019m gay,\u201d he told her. The employee told him, he said, that Ms. Shlesinger explicitly wasn\u2019t allowing men into the show.Mr. Pollister, who moved to California from New Mexico to escape what he called \u201can oppressive Republican rural community who ostracized and tortured me for being an effeminate gay man,\u201d was humiliated and upset to be excluded, he said.He said he sought an apology through Ms. Shlesinger\u2019s representatives, but did not receive one and began to do research about discrimination law.Then he read that a suit had already been filed, by Mr. Rava on behalf of Mr. St. George, the plaintiff on one of the Ladies Get Paid suits. Mr. Pollister contacted the lawyer, who dismissed Mr. St. George\u2019s suit and then refiled it as a class action with Mr. Pollister\u2019s name atop the complaint. \u201cMy motivations are purely political. I don\u2019t want someone to say, \u2018I won\u2019t bake a cake for you because you\u2019re gay,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pollister wrote. \u201cHow is that different from saying, \u2018I won\u2019t let you in this theater because you\u2019re a man?\u2019\u201dHe also invoked one of #MeToo\u2019s most cherished phrases.\u201cA marginalized group of people doesn\u2019t need to exclude others to create a \u2018safe space.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pollister wrote. \u201cDoing so actually does exactly the opposite, and gives power to your oppressors.\u201dDoris Burke contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Spider in My Life", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world is on fire, but the tiny creature in my family room is a balm against the human chaos outside.Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 A small gray spider has pitched an elaborate camp at my work space in the family room. She is not an orb-weaver like E.B. White\u2019s famous Charlotte. This spider\u2019s web is a multilayered hammock-like construction strung between the leaves of the orchid I got for Mother\u2019s Day and anchored by silken strands to the window frame in back and to an African violet and a desk lamp on either side. I don\u2019t like to disturb my new deskmate, so I don\u2019t water the plants. The orchid, a pink-and-purple confection with wide, glossy-green leaves, needs hardly any water. It is perfectly suited for this task. The African violet has seen better days.In disheartening times, in times of fear and grief, it is tempting to assign human meaning to natural systems. How many people have told me that a loved one has returned to reassure them in the form of a mockingbird singing at midnight outside a silent house or a swallowtail butterfly lighting on a freshly carved tombstone? When the world has lost its still center, we grasp for any reminder that it is nevertheless spinning exactly as it must.But my spider \u2014 for of course she is my spider now; one of those anchor lines has attached itself to my heart \u2014 is more than a symbol of the enduring natural order. She is more, even, than merely herself, performing the same motions her kind have performed for eons. She is also the linchpin of a flourishing miniature ecosystem. In winter, the worm composter is a simple contraption populated almost exclusively by earthworms, but in the summer other creatures find their way into it through open windows and doors. Whenever I lift the top of the worm composter in summertime, a small cloud of fruit flies rises into the air. The process works fine with ordinary overripe bananas, but it works faster with pre-primed fruit from the worm composter. Thus will many of the fruit flies that begin their life in my family room make it to Central America transformed into a young hummingbird\u2019s feathers and bones. Any fruit flies that escape in the transfer from worm composter to hummingbird feeder are dispatched before they reach my kitchen by the spider on my work table.This kind of circular structure is what I love best about nature, even in its most violent reality. (Outdoors, my spider\u2019s web might have been destroyed by hummingbirds, who build their nests partly of spider silk, and the spider herself might have been fed to the baby hummingbirds.) Everything goes to some crucial use; nothing goes to waste. It makes sense. And things that make sense are particularly reassuring when the human world has turned itself upside down.I remember a time when Republicans wanted to be the party of fiscal responsibility and personal integrity, the party of patriotism and old-fashioned accountability, but those Republicans are gone. The zombie Republicans who have taken their place are racking up a monstrous national debt while simultaneously propping up an incompetent president who lies to his own people, who insults our allies and disparages our institutions, and who has broken \u2014 personally or by proxy, through policy \u2014 all but one of the Ten Commandments. (Honestly, though, what do we even know about whether he honored his parents?)There is only so much information a person can take in during an emergency. There is only so much active resistance a person can engage in without succumbing to despair. Sometimes a body needs to rest. In the face of a country gone mad, we cling to any recompense we can find. I have friends who pray more now, friends who drink more now, friends who read more fiction and watch more television, friends who have taken up yoga and needlework and gardening. I have friends who wanted to adopt a kitten and then found that so many people had the same idea they had to get on a waiting list. A waiting list for rescue kittens!I have tried some of these distractions myself, but I am taking my greatest comfort in a plastic bin full of earthworms turning garbage into food for flowers, in one small spider crouching among a hundred silken strands that gleam like silver in the sunlight, in a cloud of fruit flies on their way to becoming a baby hummingbird\u2019s wings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Gains Status in China, at Least for a Moment", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has registered a subsidiary in the city of Hangzhou, according to a Chinese government filing, which said the company had gotten approval last Wednesday. The subsidiary was financed with an investment of $30 million, according to the records.Yet late Tuesday, in a sign of possible complications, the corporate registration was taken down from the Chinese government website, and some references to the new subsidiary appeared to be censored on social media in the country.The moves indicated how complicated it remains for Facebook to navigate China, where it has been blocked for almost 10 years. If the subsidiary is allowed to proceed, it will be a toe in the water here for the Silicon Valley company. Facebook said it wanted to use the subsidiary to coordinate with Chinese developers in the closely censored market.Even to release an app in China, Facebook is likely to need a separate license from regulators. To go further and introduce one of its larger products, like its social network or messaging service, would require further negotiations over issues like data storage and security. Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing service, Instagram, and its messaging platform, WhatsApp, are also blocked in China.\u201cWe are interested in setting up an innovation hub in Zhejiang to support Chinese developers, innovators and start-ups,\u201d said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman, referring to the province in eastern China where Hangzhou is. \u201cWe have done this in several parts of the world \u2014 France, Brazil, India, Korea \u2014 and our efforts would be focused on training and workshops that help these developers and entrepreneurs to innovate and grow.\u201dThe ruling Chinese Communist Party deems all social networks that it does not ultimately control, like Facebook and Twitter, as potentially destabilizing. A series of sophisticated internet filters block residents from gaining access to such sites. Networks within China often self-censor, but are still held closely accountable by government regulators.If Facebook started introducing services in China, it would probably face questions about whether to censor content or share data with Beijing. The latter could be a particularly tricky issue for the social network while it is under scrutiny by the United States government for its handling of user data.Facebook\u2019s fortunes in China follow some progress here for Google, which has also seen its products slowly squeezed out of the market. Over the past year, the search giant has set up an artificial-intelligence research lab in China and introduced several services, including an A.I.-powered sketching game.The legal representative for Facebook\u2019s new China subsidiary was the same employee who registered the company that launched Colorful Balloons: Ivy Zhang, Facebook\u2019s chief representative and head of business development in China.Also on the board of the new subsidiary with Ms. Zhang is William Shuai, Facebook\u2019s China government affairs representative and a former government relations executive at the Chinese search engine Baidu and LinkedIn. Before holding those positions, Mr. Shuai was briefly a low-level official in the Chinese government.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.

The bride\u2019s father is the chairman of American Rock Salt Company in Mount Morris N.Y., and the owner of the Newport Car Museum in Portsmouth, R.I.The groom, 29, is an account director at TuneIn, a digital audio streaming service based in San Francisco. He also graduated from Cornell.He is a son of Noreen N. Carvolth and Dr. Richard D. Carvolth of Santa Rosa, Calif. His father is the chief physician executive of Dignity Health, a health care system in Sacramento.Although Ms. Buerman and Mr. Carvolth overlapped at Cornell in 2011, it wasn\u2019t until each moved to San Francisco in November 2015 that they would finally meet. Shortly after he had arrived from New York and she Boston, they crossed paths at a San Francisco supermarket.\u201cI was shopping with my brother at Safeway, when I saw this beautiful woman there,\u201d Mr. Carvolth said. \u201cThen I turned and said, \u2018Hey, I know that girl, she went to Cornell.\u2019\u201d She was someone, he also told his brother, he had \u201cadmired from afar\u201d while at Cornell.\u201cShe was always with a lot of friends,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seemed like the kind of person that everyone wanted to be around.\u201dHe tried his best at being around her at Safeway, positioning himself in areas of the store he hoped she might see him and start a conversation, but Ms. Buerman, who had never seen or heard of Mr. Carvolth, simply went about her business and then headed for the checkout counter. He managed to get directly behind her while she attempted to pay her bill, and watched as she struggled through a conversation with the clerk who had been asking for her loyalty membership card. Knowing the store could look up members by telephone number, Mr. Carvolth stepped in and saved the day by offering his own card, thinking that would create a spark, but it didn\u2019t.\u201cHe told me that he had also gone to Cornell,\u201d Ms. Buerman said. \u201cYet I\u2019m standing there thinking: \u2018What is this deadbeat doing at a supermarket on a weekday afternoon? Doesn\u2019t he have a job?\u2019\u201dThey each walked away with groceries but no contact information. But Mr. Carvolth went on Facebook the next week to contact a friend of Ms. Buerman\u2019s.About a week later, he sent Ms. Buerman a text message that arrived just after she had pulled over to a gas station to buy a bottle of water, leaving in the car both her cellphone and the same friend who had passed along her contact information to Mr. Carvolth.Ms. Buerman had not yet returned when her friend noticed the text that included an invitation to dinner and drinks for the next evening. Ms. Buerman\u2019s friend, pretending to be Ms. Buerman, agreed to the date.

{"Headline": "They Bonded as the Pacific Crest Trail Burned. Now They Heal It.", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCASCADE LOCKS, Ore. \u2014 He posted photos of himself on Facebook as he hiked hundreds of miles of the vast Pacific Crest Trail, masked in a bandanna to protect his lungs from the smoke of the fires that had closed down parts of it. She told him about the inner workings of NASA, where she was a college intern in Alabama.As the West burned a year ago, Mark Beebe, the hiker, and Tara Prevo, the intern who was then stationed more than 2,000 miles away, began getting to know one another first through a connection on Facebook, then through texts, phone calls and trailside video. He told her of his job delivering pizzas in Portland, Ore., to make ends meet, leaving long days to rove the woods. She told him about her time of homelessness, living for a monthslong stretch out of a pickup truck.But it was the fires, they said \u2014 and the lure of the Pacific Crest Trail, which Ms. Prevo was already dreaming of trying to hike herself \u2014 that forged their relationship.By the end of 2017, the West had suffered one of the worst fire years in decades and an area more than three times the size of Connecticut lay charred, the second-worst year since the early 1950s. East of Portland, a portion of the Pacific Crest Trail \u2014 the western counterpart to the Appalachian Trail and a place that defines for many people a kind of spirit path on which to test oneself or find meaning \u2014 burned on for three months through the steep terrain of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.Through the fires of 2017, Mr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo, both 28, kept on texting and talking, sometimes for long hours into the evenings as Mr. Beebe rerouted his hike to get around the fires, like hundreds of other Pacific Crest hikers. More than 170, trapped by the fire in the Columbia Gorge, had to be rescued.Sitting beside his tent, Mr. Beebe decided that no matter what came next, he would ask Ms. Prevo out on a real date if they ended up in the same place at some point.\u201cI thought she was out of my league,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I decided to try.\u201dBy the time the winter snows came, Mr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo were a couple, and portions of their beloved Pacific Crest lay in ashes.Their response? They went back in together, along with scores of others, to rebuild.The Pacific Crest is the trail of John Muir, whose name evokes for many Americans the spirit of the Sierra Nevada, the redwoods, and the first stirrings of the conservation movement \u2014 a place that draws thousands of hikers every year seeking escape from work and urban life, but also meaning in the stories of how the trail\u2019s solitude and beauty became part of Western lore.The fire in the Columbia Gorge, which the authorities say began on Sept. 2, 2017, when a teenager threw fireworks into the woods, felt to many in the Pacific Northwest like a final emotional blow in a disastrous year of fire.After wildfires, people often think of rebuilding homes, businesses and farms, but devastated stretches of the Pacific Crest Trail also needed fixing. And repairing scorched public lands is no simple task. In places where people live, insurance policies and federal disaster relief programs come into play. Wild lands, by contrast, are mostly on their own, dependent on volunteers like Mr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo. Government land budgets, stacked toward firefighting, have little left to help once the fires are out.One day in May, Mr. Beebe, Ms. Prevo and 10 other volunteers put on borrowed hard hats, threw iron bars and rakes over their shoulders and hiked to part of the Columbia Gorge that was still blackened and closed to the public. On this day, the volunteers, organized and led by a local chapter of the Pacific Crest Trail Association, were tackling a 22-foot patch that had collapsed as huge tree roots beneath it burned to powdery ash.The task would take about seven hours, and involve dragging dozens of rocks and boulders, some of which weighed 400 pounds or more. Six people strained at the corners of a rock sling to move the biggest ones. One of the team\u2019s leaders \u2014 a retired engineer and accountant \u2014 then positioned the foundation stones with an exacting eye and an iron pry bar, building a wall on which a fresh layer of dirt would be tamped down.After hours of labor, the volunteers, grimy and caked in soot, had finally filled the hole on their collapsed stretch. They laid a new pathway of dirt on the rock foundation. Future walkers will probably pass without a clue about how things had broken at this one spot, or who had fixed them.\u201cPeople don\u2019t know what goes into one little piece of trail,\u201d Mr. Beebe said as he stood on the edge of the hole in well-worn hiking pants that had frayed at the cuffs.Distance hiking is about muscle and endurance, but also myriad fussy details of management \u2014 calories, hydration, dry socks and blisters. For Mr. Beebe, fire was just one more wrinkle.He had hiked more than 1,700 miles of the 2,650-mile trail by his first conversations with Ms. Prevo, and as he described his journey \u2014 and his mental map for the miles ahead around the blazes that were ripping through Oregon and Washington \u2014 she found herself deeply impressed. He was charming, she thought, but better yet, a nerd.\u201cThe way that you tackle a problem, and pick apart the various resources and stuff that you have for it \u2014 that\u2019s a strange thing to love about somebody,\u201d she said, looking at Mr. Beebe across a coffee shop table in Portland recently. \u201cBut I was just really attracted to that.\u201dMr. Beebe and Ms. Prevo have been out together five times now to work on fixing parts of the Pacific Crest Trail. They are planning for Ms. Prevo\u2019s own solo hike on the trail in 2020, after she finishes an engineering degree. They intend to walk the first 86 miles from Canada, heading south together \u2014 the stretch Mr. Beebe, for all his improvisation, was unable to complete. He plans to be back in school by then anyway. He dropped out several times over the years, but intends to resume a study of computer science, partly inspired, he said, by a woman he met while he was walking in the woods.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Yet whether Mr. Trump himself is clear about the strategy he\u2019s pursuing, or whether he in fact has one, remains as mysterious as ever. Of course, two days of gratuitous and self-defeating Trump bombast and threats preceded this resolution. The president publicly browbeat and insulted allies as deadbeats taking advantage of American generosity. He then raised the ante, demanding that they meet the 2 percent target \u2014 it\u2019s a target, not some specific legal obligation \u2014 by January and then go on to raise spending to 4 percent of G.D.P. Why that much? What strategic objective, what threats to the alliance, is Mr. Trump worried about? He didn't say. Greater spending by American allies might mean the United States could lower its own spending and bring thousands of troops home. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t make that argument, but he has often talked about withdrawing forces and closing bases, whether in Germany or Syria or somewhere else. Other allies could better advance their own security, and NATO\u2019s, by spending more to solve the migration crisis and other problems that have fanned nationalism and authoritarianism, and weakened democratic institutions, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland. This trend, encouraged insidiously by Russia, may be the biggest threat, eroding the alliance from within.This threat seems more in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s broader interests. He has made clear that Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and seizure of Crimea are of little matter to him. He\u2019s spoken more warmly of President Vladimir Putin than of any ally, even disputing the Russian leader\u2019s role in undermining the 2016 election. Advertisement"}

Some channels that stream videos on these subjects have millions of subscribers. Most are hosted by men.\u201cThere is a lot of discussion about YouTube being an unpleasant environment for female creators,\u201d said Inoka Amarasekara, an Australian researcher in science communication. \u201cI wanted to see if that affected science communication on YouTube, and if that was something I could corroborate.\u201dIn fact it was.\u201cShe so ugly I almost threw up. Ew.\u201d \u201cI was just staring at your bbbooo.....i mean eyes.\u201d \u201cGo back to the kitchen and make me double stack sandwich.\u201d Ms. Amarasekara didn\u2019t feel confident that an automated sentiment analysis could capture the meaning of the comments, so she manually sorted each of the thousands of comments into one of six categories: positive; negative or critical; hostile; sexist or sexual; appearance-based; and neutral or general discussion. Of course, that meant she had to read them all.\u201cI was quite disappointed by the time I\u2019d gone through them,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see why people would not want to be on YouTube.\u201dThe researchers found that about 14 percent of comments for female on-camera hosts were critical, compared to about six percent for male hosts. They also found female hosts got a much larger proportion of comments about appearance (4.5 percent for women versus 1.4 percent for men) and comments that were sexist or sexual (nearly three percent of comments for women versus about a quarter-percent for men).There were some positives for women as well. Female on-camera hosts elicited more comments, likes and subscribers per view than the other categories. They even received a slightly higher percentage of positive comments compared to male hosts.That study also found that comments for videos with female presenters tended to be more \u201cemotional\u201d \u2014 significantly both more positive and negative. \u201cI\u2019m sure it does discourage some female creators from starting a channel, but I think it goes further than that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt discourages female creators from continuing to make videos and being able to do that at a professional or semiprofessional level.\u201dSince then, Ms. Graslie says, her channel\u2019s community has gotten more positive \u2014 but she\u2019s frustrated that the conversation about women on YouTube doesn\u2019t seem to have evolved. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about women struggling to be successful on a platform, and yet I\u2019m still only asked about something I made five years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I got more recognition for the other 200 videos that I\u2019ve made.\u201dYouTube allows creators to block comments with specific words and phrases. Creators may block their own home address, for example, as well as share lists of words that tend to pop up in hostile comments. But Ms. Graslie also questioned whether YouTube could do more to support women on its platform.\u201cThe comment section on YouTube just isn\u2019t built for constructive conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most controversial comments seem to be the ones that rise to the top.\u201dWhen asked about the study, YouTube said in a statement, \u201cWe don\u2019t tolerate hateful or abusive comments and remove them when flagged. Additionally we provide uploaders with tools to moderate, disable and even hold potentially objectionable comments for review.\u201dMs. Amarasekara and Dr. Grant believe more research is needed around broader gender categories as well as factors like ethnicity, sexual orientation and physical ability, which could help improve how scientific information is communicated to the public.\u201cIf you have diverse voices, you\u2019ll reach more diverse audiences,\u201d Ms. Amarasekara said. \u201cIf you want to reach more people, you need people who speak to them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a science communication researcher.

I happen to know that you can wander around France and make yourself understood and catch at least a quarter of what people are saying with absolutely no use of the subjunctive. The survey is part of the Broad Institute\u2019s studies of the genetics of dogs and the attitudes of people toward them. Researchers hope the results will help them better understand how \u201cpeople evaluate and perceive mixed-breed dogs.\u201dSo far, the results show that we certainly don\u2019t perceive their heritage very well. But you don\u2019t see chow chows in the same number that you see Labrador retrievers.Other breeds common in mutts were German shepherds, labs and golden retrievers, as well as American Staffordshire terriers, which are essentially pit bulls. (The findings are now being reanalyzed, because in the first pass pit bull guesses were judged wrong. In reality, if the subject mutt had any American Staffordshire terrier in its background, then pit bull should have been judged a correct answer.)Among the best guessers in the survey was an amateur who got all three breeds right for four dogs. Nobody had more triples.But it was a professional who achieved the greatest accuracy: 41.9 percent. Not guessing a third breed, which I and other survey responders often did, was an indication that we could not bear just throwing in Labrador retriever again and again out of desperation.My accuracy was 18.3 percent. I got at least one breed right for 13 dogs, and two breeds for two dogs. My greatest success was Sophie. I guessed two of her three breeds. Poodle and Havanese.Advertisement"}

By attacking Mr. Jordan\u2019s accusers, dismissing the accusers as politically motivated and spinning deep-state conspiracy theories \u2014 even as the accusations pile up and Mr. Jordan\u2019s denials grow more dubious \u2014 lawmakers are opting for tribal loyalty over concern for the public good. While this kind of blind partisanship may feel like a necessity to Republicans in the age of Donald Trump, it has real potential to come back and bite them on their backsides. Also, it\u2019s morally wrong.As proof of such feverish theories, multiple members have noted that the law firm handling the abuse investigation for Ohio State has contracted with a Washington-based firm that previously did work for the Democratic Party on the infamous Steele dossier. (Don\u2019t you see? It all goes back to Hillary!) Following Republicans down that rabbit hole leads only to madness.

The congressman clearly fancies himself a fearless crusader willing to stand up to power. But what we have seen of him in the Trump era paints a different picture, of a man absolutely willing to look the other way when things around the workplace get weird and icky. Knee-jerk, belligerent, circle-the-wagons, we\u2019re-the-real-victims-here defiance has become the default attitude in Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party. It may in fact have become the party\u2019s defining characteristic. But while it plays well with angry, resentful elements of the Republican base, it\u2019s unlikely to prove an enduringly popular message for the broader electorate. Roy Moore showed as much when he handed Democrats a Senate seat in blood-red Alabama. Lawmakers continue down this path at their own peril. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FEMA Admits It Failed Puerto Rico. Can It Do Any Better? ", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe agency\u2019s disorganization and a lack of supplies and personnel contributed to the havoc.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.A report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency has now confirmed, in brutal detail, what has long been evident: Its response to the killer hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico last fall was chaotic and tragically inadequate. Yet as another hurricane season approaches, blame is less important than learning from failures. Last year\u2019s storms were the most destructive on record, and climate change promises worse to come. As Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, correctly said, the after-action report \u201cprovides a transformative road map for how we respond to future catastrophic incidents.\u201dAmong other things, wrote Brock Long, the FEMA administrator, all levels of government and individual families need to be much better prepared, especially in areas hard to reach in the immediate aftermath of a great storm. FEMA must take into account not only the logistical problems of dealing with devastation on islands like Puerto Rico, but also the possibility of multiple simultaneous disasters. When Hurricane Maria struck on Sept. 20, FEMA was already coping with the damage of Hurricane Irma in Florida, Texas and the United States Virgin Islands.All of that is evident in the report, and should be acted on promptly by federal and local governments. There can be no excuse next time for the sort of incompetence and chaos that marked FEMA\u2019s work on Puerto Rico. But there is another lesson that does not figure into FEMA\u2019s account.Many mainland Americans persist in regarding Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens. The condescension with which Puerto Rico is too often held was clearly behind President Trump\u2019s downplaying the disaster and his complaints about the cost, and most likely behind the radically underreported casualties.When the next killer storms strike, and they will, all Americans should be secure in the knowledge that their government, local and federal, will be there ready and able to help.Advertisement"}

One gang leader who faced some 11 criminal counts, including for murder, Mr. Pina said, had been holed up in his community for 15 years.Some gang members he met were able to leave behind that life through the efforts of the church, include one young man who had been shot in the neck by a supposed friend.

The man had criticized the mayor\u2019s policies on each occasion, the police said.On Monday night, the suspect, a 62-year-old resident of Burien turned himself into the police. He was arrested and released while the investigation continued, Sgt. Ryan Abbott of the King County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Tuesday. Sergeant Abbot added that the case was expected to be forwarded to prosecutors late Tuesday, with a recommendation for hate-crime charges.A few days after President Trump was inaugurated, Burien adopted an ordinance instructing city officials, including the police force, not to question residents about their immigration status in most circumstances, making Burien a \u201csanctuary city.\u201d Earlier this month at a City Council meeting, the police chief reaffirmed that policy.Mr. Matta is a former farmworker and labor organizer who was born in Idaho to parents who were undocumented migrant farmworkers. He was elected to public office for the first time last November, more than nine months after the sanctuary ordinance was adopted; he was elevated to mayor by a vote of his City Council colleagues in January.The attack on the mayor was being investigated for a possible charge of malicious harassment, The Seattle Times said in its report.

A thumbs up.Human rights groups slammed Mr. Pompeo\u2019s decision, saying he had squandered valuable leverage over President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at a time when his human rights record seems to be only getting worse.\u201cRepression is breeding resentment, and in some cases radicalization,\u201d said Brian Dooley of Human Rights First, an American advocacy group. \u201cThat will ultimately further destabilize Egypt and undermine American interests.\u201dAmerican officials say they withheld the $195 million in aid to press Egypt over a narrow set of issues. The Trump administration wants Mr. Sisi to overturn the 2013 conviction of 43 employees of international groups that promote democracy, including 17 American citizens.And it wants Mr. Sisi to rescind a draconian law regulating aid agencies that he signed last year, which could make it virtually impossible for many international aid groups to work in Egypt.But those demands were made in private, and experts said it was unclear how much the Egyptians had conceded. It seems probable that Mr. Sisi will seize on the resumption of aid as a validation of his actions so far, and perhaps will feel emboldened to step up his repression.\u201cIt\u2019s highly debatable whether Egypt has fully met any one of those conditions,\u201d said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy. \u201cBut the Egyptians will present this decision as an American blessing of their policies.\u201dThe aid decision reflects the new tenor of American foreign policy under Mr. Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who have shown a willingness to trade American leadership on human rights for an embrace of friendly autocrats like Mr. Sisi who share their hostility toward political Islam.Mr. Sisi has long enjoyed a warm relationship with President Trump, who hailed the Egyptian leader as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d and even publicly complimented his taste in shoes. But the Egyptian leader had a tougher time from the previous secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, who last August denied Egypt $96 million in aid and suspended $195 million.Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has partly addressed some American concerns. A retrial of the case involving the 43 foreign aid workers, many of whom were convicted in absentia, is scheduled to start this year. Egyptian media reports say that Mr. Sisi has forced North Korea to cut the number of diplomats stationed at its embassy in Cairo.But such restrictions can be easily circumvented through the use of accounting measures, like counting diplomats as spouses, said Mr. Miller, the analyst, who worked on Egypt at the State Department until last year. \u201cIf past is prologue, we will see that as soon as the U.S. looks the other way, the Egyptians will start up their relationship with North Korea again,\u201d he said.On most other fronts, things have gotten markedly worse in Egypt. Since Mr. Sisi\u2019s re-election in May, after a carefully managed vote, the president has redoubled his efforts to lock up even relatively mild critics.Sami Anan, a former army chief who was thrown in jail when he dared to stand against Mr. Sisi for election in April, recently suffered a stroke that has incapacitated him, a close relative said in an interview.His military captors denied requests for emergency surgery abroad, the relative said.Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a surgeon and activist who was imprisoned in May for critical comments he made against Mr. Sisi on social media, is being held in solitary confinement, his wife, Fatma Mourad, said in an interview. \u201cShady thinks that Sisi wants to punish him,\u201d she said.Critics say Egypt squanders much of the military aid it receives, splurging on expensive tanks and warplanes rather than on less glamorous, but more useful, counterinsurgency training for its army.But others argue that full American engagement is essential to help Mr. Sisi combat the Islamist extremists based in Sinai who carried out numerous bombings of churches and mosques across Egypt last year.\u201cEgypt cannot be simply ignored by the United States,\u201d Samuel Tadros of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom said at a congressional hearing this week.\u201cAbandonment is not a strategy nor will imaginary solutions of cutting U.S. aid result in Egypt\u2019s transformation into a liberal democracy,\u201d Mr. Tadros said.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: In Tallinn and Vilnius, the Complexities of Independence", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlaces 24 and 25Our columnist gets a taste of two beautiful, complicated Baltic cities \u2014 each a capital celebrating the 100th anniversary of its country\u2019s independence.\u201cThey started organizing this in July and it happened in August, so they had five weeks to get together two million people and there was no Facebook,\u201d Ms. Jogi said. \u201cIt would never happen again. So this shows how much people wanted it.\u201d Over a week, I got my own taste of the identities of these two beautiful, complicated Baltic cities, each with movie-set-ready old towns that have been declared Unesco World Heritage sites. Modernism abutted Soviet-era ruins and medieval churches. I found both incredible food and some disturbing lessons in political history I won\u2019t soon forget.To hear a history of the Baltics is often to hear of invasion. Both Estonia and Lithuania declared independence while under foreign occupation during World War I and had to fight to make those declarations reality. After two decades on their own between the world wars, both were annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union, where they remained until that empire collapsed in 1991.So it hasn\u2019t been 100 years of independence so much as 100 years of fighting for it through periods of war and oppression. Still, who could blame the Baltic people for wanting to celebrate?But through all that changing of hands, Baltic culture never died, and one of the best ways to honor that is through the incredible food to be found throughout the region. Through a series of oversights in planning \u2014 hey, it happens when you\u2019re booking over 52 legs of travel in 11 months! \u2014 I wound up with the bulk of my time in Tallinn on the weekend of Midsummer\u2019s Eve, the summer solstice. It\u2019s the longest day of the year, when night lasts for around an hour and a half, and the biggest holiday other than Christmas. Very little was open for two and a half days, as the majority of Estonians were headed to the countryside or the beach for bonfires and barbecues. Set in fields and forests right on the beach, the museum is made up of thatched-roof farmhouses and windmills that have been transported there. On the night of the solstice, it became the site of one of the greatest music and dance festivals I\u2019ve had the pleasure of witnessing. \u201cThese crosses for us were like symbols of hope and liberation,\u201d she said. For decades, the Soviets would clear out the crosses, only for Lithuanians to put them back up again. They gave up clearing in 1970. The last count was around 100,000, but now, Ms. Kakneviciute said, it must be at least 300,000. Nearly everyone who comes to the site leaves a cross anywhere they choose, whether for a loved one\u2019s death or a newborn baby. Even Pope John Paul II made a pilgrimage in the \u201990s to leave a giant crucifix. And when a single cross falls over, it leaves a trail of broken crosses, like fallen dominoes. Every year, she told me, she goes on a \u201cpatriotic mission\u201d to Siberia with a group of young Lithuanians to interview any locals who remember the experiences of deportees. They also clean up cemeteries, then come back to tour schools with the stories they\u2019ve learned. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember this still-living history because maybe in 10 years they are all passing away,\u201d she said. \u201cLots of people are still crying around in Lithuania, \u2018Oh, what a bad life we are having!\u2019 But then just think what our grandparents lived through.\u201d\u2014 There is no train between the two cities, but you can take an hourlong flight, a very long bus ride, or make like the locals and drive. It\u2019s seven hours and you could break it up with stops in the Latvian capital of Riga, plus Kaunas and Trakai, with its island castle, in Lithuania.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Meg\u00e8ve and Arles, FranceAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that the Forest Brothers, a group who waged a guerrilla war against the Soviet Army, were involved in the executions of Lithuania's Jewish population. The Forest Brothers were formed after the war and so could not have been involved, though some of those involved in the executions went on to become members of the Forest Brothers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Annoyed by Restaurant Playlists, a Master Musician Made His Own", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow Ryuichi Sakamoto assembled the soundtrack for Kajitsu, in Murray Hill, and what it says about the sounds we hear (or should) while we eat.Last fall a friend told me a story about Ryuichi Sakamoto, the renowned musician and composer who lives in the West Village. Mr. Sakamoto, it seems, so likes a particular Japanese restaurant in Murray Hill, and visits it so often, that he finally had to be straight with the chef: He could not bear the music it played for its patrons. If I\u2019m going to spend decent money on a meal, I don\u2019t want the reservation-taker, the dishwasher or someone from the back office to be cooking it; I want someone who is very good at cooking food to do it. The same should apply to the music, which after all will be playing before, during and after the eating.I would prefer that music not seem an afterthought, or the result of algorithmic computation. I want it chosen by a person who knows music up and down and sideways: its context, its dynamism and its historical and aural clich\u00e9s. Such a person can at least accomplish the minimum, which is to signal to the customer that attention is being paid, in a generous, original, specific and small-ego way.Some of what we heard at Kokage sounded like what Mr. Sakamoto would logically be interested in. There was slow or spacious solo-piano music from various indistinct traditions; a few melodies that might have been film-soundtrack themes; a bit of improvisation. Where there was singing, it was generally not in English. I recognized a track from Wayne Shorter\u2019s record \u201cNative Dancer,\u201d with Milton Nascimento, and a pianist who sounded like Mary Lou Williams, although I couldn\u2019t be sure. This wasn\u2019t particularly brand-establishing music, or the kind that makes you want to spend money; it represented a devoted customer\u2019s deep knowledge, sensitivity and idiosyncrasies. I felt generally stumped and sensitively attended to. I felt ecstatic. I found out that Mr. Sakamoto had enlisted Ryu Takahashi, a New York music producer, manager and curator, to help him with the playlist. My son and I met them both, as well as Norika Sora, Mr. Sakamoto\u2019s wife and manager, on a bright spring afternoon between services at Kajitsu, where the tobacco-earth smell of Iribancha tea permeated the dining room. Mr. Sakamoto was dressed in black down to his sneakers.I asked if the story I\u2019d heard was true. It was, he said. I asked if it would bother him if people knew. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to hide.\u201dHe is not in the habit of complaining when he has a problem with music in public spaces, because it happens so often. \u201cNormally I just leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot bear it. But this restaurant is really something I like, and I respect their chef, Odo.\u201d (Hiroki Odo was Kajitsu\u2019s third chef, and worked there for five years, until March. Mr. Odo told me the music had been chosen by the restaurant\u2019s management in Japan.)Some of those things, individually, may be very good, I suggested.\u201cIf they have context, maybe,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut at least the Brazilian pop was so bad. I know Brazilian music. I have worked with Brazilians many times. This was so bad. I couldn\u2019t stay, one afternoon. So I left.\u201dHe went home and composed an email to Mr. Odo. \u201cI love your food, I respect you and I love this restaurant, but I hate the music,\u201d he remembered writing. \u201cWho chose this? Whose decision of mixing this terrible roundup? Let me do it. Because your food is as good as the beauty of Katsura Rikyu.\u201d (He meant the thousand-year-old palatial villa in Kyoto, built to some degree on the aesthetic principles of imperfections and natural circumstances known as wabi-sabi.) \u201cBut the music in your restaurant is like Trump Tower.\u201dWell-known tracks, he suggested, can be useful. But some feeling of lift or transcendence is essential. (He cited the jazz-harp music of Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby as examples of music that does not go wrong.) Also, a great playlist for your customers is not equal to the music you listen to for own purposes. \u201cI draw the line,\u201d he specified, \u201cat something I might listen to at home, which might be bleak and dystopic.\u201dI asked Mr. Sakamoto whether the exercise of creating a restaurant playlist was as simple as choosing music he liked. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning, I wanted to have a collection of ambient music \u2014 not Brian Eno, but more recent.\u201d He came to the restaurant and listened carefully as he ate. He and his wife agreed that the music was much too dark in mood.\u201cThe light is pretty bright here,\u201d Ms. Sora said. \u201cThe color of the wall, the texture of the furniture, the setting of the room, wasn\u2019t good for enjoying music with darker tones, to end your night. I think it depends not just on the food or the hour of the day, but the atmosphere, the color, the decoration.\u201dMr. Takahashi reckoned that he and Mr. Sakamoto made at least five drafts before settling on the current version of the Kajitsu playlist. Some songs were too this or too that \u2014 too loud, too bright, too \u201cjazzy.\u201dIt was also not very loud, and here we arrive at an issue that may concern older customers more than younger ones. Mr. Sakamoto objects to loud restaurant music, and often uses a decibel meter on his phone to measure the volume of the sound around him. He has composed original music for public spaces before, he said \u2014 a scientific museum and an advertising-agency building in Tokyo. He used light and wind sensors to change the music during the day. But the only experience he has had making playlists of the music of others, for other people, has been for family members.Mr. Sakamoto and Mr. Takahashi plan to change their playlist with each new season. Mr. Odo\u2019s next venture, a bar named Hall and a restaurant named Odo, is scheduled to open in the Flatiron district in the fall. Mr. Sakamoto, again, has been retained as chief playlister.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Battle for Guadalcanal, This Time With China", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUADALCANAL, Solomon Islands \u2014 When Toata Molea looks to the sea and his fleet of fishing boats on the island of Guadalcanal, he imagines the possibilities from a new connection to the outside world: a planned undersea internet cable to be built by Australia.When he turns the other way, however, to the main road passing through Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, he sees another form of foreign investment: dozens of buildings and businesses bought or built by Chinese immigrants.\u201cThey own everything,\u201d Mr. Molea, 54, said of his ethnic Chinese neighbors. \u201cMy fear is that in the next 10 years, this place will be taken over by the Chinese.\u201dAfter years of largely unchecked Chinese investment and immigration throughout the South Pacific, Australia and the United States are stepping up their efforts here and across the region \u2014 warning local officials against relying too much on China, and pushing to compete with more aid, infrastructure and diplomacy.There is no denying that \u201cstrategic competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific region is on the rise,\u201d said Matt Matthews, a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. As a result, he said, \u201cwe must not take our longstanding friendships with the Pacific islands for granted.\u201dA large portion of that money will go toward installing the undersea cable connecting Guadalcanal (and Papua New Guinea) to Australia\u2019s global internet hub.Experts consider Australia\u2019s spending spree the strongest example yet of its intensified push to counter Chinese efforts in the region.The Chinese networking company Huawei announced last year that it planned to lay a cable and provide the Solomon Islands with a high-speed internet connection.When Australia learned of that plan, it threatened to withhold a connection license when the cable reached Sydney because it considered Huawei a cybersecurity threat.Australian officials immediately offered an alternative: Australia would pay for a cable and it would be up and running by 2019.When they saw the Chinese cable proposal, he said, the Australians \u201cmade an intervention and said, \u2018Sorry, that\u2019s a red line for us.\u2019\u201dFor business owners in particular, the undersea cable is long overdue. Connectivity is so weak across the Solomons that storm clouds often interfere with the satellites that currently provide internet access.But to truly compete with China, many people said, Australia, the United States and their allies need to do more, more visibly, with less bureaucracy.The cable stands out because it is a rarity. The aid packages cited with pride by officials in Canberra and Washington tend to focus not on the tangible infrastructure that struggling countries like this one crave, but rather on institutional assistance with governance and law enforcement.Regional officials often argue that too much of the aid money is tightly restricted or boomerangs back to foreign consultants and contractors, leading many to ask: Well, why not try our luck with China?Anthony Veke, 41, the ambitious premier of Guadalcanal, counts himself among those pushing toward a future with various partners.He told me he has gone to China twice in the past year to pursue investment for a tourism development on the island\u2019s west coast that would include a new airport.He added that he would like to see a new road circumnavigating Guadalcanal, and an upgrade for the international airport.\u201cWe can\u2019t be boxed in,\u201d Mr. Veke said, sitting in his office on the main road through Honiara, where dust and potholes still dominate. \u201cWe have to be given an opportunity to look at other places for things that are good for our people.\u201dGiven the history, it is a striking shift \u2014 for the Solomons and the postwar order.Honiara exists largely because of World War II and the United States Navy.Naval Construction Battalions, better known as Seabees, built most of the city\u2019s roads, its major bridges and what was until recently its largest hospital.Little development has occurred since \u2014 the airport still feels like a World War II relic \u2014 but much of what is new or prosperous seems to be owned by someone from China.Many, if not most, of the shops along the main road have Chinese owners, who sit in corner booths towering over their China-made merchandise and local employees.In Honiara\u2019s Chinatown, a small strip of shops that has existed since the first wave of Chinese migrants arrived a century ago, signs of growth are visible: Scaffolding climbs above a new Chinese school that has received financial support from the Chinese government.Matthew Quan, 52, the president of the Solomon Islands\u2019 Chinese Association and a third-generation Solomon Islander who runs a large wholesale business across from the school, said Chinese expansion had been organic, driven by migration and economic factors rather than political or military direction from Beijing.Centrally planned or not, the influx has not always been welcome. Frustration with Chinese shop owners flared up in 2006, leading to riots, and in 2014 Chinatown was set ablaze during another spasm of violence.The main concern for many people on Guadalcanal involves not Chinese government interference, but rather cronyism and corruption fueled by Chinese wealth. No one knows the extent of Chinese property ownership in the Solomons; even the size of the Chinese population is a mystery, Mr. Quan said, since many migrants come in as tourists and bribe officials for visas that let them stay.\u201cI suppose you could say they\u2019re a lot more ruthless in how they do things,\u201d Mr. Quan said, referring to the recent migrants. \u201cAnd the government of the Solomon Islands is easily manipulated.\u201dMr. Molea called what\u2019s happening \u201ca different form of colonialism that\u2019s a consequence of democracy.\u201dHe has called on officials to halt all Chinese purchases and investment until there is a public accounting of who owns what.But such an audit is unlikely. For Guadalcanal and many other islands in the region, this is a moment to embrace competing offers from world powers, not spurn them.Not far away, by contrast, is an obvious example of Chinese productivity: a large gold mine that was closed by an Australian company in 2014, then sold last year to a Chinese developer who made a fortune in Australian real estate.The mine reopened in May, providing jobs \u2014 but in a riskier work environment.Local tribes have discovered that the new owners are less careful about worker safety than the Australians. According to a monitor they sent to investigate, employees don\u2019t wear goggles or safety boots as often as they should, and tasks that used to be closely monitored no longer are.The company that owns the mine, the AXF Group, did not respond to requests for comment.Asked whether the return of the mining jobs was worth the potential danger to workers, the tribes\u2019 investigator, Densley Kesi, said he couldn\u2019t be sure.\u201cThe Australians had a lot of regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t. It worries me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Battling Fake Accounts, Twitter to Slash Millions of Followers", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter will begin removing tens of millions of suspicious accounts from users\u2019 followers on Thursday, signaling a major new effort to restore trust on the popular but embattled platform.The reform takes aim at a pervasive form of social media fraud. Many users have inflated their followers on Twitter or other services with automated or fake accounts, buying the appearance of social influence to bolster their political activism, business endeavors or entertainment careers.Twitter\u2019s decision will have an immediate impact: Beginning on Thursday, many users, including those who have bought fake followers and any others who are followed by suspicious accounts, will see their follower numbers fall. While Twitter declined to provide an exact number of affected users, the company said it would strip tens of millions of questionable accounts from users\u2019 followers. The move would reduce the total combined follower count on Twitter by about 6 percent \u2014 a substantial drop.Officials at Twitter acknowledged that easy access to fake followers, and the company\u2019s slowness in responding to the problem, had devalued the influence accumulated by legitimate users, sowing suspicion around those who quickly attained a broad following.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to incentivize the purchase of followers and fake accounts to artificially inflate follower counts, because it\u2019s not an accurate measure of someone\u2019s influence on the platform or influence in the world,\u201d said Del Harvey, Twitter\u2019s vice president for trust and safety. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a really important and meaningful metric, and we want people to have confidence that these are engaged users that are following other accounts.\u201dThe market for fakes was also hurting Twitter with advertisers, which increasingly rely on social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 mini-celebrities who promote brands and products to their followers \u2014 to reach customers. In recent months, advertising and marketing firms have put pressure on Twitter, YouTube and other platforms to help ensure that influencers have the reach they claim. Last month, the consumer goods giant Unilever, which spends billions of dollars a year on advertising, announced that it would no longer pay influencers who purchased followers and would prioritize spending advertising dollars on platforms that took steps to stamp out fraud.In an interview on Tuesday, Unilever\u2019s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, praised Twitter for its decision. \u201cPeople will believe more and read more on Twitter if they know there is less bot activity and more human activity,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cI would encourage and ask others to follow.\u201dTwitter locks an account \u2014 blocking it from posting or interacting with other users \u2014 when the company suspects that it is automated spam, or that it has been compromised, usually by having its password hacked or leaked. Most spam accounts are quickly removed. But until now, even after Twitter privately identified an account as suspicious and locked it, that account would still be included among the legitimate followers of a user.Most of the time, according to Twitter, the locked accounts are not included in the monthly active user count it reports to investors each quarter, a critical Wall Street metric for social media companies. But the locked accounts were nevertheless allowed to inflate the follower counts of a large swath of users.That choice helped propel a large market in fake followers. Dozens of websites openly sell followers and engagement on Twitter, as well as on YouTube, Instagram and other platforms. The Times revealed that one company, Devumi, sold over 200 million Twitter followers, drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over.Tens of thousands of automated accounts were created by stealing profile information from real users, including minors. One such victim, a teenager named Jessica Rychly, had her account information \u2014 including her profile photo, biographical information and location \u2014 copied and pasted onto a fake account that retweeted cryptocurrency advertisements and graphic pornography.Twitter officials believe that the new policy will disrupt the marketplace for fake followers and curb abusive practices used to create fake accounts: Since suspicious accounts will now be stripped from users\u2019 followers, the company hopes there will be less incentive to purchase fakes in the first place.Twitter has also begun to permanently remove more suspicious accounts. After The Times\u2019s investigation was published in January, Twitter removed over a million accounts from the followers of Devumi customers \u2014 accounts that the company said violated its spam policies.Twitter estimates that as a result of Thursday\u2019s changes, the average user will see his or her follower number drop by four \u2014 but that number would be much higher for some accounts.\u201cAs part of our renewed focus on public healthy conversation, and certainly some of the information that The New York Times was able to provide in their story, we felt it was an important step to take,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Used Tinder to Hunt the Women He Raped and Killed, Police Say", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDating apps were created to help people meet each other and maybe fall in love. But law enforcement authorities say a Connecticut man used them to prey on women, including a nurse in Queens he met through Tinder who was strangled to death earlier this month.The police in New York have also linked the man, Danueal Drayton, to a rape in Brooklyn and they are investigating whether he might be responsible for other rapes and killings involving women he met through dating and ride-hailing apps. Mr. Drayton, of New Haven, has a history of arrests involving violence against women dating back to 2011, according to the authorities, and he has told investigators he is responsible for several other crimes.Mr. Drayton, 27, was arrested last week in Los Angeles by a regional fugitive task force after the police in New York tracked him to a hotel room there, law enforcement authorities said. When Mr. Drayton was found, officers discovered he had raped a woman and was holding her captive after sharing an Uber ride, the authorities said.He pleaded not guilty on Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court to charges of attempted first-degree murder, forcible rape, penetration with a foreign object, and false imprisonment by violence. During the hearing, he was restrained in a chair that could not be seen by people in the courtroom gallery, but he could be heard muttering incoherently. A judge ordered him held on $1.25 million bail.Investigators in New York have begun a deeper investigation into Mr. Drayton and are looking for other victims, Dermot F. Shea, the chief of detectives, said on Monday.\u201cIf you look at the body of work, what just took place, it\u2019s not much of a stretch unfortunately to think that there are going to be other victims,\u201d Chief Shea said. \u201cWe need those victims. We need them to come forward for a lot of different reasons.\u201dBut so far, no other victims have come forward, Chief Shea said.The police in New York were seeking Mr. Drayton in the killing of the nurse, Samantha Stewart, 29, who was found in her apartment in Queens on July 17. Her brother discovered her body wrapped in a blanket in the corner of her bedroom. The medical examiner determined she had been beaten and strangled.At the same time, the police said detectives in the special victims division were investigating a Brooklyn woman\u2019s report that Mr. Drayton had choked her until she passed out and then raped her on June 17 after they met through Tinder and went on a date.Tinder said on Monday it was cooperating with the investigation. \u201cThese heinous acts of violence are heartbreaking,\u201d the company said in the statement.Four days earlier, on June 13, Mr. Drayton was accused of choking an ex-girlfriend during an argument, according to a criminal complaint. The woman fled to her house, where Mr. Drayton forced his way in before her brother intervened, according to the complaint filed in Criminal Court in Nassau County.Mr. Drayton was not finished, the complaint said.

{"Headline": "American Ros\u00e9s Without Clich\u00e9s", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of the TimesCynical producers have flooded the market with bad ros\u00e9s to meet fad demand, but the wine panel found some excellent American bottles. In these mad times when ros\u00e9-mania reigns over summer, the sad fact of the matter is that most ros\u00e9s are not made for people who love wine. It\u2019s perhaps natural for the wine industry to want to whip up enthusiasm for its cash cow. Many producers try to slake that ros\u00e9 thirst with cynically made pink wines that have the life span of a tsetse fly before they fade away like the Cheshire Cat, leaving only the marketer's smile. It\u2019s thought to be snobbishly pedantic for one to think critically about these wines, as if preferring a good bottle robs everyone else of the lighthearted diversion that is ros\u00e9. I\u2019m not buying any of this. Ros\u00e9 is a wine like any other. Some are good, even excellent. Some are mediocre, and some are sweet pink confections like the white zinfandels of the 1970s and \u201980s. If you do care about the wine you drink, why settle for the bad stuff?Pink wine, and all that it connotes, may be satisfying enough to some, but good pink wine is worth seeking out.Ros\u00e9 wines are made all over the world, so why American ros\u00e9s? Many of them are superb. We have long ago discarded the stereotype that American wines are by nature thick, heavy, powerful and bordering on sweet. If anything, the best American ros\u00e9s today are exactly what one would want: brisk and refreshing, subtle and savory, never cloying or fatiguing. We were all pleased by the high level of quality. Most followed the prevailing Proven\u00e7al fashion: ros\u00e9s the color of pale onionskin. The best had depth, minerality and a lip-smacking vibrancy that made you want to keep drinking them. Almost all were dry, and displayed varying levels of citrus flavors and earthy fruitiness. We rejected a few, though, that seemed harshly acidic.Marika said she was happily surprised. \u201cThey were not at all what I was expecting,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re dry, savory, and some are hard-core, year-round ros\u00e9s.\u201dFlorence, too, was expecting more sweetness but found instead freshness and balance. \u201cThese are serious wines, not crowd-pleasing junk wines,\u201d she said. If anything, Victoria suggested, some of the wines had gone overboard in reaction to the once dominant style of powerful fruitiness. To her, those wines seemed to be a little underripe. But she was pleased over all. Our No. 1 bottle was an old friend, the Edmunds St. John Bone Jolly gamay noir ros\u00e9 from El Dorado County in California \u2014 savory, saline and simply delicious. Gamay noir is the grape of Beaujolais, hence the egregious Bone Jolly pun. Nonetheless, Steve Edmunds has pioneered modern gamay production in California, making both a red and this ros\u00e9, which has been superb year in and year out. Perhaps coincidentally, our No. 3 wine was also a gamay noir ros\u00e9, the Folk Machine from Arroyo Seco in the Central Coast. It was dry and succulent, but a very different style: more delicate and ephemeral than the Bone Jolly, which could easily age a couple of years. Sandwiched between the two gamay noirs was the North Valley pinot noir ros\u00e9 from Soter in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, lively and refreshing, with flavors of herbs, berries and the bloody tang of iron. Rounding out the top four was the high-toned, earthy Porter Creek, made from old vines of carignan from Mendocino, blended with a small percentage of zinfandel grown next door to the winery in the Russian River Valley. As you may have inferred, ros\u00e9 can be made of any red grape. Rather than allow the grape juice to macerate for long with the pigment-bearing skins, as they would a red wine, producers whisk away the skins after the juice has absorbed the preferred amount of color. Three more to keep in mind are the stony, citrusy Matthiasson, made from a combination of grenache, syrah, mourv\u00e8dre and counoise grown in three different sites in Northern California; the savory, floral Flower, Flora and Fauna from Idlewild in Mendocino, made from nebbiolo, barbera and dolcetto; and the subtle, soft, Gramercy Cellars, made of cinsault grown in the Olsen Vineyard in the Columbia Valley of Washington. These 10 wines represent a mere thimbleful of the ros\u00e9s produced in the United States each year. Obviously, American wine is not immune to the annual flood of bad ros\u00e9, but the good stuff is out there if you want it. A rule of thumb: If you like a particular producer\u2019s reds or whites, you are quite likely to enjoy the ros\u00e9s, too. Zesty and savory, with lingering citrus, apple and saline flavors.Vibrant and refreshing, with flavors of herbs, berries and iron. Bone-dry and succulent, with aromas and flavors of citrus, flowers and minerals.Savory and high-toned, with dry, earthy aromas and flavors of flowers and citrus. Balanced and floral, with lively citrus and herbal flavors. Tart, juicy and rich, with refreshing flavors of grapefruit and flowers. Juicy and fresh, with unusual aromas and flavors of watermelon and potpourri. Austere and reticent, with stony aromas and flavors of citrus and flowers. Pleasing texture, with savory, saline, floral flavors. Gentle and subtle, with soft flavors of dried fruits and citrus. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Target in the Politics of Fear: Citizenship ", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has embraced McCarthy-era scare tactics. We may need a constitutional amendment to guarantee that citizenship can\u2019t be revoked.Mr. Ganz is a writer in Brooklyn. Yes, you\u2019re reading that right: A high-ranking former member of the state security apparatus seriously believes that it is good policy to revoke citizenship by executive order. For Arendt, the prospect of mass statelessness was particularly alarming. Since states are the only institutions able to guarantee rights, she wrote, \u201cA stateless person is not just expelled from one country, native or adopted, but from all countries \u2014 none being obliged to receive and naturalize him \u2014 which means he is actually expelled from humanity. Deprivation of citizenship consequently could be counted among the crimes against humanity, and some of the worst recognized crimes in this category have in fact, and not incidentally, been preceded by mass expatriations.\u201d The number of potential denaturalization cases that are being considered is reportedly in the thousands, so the Trump administration can\u2019t hope to permanently alter the demographics of the country with this unwieldy device. Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s possible that the true intent \u2014 and the probable consequence \u2014 of the Trump policy is that naturalized citizens will not actively participate in political activity for fear that some old mistake on their forms could put their status in jeopardy. When Arendt warned that \u201ctotalitarian solutions may well survive the fall of totalitarian regimes\u201d and return disguised in otherwise free countries, things like this and Mr. Anton\u2019s perverse proposals may be the sort of things she had in mind. The way to forever neutralize this technique of fear is to make citizenship permanent and irrevocable. While a statute might suffice, a constitutional amendment as Arendt proposed would make it so citizenship could never again be a political target. Even the remotest possibility that one group of citizens who have gained power might have the ability to strip another group of citizens of their rights should make one shudder. the future of American democracy demands we guarantee now that citizenship cannot be stripped.

After three days of prayer and fasting, Mr. Hogg had an answer.\u201cGod said I needed to open a grocery store,\u201d he said.\u201cBy and large, supermarkets are kind of behind the eight ball\u201d in responding to changes in how people shop, said Diana Smith, the associate director of retail and apparel for the market research company Mintel.Customers, especially younger ones, want stores that offer what some industry analysts have come to call \u201cfood experiences,\u201d with craft beer on tap, meals to go and vegetable butchers. They tend to shop only when they cook, visiting more than one store to collect ingredients, rather than making a weekly trip to stock the pantry with toilet paper, chuck roast and gallons of milk.But some of the most radical reinvention is happening at the local level, in both cities and small towns, where a new breed of small community stores use the grocery aisles to fill cultural niches and address social needs.At Nada, everything, including toothpaste and chocolate, is sold package-free. Shoppers can buy scoops of frozen berries, a handful of crackers and just one egg, if that\u2019s all they need. There\u2019s no plastic wrap or paper at the deli counter. Customers bring their own containers, buy reusable ones at the store or take some from a stack that have been cleaned and sanitized, using a digital scale to weigh and tag them before they start shopping.The store won\u2019t be equipped to sell fresh meat, but will soon add cured meats and more frozen seafood (caught in a sustainable way, of course). Suppliers, too, have to be willing to reduce waste: A local coffee roaster, for example, delivers beans in refillable bulk containers.Ms. Miller, a marine-mammal biologist who has a big vegetable garden and likes to bake, opened Nada after she saw how much plastic waste was choking the oceans. \u201cIt was a leap of faith,\u201d she said.About 300 people showed up \u2014 more than she expected \u2014 to shop in the 2,332-square-foot store on its first day. Business continues to beat projections, and Ms. Miller has fielded more than 100 calls from people all over the world who want to know if she plans to franchise or who hope to open their own version.\u201cIt just shows how much people want to buy their food this way,\u201d she said.Two thousand miles away in New Prague, Minn., population around 7,600, Kendra and Paul Rasmusson have been inundated with inquiries from people equally enamored with their grocery concept: a store that is largely unstaffed.Then, inspired by a nearby 24-hour fitness center, they had an idea: Why not create a store that didn\u2019t need staff, for shoppers who wanted organic ketchup, gluten-free crackers and vegetables from local farmers?Members can use a space upstairs for community meetings, or hold classes on making kombucha or Spanish for children. And the store is not completely unmanned. It is open to the public nine hours a week, with an actual cashier.The Rasmussons don\u2019t worry too much about theft. They can monitor the store, which is only 650 square feet, with remote cameras. Inventory is tracked digitally, and they have a one-theft-and-you\u2019re-banned-forever policy.\u201cThese rural communities are losing grocery stores, and it isn\u2019t making sense to keep them open,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need new models.\u201dMore than 80 people from around the world who are interested in opening a version of her unstaffed store have contacted her since Farmhouse Market opened. \u201cI tell people we just pieced it together and dug in and figured it out,\u201d she said.Many eat at a nearby McDonald\u2019s or a KFC, or walk a quarter-mile to the Giant Food.

Budgets don\u2019t allow for big, weekly shopping trips to stock up, and many residents lack a car.The cheery store, whose name is an abbreviation of the organization\u2019s motto, Doing the Most Good, feels a little bit like what Amazon would ship if you typed \u201cgrocery store\u201d into the search bar. And in a way, that\u2019s what Mr. Hogg did.The grocery cost $2.2 million to set up, and his operating costs are low because the Salvation Army handles human resources and some other business operations. The power company takes a quarter off the energy bill. Donations and grants pay for education and training.

{"Headline": "The IDs Were Meant to Protect Immigrants. Are They a Liability?", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York City identification card program was supposed to offer protection to undocumented immigrants, allowing them to engage with city agencies and move freely through the five boroughs. But two recent episodes show that the cards can also be a liability, offering a false sense of security in interactions with federal officials that can leave cardholders in detention.Last week, Concepci\u00f3n Barrios, 49, and Margarito Silva, 59, were detained at Fort Drum in upstate New York while attempting to visit their son, an Army sergeant, on the Fourth of July. The couple, unauthorized immigrants who have been New York residents for more than 20 years, presented their city-issued ID cards at the base\u2019s entry gate. They were told they needed another form of ID. After showing their Mexican passports, security called Border Patrol agents, who ultimately arrested them.Immigrant rights groups and Mayor Bill de Blasio stand behind the cards\u2019 value but caution that they can\u2019t be used in all circumstances.\u201cThere is an artificial security that is created by it,\u201d said Betsy Plum, vice president of policy at the New York Immigration Coalition. \u201cThat\u2019s really dangerous if it\u2019s then being used outside of its intended purpose.\u201dShe added that the card \u201ccan absolutely be a valuable tool, but you have to be using it the right way.\u201dThe city ID cards, issued through a program called IDNYC, are only valid with city agencies like the Police Department, and they cannot be used, for example, to board a plane or to purchase alcohol. The cards are not valid identification at federal complexes like Fort Hamilton, even if they sit within city limits.Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights group that is working with the Silva family, is trying to help cardholders navigate those tricky distinctions.\u201cIDNYC was a major victory for ensuring that all New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status, have access to city services \u2014 and that continues to be the case,\u201d Javier H. Vald\u00e9s, co-executive director of the group, said in a statement. That said, when individuals ask, \u201cwe are now suggesting that undocumented members of our community steer clear of military or federal government facilities.\u201dIDNYC \u201chas been a positive for our communities, and certainly for law enforcement,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, adding that the program had cut down on arrests during police stops. He argued that the detention of the Brooklyn couple shouldn\u2019t be connected to the cards.\u201cIf anyone is on a military base, and any individual there chooses to act on the fact that they\u2019re undocumented, that has nothing to do with what kind of ID they\u2019re carrying,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to happen whether they\u2019re carrying a local ID, a state ID, whatever kind of ID.\u201dAsked whether federal immigration officials could see the ID cards as a red flag, signaling that their holders are undocumented, Ms. Plum of the New York Immigration Coalition said it was possible.\u201cWe need to all be using it,\u201d she said, \u201cso that there then isn\u2019t a presumption that anyone using it is an immigrant.\u201dNew York City ID cards aren\u2019t accepted at military bases, according to Julie Halpin, a spokeswoman at Fort Drum. When Mr. Silva and Ms. Barrios were asked for a second form of ID, she said, they presented Mexican passports that didn\u2019t include documentation that they were in the United States legally. The couple is now being held at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York, where they\u2019re awaiting an immigration hearing.But Perla Silva, the daughter of Mr. Silva and Ms. Barrios, wrote on Facebook that her family had visited military bases in Colorado, Hawaii and Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, and had never run into problems before.\u201cWhy on this Fourth of July were they singled out?\u201d she asked.Advertisement"}

They attended school, went sailing, traveled, celebrated Christmases.Mr. Dondyuk, who was born three years before the nuclear reactor exploded, found decaying pictures in the abandoned homes and buildings that encapsulated the previous era. He wants to ensure it isn\u2019t forgotten.\u201cIt\u2019s memory, it\u2019s really important history, part of my life,\u201d he said in a Skype interview. \u201cAnd now every year, with radiation, with dust, with rain, with something else, it\u2019s destruction, destruction.\u201dAround 1:30 a.m. on April 26, 1986, sixteen years after construction on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant began, alarms rang out at a local fire station. A test to determine how Reactor No. 4 would operate after losing power went awry, and a sudden increase in power levels triggered an explosion that spewed radiation into the air, and set the nuclear reactor ablaze. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens were eventually evacuated from their homes in what would become the exclusion zone, taking with them only identity documents, food and clothing. Within days, many cities and villages had become ghost towns.\u201cI want to learn as much as possible about what was in Chernobyl zone before the explosion,\u201d Mr. Dondyuk said in an email, \u201cand to save these visual, historical objects, if in my country nobody bothered to do it for more than 30 years.\u201dBy reading the letters and postcards decorated with roses and hammer-and-sickle iconography \u2014 conveying everything from generic well wishes for the new year, to solemn love letters like those between a woman and her army-enlisted partner \u2014 Mr. Dondyuk started following these narratives to try to piece together the former residents\u2019 lives. In the case of the army couple, the woman wrote about creating a future with her husband in Chernobyl.Although not every photograph has a clear story, some portraits conveyed the serene normalcy the region enjoyed before 1986. Once cleaned off, the artifacts revealed a land that once hosted wedding processions in fields, or provided family bonding time through sunbathing on picnic blankets and fishing expeditions.In a meadow, square-jawed young men wearing military fatigues share a light and enjoy a group smoke break. Out in the woods, a group of mop-topped musicians dressed in bell-bottoms and tweed have set up guitars and drums, possibly for an album photo shoot, much like bands today.

{"Headline": "A Week After Novichok Exposure, 2 Britons\u2019 Lives Hang in the Balance", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two British citizens remained in critical condition on Saturday, breathing with the assistance of ventilators and surrounded by the world\u2019s leading experts on Novichok poisoning, their odds of survival being closely tracked by Britain and Russia.The couple, Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, was exposed a week ago to traces of a Soviet-developed nerve agent. They likely came into contact with it by picking up a vial, syringe or ampul discarded by a would-be assassin who took to the city of Salisbury in southern England months ago to target a former Russian spy, police said.Their recoveries meant the attack fell off the front pages, allowing investigators to proceed with a slow, methodical search for evidence that might support their leading theory \u2014 that Russian agents were behind the attack. The emergence of additional victims \u201cwill give it a renewed sense of urgency,\u201d particularly if one of them succumbs, said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a research group in London.\u201cThe spines were weakening,\u201d Mr. Nixey said of the British authorities, \u201cand if there are new crimes or misdemeanors on the part of the Russian state, then it means that those spines can be restiffened.\u201d If either victim dies, he added, \u201cit becomes a murder investigation, and it\u2019s involving a British national rather than a Russian national.\u201dPolice said Friday that the couple remained in critical condition and that officials were \u201cworking to support their next of kin.\u201dA policeman, who was admitted to Salisbury District Hospital on Saturday over fears he had been exposed to Novichok, was found not to have been and was released several hours later.The recently poisoned couple were being treated at the same hospital that cared for the Skripals.The hospital, in Salisbury, \u201chas the most expertise in the world in dealing with people with this type of poisoning, but it very much depends on the state of the individual,\u201d said Alastair Hay, an emeritus professor of toxicology at the University of Leeds, England. \u201cThe fact that someone is frailer makes it more difficult, makes the outlook a little more bleak.\u201dHe said the couple\u2019s prospects for survival were \u201cmuch more problematic, I think, given their overall state.\u201dEach of the two recent victims had long histories of addiction.Ms. Sturgess referred to her troubles with drinking in wry Facebook posts, writing in 2016 that, after one spree, she was not sure how she had reached her room at John Baker House, a supported-living facility in Salisbury that houses people with drug and alcohol problems. She thanked her mother for feeding her when she was sick.\u201cLove her, she knows how to mend me when I\u2019m lost and low,\u201d Ms. Sturgess wrote.Her posts brightened in February 2017 when she began her relationship with Mr. Rowley, a recovering heroin addict who rented an apartment in Amesbury, eight miles away.\u201cFell in love \u2026 never bodes well for me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI trust Charlie with my life and he gets me the best gifts ever.\u201dPeter Cook, 58, who lived in the same shelter as Ms. Sturgess, spoke fondly of her, saying she propped her door open with a sock so that friends could visit at any time. He said she had a loving relationship with Mr. Rowley and there was talk they might move in together.\u201cHe had a nice flat; he was getting it together,\u201d he said.But Becca Stewart, 20, who lived next door to Mr. Rowley in Amesbury, said Ms. Sturgess had become painfully thin and that she sometimes saw her walking in the neighborhood \u201cstumbling all over the place.\u201dThe police on Friday released a detailed timeline of the couple\u2019s movements on June 30 and July 1, leading up to their hospitalization. They may have picked up the contaminated object in Queen Elizabeth Gardens, where they relaxed that afternoon before returning to Ms. Sturgess\u2019s room at the shelter and then to Mr. Rowley\u2019s apartment.Anna Schaverien contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The European case is strongest when it argues against Google\u2019s exclusionary requirements \u2014 that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google\u2019s and users can easily download software by other developers \u2014 something many people do. This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google\u2019s to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition. For his part, President Trump absurdly sought to turn the European Union\u2019s case into another example of how European officials are taking \u201cadvantage\u201d of the United States.Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Can\u2019t Quit Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBecause his other populist promises are broken, he has to keep this one.Opinion ColumnistWith the possible exception of his pas de deux with Vladimir Putin, nothing about the Trump presidency inspires so much public resistance from his fellow Republicans as the president\u2019s zest for tariffs and trade wars. That resistance only goes so far, taking the form of nonbinding resolutions and verbal scoldings and sighs of relief when, as he did this week with the European Union, Trump temporarily chooses jaw-jaw over war-war. But in a party so otherwise beholden to its leader, anything that gets conservative senators accusing their president of running \u201ca Soviet type of economy\u201d (as Ron Johnson of Wisconsin put it this week, attacking the president\u2019s jury-rigged bailout for farmers hurt by his tariffs) counts as a dramatic fissure in the facade of MAGA unity.The answer gets at the dilemma of the Republican establishment in the age of Trump. The party\u2019s senators generally have a better grasp of facts than the occupant of the White House, but the president often has a better grasp of politics. And the political truth is that Trump probably needs his tariffs, needs his trade war, to have any chance of re-election \u2014 precisely because it\u2019s the only remaining economic issue where he\u2019s stuck to his campaign promises and hasn\u2019t just deferred to traditional Republican priorities.Those campaign promises, as everyone is well aware, were generally more populist than the official G.O.P. agenda: Trump promised middle-class tax cuts and a generous Obamacare alternative, he stiff-armed the entitlement reformers and talked up infrastructure spending, and he railed against free trade deals with every other breath. And that populist branding was crucial to the electoral trade he made, which ceded a share of business-friendly suburbanites to the Democrats but reaped a crucial group of erstwhile Obama voters, mostly white and working class and concentrated in the Rust Belt and upper Midwest states, who ultimately handed Trump the presidency.So the fact that Trump\u2019s tariffs are generally unpopular, even in Midwestern states, doesn\u2019t matter politically nearly as much as their potential appeal to the narrow slice of blue-collar swing voters that he needs if he\u2019s going to be re-elected. And their potential cost, for now, can be swallowed up by general economic growth or dealt with via cynical payoffs; if the general economic growth itself goes away, well, then Trump isn\u2019t getting re-elected anyway.Free-trade Republicans have every right to reject the Trumpian alternative to that consensus. But their whingeing would be easier to take if they hadn\u2019t discouraged Trump from every other attempt to make good on his populist pledges. He knows better than they do how he got elected; if protectionism is the only promise he can keep, it's no surprise he's keeping it.

{"Headline": "When Reporting on Gay Rights in India Gets Personal", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 For over 150 years, a law called Section 377 has imposed up to a life sentence in prison on \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature.\u201d Section 377 is vaguely worded, an archaic law introduced by British colonizers with stiff, Victorian morals. Essentially, it criminalizes gay sex in India.One evening, as hearings wound down, a wave of emotion caught me off guard at home in Delhi. I realized I had become a part of the story.I am a gay man reporting on gay rights in India. But I am also invisible in many situations, asking the questions but never answering them. As a journalist, I struggled with my own place in the narrative.Three years ago, when I left New York City for South Asia to give journalism a try, I barely thought about the consequences of moving to a part of the world where sex between men is illegal. The longer I stayed, the more I felt unsettled.Forty five million people populate Delhi and its suburbs. Assuming five or 10 percent of the population is gay, the community should reach into the millions. But attend Delhi\u2019s annual pride parade or stop by one of just a few L.G.B.T. organizations in the city \u2014 you will realize how few people are out.In part, I volunteered to cover gay rights in India because I wanted to know: Where were all the gay men?Finding sources willing to speak with me was challenging. I contacted the groups working on L.G.B.T. issues in India and asked if they knew of anyone who had been targeted by Section 377. The answer was almost always the same: The people they knew would not speak on the record, or were caught in legal binds, or were simply afraid. The risks of family ostracism, extortion or police involvement weighed on many people\u2019s minds.Posting in closed Facebook groups for L.G.B.T. Indians sometimes worked. Several men privately messaged me, saying they were comfortable with part of their names being published. To my surprise, it was easier speaking to people in villages than in cities. One lower-income gay man, who lived alone in a shoebox room in India\u2019s interiors, defiantly told me he had nothing left to lose. In the last year, he had been raped several times, he said.Traveling around the country, I found that progressiveness on the issue did not necessarily predict progressive mores on others. In a rural patch of central India, a transgender woman told me she planned to break up with her boyfriend because \u201che should marry a woman of the same caste.\u201d Later, in a city a few hundred miles away, a gay man ran his fingers along my arm and remarked on the whiteness of my skin, saying he wished he were fairer; it was more attractive, he said.When my questions were perceived as too pointed, I was told to worry about my own country\u2019s problems. After I met a police superintendent leading sensitization training in a nearby district, I informed him that transgender locals often felt unsafe approaching law enforcement officials. Clearly irritated, he posed a question: \u201cAren\u2019t transgender people all in the mafia in the United States?\u201dAs I dug in, I weighed whether to reveal my sexuality in interviews, looking for ways to set people at ease, but also wondering whether the idea was connected to my own loneliness. Section 377 thwarts the formation of supportive communities \u2014 it is not uncommon for cops to demand bribes from party organizers at the few clubs in Delhi that hold events for the gay community.The loneliness was jarring. Many nights, I stared at the ceiling and cried. I wondered if other people here felt the same way. Through my reporting, I realized some of them did.Among the more affecting interviews was one with a young man who went by A., his first initial. In conversations that lasted for hours over text, Facebook and in person, A. recalled the night in 2014 when he was drugged and raped by two men at the bare-bones hostel of a medical college.A. decided not to report the crime, fearing that he, too, would be arrested.After we met in Delhi, A. asked that I keep his identity confidential. In a country of 1.3 billion people, he hesitated to let me use even his first initial, whispering stories of gruesome hate crimes and the fear that his own parents would \u201cliterally kill me\u201d if they found out he had been raped.Over several months, I fact-checked details of A.\u2019s story, and asked how he was doing. He never revealed much about himself, telling me he did not want to have extended contact with somebody who knew about the rape. But when I asked A. why he had decided to speak out, his answer was one that has lingered.\u201cPeople should know that bad things happen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drive Against Gerrymandering Finds New Life in Ballot Initiatives", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe movement to take politics out of setting legislative district boundaries seemed to suffer a grievous, and perhaps even mortal, blow this spring when the Supreme Court passed up three chances to declare partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional.But it turns out that reports of its death are exaggerated. As federal courts dither over how to resolve the issue, activists have begun tackling it state by state at the grass roots.It is remarkable that five states are holding ballot measures on the issue in a single year; only five had taken them up over the entire preceding decade.Mr. Silver compares the change in public opinion on gerrymandering \u2014 the practice of drawing maps to disproportionately favor one party \u2014 to the shifts on other issues like gay marriage, where voters\u2019 views were often shown to be changing far faster than national political dogma.In the past, only a handful of states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa and Arizona among them \u2014 embraced genuinely nonpartisan redistricting, while most states continued to treat mapmaking as the privilege of the party in power.From 2008 to 2018, only California voted to strip state legislators of the power to draw all political boundaries. (New York voters approved nonpartisan redistricting in 2014 and Ohio voters in 2015, but only for state legislative seats, not for Congress.) Anti-gerrymander initiatives in Ohio and South Dakota were defeated in 2012 and 2016.But advocates say that public disgust with the state of politics is increasingly overriding partisan sentiment on the issue.Mr. Silver of Represent.Us said he agreed. \u201cOne thing that both Trump supporters and Bernie\u2019s voters \u2014 and pretty much all voters \u2014 agree on is that the system is rigged,\u201d he said, referring to Bernie Sanders, the liberal senator from Vermont. \u201cIn a political environment that\u2019s confusing and frustrating to most Americans, this is an easy issue to understand.\u201dOnly 26 states allow citizen-driven ballot initiatives, so their reach is limited. But legal experts and advocates say the campaign to end gerrymandering has other options it can pursue besides ballot initiatives.And legislatures in some states, like Colorado, have begun to ponder whether the political and legal toll from partisan redistricting outweighs the advantages. Pennsylvania and Louisiana have seen the beginnings of bipartisan legislative efforts this year to hand over redistricting to apolitical commissions.The current political climate is so unsettled, Mr. Li said, that legislators in some states worry about whether their party can count on having a majority \u2014 and with it, authority over redistricting \u2014 after the 2018 and 2020 elections.\u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily know who\u2019s going to be in control in 2021 in many states,\u201d he said. \u201cThat uncertainty creates an incentive to be reasonable in ways you didn\u2019t have in the past.\u201dHe said that in 2016, there were hardly any competitive races for the Utah legislature: 70 percent of seats were won by margins of 30 points or more, including about one-fifth that were uncontested.\u201cSo if you ask who\u2019s getting the short end of the stick,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s the voters of Utah.\u201dThe group\u2019s proposed remedy is similar to what has been advanced in the other states: amending the state constitution to turn responsibility for drawing political boundaries over to a citizens\u2019 commission composed of Democrats, Republicans and independents or small-party supporters. The panel would be barred from giving any political party an advantage, and would judge its work using \u201caccepted measures of partisan fairness.\u201dThe state attorney general and the state chamber of commerce sued to block the proposal, saying that it is illegally broad. A lower court unanimously rejected that argument; the case is now before the state Supreme Court, which held a hearing about it last week.The chamber says it does not support gerrymandering, \u201cbut we don\u2019t see the current standard as favoring one party over another,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Richard K. Studley, said in an interview. \u201cThe current system isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s better than what they\u2019re proposing.\u201dMs. Fahey of Voters Not Politicians said she believes public support for the proposal is strong.\u201cThis is one of those building-block-of-democracy issues,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen support across the state, including from the reddest counties.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Note that the last three are already in power. All this must be gratifying to Trump\u2019s sense of his historical importance. For America, it\u2019s a historical disaster. The United States can only lead a world that\u2019s prepared to follow.But follow what? Not the rules of trade that America once set but now claims are rigged against it. Not the democratic ideals that America once embodied but now treats with disdain. Not the example of fighting bullies, after it has now become one. This will suit Americans for whom the idea of a free world always seemed like a distant abstraction. It will suit Europeans whose anti-Americanism predates Trump\u2019s arrival by decades. And it will especially suit Putin, who knows that an America that stands for its own interests first also stands, and falls, alone. Surely the dead at Colleville-sur-Mer fought for something greater than that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: In Picking L.A., Did LeBron Choose Comfort Over Legacy?", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.At first glance, the gravity of the Los Angeles Lakers appeared to have sucked in yet another all-time great. LeBron James, heading into the 16th season of his career, was asked to bring the luster back to one of the N.B.A.\u2019s two marquee franchises, and he readily accepted by agreeing to a four-year contract with the team on Sunday.It would be easy to make the case that this is a curious move for James in terms of his legacy. The Lakers are lacking in experience and play in the same conference as the mighty Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, which could end his incredible streak of making the N.B.A. finals at eight seasons. He will also have to contend with a fan base that will rank him far below homegrown talent like Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson almost no matter what he does.But after fulfilling his promise to end a pro sports championship drought in Cleveland that stretched back to 1952, James is comfortable with his legacy and reportedly made it clear to Johnson, who now serves as the Lakers\u2019 president, that he is fine with being patient and not blowing up the team to chase an immediate title. After 15 hard-fought seasons of fighting to prove himself as a worthy heir to Michael Jordan, James is ready to seek happiness for himself and his family. And he will do it in the sunshine of Southern California rather than spending another winter in his native Ohio. His legacy, both with the Lakers and among the all-time greats, can be something other people worry about.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)By now, we all know that L.A.\u2019s basketball aspirations are riding on LeBron James\u2019s very strong shoulders.Are the city\u2019s cycling hopes depending on his legs?It took mere hours for writers at Curbed L.A. and The Los Angeles Times to breathlessly point out that the world\u2019s best basketball player very much likes riding his bike.And that has bike enthusiasts across the city dreaming big.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "No Plane. No Remains. And Now, No Real Answers on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plane was heading north from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8, 2014, when it deviated from its scheduled path, turning west across the Malay Peninsula. It is believed to have turned south after radar contact was lost and crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean after running out of fuel.No significant pieces of the wreckage of the jetliner, a Boeing 777, have ever been found. Nor have any remains of the 239 people on board.The absence of definitive answers in the report, which was released at a news conference, devastated families of the victims, who have waited more than four years for the searches and investigations to be concluded.\u201cIt is so frustrating, as nobody during the briefing can answer our questions,\u201d Bernama, the Malaysian state news agency, quoted her as saying.The long-awaited report offered no conclusion on what caused the plane with 239 people aboard to veer off course, cease radio communications and vanish.The head of the safety investigation team, Kok Soo Chon, said the available evidence \u2014 including the plane\u2019s deviation from its flight course, which tests showed was done manually rather than by autopilot, and the switching off of a transponder \u2014 \u201cirresistibly point\u201d to \u201cunlawful interference,\u201d which could mean that the plane was hijacked.But he added that the panel found no indication of who might have interfered or why, and that any criminal inquiry would be the responsibility of law enforcement authorities, not safety investigators.While Mr. Kok did not directly address theories that the disappearance was the result of pilot suicide, he said investigators were \u201cnot of the opinion that it could have been an event committed by the pilot.\u201dBackground checks on the passengers by local law enforcement agencies also revealed \u201ca clean bill of health for everybody,\u201d he added.The disappearance of Flight 370 led to numerous conspiracy theories. And the report, by offering no final conclusion, will do little to settle the matter.The report detailed an extensive examination of the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and the first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, including their financial status, health, tone of voice on radio communications and even their gait as they walked to work on the day the plane disappeared. The investigators \u201ccould not detect any abnormality,\u201d Mr. Kok said.Investigators also considered data saved on a flight simulator at Mr. Zaharie\u2019s home, which showed seven coordinates that would create a flight path from Kuala Lumpur to the southern Indian Ocean. The manner in which those points were saved made it impossible to draw any conclusions, Mr. Kok said.A police investigation \u201cconcluded that there were no unusual activities other than game-related flight simulations,\u201d the report said.While Mr. Kok suggested the possibility of \u201cunlawful interference by a third party,\u201d investigators could not establish that anyone except the pilot had flown the plane.Mr. Kok said there had been no threats or credible claims of responsibility for the plane\u2019s disappearance, which might have been expected as part of a plan to take it down intentionally.Technology that would allow someone to pilot the aircraft remotely had not been installed on this plane, the report said. No mechanical issues that would affect the plane\u2019s airworthiness were identified either.\u201cThe aircraft was well-maintained,\u201d Mr. Kok said.Other possible factors \u2014 like lithium-ion batteries that could have caught fire and the presence of mangosteen fruit in the plane\u2019s cargo, which was considered unusual \u2014 were considered. But such materials had been carried dozens of times before on the same route without incident, the report said.The panel said it would disband, but declined to call the report final.\u201cIt is too presumptuous of us to say this is the final report,\u201d said Mr. Kok, a former director general of Malaysia\u2019s Civil Aviation Department. \u201cNo wreckage has been found. The victims have not been found. How could this be final?\u201dFamilies of the 239 people who disappeared with the plane had expected clearer answers in the report, and were left disappointed.Most of the passengers were from China, followed by Malaysian citizens.After the aircraft disappeared, an air search of nearly two months was carried out, followed by an underwater search, primarily by private contractors.The Malaysian safety investigators said on Monday that they had waited to release their report until after the search was concluded.The investigators said on Monday that they had found several shortcomings in procedure among various bodies responsible for the flight\u2019s safety.The handover of responsibility for the flight from air traffic control in Malaysia to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was premature by three minutes, and the Vietnamese authorities were late in recognizing that the plane had vanished, the report said.But Mr. Kok said none of these factors were responsible for the plane\u2019s disappearance.Advertisement"}

They now live in a high-security community hundreds of miles from where their 6-year-old is buried.\u201cI would love to go see my son\u2019s grave and I don\u2019t get to do that, but we made the right decision,\u201d Ms. De La Rosa said in a recent interview. Each time they have moved, online fabulists stalking the family have published their whereabouts.\u201cWith the speed of light,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have their own community, and they have the ear of some very powerful people.\u201dOn Wednesday in an Austin courtroom, the struggle of the Sandy Hook families to hold to account Alex Jones, a powerful leader of this online community, will reach a crossroads. Lawyers for Noah Pozner\u2019s parents will seek to convince a Texas judge that they \u2014 and by extension the families of eight other victims in the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults \u2014 have a valid defamation claim against Mr. Jones, whose Austin-based Infowars media operation spread false claims that the shooting was an elaborate hoax.Mr. Jones is trying to have the Pozner and Fontaine cases dismissed under the Texas Citizens Participation Act, which protects citizens\u2019 right to free speech against plaintiffs who aim to silence them through costly litigation. Mr. Jones is seeking more than $100,000 in court costs from the Pozner family. Efforts to reach Mr. Jones on his cellphone and through the Infowars email were unsuccessful. Mark Enoch, his lawyer in the case, did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment.Mr. Jones has emerged as an avatar for a \u201cpost truth\u201d ethos that flourished online during the last presidential campaign. He gained a national spotlight and millions of followers after Donald J. Trump appeared on his show during the campaign, praising his reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Since then, many of Mr. Jones\u2019s bogus theories have targeted President Trump\u2019s perceived adversaries and reflect opinions held by his political base.Recent \u201cmost popular\u201d stories on the Infowars website included \u201cMarine Veteran, Man Wearing Trump Shirt Violently Attacked Near Trump Star in L.A.,\u201d \u201cRevealed: U.N. Plan to Flood America With 600 Million Migrants,\u201d and \u201cLeft Protests \u2018Racist\u2019 Stand Your Ground Law After Black Man Shot in Self-Defense.\u201dThe videos removed included one called \u201cPrevent Liberalism,\u201d in which a man chokes a child and throws him to the ground. Another one was called \u201cShock Report: Learn How Islam Has Already Conquered Europe.\u201dMr. Jones and his lawyers say in court filings that the Pozner family\u2019s suit is an effort \u201cto silence those who openly oppose their very public \u2018herculean\u2019 efforts to ban the sale of certain weapons, ammunition and accessories, to pass new laws relating to gun registration and to limit free speech.\u201dThat stance echoes Mr. Jones\u2019s original false claims that Sandy Hook was staged by government-backed gun control activists. Mr. Jones\u2019s lawyer says in court filings that Mr. Jones\u2019s theories are opinion, which is more broadly protected by the First Amendment. He also maintains that Mr. Pozner and Ms. De La Rosa are public figures, because Mr. Pozner has created a nonprofit to combat the harm caused by online falsehoods and Ms. De La Rosa has advocated a ban on assault weapons, like the AR-15-style rifle used in the Sandy Hook shooting.If the parents are found to be public figures, they will have to prove actual malice, or that Mr. Jones knew the claims were false, but repeated them anyway.The Pozner family\u2019s story is recounted in the court filings: In 2015, after Mr. Pozner succeeded in having an Infowars video taken down from Mr. Jones\u2019s YouTube channel, \u201cMr. Jones went on an angry rant about me for nearly an hour,\u201d Mr. Pozner said in an affidavit. Mr. Jones \u201calso hosted a call with an obsessed fellow conspiracy theorist who issued a threat to me.\u201d\u201cMr. Jones then showed his audience my personal information and maps to addresses associated with my family,\u201d the affidavit says.Lucy Richards, an Infowars devotee, was arrested the next year for repeatedly threatening Mr. Pozner\u2019s life. She was sentenced to five months in prison last year. As a condition of parole, a judge ordered that she cease consuming Infowars programming, the court documents state.\u201cThis type of misinformation is a bit of a societal crisis,\u201d Ms. De La Rosa said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t someone on a soapbox in Times Square spewing nonsense. It\u2019s someone who every day generates income from his demonstrably false utterances.\u201dStarting days after the shooting, Mr. Jones helped spread false claims that the Sandy Hook parents were \u201ccrisis actors\u201d in a government conspiracy. A month after the shooting, he began broadcasting excerpts from Ms. De La Rosa\u2019s interview with the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, which was taped in front of the Edmond Town Hall in Newtown. Mr. Jones falsely claimed that the interview was taped in a studio before a \u201cgreen screen.\u201dIn an April 2017 Infowars broadcast titled \u201cSandy Hook Vampires Exposed,\u201d according to the court documents, Mr. Jones aired the clip of Ms. De La Rosa\u2019s interview, noting that when Mr. Cooper turns his head, \u201chis nose disappears repeatedly because the green screen isn\u2019t set right.\u201d The Pozner filings include an affidavit from Grant Fredericks, a forensic video analyst and expert witness, in which he attributes the anomaly in the videotape to \u201cpostproduction compression,\u201d common in video production, and said \u201cno credible video professional, editor or web-content specialist would conclude\u201d that the interview was taped in front of a screen.In court filings responding to the Pozner suit, Mr. Jones\u2019s lawyer says that \u201ccertain comments that he had previously made in connection with possible faking or staging events at the Sandy Hook shooting was not an accusation against the children or families, but against the media and government officials, whose actions led many to question the official version of the event.\u201d The parents, the filing says, \u201cisolate specific statements, take them out of context while ignoring other relevant portions, and misinterpret what was said.\u201dMs. De La Rosa and Mr. Pozner will not appear in court on Wednesday, in part because of safety concerns.Advertisement"}

By the time she was ready to move, Ms. Lindner had already made a number of lifestyle changes. She had stopped using plastic takeout containers (bringing reusable metal tins to restaurants instead), switched out her toothpaste for baking soda and started carrying around a metal water bottle and tote bag wherever she went. $1,600 | BROOKLYNFortunately, Ms. Lindner, who had never lived with fewer than three people before renting her own one-bedroom, had only had a small bedroom\u2019s worth of possessions to transport across the city.She borrowed a minivan from her parents on Long Island and packed her belongings into suitcases, padding breakable items with towels and blankets. In the end, she conceded to using a few pieces of packing tape, which she grudgingly put into her \u201ctrash bin,\u201d a quart-size Mason jar that still had space to spare four months into her zero-waste journey. Furnishing her new apartment, however, was a challenge.\u201cI have since become an expert thrifter,\u201d Ms. Lindner said. She has found furniture through Facebook marketplace, on Craigslist and at a sidewalk sale outside a storage unit. Perhaps her favorite find is a sofa that belonged to an uncle and reminds her of family gatherings.\u201cOne of the challenges is that you have to be open to things, you can\u2019t be too specific,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it has been a really cool experience, because you get to talk to all these different people and peek into their lives and homes. And you have a connection to the piece of furniture then: It has a story and it adds to the character of your home.\u201dThe most difficult thing, ultimately, was deciding whether or not to paint her apartment. When she moved in, the walls were a \u201cdim peach tan.\u201d She knew that the real zero-waste approach would be not to paint, but \u201cI really wanted it to be brighter, and I decided that it\u2019s not about perfection,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you try to do that you\u2019re going to get tripped up.\u201dShe selected a paint and primer combo in sea-glass green and hired a professional painter from TaskRabbit so she wouldn\u2019t have to buy equipment she would likely never use again. Afterward, she turned the paint can into her composting bucket, which she brings to the farmer\u2019s market in Prospect Park every Saturday.In many respects, living alone has made a zero-waste lifestyle easier to pursue, Ms. Lindner said. Although her roommates had been supportive \u2014 and she was always delighted when one of them would come home and tell her that she had refused a plastic straw, for example \u2014 the choice of which cleaning products and other shared goods to buy was not entirely up to her. And other things might be a hard sell: In her living room, she keeps a basket of clean hankies to use in lieu of tissues. \u201cIf I had a family, mobility issues or was working three part-time jobs, this would be difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to be able to do this, but because I have the ability to do it, I feel that I should.\u201dInitially, she was worried that her requests to fill reusable containers might annoy or burden others, but for the most part she has encountered only curiosity and encouragement. Still, her parents were disappointed not to be able to buy her things for her first apartment, she said. Her mother begged her to at least get new pots and pans.\u201cI think it was really hard for them at first,\u201d Ms. Lindner said. \u201cBut even my mom is going to thrift stores now instead of Macy\u2019s.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could You Make It Through Dinner Without Checking Your Phone?", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Marc and Kara Lyons take their family out for a nice dinner, they typically hand their two sons cellphones to play games and watch YouTube videos. Sometimes, the parents grab the devices back to check their own email and text messages.But on a recent night at Hearth, an Italian-inspired restaurant in the East Village, the boys, 5 and 7, colored on blank white paper with crayons. Their parents discussed the highlights of their trip to New York from their home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to celebrate Mr. Lyons\u2019s 40th birthday.The reason for the tech-free dinner? The cellphones were stashed in a small decorative box on their table, an initiative that Marco Canora, Hearth\u2019s chef and owner, began in November to help customers disconnect from their devices for a little bit.Hearth is taking a softer approach \u2014 there are no rules, just the containers on each table. A note on top says, \u201cOpen me!\u201d Inside is an invitation to stash your phone during the meal.Mr. Canora started thinking two years ago about how to try to curb his customers\u2019 increasingly distracted behavior. At first, he considered asking guests if they wanted to check their phones at the host stand, as they would a coat, but he worried this could create arguments between couples at the front of the restaurant. And he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for lost or forgotten phones.His other idea was asking customers for their phones once they were seated, but he didn\u2019t want to add another task for his servers.Mr. Canora finally decided on the vintage boxes, which the restaurant\u2019s general manager and wine director, Christine Wright, bought from Etsy. No two boxes look the same \u2014 some are vintage candy boxes, others old cigar cases. They complement the restaurant\u2019s whimsical d\u00e9cor, including the mismatched glassware.Servers ignore the boxes, leaving guests to discover the option themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anybody who is coming in and feeling like we are condescending to them,\u201d said Erik Gullberg, a bartender and server who has worked at Hearth for four years.Few guests make it through their meal without checking their phone, Mr. Canora said. If a diner\u2019s companion leaves to go to the restroom, the phone comes out immediately.\u201cIt has really reinforced our belief that it is a true addiction,\u201d Mr. Canora said. \u201cYou see people succumb to their addiction all night long.\u201dEven if customers don\u2019t follow through completely, he said, he figures it\u2019s better than nothing. People at least often have a conversation about technology\u2019s impact on their lives.Some customers say they don\u2019t need the box to avoid technology during their meal. Janie Quinn and Elissa Epstein, friends who live in Manhattan, noticed the box but didn\u2019t put their phones inside.\u201cMy purse is like that. I don\u2019t need a box,\u201d Ms. Quinn said.She worried that she might forget about her phone and leave without it.\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Mr. Canora said. \u201cThey\u2019re counting the seconds before they can grab it.\u201dJoy Habian, who lives in TriBeCa, said she wished she could forget her phone in the box, noting the oversize role of technology in her life. Although she tries not to check her phone while eating at restaurants, she said she was only successful about 75 percent of the time.\u201cIt\u2019s just an unconscious habit,\u201d Ms. Habian said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rational or meaningful.\u201dAt Hearth, she placed her phone in the decorative container and tried to focus more on enjoying her meal.One way diners frequently use their phones during meals is to post photos of their food on Facebook or Instagram, often tagging the restaurant and providing a source of free publicity. Hearth\u2019s boxes have led fewer people to do that.Some of Hearth\u2019s staff members had initially worried that this would hurt the business. Ultimately, Mr. Canora decided the loyal following that Hearth has built in its 14 years meant that it didn\u2019t need to depend on Instagram.That doesn\u2019t mean the social media platform is devoid of content about Hearth.\u201cWe do see people Instagramming about the boxes, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a win or a lose there, but I guess it\u2019s still good for us,\u201d Ms. Wright joked.Still, she said most customers hadn\u2019t heard about the boxes. The restaurant has yet to receive negative reactions from diners, with most offering enthusiastic feedback.Mr. Lyons was certainly a fan of Hearth\u2019s strategy, noting that he and his wife enjoyed their conversation more without the distraction. Their sons asked for the phones only once, and he quickly dismissed the request. Instead, the boys entertained themselves with tic-tac-toe, and Mr. Lyons taught them how to play hangman.He\u2019s even planning to copy Mr. Canora\u2019s idea.\u201cWe said we should get a box at home,\u201d Mr. Lyons said.Advertisement"}

It is his failure to defend.The intelligence community long ago concluded that Russia attacked our election in 2016 with the express intention of damaging Hillary Clinton and assisting Trump. \u201cIn 2016, cyber actors affiliated with the Russian Government conducted an unprecedented, coordinated cyber campaign against state election infrastructure.

This activity was part of a larger campaign to prepare to undermine confidence in the voting process.\u201dThe Robert Mueller investigation is looking into this, trying to figure out what exactly happened in 2016, who all was involved, which laws were broken and who will be charged and tried.\u201cSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 32 people and three companies \u2014 that we know of. That group is composed of four former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer. Five of these people (including three former Trump aides) have already pleaded guilty.\u201d\u201cFrom phishing attacks to gain access to Democratic operatives, to money laundering, to attempts to break into state elections boards, the indictment details a vigorous and complex effort by Russia\u2019s top military intelligence service to sabotage the campaign of Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\u201dWhether or not Trump himself or anyone in his orbit personally colluded or conspired with the Russians about their interference is something Mueller will no doubt disclose at some point, but there remains one incontrovertible truth: In 2016, Russia, a hostile foreign adversary, attacked the United States of America.We know that they did it. We have proof. The F.B.I. is trying to hold people accountable for it.And yet Trump, the president whom the Constitution establishes as the commander in chief, has repeatedly waffled on whether Russia conducted the attack and has refused to forcefully rebuke them for it, let alone punish them for it. \u201cTrump signed the bill reluctantly in August, claiming it impinged upon his executive powers and could dampen his attempts to improve ties with Moscow.\u201dInstead, Trump has repeatedly attacked the investigation as a witch hunt.\u201cI think I would have a very good relationship with Putin if we spend time together. After watching the rigged witch-hunt yesterday, I think it really hurts our country and our relationship with Russia. I hope we can have a good relationship with Russia.\u201d\u201cWill he be prepared? Will he be prepared? And I might even end up having a good relationship, but they\u2019re going, \u2018Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is K.G.B. and this and that.\u2019 You know what? Putin\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all fine. We\u2019re people.\u201dAmerica\u2019s commander wants to be chummy with the enemy who committed the crime. Trump is more concerned with protecting his presidency and validating his election than he is in protecting this country.Simply put, Trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have the Tech Giants Grown Too Powerful? That\u2019s an Easy One", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe easy question is a common start-up origin story: One day, the founder asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d before going on to figure out, though hard work, that he or she actually can. According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results? Facebook: Why aren\u2019t social networks connecting people with real names? Uber: Why can\u2019t I use an app to summon a taxi? Twitter: Why isn\u2019t there a dead-simple way to just publish whatever you want for a gathered audience? In real life, each of these companies had more sinuous origins, with dead ends and discarded ideas. But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.In 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways. Most recently, however, the case for \u201cjust asking questions\u201d \u2014 for finding a problem intolerable and believing there must be some way to fix it \u2014 has proved remarkably well suited for a fresh purpose: challenging the tech companies themselves.There are companies that are mostly immune to the easy-question-hard-answer dynamic. Easy questions about Netflix, for one, tend to have easy answers: You pay; they stream. Most obvious questions about Apple can be answered by pointing out that it would like to sell you expensive items on a fairly regular basis. What these more straightforward companies have in common is that their founding questions doubled as consumer rallying cries \u2014 they asked, and continued to ask, about things that their customers need, or at least want, and tend to understand.But for the rest of the tech giants, the easy questions have much harder answers. As these companies grew, they did more than just vanquish their competition. Their growth and free-service benevolence succeeded at making the very idea of competitors\u2019 challenging their efforts \u2014 the industry\u2019s traditional way to solve the problems they\u2019ve created \u2014 seem unnecessary or even counterproductive. They\u2019ve ducked the easy questions for so long that it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that they doubt we will like the answers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambodia Re-Elects Its Leader, a Result Predetermined by One", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRAPAING CHOUR, Cambodia \u2014 Prime Minister Hun Sen, the only leader that two-thirds of Cambodians have ever known, is not prone to leaving things to chance.Over the past year, scrappy independent news media outlets that once reported on government corruption and crony impunity have been silenced. Websites that carried negative portrayals of Mr. Hun Sen and his Cambodian People\u2019s Party were blocked on the eve of Sunday\u2019s vote.Western nongovernmental organizations, which had pumped money into Cambodia as it was emerging from decades of conflict and genocide, have been kicked out. Mr. Hun Sen, 65, says they, too, were trying to topple his administration, which critics have called increasingly authoritarian.With all of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s machinations to control the vote, the question that faced Cambodians on Election Day was not who would win; there is, after all, only one answer, and it is the man whose name graces thousands of schools across the country.Instead, the real mystery was whether Cambodians were so deeply disenchanted with a rigged election that they would stay away from the polls or cast spoiled ballots.On Sunday evening, Cambodia\u2019s National Election Committee said that turnout had reached 82.17 percent, a figure that in the capital, Phnom Penh, at least, did not correspond with the sight of empty polling stations and residents walking around with fingers untouched by the ink used to denote those who had voted.In commune elections last year, in which the opposition gained seats from the governing party, roughly 90 percent of voters cast ballots, a record turnout.\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to vote,\u201d Bun Chea, a 26-year-old technician, said on Sunday as he passed by his polling station in Phnom Penh. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference to our lives.\u201dIn a speech on Friday, Mr. Hun Sen warned against a boycott of Sunday\u2019s balloting. \u201cThose who do not go to vote, and who are incited by the national traitors, are the ones who destroy democracy,\u201d he said.But that did not stop the governing party from claiming in a statement on Sunday evening that its victory \u201cclearly illustrated the enthusiasm and political rights of the Cambodian people in strengthening a multiparty democracy.\u201dSok Eysan, the party\u2019s spokesman, projected that it had won at least 100 seats out of 125 in Parliament, a significant increase over the last polls.\u201cA victory without a contest is a hollow one,\u201d Sam Rainsy, the exiled co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party \u2014 the now-dissolved main opposition party \u2014 said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis senseless victory does nothing to resolve the political crisis that Cambodia faces as a result of the regime\u2019s totalitarian drift over the last 12 months.\u201dOn Saturday, El Sitha, a former district councilor from the Cambodia National Rescue Party, got a taste of what even humorous opposition to Mr. Hun Sen can catalyze. After posting a group picture on Facebook of fingers devoid of the ink that shows who has voted, Mr. El Sitha was summoned to his local police station.\u201cThey dissolved my party, so what can I do?\u201d Mr. El Sitha asked, adding, \u201cThe way to win is to sleep at home.\u201dFlush with foreign aid money, Cambodia was supposed to prove that democracy could be fostered by a concerned global community. After the fall in 1979 of the Khmer Rouge, the communist radicals who oversaw the deaths of at least one-fifth of the population, Cambodia was administered first by the Vietnamese and then by the United Nations.While Western aid workers lectured on the superiority of a multiparty democracy, Mr. Hun Sen, who entered the leadership ranks during the Vietnamese regime, subverted that plan. Even as he has maintained the illusion of electoral politics, he outfoxed one co-prime minister and purged those who challenged his power.And as American influence in the region wanes, Mr. Hun Sen has the backing of the Chinese, whose financial assistance is unburdened by admonitions that Cambodia improve its record on human rights.During campaigning, Chinese diplomats appeared at events supporting Mr. Hun Sen. The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia spoke disparagingly of the European Union\u2019s mulling of further sanctions on the country.Mr. Hun Sen has returned the love, calling China a steadfast friend and accusing the West of trying to foment a color revolution in Cambodia.Sok Eysan, the spokesman for the governing party, dismissed some of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s most incendiary talk.\u201cThat\u2019s just politics,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Cambodian foreign policy is to be friends with everyone who respects us.\u201dBut Mr. Sok Eysan quickly shifted gears. \u201cWe don\u2019t like any country that interferes in our country or tries to control us,\u201d he said. \u201cU.S. assistance to Cambodia has strings attached, but China doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dOn Wednesday in Washington, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would pave the way for sanctions against Cambodians who have undermined the country\u2019s democracy. If it is approved by the Senate, offenders\u2019 assets in the United States could be blocked, and they could be barred from entering the country.On Sunday evening, the White House press office released a statement criticizing the voting. \u201cThe United States regrets that Cambodia\u2019s July 29 parliamentary elections were neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people. The flawed elections, which excluded the country\u2019s principal opposition party, represent the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia\u2019s Constitution.\u201dGiven the widely held sense that Sunday\u2019s vote was a sham, American, European and Japanese election monitors refused to observe the process. Instead, one of the largest groups charged with inspecting the polls was overseen by one of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s sons. The Chinese and Russians also sent delegations of observers.Unlike in 2013, when a surge of youth voters almost propelled the opposition to victory, this election season was devoid of the energy that galvanized the last one.At a sleepy polling station in Ariksat commune, outside Phnom Penh, a villager who gave only his first name, Heng, said he had deliberately spoiled his ballot.\u201cI didn\u2019t write or tick anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not satisfied with this election because of the opposition\u2019s absence.\u201dOthers, though, said they admired Mr. Hun Sen for delivering more than 30 years of peace and stability, allowing for the development of Cambodia\u2019s export-led economy. The nation\u2019s city skylines are being transformed with high-rise projects that are often funded by foreign investment.\u201cHun Sen grew up poor in the provinces, so he understands what our problems are,\u201d said Sok Dorn, a noodle seller. \u201cI hope his sons take over from him one day.\u201dThe prime minister\u2019s children are scattered in top military, government and business posts. At least two have been considered for a possible future American sanctions list.Amid the rice paddies and lowland farms two hours outside Phnom Penh, a group of villagers from Trapaing Chour commune said their years of protest had brought no relief. They said their land had been seized by two companies, which have been linked by international rights campaigners to either governing party lawmakers or to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s sister.Land grabs by well-connected politicians and businessmen are the biggest problem afflicting this predominantly rural nation.Peung Thy served the nation as part of an elite bodyguard unit formed to protect Mr. Hun Sen. He fought during a brief border conflict with Thailand. But when his 10 hectares of land were taken from him to make way for a sugar plantation owned by Ly Yong Phat, a Cambodian tycoon, Mr. Peung Thy began to lose his sense of patriotism.\u201cI thought I was serving my country, but I was only serving the rich and powerful people who stole my land,\u201d he said.Back in Phnom Penh, Perk Chrep, a 30-year-old worker in Cambodia\u2019s important garment industry, fretted that she had little choice in the electoral exercise. The line manager at her Chinese-owned factory, she said, had warned the seamstresses several times that if they did not come back to work with ink on their fingers, they need not return at all.Ever since garment workers flocked to the opposition in the 2013 elections, Mr. Hun Sen has courted this demographic, regularly holding rallies where he handed out envelopes of cash.But Ms. Perk Chrep, who makes $300 a month with overtime pay, said she did not want to sell her vote. She mourned the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, which she said had worked to guarantee basic rights for garment workers.Sitting in a single room devoid of furniture, Ms. Perk Chrep said that all she wanted to do was send a message to Mr. Hun Sen.\u201cI want him to reflect on what he has promised the people in Cambodia,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes he really think he has achieved that much except for adding more years to his rule?\u201dSun Narin and Len Leng contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Julia Wallace from Siem Pang, Cambodia.Advertisement"}

My parents\u2019 oath was administered in a drab conference room under fluorescent lighting with brutal efficiency. None of us thought to take a photo.I didn\u2019t feel moved until later that afternoon, when my (white) sixth-grade classmate showed up on our doorstep with her grandmother, bearing a bouquet of red, white and blue lollipops. My mom held onto the glass vase for years, a memento of that time and how kind our fellow citizens could be.My family immigrated to the United States in 1993 from Bangladesh when I was 5, after waiting a decade for a visa. A few years later, we moved to Plano, Tex., a sprawling Dallas suburb. My parents, like most of our neighbors, came for the reasonable property values and high-performing public schools. I thought Plano was unbearably dull, but I was happy there. You could forgive me for being lulled into the false sense that we \u2014 my new countrymen and I \u2014 had collectively decided that immigrants were good, and even brown ones were O.K.Sure, there was an occasional spasm of racism, like the kid at my school who asked me, a few weeks after 9/11, if my father was planning on bombing any buildings. But mostly we felt comfortable enough to be ourselves.We lived in a beige brick house that my parents scraped to afford with their retail jobs, and on Eid al-Fitr and the Fourth of July, we threw raucous parties. Cars lined up bumper-to-bumper in our driveway and for long stretches down the street. Guests tumbled out in kaleidoscopic panjabis and saris and were led to our doorstep by the smell of biryani.I went to summer camp at a Baptist church, the one where Jessica Simpson\u2019s father was once a minister, because it was cheaper than the secular ones in the area, and there was only the lightest bit of proselytizing in between trips to the swimming pool and the bowling alley. When it was my turn to bring in snacks for the classroom, I brought trays of homemade kalo jam \u2014 fat, round, syrupy Bangladeshi sweets \u2014 and was only mildly embarrassed.People contain multitudes \u2014 especially Texans. Given this country\u2019s painful history, in which even incremental racial progress is always met with ferocious backlash, I should have known better. I should have known that the polite acceptance our neighbors showed us, their tolerance for the drippings of our culture, didn\u2019t necessarily signal a deeper acknowledgment of our humanity. I wanted to believe in all those rah-rah myths about our glorious melting pot, but the truth is, we, like everyone else, will have to fight for our place here.A majority in Collin County \u2014 the place where I was a parking lot attendant at the annual hot air balloon festival, the place where I dropped out of mosque school because it was so boring \u2014 voted for Donald Trump, a man who has aligned himself with white supremacists.After I graduated from college, my parents moved to North Carolina from North Texas. They wanted to live closer to family, they had gotten sick of the blistering heat and they wanted to spend their free time doing something other than tending their yard.Since they left, the ugliness that\u2019s been bubbling up all over the country has come to Plano, too. In early 2015 \u2014 before Mr. Trump had even announced his candidacy \u2014 spectators at a high school basketball game were photographed holding signs spelling out \u201cwhite power.\u201dIn the days after the election, someone wrote \u201cBuild that wall\u201d on a walkway at my former high school. Early this year, a Plano City Council member shared a Facebook post calling for the president to \u201cban Islam in American schools.\u201d He now faces a recall election.A few old friends have reached out in the last two years with Facebook messages of love and solidarity, expressing their horror at what\u2019s been unfolding. I hope that there are more like them, and that they are raising their voices loudly and persistently.It\u2019s been more than 18 years since I got that lollipop bouquet, but it feels like so much longer.

{"Headline": "Poland Purges Supreme Court, and Protesters Take to Streets", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours before the purge took effect at midnight, Poles again took to the streets in more than 60 cities and towns around the country. As the sun set in Warsaw, crowds gathered in front of a memorial dedicated to those who died in the city\u2019s 1944 uprising against Nazi Germany, chanting an old but familiar refrain: \u201cSolidarnosc.\u201dBut now, calls for solidarity were not directed at an occupying force \u2014 or at Communist rule, which the labor-backed Solidarity movement brought down in 1989 \u2014 but at a democratically elected government, albeit one the demonstrators fear is undermining the system they fought so hard to build.\u201cWe are here because of the destruction of the judiciary in Poland,\u201d said Kamila Wrzesinska, who stood amid a sea of Polish and European Union flags. Organizers passed out placards with one word: \u201cConstitution.\u201dIn an interview just days ago, the leader of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, expressed deep concern about her country\u2019s direction.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I am terrified,\u201d she said, \u201cbut without a doubt this is not a direction I would like to go in, nor support, as I think it destroys what has been built over the last 25 years.\u201dThe new law passed by Parliament requires that judges retire when they turn 65 unless they appeal to the country\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, who has sole discretion over whether they can remain.Justice Gersdorf, who is 65, and more than a dozen others have refused to make such appeals, saying that the law itself was unconstitutional. Their supporters say the law was aimed at certain judges and had little to do with age, an argument that was bolstered when the government named Justice Gersdorf\u2019s replacement: the 66-year-old judge Jozef Iwulski.If Poland is not made to pay a high price for its actions, critics and outside legal experts worry, currents unraveling democracy in member states will be further strengthened.For now, many of the country\u2019s 10,000 judges remain united in their opposition to the government\u2019s measures. And counter-pressures are building in Poland\u2019s vibrant civil society.Lech Walesa, who led the Solidarity movement that ended Communist rule in Poland and then served as president from 1990 to 1995, vowed on Sunday to lead a campaign of civil disobedience if Justice Gersdorf and other judges were removed.\u201cI am saying a definite \u2018enough\u2019 to this,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cIf they raise their paws against the Supreme Court, then I am going to Warsaw.\u201dJudges who have spoken out publicly against the purge have reported being threatened, harassed and intimidated.Waldemar Zurek, a former spokesman for the National Council of the Judiciary and a district court judge in the city of Krakow, has been openly critical of the changes. In response, he says, both he and his family have been subject to intense pressure and abuse, including death threats.Judge Zurek said he was dismissed as a spokesman for the courts, threatened with disciplinary sanctions over fabricated allegations, and harassed by government agents, including at his home. His financial records were improperly disclosed, he has faced what he calls a trumped-up investigations about a long-ago real-estate transaction, and he has gotten scores of threatening emails and letters.\u201cAll those who stand in the way of the minister become public enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are spat on.\u201dJustice Gersdorf, whose title is first president of the Supreme Court, said she thought that the mandatory retirement age was set with her in mind. Backed by 63 other judges on the court, who voted last week that she should stay in office, Justice Gersdorf said that she would continue to show up for work.\u201cI have no intention of resigning, since my term of office is six years,\u201d she said.Such defiance is the latest and most high-profile development in a confrontation that has been building for months.In December, the Venice Commission, which is responsible for monitoring rule of law for the European Union, expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that the judicial overhaul put \u201cat serious risk the independence of all parts of the Polish judiciary.\u201dPoland was given until the end of June to make changes that would satisfy those concerns. But no agreement was reached in meetings last week in Luxembourg, and Polish leaders vowed to press ahead.Mr. Kaczynski, the governing party\u2019s leader, has not hidden his intentions.\u201cIn a democracy, the sovereign is the people, their representative in Parliament and, in the Polish case, the elected president,\u201d he said in a 2016 speech. \u201cIf we are to have a democratic state of law, no state authority, including the Constitutional Tribunal, can disregard legislation.\u201dLacking the two-thirds majority needed in Parliament to change the Constitution, the party instead took control of the tribunal. After that, the tribunal approved laws, like those restructuring the courts, that critics have called unconstitutional.The party then gave the Minister of Justice the role of prosecutor general, which had previously been independent, and it took over the National Council of the Judiciary, which is responsible for appointing judges.Parliament also created a new disciplinary chamber that the opposition says would be used to attack judges who displeased the party.\u201cJudges in this disciplinary chamber will be earning 40 percent more than the justices on the Supreme Court,\u201d Justice Gersdorf said. \u201cIt has to be emphasized that this is political bribery.\u201dOne of Poland\u2019s great accomplishments after 1989 was restoring public faith in the courts, she said, but it \u201cwill require years of rebuilding\u201d to undo the damage being done to that achievement.She shrugged off concerns that she might have to pay a high price for her defiance.\u201cThey are not putting people in jail yet,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

So far, the hit is largely coming from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have pushed up the prices many firms pay for the metals.The current spending bill that Mr. Trump signed earlier this year expires at the end of September, the end of the current fiscal year. Congress is unlikely to pass another comprehensive spending bill before then.

They chatted, and a spark between them ignited.\u201cShe\u2019s really beautiful, that caught me at first glance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd beyond the initial physical attraction, she\u2019s really an incredible person \u2014 really strong \u2014 and has made me more mellow, which is really good for me, and she\u2019s a really good support system, pushing me to pursue my dreams.\u201dShe, also, soon saw much she admired in Mr. Israel.Read more.Caroline Ann Anderson and John Thomas Foley were married June 30 in the Merrick Rose Garden in Evanston, Ill.

{"Headline": "Does Vladimir Putin Speak for the Russian People?", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.McFaul answers his own question in these pages. For while this is the only personal confrontation between the two men that he recounts, the wider battle between their opposing visions of international affairs dominates the book. This memoir tells a political story that is also personal: the story of a man who watches as his own lifelong efforts to promote cooperation and integration between America and Russia are undone by Putin himself.McFaul cut his political teeth as a pro-democracy activist in Moscow during the final years of Soviet power before becoming a scholar of contemporary Russia at Stanford University. In 2008, he joined Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign and was later appointed senior director for Russian affairs at the National Security Council before serving as ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014. McFaul combines both analytical and personal perspectives to offer a fascinating and timely account of the current crisis in the relationship between Russia and the United States.The dramatic pivot in McFaul\u2019s story comes in late 2011, when relations between Russia and the United States quickly soured. The primary cause was, McFaul maintains, Russian domestic politics. Putin\u2019s earlier terms as president had been underpinned by a social compact in which the Kremlin offered rising living standards in exchange for political support or at least acquiescence. By 2011 under Medvedev, as the fallout from the financial crisis hit Russia hard, that deal was beginning to unravel.In September, many educated Russians became indignant at the news of a \u201ccastling move,\u201d in which Medvedev and Putin announced they would swap positions of president and prime minister. Mass demonstrations against voter fraud in the December parliamentary elections thronged Russian cities and spooked the Kremlin. With the presidential vote looming in March 2012, Putin cast around for enemies at home and abroad to revalidate himself as defender of the Russian people.The Kremlin subjected McFaul and his embassy staff to harassment and vitriol that tore up the conventions of international diplomacy. Government mouthpieces in the press and on television assailed McFaul as \u201cthe color revolutions specialist sent by Obama to orchestrate regime change.\u201d A fake Twitter account purporting to belong to the ambassador tweeted out criticisms of the Russian elections; videos circulated on YouTube suggesting he was a pedophile; agents of the pro-Kremlin youth organization Nashi repeatedly ambushed McFaul in the street with accusations and innuendo; even his children were obtrusively tailed by the Russian security services.McFaul did his best to swim against this tide of official hostility. He took to Twitter and Facebook in an attempt to communicate directly with the Russian people, an unorthodox approach that enjoyed, he claims, some success, but ruffled feathers in Moscow. He hosted receptions, concerts and lectures designed to champion not just American culture but also wider respect for democratic values. Against the unfolding crackdown on the protest movement, many opposition leaders declined even to meet McFaul for fear of being demonized as puppets of the United States State Department. \u201cOur tweets and jazz concerts were no match,\u201d McFaul acknowledges, for Putin\u2019s \u201cmedia empire.\u201dAnd what of wider public opinion? McFaul concedes that Putin\u2019s popularity \u201csuggests a deep societal demand for this kind of autocratic leader, and this kind of antagonistic relationship with the United States and the West.\u201d But instead of developing this insight, McFaul leaves it hanging.Placing responsibility for the rapid deterioration in United States-Russian relations squarely on the shoulders of the Russian president has its appeal. It holds out the promise that Kremlin policy toward the West might pivot once again when Putin finally retires or is pushed out. Maybe so, but the more pessimistic view is that Putin represents a now-entrenched revanchist nationalism that sees the liberal international order as a mere smokescreen for the advancement of Western political agendas. Deep-rooted antagonism toward the United States might well endure long after Putin has gone. As McFaul himself laments, \u201cthe hot peace, tragically but perhaps necessarily, seems here to stay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Right Way to Lose the Kavanaugh Fight", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Democrats go down swinging, they\u2019ll have a potent message for the midterms.Mr. Tomasky is a columnist for The Daily Beast and a contributing opinion writer.The press never tires of the \u201cDemocrats in disarray\u201d story line, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always wrong. Its latest manifestation concerns the pickle Senate Democrats are in with respect to the coming hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court.They face, it is said, a terrible choice: On the one hand, they can put up token opposition knowing that Judge Kavanaugh is almost certain to be confirmed anyway, get the vote out of the way before the midterms and perhaps use the new associate justice as a whipping boy in campaign ads.On the other hand, some ask, should they pull out all the stops to delay a vote, gambling that such a move would end up being a wash with voters, and hoping that if they get lucky and take back the Senate, they can block Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s ascension, as the Republicans did with Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland?Both choices carry risks. If the Democrats pursue the former route and their base sees them as having capitulated, that might depress turnout in November. If they succeed at the latter, that might energize the Republican base. And if they fail to take back the Senate, Judge Kavanaugh will sail through after all, and the Democrats will look weaker still for having attempted a tactic that backfired.But maybe the problem isn\u2019t which choice to make. It\u2019s that the very framing of the Democrats\u2019 choices in this way is bound to result in defeat and rancor. Democrats can transcend this Hobson\u2019s choice, even in defeat, if they just fight the nomination the right way: making the nomination fight a referendum on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s past actions and on President Trump\u2019s character.Polls usually show that on most issues, in the abstract, majorities support the Democratic position, from preserving Social Security to comprehensive immigration reform. That seems great for Democrats, but in fact it often lulls them into an uncreative passivity: They\u2019re with us on the issues, Democrats think, so all we have to do is discuss the issues and we\u2019re home free.Republicans look at those same polls and think: Hmm, the voters aren\u2019t with us, so we must discredit these popular Democratic positions. They do this in two ways. First, by reminding voters that these ideas cost money. Second, and more cunningly, they attempt to turn the conversation away from issues and toward character. This is one of the fundamental differences between the two parties. For Democrats, politics is a battle of ideas, punctuated by occasional detours down the character road. For Republicans, though, politics is an unending morality play, in which the probity of the dramatis personae is all-defining, punctuated by occasional battles of ideas. And while you may be thinking that Donald Trump upends this theory, in fact, our arbiters of right-wing morality (such as it is) are constantly excusing his louche behavior and trying to make him into a figure of rectitude.Democrats should talk about those very important things. But they can\u2019t leave it at that. They absolutely must discuss character \u2014 both the president\u2019s and Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s. The nominee worked for Ken Starr in 1998 as Mr. Starr pursued President Bill Clinton. What exactly did he do for Mr. Starr? That office was notorious for leaks. Did he leak secret grand jury proceedings, violating Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure?He helped write the Starr report, which recommended impeachment of President Clinton for (among other things) lying to the public. Is that grounds for impeachment today? There will be many statements Mr. Kavanaugh made in the late 1990s that he will want to walk back, and the Democrats should make him walk every one of them back \u2014 over hot coals.Then there is the matter of Mr. Trump\u2019s possibly naming one of his own future jurors. This is a grave constitutional issue. The Democrats\u2019 job here is to get Judge Kavanaugh on the record such that if he does someday rule that Mr. Trump cannot be prosecuted, the public will be outraged.The Democrats will probably lose the Kavanaugh battle. But there are two ways to do it. They can lose by appearing to be timid, calculating, fretting too much about the consequences of being aggressive.Or they can lose by showing they understand that millions of Americans are counting on them to protect their rights and, the stakes being what they are, the Constitution itself. If Democrats do the latter, they will manage to have laid the groundwork for some optimism about November and 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Political Crisis Has Just Begun", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fight over refugees has introduced a new climate of fear-mongering and brinkmanship. Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.BERLIN \u2014 Europe breathed a sigh of relief late Monday night when, at just after 10 p.m., Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democrats and the heads of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to the Christian Democrats, declared they had reached a compromise on migration policy. The fight, in which the Bavarians demanded a significant tightening of Germany\u2019s borders against refugees, had gone on for weeks and threatened, at the end, to take down the government. Had Ms. Merkel fallen, even temporarily, the European Union would have lost one of its last stalwart advocates \u2014 at a time when the forces of illiberalism are growing even stronger.But is the crisis really over? Can Germany and Europe finally breathe again? Hardly. The damage is here to stay.The superficial explanation for the crisis is that the C.S.U., facing state elections in October, wanted to shore up its conservative base against the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German initials A.f.D. But this crisis is about much more than that. In the past weeks, Germany has seen an unprecedented and possibly irreparable deterioration in its political culture. Simply put, the C.S.U. didn\u2019t just borrow an issue from the far right; by demonizing immigrants and harping on a nonexistent refugee \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2014 in fact, refugee arrivals are down significantly \u2014 it adopted a politics of fear and panic, for which it positioned itself as the savior. This is a new and dangerous turn in Germany\u2019s once rational and consensus-driven political climate.The C.S.U. then used the fear it generated to force Ms. Merkel to accept an uncomfortable compromise \u2014 holding camps along the border for newly arrived refugees. The alternative was a collapse of the government, new elections and most likely an improved standing for the A.f.D. Whatever the outcome, it would have meant many more months without reliable German leadership for Europe and a stalled opportunity to build a stronger Franco-German dynamic, arguably the only thing holding the European Union together.Nor was the C.S.U.\u2019s demand a small one, though on paper, the dispute seems remarkably narrow. It involved the third subpoint to Item 27 in a policy paper signed by the German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, of the C.S.U. But that subpoint contained multitudes: It dealt with so-called secondary migration within the European Union. According to the Dublin Convention, which regulates which country is responsible for examining an asylum seeker\u2019s plea for protection, the first country a migrant enters is in charge. In most actual cases, this is one of the southern European states bordering the Mediterranean. However, many migrants don\u2019t stay in those countries but move on to the north of Europe. Germany has the right to send \u201csecondary migrants\u201d back. But in many cases, the legal protections of the Dublin regulation and exemptions, for example for minors, require further examination of each individual case, something that legal scholars argue cannot be done at the border. Also, the countries of first entry often decline to take the migrants back. It\u2019s a complex, confusing issue, even for Germans, in part because everyone agrees that the Dublin process is a mess, and the union\u2019s failure to fix it is a sore point even for its defenders. What is more confounding, though, is the fact that the migration crisis is over in Germany. In 2015 and 2016, the German administration was overwhelmed by the influx on every level. Gyms and airport hangars became housing facilities. Soldiers were trained to administer in hearings for pleas for asylum, because the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees could not cope. That\u2019s no longer the case.This is not to say that the country is not still grappling with the consequences. Europe still lacks a functioning common asylum system. But contrary to what the C.S.U. and A.f.D. assert, the German state is not failing, and order is returning. For all its shortcomings, Europe has actually managed the crisis quite well, in practice. Its external borders are stronger, and better policed and managed. Cooperation with Libya\u2019s border-patrol militias, however ethically suspect, has brought down the numbers crossing from that country to Italy. So has the agreement with Turkey to host migrants in return for financial aid. In 2015, more than 450,000 pleas for asylum were filed; in 2016, about 745,000. So far this year, there have been only 68,000. According to figures by the German Federal Agency for Migration and Refugees, only about a quarter of those applying for asylum in Germany in 2018 are already registered in another European country. This means that the C.S.U. risked blowing up the government to push through a regulation that applies to about 100 individuals a day, scattered over all of Germany\u2019s points of entry.In a sane and sound political system, threats to blow up governments and force new elections are reserved for the truly momentous disputes; small things are resolved through compromise. That\u2019s how Germany worked for decades. This logic no longer applies. It has been replaced by the logic of escalation. The sentiment of crisis is perpetuated rhetorically in an attempt to whip up public opinion to then point to public opinion as a justification for radical solutions. And not just by the fringes, but by mainstream politicians. Populism needs an outer threat to function. It requires a sense of urgency to justify its policies. Populism can\u2019t let crisis go. It is both its fuel and its outcome.For the C.S.U., this strategy proved to be both a great failure and a great success. Though Mr. Seehofer and his faction keep claiming to speak for a majority, citizens both in Bavaria and elsewhere have grown increasingly annoyed with their caprices. The C.S.U. has dropped in the polls, in Bavaria and nationwide. On the political level, however, the strategy worked. Ms. Merkel was forced to react and to compromise much further than she was once willing to. Instead of working on a proactive and more sustainable European solution along the lines of the Franco-German agreements adopted recently at Meseberg, she had to resort to whatever she could get in the short term, paving a completely different path for European migration policy. On Thursday the Social Democrats, who govern alongside Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and Mr. Seehofer\u2019s C.S.U., are meeting to decide whether to accept the deal or repeat the threat of leaving the government. Chances are they will go along, because they fear new elections even more than Ms. Merkel. But they also face strong opposition to the deal from their left wing \u2014 and in general, most Germans are uncomfortable with the plan. So whatever deal is sealed this week, the political crisis over refugees is not over.Whatever respite Germany may have gained this week is offset, and then some, by the arrival of a new and frightening political dynamic. Mr. Seehofer succeeded by going nuclear; chances are, he won\u2019t be the last. The politics of fear and menace may be here to stay, undermining the foundations of democracy. In sound democracies, policies are the results of compromise between parties representing a majority of the voters. Through the politics of artificial crisis, minorities take the system hostage. They create policies redeeming fictional problems for fictional majorities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Memories Hiding in My Data Dump", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking through information stored by Facebook and Google was like reading a diary I hadn\u2019t intended to keep. The first message I saw when I downloaded my Facebook data referenced a long-forgotten encounter. Eleven years ago, two weeks before my senior year of high school, I had \u2014 apparently \u2014 written an angry note to a guy on a clunky Dell desktop (no iPhones yet) from the bedroom I shared with my sister at our parents\u2019 home in Brooklyn. I laughed out loud as I reread the more-than-a-decade-old conversation from my desk at The New York Times, where I work as a visuals producer. I found myself to be the instigator of a confrontational exchange, an uncharacteristic position for me. The safe distance of being behind a computer screen had emboldened me at the time, but now it made me cringe. As I read our correspondence, I was unnerved to realize that I had no memory of this stranger. I looked up his profile, expecting to understand our connection, but I still couldn\u2019t place him. Yet the record of him in my life was clear; it was right here in my downloads folder. I found myself digging through his Facebook page, only to learn that he had passed away. I immediately closed my computer, feeling I had somehow overstepped my inquiry.But it was much more interesting to be a voyeur of myself.At the dawn of social media, I never would have imagined that my youth was being recorded. Looking at the data now is like accessing pages from a diary I didn\u2019t intend to keep \u2014 an honest snapshot of my speaking habits, my treatment of other people and their treatment of me, over the course of more than a decade. It was highly telling in the way anything captured by an insentient machine can be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nike Says Its $250 Running Shoes Will Make You Run Much Faster. What if That\u2019s Actually True?", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nNike says the shoes are about 4 percent better than some of its best racing shoes, as measured by how much energy runners spend when running in them. That is an astonishing claim, an efficiency improvement worth almost six minutes to a three-hour marathoner, or about eight minutes to a four-hour marathoner.And it may be an accurate one, according to a new analysis by The New York Times of race data from about 500,000 marathon and half marathon running times since 2014.We found that the difference was not explained by faster runners choosing to wear the shoes, by runners choosing to wear them in easier races or by runners switching to Vaporflys after running more training miles. Instead, the analysis suggests that, in a race between two marathoners of the same ability, a runner wearing Vaporflys would have a real advantage over a competitor not wearing them.How the Nike Vaporflys compare with other popular running shoes ...When we use a statistical model, based on runners\u2019 ages, genders, race histories and other information, to measure the effect of shoesWhen we compare changes in race times among groups of runners who ran the same pairs of racesWhen we measure finish times after runners switch to new shoesWhen we see how common a personal record is when switching shoesThe advantages for runners wearing Vaporflys were consistent for slower racers and fast ones; for men and women; for runners on their second marathon or their fifth.When asked whether the shoes conform to track and field\u2019s rules, a spokesman for Nike wrote in an email that the shoe \u201cmeets all I.A.A.F. product requirements and does not require any special inspection or approval.\u201d\u201cWe need evidence to say that something is wrong with a shoe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anyone to bring some evidence to convince us.\u201dAn ideal experiment to measure how much shoes matter for race performance might involve a series of marathons on a variety of courses, with runners randomly assigned different running shoes.This data usually includes statistics like a runner\u2019s overall time, splits for every mile and a map of the runner\u2019s route. In about one-third of the races on Strava, athletes reported data on the shoes that they wore.Here\u2019s what those race reports look like for three runners of the 2017 New York Marathon who finished near the three-hour mark:No shoes reportedNike Zoom Vaporfly 4%Brooks LaunchNo shoes reportedNike Zoom Vaporfly 4%Brooks LaunchNo shoes reportedNike Zoom Vaporfly 4%Brooks LaunchBased on profiles from more than 700 races in dozens of countries since 2014, The Times compiled results from about 280,000 marathon and 215,000 half marathon completed races. (These race records are public, but The Times obtained permission from every athlete named in this article.)Below, we describe the four ways we measured the shoes\u2019 effect.We know a lot about the runners in our data set, including their age, gender, race history and, in some cases, how much training they\u2019ve done in the months before a race. We also know about the races themselves, including the distribution of runners\u2019 times and the weather that day. We can put all of this information into a model to try to estimate the change in runners\u2019 time from their previous races.After controlling for all of these variables, our model estimates that the shoes account for an expected improvement of about 4 percent over a runner\u2019s previous time. Including the uncertainty around the estimates, the Vaporflys are a clear outlier, one of the only popular shoes we can really say makes any difference at all.This model estimates the effect of wearing Vaporflys compared with the effect of wearing any other shoes. It estimates the expected change in race time from a runner\u2019s previous race given the runner\u2019s age, gender, race history, training miles (for those athletes whose training logs are public) and the weather conditions on race day.There are several statistical approaches one could take with this data set \u2014 and we tried several of them. None are perfect, but every way we tried, the effect of the shoes was more or less consistent: whether we included training miles or omitted them; whether weather data was included or ignored; or whether we modeled the change in time after switching shoes or the change in time from a runner\u2019s average.Tony Kharitonov and Marios Athineos don\u2019t know each other \u2014 in fact, they live on opposite coasts \u2014 but they have something in common: They both failed to get the time they wanted in the 2017 Boston Marathon. But they failed together, just nine seconds apart, two minutes on the wrong side of three hours.Running a marathon in less than three hours is a sign of an elite runner, and Boston is one of the world\u2019s most prestigious races. In April, the men returned to run it again \u2014 and both switched to a different pair of shoes. Mr. Kharitonov wore Altra Solstice shoes, and Mr. Athineos wore Vaporflys.Perhaps not surprisingly, given the conditions, neither runner identified shoes as a factor in this year\u2019s result. And, given what we know about how different the races were, it may seem unhelpful to compare times between them at all. But there is still meaningful information in events like these in aggregate.Instead of directly comparing performances in the two races, we can compare the net change of runners who switched to Vaporflys with the net change of similar runners who did not. Of the 1,275 runners in our data who ran Boston both years, 52 switched to Vaporflys in 2018, as Mr. Athineos did. On the whole, those runners\u2019 times improved more than that of the group of runners who did not.The runners who use Strava are an enthusiastic bunch: About one in four have uploaded data for two or more marathons, and about one in 10 have uploaded data for three or more. The Strava data allows us to follow these repeat racers over time, and, crucially, as they change shoes.New York, 2015Austin, 2016Chicago, 2016Boston, 2017Houston, 2018Saucony TriumphNew Balance Vazee PaceHoka One One CliftonNew Balance 1400Nike Vaporfly 4%3:35:223:13:303:30:233:13:502:56:00New YorkAustinChicagoBostonHouston20152016201620172018New BalanceVazee PaceHoka OneOne CliftonNew Balance1400Nike ZoomVaporfly 4%SauconyTriumph3:35:223:13:303:13:503:30:232:56:00In Houston, Mr. Kasin improved on his Boston time by about 18 minutes, an improvement owing to much more than a pair of shoes. He attributed his result, a 2:56:00, to many things: perfect weather, a fast course and the culmination of two consecutive years of a training regimen that included, on average, about 50 miles of running per week. But he said he also thought the shoes made a difference.\u201cEverything aligned, and then you throw that shoe on top of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace felt so easy that you felt like questioning: What\u2019s going on here? When is it not going to feel easy?\u201dMr. Kasin is a single data point, but in our data there are almost 4,000 runners just like him \u2014 men and women who have uploaded results for five marathons or more. When we aggregate the change in race times for runners the first time they switch to a new pair of shoes, runners who switched to Vaporflys improved their times more than runners who switched to any other kind of popular shoe.We can follow the runners in our data with this measure in mind, testing whether a runner\u2019s fastest time is more likely when he or she switches to the Vaporflys, or any other kind of shoe.Here are the two women\u2019s marathon race histories as they appear in our data, with races in the Vaporflys highlighted:Someone can run a personal best for all kinds of reasons unrelated to shoes. A runner may train more, execute a better strategy on race day or run an easier course. Regardless, we found that runners who switched to Vaporflys were more likely to run their fastest race than runners who switched to almost any other kind of popular shoe.None of these approaches are perfect, but they all point to a similar conclusion. Wherever we look for evidence that shoes matter in a marathon or half marathon, we find Vaporflys at or near the top of that list. More than that, the shoes tend to be outliers among all popular shoes, suggesting that there is something happening in races with Vaporflys that is not happening in races with nearly any other kind of popular shoe.Nothing is certain, of course, and we describe some reasons for continued skepticism below. But from our perspective, the most honest answer we can give to the question \u201cDo Vaporflys really make runners faster?\u201d is a qualified yes.The shoe names published here reflect a bespoke attempt at standardizing names, but we also tried an algorithmic approach. While the ordering of the shoes changed somewhat, the general pattern did not.First, we identified training mileage in the months leading up to a race for runners whose training logs are public, an important indication that a runner is getting more serious in his or her race preparations. Training miles are a variable we included in our statistical approach, and when we matched pairs of runners who ran in the same groups of races, we tried to match not just race time but also training regimens, where possible.Second, the effect of the shoe was persistent across different tiers of athletes \u2014 for three-hour marathoners and four-hour marathoners alike. Faster runners improved their race times at about the same rate that slower runners did.Finally, if runners raced in Vaporflys only when they thought they might have their best race, we might expect to see fewer of them on days with suboptimal weather. But we do not see that. In the 2018 Boston Marathon, in particular \u2014 a race with conditions few runners would prefer \u2014 no shoe was more popular among the runners in our data who reported what they wore.In all, about 600 different athletes reported wearing Vaporflys in 825 marathons and half marathons. They were the 32nd-most popular shoe in this data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Mistranslation Matters", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWould history have been different if Khrushchev had used a better interpreter?The author of \u201cSympathy for the Traitor: A Translation Manifesto.\u201dTranslation is the silent waiter of linguistic performance: It often gets noticed only when it knocks over the serving cart. Sometimes these are relatively minor errors \u2014 a ham-handed rendering of an author\u2019s prose, the sort of thing a book reviewer might skewer with an acid pen.But history is littered with more consequential mistranslations \u2014 erroneous, intentional or simply misunderstood. For a job that often involves endless hours poring over books or laptop screens, translation can prove surprisingly hazardous.Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s infamous statement in 1956 \u2014 \u201cWe will bury you\u201d \u2014 ushered in one of the Cold War\u2019s most dangerous phases, one rife with paranoia and conviction that both sides were out to destroy the other. But it turns out that\u2019s not what he said, not in Russian, anyway. Khrushchev\u2019s actual declaration was \u201cWe will outlast you\u201d \u2014 prematurely boastful, perhaps, but not quite the declaration of hostilities most Americans heard, thanks to his interpreter\u2019s mistake. The response of Kantaro Suzuki, prime minister of Japan, to an Allied ultimatum in July 1945 \u2014 just days before Hiroshima \u2014 was conveyed to Harry Truman as \u201csilent contempt\u201d (\u201cmokusatsu\u201d), when it was actually intended as \u201cNo comment. We need more time.\u201d Japan was not given any. And the events of Sept. 11, and everything that followed, might well have been averted had the Arabic-language messages that American intelligence intercepted on Sept. 10 been processed sooner than the 12th \u2014 a matter less of misreading than of personnel shortages, but a failure of translation nonetheless. These are recent instances, but examples stretch back to antiquity. The Bible, reportedly the most translated book of all time, has begotten not only the longest-running debates about translation, including the endless war between fidelity and felicity, but also some notable misconceptions. Of course, \u201cmistranslation\u201d is often in the eye of the beholder, and its consequences can range from the philosophical to the fatal. A populist English translation of the New Testament by the 16th-century scholar William Tyndale got him executed by the clergy for heresy, and not long afterward the French printer and scholar \u00c9tienne Dolet was hanged and burned at the stake for a translation of Plato that was also deemed heretical. One of the most infamous cases of translation-related killing involves the 1991 murder of Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of Salman Rushdie\u2019s \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d What makes Mr. Igarashi\u2019s assassination even more deplorable is that it is due, at least in part, to a mistranslation, and not even his own. The phrase \u201csatanic verses\u201d was coined by 19th-century British Orientalists to designate one or several suppressed verses in the Quran, which the Prophet Muhammad is said to have repudiated as having been suggested by Satan. This is not how the Muslim world refers to these verses, however, so when the Arabic translator of Mr. Rushdie\u2019s novel rendered the title literally, he inadvertently made it sound as if the Quran itself had been dictated by Satan. The perceived blasphemy, unintended by the author, led to international rioting, Mr. Rushdie\u2019s enforced seclusion, Mr. Igarashi\u2019s stabbing and the attempted murder of the book\u2019s Italian translator, Ettore Capriolo. Lately, the perils of mistranslation have taken on renewed currency. How to convey Donald Trump\u2019s free-form declarations to a global audience? The president\u2019s capricious employ of his native idiom, his fractured syntax and streaming non sequiturs are challenging enough for Anglophones, so imagine the difficulties they pose to foreigners: How, exactly, do you translate \u201cbraggadocious\u201d? The speed and frequency of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets have spawned an explosion of equally fast, equally viral amateur renditions, with little thought as to how they might be interpreted worldwide. The incendiary nature of many of his statements about other political leaders only exacerbates the problem. As an article in The Boston Globe suggests, Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un, given the two men\u2019s \u201cmercurial speech patterns,\u201d is a potential minefield of catastrophic miscommunication. One can all too easily imagine another disaster on the order of Khrushchev\u2019s \u201cWe will bury you\u201d or Suzuki\u2019s \u201csilent contempt,\u201d with far more cataclysmic results.

{"Headline": "Medicare Advantage Is About to Change. Here\u2019s What You Should Know.", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe new old ageMedicare Advantage plans will be allowed to cover adult day care, home modifications and other new benefits. But they may not be available to all enrollees every year. Did you fall in the bathroom and fracture your hip? Medicare, if you have it, will pay thousands of dollars for surgery to repair the injury and thousands more for your resulting hospital stay and rehab in a nursing home.For decades, public health experts, doctors, patients and families have lamented this narrow, often counterproductive approach to older Americans\u2019 health care. \u201cYou don\u2019t want somebody with asthma rushing to the emergency room with a breathing problem that could have been prevented with an air conditioner,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, who directs the Medicare policy program at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Yet Medicare covers costly emergency medicine, not window units.When Medicare\u2019s open enrollment period begins on Oct. 15, the private insurers that underwrite Advantage plans \u2014 which already lure seniors with things traditional Medicare can\u2019t cover, like eyeglasses, hearing aids and gym memberships \u2014 will be free to add a long list of new benefits. Among those the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will now allow, if they\u2019re deemed health-related: Adult day care programs. Home aides to help with activities of daily living, like bathing and dressing. Palliative care at home for some patients. Home safety devices and modifications like grab bars and wheelchair ramps. Transportation to medical appointments. \u201cThis will potentially help people stay in their homes longer and not have to go to institutions,\u201d Seema Verma, the C.M.S. administrator, said in an interview. \u201cYou could provide a simple device or a home modification that could mean the world to a patient, but plans weren\u2019t allowed to do that in the past.\u201d\u201cWhat I find most fundamental is the recognition, by C.M.S. and Congress, that this bright line between \u2018medically necessary\u2019 and things necessary to maintain health \u2014 like proper nutrition and transportation to a doctor\u2019s office \u2014 is an illusion,\u201d she said. \u201cFailure to invest in simple things like safe housing and transportation means you will invest in hospitalization and emergency room visits\u201d at far higher costs, she added.Yet celebration may prove premature. Many questions remain about how insurers will respond to the legislative opening. \u201cWe have concerns about where all this is heading,\u201d said David Lipschutz, senior policy lawyer for the Center for Medicare Advocacy. \u201cThe scales really are being tipped in favor of Medicare Advantage, with unknown consequences.\u201dA primer: Medicare Advantage funnels federal dollars to private insurers \u2014 United Healthcare and Humana dominate the market \u2014 who must cover all Medicare services but can also dangle a number of bonus benefits. Dentistry, for instance. Original Medicare doesn\u2019t cover it, but with Medicare Advantage, \u201csome plans cover cleaning,\u201d Dr. Neuman said. \u201cSome cover cleaning and extractions. Some might cover a crown every five years.\u201d Now, such extras could expand. The plans \u2014 including premiums and benefits \u2014 already vary widely. Enrollees pay the monthly Part B premium ($134 this year, though higher income people pay more) and may pay an additional Medicare Advantage premium. Last year, according to Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, that ran an average $36 a month, including Part D drug coverage.So Medicare Advantage plans may appear cheaper than standard Medicare combined with Part D and a supplemental Medigap policy \u2014 though with co-pays, deductibles and drug formularies, they may not be. The proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who opt for these plans has climbed steadily, nonetheless, to 33 percent last year from about 16 percent in 2006. In 10 years, the Kaiser Family Foundation calculates, that figure will reach 42 percent.Additional benefits could accelerate that growth, and Ms. Verma said she hoped they would. \u201cWhen people look at making a choice between enrolling in Medicare Advantage or the traditional program, they\u2019re going to see this as a tremendous opportunity,\u201d she predicted. The immediate changes may be modest. Because C.M.S. announced its new rules in April, and insurers had to submit proposals last month, \u201cthere was very little time for the plans to mobilize,\u201d said John Gorman, a consultant for many Medicare Advantage insurers. He expects more significant differences in 2020 and beyond.And then? What particularly troubles skeptics is that these intended improvements completely bypass most Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 the two-thirds who have stuck with traditional Medicare.You can see why it\u2019s played out this way. Funding for Medicare Advantage programs is capped: C.M.S. provides a set amount, which private insurers can use to provide whichever supplemental benefits they choose, theoretically stoking competition. Any increased costs will be borne by the plans and their enrollees, not the federal budget.\u201cRepublicans have always been some of Medicare Advantage\u2019s biggest boosters,\u201d Mr. Gorman noted. \u201cIn effect, you\u2019re shifting deficits onto the private sector.\u201dAs for the remaining Medicare population, \u201cadvocates are hoping this provides a pathway to expanded services for all beneficiaries,\u201d Dr. Neuman said. Thus, a plan can tailor its offerings, providing adult day programs, say, only for people with dementia. \u201cIf you see a plan advertising certain supplemental services, that\u2019s not necessarily a guarantee the services will be available to you,\u201d Mr. Lipschutz said. Advantage plans could provide certain benefits one year, then withdraw them the next, in the same way that drug coverage shifts. As for providers, \u201cwho\u2019s in-network and who\u2019s not changes by the minute,\u201d Dr. Meier said. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to require experimentation,\u201d Dr. Meier said. Still, a move to more broadly support the health and well-being of an aging population could mark an important turning point. \u201cCould\u201d is the key word. \u201cIt\u2019s only a possibility,\u201d Dr. Meier said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a possibility before.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the institution at which Dr. Diane Meier works. It is the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, not the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.Advertisement"}
