{"Headline": "Brexit and Trade Wars Are Quietly Undermining the Markets", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking at the stock markets of the developed world, it is not immediately apparent that populists are busily hacking away at the postwar international economic order.But the headline stock market numbers do not tell the whole story. A closer look suggests that the threats to the global trading system are dampening investors\u2019 enthusiasm, and the mood could darken quickly if the fights drag on and start to hurt companies\u2019 profits.Britain\u2019s two main stock market indexes, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, are both up over 20 percent since the June 2016 referendum in which voters chose to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. For comparison, Germany\u2019s stock market is up by only slightly more since then.But stocks don\u2019t tell the whole story. Since the Brexit vote, the British pound has plunged 13 percent against the euro, and 11 percent against the dollar. The pound may continue to decline if negotiations between Britain and the European Union go badly in the coming months.The falling pound helps British exporters, because a lower pound makes their goods and services cheaper to foreign buyers, spurring higher sales, at least for a while. But it can also stoke inflation in Britain, by making imports more expensive to British buyers.Things could get worse if the pound goes into a panicky free fall, because that could stir up fear in other markets and in the wider economy. And that is a possibility, because there is much that could still go wrong in the Brexit negotiations.Britain and the European Union, at least, have clear objectives that they are both attempting to reconcile. The same cannot be said of the trade conflicts set off by the United States.President Trump has imposed or proposed tariffs on imports from the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners, including China and the European Union, but it is not engaged in full-fledged negotiations to resolve grievances. Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy may be to wait until the economic pain of the American tariffs is felt by other countries, at which point they may be willing to make concessions. But such an approach could prolong the uncertainty in the markets for months.But there is reason to believe that stocks would be a lot higher if it were not for the uncertainty surrounding trade tensions.This week, companies start to release their earnings for the latest quarter. The warnings related to tariffs may occur in unexpected places.\u201cThis is no longer a skirmish, but a global trade war with uncertain consequences,\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, wrote in a research note on Wednesday, \u201cbut none that are bullish for growth or the investment landscape.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiaomi\u2019s Weak I.P.O. Raises Doubts About China\u2019s Tech Boom", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Xiaomi\u2019s public debut was supposed to value the Chinese gadget maker at $100 billion and set the stage for a global coming-out party for some of China\u2019s most successful technology companies.When Xiaomi finished its first day of trading on Monday, the company was worth only $48 billion, weakness that could hang over the rest of the Chinese tech players waiting to go public.Some companies say money from Chinese lenders has become harder to come by. China\u2019s leaders are bracing for a bruising fight with the United States over trade.Xiaomi\u2019s founder and chairman, Lei Jun, cited worries about the trade war just before the company\u2019s shares began trading.\u201cAt this critical moment in Sino-U.S. trade relations, the global capital markets are in a constant flux,\u201d Mr. Lei said to a group that included Xiaomi employees at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange early Monday.The expectations for Xiaomi have been falling in recent weeks. Investors started to re-evaluate the prospects for the company, which sells affordable smartphones and a slew of other gadgets. Although it was the biggest Chinese initial public offering since 2014, Xiaomi raised considerably less than it had originally hoped on Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. Shares then fell slightly.Xiaomi is widely expected to be the first of several big Chinese tech names to seek initial public offerings in coming months. They include Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s version of Uber; Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of the Alibaba Group; and Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and products.All three companies have benefited from the prevalence of smartphone use in China and the country\u2019s wild online growth, which has made it by far the world\u2019s largest internet market in terms of users. They could choose to go public in Hong Kong, which would give global investors a chance to bet on them.Xiaomi\u2019s shares on Monday ended at 16.80 Hong Kong dollars, or roughly $2.15 \u2014 just below the 17 Hong Kong dollars at which they began the day, and far below the company\u2019s earlier hopes.Though Mr. Lei cited trade, investor concerns about the company\u2019s plan played a big role in its disappointing debut.In recent months, as Xiaomi bankers and executives traveled around the world to meet with prospective investors, they pitched Xiaomi as an internet company and China\u2019s answer to Apple. It was a formula \u2014 China plus internet \u2014 that in the past guaranteed strong support from overseas investors like hedge fund managers in the United States.But many investors view Xiaomi as still largely a hardware maker, not an internet company. It has promised fatter margins from selling internet services to its smartphone users, but those services accounted for less than 9 percent of last year\u2019s revenue.\u201cXiaomi has been billing itself as a Chinese internet company, but they really are not quite yet a pure internet company,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.\u201cInvestors haven\u2019t really bought into that story,\u201d Mr. Wang added.Some investors were also concerned about Xiaomi\u2019s focus on international growth, as its home market has become increasingly competitive. More than half of its sales are outside China, primarily in India, where it has a loyal following for its low-cost smartphones.While that could be attractive to some investors in the long run, some saw more immediate risks. For example, Xiaomi was forced to backtrack in Brazil after it failed to establish a relationship with local carriers.Xiaomi received wide news coverage this year when it announced its plans to list in Hong Kong, picking Hong Kong over New York, the listing venue of choice for some of China\u2019s blockbuster offerings, like Alibaba.Even with the tepid market response on Monday, Xiaomi persuaded a number of high-profile investors to buy shares. These included China Mobile, Qualcomm and China Merchants Bank Group, according to a term sheet seen by The New York Times.And with its public market listing, Mr. Lei is a new billionaire. Wearing a tie in the same orange as his company\u2019s logo, he told reporters at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, \u201cI am excited beyond words!\u201dMr. Lei then hit the gong to signal the start of trading, and everyone watched as the company\u2019s shares fell. And they continued to fall; by midmorning the stock had dropped 5 percent against a rising Hong Kong Stock Exchange.By the end of the day, it had recovered some of the losses, after support from bargain hunters and Xiaomi\u2019s bankers helped to push the share price back up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet the Rebate, the New Villain of High Drug Prices", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA growing chorus, including the Trump administration, is calling for a rethinking of after-the-fact drug discounts that some say contribute to rising prices.An increasingly popular culprit in the debate over high drug prices is the pharmaceutical rebate, the after-the-fact discounts that form the heart of the nation\u2019s arcane \u2014 many would say broken \u2014 market for prescription drugs.Here\u2019s a rundown on everything you need to know about rebates.Pharmaceutical rebates are similar to the type that you get when you buy a toaster \u2014 discounts that are redeemed after the transaction has taken place.Except with the toaster, you get to keep the money. With drug rebates, it\u2019s the insurer or employers who usually reap the benefit.Under the current system, drug makers set a list price for their products, then negotiate with pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts or CVS over how much of a discount they will provide off that list price. Most of the rebate \u2014 and sometimes, all of it \u2014 goes to those who are paying the bill for the drugs, mainly insurers or large employers who cover their workers\u2019 health care. Pharmacy benefit managers usually keep a percentage of the rebate as payment.Insurers and employers get their rebates in lump sums that they say are often used to offset general health care costs and to hold down premiums. But that has led to an escalating game, where drug companies raise their list prices to maintain their profits and to offer bigger rebates.Some say the system has created a series of perverse incentives, where the middlemen have an interest in keeping the list price high. In addition to pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers and pharmacies are also paid based on a percentage of the list price.Even as insurers\u2019 drug spending has grown slowly, critics say the rebate game has served to inflate the list price of drugs, which consumers are increasingly responsible for paying. This is especially true for expensive specialty drugs, which treat serious conditions like cancer and multiple sclerosis \u2014 and whose prices have been skyrocketing. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, has singled out rebates as a primary way that patients\u2019 costs could fall. Last week, the Trump administration signaled that it might try to end the \u201csafe harbor\u201d exemption that protects rebates from falling under anti-kickback laws. That would affect government programs like Medicare\u2019s Part D drug plans, but it wouldn\u2019t affect rebates in private plans \u2014 like those offered by employers. Changes to large programs like Medicare often have a rippling effect across the industry. Doing away with rebates won\u2019t fix other problems. The companies that sell the most expensive drugs \u2014 newly approved products that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year \u2014 don\u2019t offer many discounts because they have little to no competition. IQVIA, the drug research firm, found that rebates amounted to about 40 percent of the list price for treatments of some diseases, like diabetes. But they reduced the list price by only 10 percent in treating other diseases, like cancer. It\u2019s unclear.But doing away with the rebate would create disruption that may be fought by a host of players. \u201cThings that seem simple, like let\u2019s cut the list price, are not actually simple,\u201d said Adam J. Fein, of the Drug Channels Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are the Trade War Losers? Just Look at the Earnings Rolling In", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorporate earnings are the strongest they have been in years. Headline numbers suggest the economy is doing pretty well under President Trump.The stock market, however, is starting to signal that the good times might not last for many.On the surface, stocks look to be performing well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up more than 6 percent this year, and it is close to getting back to the historic high it hit earlier this year.A deeper look, however, suggests there is increasing concern among stock investors. A small group of the largest technology companies has driven much of the recent rally. The stocks of other types of companies have not performed nearly as well, in part because of worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs will harm corporate profits.The stock market is not a perfect predictor of the future, but the lackluster performance of a large part of it may portend a difficult period for many companies in which they pull back on their businesses and perhaps shed jobs in the process.The trade talks announced on Wednesday between the United States and the European Union could prevent an escalation of the fight between the two trading partners. Some investors have been betting that Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose stance was a bargaining tactic. Stocks jumped after news of the talks was reported.And investors and executives are finding plenty of reasons to remain nervous as companies report their second-quarter earnings. The trade war\u2019s impact on some companies is causing their stocks to crater. So far, the hit is largely coming from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have pushed up the prices many firms pay for the metals.It\u2019s possible that the economy is strong enough to make up for the drag caused by the trade confrontations. United Technologies, an industrial conglomerate, on Tuesday raised its profits forecast even as it reported higher costs because of the tariffs.But executives on earnings calls are saying their companies have only just begun to feel the effect of the tariffs. Their second-quarter results, for instance, reflected steel and aluminum bought at lower prices than exist in the market today. And few of the other tariffs that Mr. Trump has proposed have gone into effect yet. That could change by the end of the year, including an additional $200 billion of tariffs on imports from China. Mr. Trump is also pushing for tariffs on autos, though these may not be imposed on European imports if progress is made in the talks announced on Wednesday.General Motors, which reported earnings on Wednesday, showed the many ways in which President Trump\u2019s trade actions could damage the company\u2019s business. Higher steel costs were one of the reasons General Motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018, a move that helped send its stock down 4.6 percent on Wednesday.The company\u2019s costs didn\u2019t rise because it is purchasing a large amount of foreign steel that is subject to tariffs. Over 90 percent of the steel used in General Motors\u2019 production comes from the United States, said Tom E. Henderson, a company spokesman. But the tariffs have pushed up prices for all steel, including American, and put a burden on even companies that rely on domestic suppliers. Higher prices for steel and aluminum could add as much as $700 million to General Motors\u2019 costs this year, Chuck Stevens, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday.General Motors sells a large number of vehicles in China, where it has significant operations. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions against China could end up provoking Chinese consumers to boycott G.M.\u2019s cars \u2014 a real possibility, given that those same buyers recently shunned South Korean autos and other products. But Mr. Stevens said Wednesday that the company had not seen any sign of a boycott.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Plans Raise Fears of Food Shortages and Jammed Ports", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Trucks parked along freeways or stuck in gridlocked ports. Food disappearing from supermarket shelves and stocks of medicines under strain. The military on standby, ready to step in to avert crisis.For a British public that has often tuned out from the mind-numbing complexities of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, recent government statements, amplified by raucous newspaper headlines, have finally become comprehensible \u2014 and alarming.For days, talk has swirled about government preparations for a disruptive departure from the European Union without any agreement \u2014 a scenario that could mean new border checks, log-jammed ports, marooned trucks, and food, drugs and other essential supplies drying up.The speculation was prompted by a government promise to prepare for all eventualities, including the extreme one of a \u201cno deal\u201d departure from the European Union, or Brexit. But even before the first of around 70 official \u201cno deal\u201d warning documents for businesses and consumers was published, they had \u2014 through the filter of the British news media \u2014 started to sound ominously reminiscent of rationing and other preparations during World War II.On Monday, the government insisted that it had \u201cno plans\u201d to involve the army and was backpedaling over the timing of the 70 warning notices. They were originally scheduled to appear regularly throughout the summer, something that would have generated maximum publicity. Now, the documents are expected in August and early September, probably in two batches.Already, however, efforts to prepare for the possibility of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit have backfired by drawing attention to the extreme consequences Britain might face, and to the fact that it might not be able to do much to mitigate them.And they have angered the very people they were meant to please: hard-line supporters of Brexit who had been pressing the government to make \u201cno deal\u201d preparations so the country could threaten to walk away from negotiations with the European Union.\u201cIt has not been a tremendous success, and I don\u2019t know what the hell the thinking is,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London.\u201cThis started off as a way to placate the Brexiteers,\u201d he said, \u201cand then it turned into something that the Brexiteers hate because the contingency planning sounds so awful.\u201dNow, with opinion surveys suggesting that worries about chaos are rippling through to the public, Brexit supporters have renewed their denunciations of \u201cproject fear\u201d \u2014 a term they used successfully in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign.They have only themselves to blame. For months they urged the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario to strengthen its negotiating position with the European Union, and Prime Minister Theresa May ultimately relented.Last week Mr. Raab said he would ensure \u201cadequate food supplies\u201d in the event of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, but suggested that this would be the responsibility of the food industry as it would \u201cbe wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling.\u201dIf he expected retailers and suppliers to begin quietly stocking up on essential goods, he seems not to have spoken first to key figures.\u201cStockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit and industry has not been approached by Government to begin planning for this,\u201d the British Retail Consortium, which represents many retail firms, said in a curt statement.\u201cRetailers do not have the facilities to house stockpiled goods and in the case of fresh produce, it is simply not possible to do so,\u201d it added.Others complained that the government looked incompetent and na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea of stockpiling and storage is a red herring,\u201d said Shane Brennan, the chief executive of the Food Storage and Distribution Federation, a trade lobby group.\u201cFood supply systems don\u2019t work like that,\u201d he added. \u201cFood is kept moving. It\u2019s out of the ground and to the point of sale as quickly as possible. The idea of stockpiling it suggests a lack of understanding about how things work.\u201dContracts for food supplies are typically set 12 months ahead, with food arriving via a complex logistics system that runs on a just-in-time basis and often provides three to five days\u2019 supply, it said.\u201cIf there are delays due to added inspections, you have all the Armageddon that goes with that,\u201d said Nigel Jenney, the chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, a group that represents companies in that part of the food sector. \u201cThese things are highly perishable, and they can\u2019t sit there for days.\u201dIn theory, both the European Union and Britain have an interest in keeping trade flowing.The British government has negotiated a standstill transition period, during which trading ties would remain the same, from the departure date in March next year until December 2020. The catch is that this is conditional on a withdrawal agreement that still has to be finalized.Robert Hardy, the commercial director of Oakland International, a logistics and distribution specialist, dismissed some of the more dire scenarios and argued that the British authorities would waive the need for trucks to be stopped at key ports like Dover.Customs formalities could be performed later in the process, something permitted under existing rules, Mr. Hardy said.\u201cFor imports I don\u2019t see any major changes,\u201d he said.That said, he acknowledged that there could be big problems for exporters if \u2014 as is likely \u2014 officials in France were to impose new checks. Others point out that trucks delivering supplies to Britain would have difficulties getting home, thereby disrupting the supply chain and affecting imports.Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents food and nonalcoholic drinks manufacturers, said the group was investigating strategies to limit the impact of a no-deal Brexit.But the scope for stockpiling is limited by the cost, the availability of storage space and by the fact that fresh food spoils quickly.\u201cWe are not going to run out of food \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the return of rationing,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cBut there could be some shortages and an erosion of choice.\u201dFor the government, there is one small silver lining to yet another bad Brexit news story.If Mrs. May can negotiate a deal with the European Union in the fall, and avoid a disruptive exit from the bloc, her agreement will sound better than the chaos of the \u201cno deal\u201d alternative, Mr. Menon said. \u201cPerhaps it helps Theresa May to point back to all the speculation about \u2018no deal\u2019 and say, \u2018At least I have avoided all that,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

You can\u2019t view this story of a hard-grafting immigrant family, this apparent tale of the American dream, without awareness of where it all wound up.Basically, the Lehmans are present for all things great and horrible about U.S. economic shifts, trends and fads since, roughly, the 1840s. But it\u2019s also a family story, too. And this leaves the thorny question of what we are to think of these people. Are they merely opportunists? Are they amoral? Are they geniuses? Are they a net positive for the country? The answers change because the plot follows three generations of very different characters. But the question persists, in my mind, after the curtain falls. What did you make of this remarkable little clan, Holly?While there\u2019s a strong argument that the best way to stop history repeating is to really understand it, and a human look at the people behind mega institutions can help that, the play was still three and half hours of white men talking about how much money they want to make. I found it completely compelling, I should add, but it\u2019s always worth thinking about whose stories get told on our major stages.Anyway, David, what I want to know is how does it feel to see this very American story told by Brits? Did we do a reasonable job at catching something of the national psyche? So far, British critics seem unanimous in their praise \u2014 do you think it would play so well on Broadway? Famously, Lucy Prebble\u2019s \u201cEnron\u201d was a smash in London and a flop over there.I also think that American audiences will like the kinetic staging. For stretches of the show, you are transported via a video backdrop that is inventively deployed \u2014 to convey fire, war, the crash, nightmares, and most winningly, the \u201cdance\u201d of an economy at full throttle. Also, the U.S. is filled with fans of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and one of the brothers is played by Adam Godley, who was Elliott Schwartz in that show. Mr. Godley demonstrates range that he never got to in the show. Like his co-stars, he plays women, children and an assortment of men, all while wearing the same dark overcoat and suit.That said, I felt it was less effective with the female roles. All the female parts were played for laughs, really. Given these three actors exhibit such mastery at inhabiting different roles, this didn\u2019t need to be the case.This was an evening that could have felt very pedantic \u2014 an Italian playwright and an English production on Britain\u2019s national stage, at a moment when the world is pontificating and theorizing about what ails America. Mr. Massini rarely puts his thumb on the dramatic scales, and only toward the end, when he makes it clear that avaricious people are to blame for a catastrophe. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t feel lectured to, or pointed toward a particular conclusion, any other time.The revelation is what comes before that. The men who rise from nothing and a nation that makes that rise possible. It is a yarn with plenty of ugliness, sometimes acknowledged by the main players, more often not.

Anyone can! It doesn\u2019t take some special crafting gene, and you don\u2019t need superhuman dexterity (or even a lot of patience). You just need to follow a few basic rules and, most important, you have to want it.Who really knows! People quit lots of things for lots of reasons. That said, there are a couple of common, easily avoidable mistakes that make new knitters (and their teachers) stumble.Another reason new knitters give up is that projects can sometimes drag on, so try to give yourself a deadline for your first: maybe you\u2019ll want to wear the completed item on an upcoming trip or to give it to someone for their birthday.Last, accept that it\u2019s O.K. to be bad at something when you\u2019re first starting out. As adults we so rarely try things we\u2019ve never experienced before, and there\u2019s truly something liberating in sucking for a week or two before finally getting the hang of it.For those first few projects, generally you\u2019ll want yarn that\u2019s medium-weight, otherwise known as worsted \u2014 not as thin as dental floss nor as thick as rope \u2014 and make sure to read its label to figure out which size needles you should buy to go along with it (generally sizes 6 to 9). Don\u2019t worry too much about your first needles; the size is the important thing, and what they\u2019re made of (bamboo, aluminum, plastic) and how they look (straight versus circular) is more a matter of preference than anything else.It\u2019s time to figure out what kind of student you are.If you learn best in an in-person or group setting and don\u2019t mind potentially spending some time and money, contact your LYS to find out when and how they teach beginners. Sometimes the price of admission is just buying the materials there, and often it\u2019s more for longer, more intensive courses.Congratulations: You\u2019re ready to knit!Block out a chunk of time in your schedule to put some initial time into whichever learning method you prefer. It should be at least a couple of hours with minimal interruptions at first (although soon you should be able to knit and listen to a podcast or watch TV). When you\u2019re first starting out, try to do multiple sessions in a short time period \u2014 a good beginner\u2019s pace is about three times per week.Give yourself time to learn the following techniques: casting on, the knit stitch, the purl stitch, decreasing, increasing and casting off. Each of these will take some trial and error, but once you know them, you\u2019ll be able to make most beginner patterns. (And don\u2019t forget to take breaks to stretch your hands.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Balanced Funds Don\u2019t Inspire Fear or Greed. That\u2019s Why They Are So Useful.", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe balanced fund is the vintage bicycle of investing.And the old balanced fund is lately finding new fans. Since 2013, investor money has sloshed in, with the total assets in balanced funds swelling about 70 percent, to $1.7 trillion, according to EPFR Global in Cambridge, Mass. In an age of ever-more-complicated mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, based on arcane strategies and obscure indexes, these folks are betting on the original set-it-and-forget-it investment.A balanced fund invests in both stocks and bonds. It is balanced inasmuch as its traditional asset allocation is about 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds and cash, with the stocks providing return and the bonds reducing risk.Russel J. Kinnel, director of manager research for Morningstar, said he once dismissed balanced funds as obsolete but has come to appreciate them.\u201cPeople do pretty well in balanced funds because balanced funds tend not to inspire fear or greed,\u201d he said.Balanced offerings can be actively managed, like Vanguard Wellington, T. Rowe Price Balanced, Mairs & Power Balanced or Oakmark Equity and Income, or indexed and passively managed, like the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund or iShares Core Growth Allocation E.T.F.They can hew mostly to domestic securities, as does Vanguard Balanced, or they can bet bigger on international markets, as does T. Rowe Price Balanced. They\u2019re widely available \u2014 many large fund families offer them, including American Funds, BlackRock and Fidelity.Balanced funds\u2019 virtue is that their stodgy construction discourages investors from defeating themselves, Mr. Kinnel said.Morningstar analyzes how mutual funds\u2019 returns compare with those of the investors in those funds. Even when funds post good numbers investors don\u2019t necessarily reap the same returns, he said. That\u2019s because many people tend to buy and sell willy-nilly, jumping in when the market soars and bailing out when it crashes, rather than buying and staying put.But people in balanced funds tend to be patient, helped by the funds\u2019 smoother performance. As a result, the investors\u2019 actual returns are more likely to match those of their funds.In the 10 years through March, for example, investors in balanced funds, on average, had an actual asset-weighted 5.93 percent annualized return, according to Morningstar. That was better than the 5.63 percent annualized total return of those same funds, indicating that balanced fund investors typically avoided maladroit timing.For mutual funds over all, the situation was reversed. Actual investor returns were 5.53 percent annualized, compared with a 5.79 percent total return for the funds. That shows that, in most other funds, investors had smaller returns because they bought high and sold low.Jennifer Lane, a financial planner at Compass Planning Associates in Boston, said she recommends balanced funds because they really do encourage patience and prudence.\u201cWe want to make sure our clients meet their savings goals, which means they have to stay in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will say they\u2019re risk tolerant, but that really means they like return.\u201dWhen the stock market drops, they often panic and sell. Those who exit can miss out on a big chunk of the market\u2019s rebound. By recommending balanced funds over ones with greater percentages of stocks, Ms. Lane said, she\u2019s nudging clients toward staying invested and sticking with their financial plans.Target-date retirement funds have replaced balanced funds in some retirement plans. They don\u2019t stick to a relatively stable asset allocation, as balanced funds do. Instead, investors pick them based on when they are likely to retire, 2020, 2025, 2030 and so on. The funds change their asset allocation, typically reducing the share of stocks and increasing the share of bonds, as their investors approach that year.The trouble with that approach, said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, is that it assumes that everyone of the same age has the same risk tolerance and that people know in advance when they will retire. Balanced funds give flexibility to those who don\u2019t fit comfortably into a target-date template, he said.Another benefit of balanced funds is that their approximate 60/40 asset allocation, while not perfect, is good enough for many people, said Barry L. Ritholtz, chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management in New York and a columnist for Bloomberg. \u201cThe perfect portfolio isn\u2019t necessarily the one that generates the highest return \u2014 it\u2019s the one you can live with,\u201d he said.One of the two managers of Wellington, Edward P. Bousa, expressed ambivalence about 2008. Mr. Bousa said he was pleased that he and John C. Keogh \u2014 Mr. Bousa oversees the stocks and Mr. Keogh the bonds \u2014 had outperformed the market. But he was disappointed that they had lost money for shareholders.After all, Mr. Bousa said, they manage the fund defensively, with an aim of avoiding down years. That has been the fund\u2019s goal for much of its existence. Wellington has lost money in only 18 of the 89 years since its birth. Over that time, it has returned an annualized average of 8.3 percent.Mr. Bousa said he maintains a defensive position, on the equity side, in three ways. He seeks solid stocks with above-average dividend yields. He picks up growth companies that have fallen out of favor for reasons he judges to be temporary. And he hunts for opportunities in the capital-spending and demand-growth patterns of industries.\u201cThe idea is, in an area where there\u2019s a lot of spending, there\u2019s likely too much supply,\u201d he said.\u201cIn 2002, oil was $22 a barrel,\u201d he said. \u201cSupply was being constrained. The companies weren\u2019t spending much money. But China was starting to emerge.\u201d That meant oil prices were likely to rise, he said, so he increased the fund\u2019s holdings in energy, a bet that paid off.The stock portfolio has greater allocations of financial and health care stocks than competing funds, according to Morningstar. The fund\u2019s international stock stake, at 13.5 percent of its assets, is roughly in line with competitors\u2019.Mr. Keogh said he tries to do three things with the fund\u2019s bonds \u2014 contribute to the fund\u2019s total return, damp the stocks\u2019 volatility and provide insurance against bear markets.\u201cYou can go in lots of directions to enhance your total return, like high-yield bonds, but that wouldn\u2019t protect you in a down equity market,\u201d he said.The committee meets monthly to decide how to divide the fund\u2019s assets, typically among domestic and international stocks and bonds and cash. Mr. Shriver said the committee\u2019s \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d are T. Rowe Price\u2019s \u201cunderlying actively managed strategies like high-yield bonds and U.S. growth and value stocks.\u201dFor example, Larry J. Puglia, who manages T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth, selects the balanced fund\u2019s large-cap growth stocks. The fund has returned an annualized average of 9.6 percent since its 1939 inception.\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with a lot of great companies here, like 3M, where we\u2019re a long-term investor,\u201d he said.Mr. Kaliebe said investing regionally lets him and his fellow managers cultivate a deeper knowledge of companies. They meet regularly with executives and often chat informally with lower-level employees.\u201cYou can have a neighbor who\u2019s an engineer somewhere or go to church with someone who works there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helps you build your investment mosaic.\u201dThe local focus also leads to idiosyncratic opportunities, like bonds issued by Land O\u2019 Lakes, which the fund owns. \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit of a one-off \u2014 it\u2019s a locally based co-op of milk producers,\u201d he said.Hormel Foods, the meat-products company known for making Spam, is another holding based nearby, in Austin, Minn., just north of the Iowa state line. But not every investment comes from the Upper Midwest. \u201cWe can\u2019t build the portfolio 100 percent in our home region because we don\u2019t have that much energy and technology here,\u201d Mr. Kaliebe said.Suggest to Mr. Kaliebe that a balanced fund exhibits the unpretentious common sense that Midwesterners are known for and he\u2019s quick to agree.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people can get overwhelmed by complexity in investing. A balanced fund offers more understandability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bitcoin Funds Are Rare: They Sail Uncharted Waters", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are on their way to being the next big thing or yesterday\u2019s news. Their novelty makes it hard to tell which.For better or worse, funds are being introduced that let investors capture the rewards and risks available in cryptocurrencies. Most are listed on foreign markets or aimed at so-called accredited investors, those with high incomes or substantial wealth, although the funds often have minimum investments of as little as $10,000 to $25,000.Several firms have filed to sell specialty exchange-traded funds in the United States, but none have been approved yet. The Securities and Exchange Commission has cited \u201csignificant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.\u201dThe fund manager Van Eck and the software developer SolidX asked the S.E.C. in early June for permission to offer an E.T.F. that addresses the agency\u2019s concerns, partly by setting the share price so high, nearly $200,000, that small investors could not afford it. That request is still pending.If and when funds are listed, prospective shareholders should treat them with caution and skepticism, investment advisers and authorities on cryptocurrencies warn. Since its invention in 2009, Bitcoin has risen from pennies to about $6,400, and other cryptocurrencies have experienced astounding runs of their own.There are fascinating aspects to Bitcoin and its peers, especially the underlying blockchain technology, but prices have been driven to a large extent by hype and hope, and the gains could be reversed.\u201cThere is no intrinsic value to a Bitcoin,\u201d said Lee McKnight, an associate professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. \u201cThe market is caught up in a frenzy for new technology.\u201dOne sign of the frenzy is in the trading price of Bitcoin Investment Trust, one of the funds for well-off investors. It has been 56 percent above the value of the portfolio\u2019s assets this year on average, according to Morningstar, bid up by shareholders eager for access to the market when few other avenues exist. The premium, which was 45 percent on June 30, could fall sharply if other investment vehicles come along.\u201cThe challenge with cryptocurrency-oriented investing is it\u2019s hard to gain exposure, as there are no U.S.-listed E.T.F.s,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA.\u201cWhen the supply to gain exposure to Bitcoin grows via E.T.F. choices and better meets demand, the premium will narrow.\u201dJust what the right prices are for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fund premiums aside, is hard to judge, Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, acknowledged.\u201cThe crypto ecosystem hasn\u2019t evolved an agreed-upon framework to value crypto,\u201d he said. Referring to extreme long-range valuation estimates floated for Bitcoin, he added, \u201cAnyone who says they know it\u2019s worth $10,000 or $20,000 or $1 million or $0 is wrong.\u201dMr. Hougan thinks there\u2019s a reasonable chance that cryptocurrencies will become widespread alternative forms of money, much as gold may be considered today, putting a floor under prices. He cited the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies \u2014 the blockchain ledgers recording transactions exist in no one spot and under no one\u2019s control \u2014 and their built-in digital scarcity.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely feasible that a new store of value could emerge in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that concept began and ended with gold.\u201dBitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency but not the only one. There are roughly 1,600 of them, Mr. McKnight said, and, \u201cEighty percent are scams, or assets with no value in the long run.\u201dThe technologies embodied in these ventures will undoubtedly serve other purposes, he said. Blockchains \u2014 secure, time-stamped sets of digital records \u2014 are expected to be valuable tools in areas like supply chain management and banking that feature large amounts of information shared among multiple parties using varied data management systems.\u201cThere\u2019s a mass of confusion between blockchain technology, which will have a big impact, and cryptocurrencies,\u201d Mr. McKnight said. The former \u201cis what investors should be looking at.\u201dA mature business devoting large resources to blockchain projects is I.B.M. It has about 15 commercial ventures focused on supply-chain management, he said, and it has \u201cpurposely stayed away from cryptocurrencies.\u201dMany professional investors find promise in the core blockchain technology, even as they scoff at the notion that it can be used to reinvent money. In a note to investors this year, Joe Davis, the head of Vanguard\u2019s Investment Strategy Group, said he was \u201centhusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes Bitcoin possible.\u201d But \u201cas for Bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.\u201dEven a believer in cryptocurrencies like Mr. Hougan said Bitcoin is inefficient, with \u201ca slow, simple network\u201d and limited programming capabilities.But he wouldn\u2019t rule it out as a portfolio holding. Because its price movements are minimally correlated with those of conventional assets, adding a modest allocation to Bitcoin to a 60 percent stock-40 percent bond portfolio could improve performance, he said. A study by Bitwise found that a 5 percent allocation would have doubled the Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted returns, of such a portfolio between the end of 2013 and the end of March.Because Bitcoin is so volatile, however, rebalancing the allocation is essential, Mr. Hougan added. If the desired weighting is 1 percent, he would sell back to that level whenever it reached 1.5 percent and buy more when it reached 0.5 percent.The value of a Bitcoin rose to just under $7,000 from about $600 during the time of the study. Whether owning it or other cryptocurrencies will be as helpful if the price persistently falls remains to be seen. Mr. McKnight is skeptical.\u201cIt\u2019s buyer beware,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go into this space saying you\u2019re going to pick this or that cryptocurrency without knowing anything. And you should not be using your living money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drug to Treat Smallpox Approved by F.D.A., a Move Against Bioterrorism", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first drug intended to treat smallpox \u2014 a move that could halt a lethal pandemic if the virus were to be released as a terrorist bioweapon or through a laboratory accident.The antiviral pill, tecovirimat, also known as Tpoxx, has never been tested in humans with smallpox because the disease was declared eradicated in 1980, three years after the last known case.But it was very effective at protecting animals deliberately infected with monkeypox and rabbitpox, two related diseases that can be lethal. It also caused no severe side effects when safety-tested in 359 healthy human volunteers, the F.D.A. said.\u201cThis new treatment affords us an additional option should smallpox ever be used as a bioweapon,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A.\u2019s commissioner.Having a drug that usually cures smallpox is an important medical breakthrough, according to several medical experts not associated with the F.D.A. or the company making the drug.F.D.A. approval is \u201cdefinitely a good thing,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Research on tecovirimat \u2014 originally designated ST-246 \u2014 began at the institute after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Dr. Fauci said. The research accompanied efforts to stretch the national stockpile of smallpox vaccine by safely diluting it.\u201cIt all started back then, but developing a licensed product took until today,\u201d he added.The F.D.A. approval of the drug went to Siga Technologies of Corvallis, Ore., a private company that developed the medicine under a federal biomedical defense contract.Although circulating smallpox has been eradicated, two known stores of the virus exist in laboratory freezers \u2014 one in Russia and one at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.More worrisome, experts say, is the possibility that a terrorist lab or even a sophisticated amateur could use modern gene-editing techniques to rebuild the virus and then unleash it, deliberately or accidentally, on an unprepared world.Because routine smallpox vaccination stopped after 1980, almost everyone under the age of 40 is unprotected. The disease kills almost a third of people who get it, and is even more lethal to babies.Finding a medicine was vital because \u2014 unlike, for example, measles or whooping cough vaccine \u2014 smallpox vaccine is too dangerous to give everyone, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, former president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.The vaccine is now routinely given only to some members of the military, lab workers and others likely to come in contact with the virus in a bioterrorism event. It cannot be given to pregnant women, or to anyone with H.I.V., under cancer treatment or with any other immunosuppressive condition; nor can the vaccine be given to anyone with eczema or several other skin diseases, Dr. Hotez said.So a medicine like tecovirimat would be useful for treating anyone infected in the first wave of any release of the virus, as well as the millions of Americans who cannot be vaccinated.Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School, noted tecovirimat also could be useful for treating monkeypox, which infects humans and has been increasing rapidly in Africa since smallpox vaccination ended.Despite its fearsome reputation, smallpox actually spreads slowly compared with more common diseases like measles or chickenpox, Dr. Schaffner said.Symptoms like fever, exhaustion and headache typically begin 10 to 14 days after infection. These are followed by a rash of small bumps that become pus-filled sores, which can cause permanent scarring.In severe cases, the infection causes loss of large areas of skin and bleeding. The virus can also reach the brain, leading to encephalitis, and can cause blindness by blistering the eyeballs.When tecovirimat was tested in humans, the most common side effects it caused were headache, nausea and abdominal pain, the F.D.A. said.The F.D.A. gave Siga several valuable incentives toward its application for approval, including fast-track and priority review designations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Earnings Are Booming. Stocks Not So Much.", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are not rewarding American corporations for the best profits they\u2019ve reported in years.The second-quarter earnings season is underway, and the first reports look strong. So far, 87 percent of companies that have reported earnings have exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates, well above the 70 percent average over the past five years, and FactSet is now forecasting that second-quarter profits for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index will be up 20.8 percent from a year earlier.This follows a first quarter in which profits ballooned by 24.6 percent and 78 percent of companies announced profits that exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations.Heading into 2018, many market watchers pointed to corporate earnings to explain their rosy outlook for stocks. Yet despite this performance, the stock market has been lackluster. The S. & P. 500 has gained 4.9 percent this year and is off 2.4 percent from its high, on Jan. 26.So why aren\u2019t stocks higher?The lack of excitement about the earnings surge shows up in stock movements. So far this earnings season, shares of S. & P. 500 companies that reported profits above expectations rose just 0.9 percent in the days surrounding the release of their results. During the first-quarter earnings season, shares of companies whose results topped estimates rose 0.2 percent, and those stocks even declined during the fourth-quarter reporting period.So why aren\u2019t investors rewarding companies? Expectations and valuation. Investors have already priced in big earnings from corporate America. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S. & P. 500 stands at 16.5, slightly above the 10-year average of 14.4. That valuation takes into account profits rising nearly 20.6 percent this year, the best annual growth rate since 2010.With expectations already so high, there is little room for error. If the growth rate comes in lower than currently expected, the stock market will suddenly look overvalued in a bull market that is entering its 10th year.The first-quarter earnings growth rate may have marked a high, in part because of the benefits of tax cuts. Although the tax legislation passed in December is certainly bolstering profits \u2014 profit margins are at a record high this year, according to FactSet \u2014 the positive impact on the earnings growth rate is expected to fade next year.But the relationship between earnings and stock market performance is sometimes not cut and dried. Bank of America Merrill Lynch looked at 90 years of stock market data and found that the S. & P. 500 was slightly more likely to finish a year lower when earnings growth topped 10 percent than when it failed to reach double digits.Advertisement"}

But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That\u2019s because to succeed, it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well. As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues, PillPack most likely didn\u2019t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry\u2019s giants, said Eric Percher, an equity research analyst at Nephron Research. PillPack, which was founded in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken. While the company had a niche appeal, many analysts have speculated that Amazon\u2019s true motivation for buying PillPack is to leapfrog its way into the broader prescription drug business because PillPack has pharmacy licenses in 50 states. It also has relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health, that serve as gatekeepers to the majority of Americans who are covered by health insurance.Although that dispute was resolved, Express Scripts said on Friday that its network agreement with PillPack was expiring in July and that the two companies had not reached an agreement on rates. It also said that it was investigating PillPack for \u201cprovider compliance,\u201d although it did not elaborate. CVS Health said PillPack is in \u201cmany\u201d of its pharmacy networks, including for commercially insured consumers as well as Medicare beneficiaries. OptumRx, another large benefit manager, did not comment, although a spokeswoman for PillPack said the company was in OptumRx\u2019s commercial pharmacy network. She declined to comment on the negotiations over the Express Scripts contract.But Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said she was skeptical that Amazon would link up with an established company. \u201cIt\u2019s looking to partner with other innovators, not just your standard vendors like your traditional P.B.M.s,\u201d she said. Any partner \u201cwould have to be one that brings something to the table in an innovative way.\u201dThe months of speculation have allowed competitors to prepare, acting as \u201ca catalyst for participants to close ranks against competition and invest to improve the consumer experience,\u201d Mr. Percher wrote in a research note last week. In a statement, Express Scripts touted the breadth of its services, saying it delivered more than 100 million prescriptions to patients around the country in 2017. \u201cOur scale and quality of care provides patients with access to a broader suite of products than other smaller pharmacies,\u201d the company said.Peter Blicher, 70, of Vacaville, Calif., said he has used several different mail-order pharmacies over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do business with them, takes multiple interaction, the customer service is very poor,\u201d he said. If Amazon were to begin selling prescription drugs, he said, he would sign up. \u201cI haven\u2019t found another e-commerce website that can compare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Companies Are Making Customers Pay for Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________President Trump\u2019s trade war is making life uncomfortable for some large American corporations, but they have found a way to reduce the pain: Pass it on to customers.The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have pushed up the prices of steel and aluminum and have raised costs for companies that make everything from cars and tractors to dishwashers. These companies face a choice. They can bear the higher costs themselves and report weaker profits, which might crater their stocks. Or they can charge more for their products, in effect making their customers bear much of the financial burden of the tariffs, at least for a while.Many companies are opting for the latter.As they report second-quarter earnings, they are going out of their way to let their shareholders know that it is customers who are paying.Caterpillar, while reporting record profits on Monday, predicted that tariffs would add as much $200 million to its costs in the second half of this year. The company added, however, that it would try to partly offset the hit by increasing the prices of its products. Whirlpool, which uses steel and aluminum in its dishwashers and washing machines, said it had hoisted its prices this year. Coca-Cola said last week that it had increased prices in the United States in part because of tariff-related cost increases.\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard for companies to pass costs through to prices for many years,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u201cThe thing about tariffs is that they make a very good excuse: Blame it on Trump.\u201dThe impact of the tariffs, and who bears their brunt, could have big implications for the wider economy. The tariffs are raising expenses at a time when companies are paying more for other materials and labor. If most of these costs are passed on to consumers, inflation, already rising after being dormant for years, could accelerate. What is more, since the metals tariffs have been in effect only since the start of June, their full impact has not been felt.And telling investors that customers will pay up does not mean they will believe you.Still, some economists say companies may be able to get away with charging more for a while longer. With the economy buoyant, there may be enough customers who can afford the increases. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, noted that a deeper dig into wage data showed strong rates of growth, and, he added, a recent survey showed that consumers appeared to be stepping up purchases of big-ticket items in anticipation of price increases.The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. But the tariffs, along with other pressures, could prompt the Fed to tap the brakes more firmly, which could spook the stock market.\u201cWe are seeing tariffs adding to classic late-cycle inflation pressures,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cThis may force the Fed to do more than the market has priced in.\u201dMuch depends on whether President Trump follows through on his proposed trade policies. To some extent, the strength of corporate earnings has bolstered America\u2019s position in its trade fights. Profit margins for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index are at their highest in many years, in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, Mr. Yardeni noted. But the longer the trade war drags on, the harder it will be for corporate America\u2019s bottom line to hold up.\u201cTrump gave companies a record profit margin, and now he might take some of that away,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

By taking inflation into account in calculating capital gains tax liabilities. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said that his department was investigating whether it could do that without congressional approval.More than 97 percent of the benefits of such a change would go to the top 10 percent of income-earners in the U.S., according to independent analyses, and nearly two-thirds to the top 0.1 percent.Advocates say it would unleash a wave of asset sales, boosting the economy. But the Congressional Research Service said in a July report that on its own, such a proposal probably wouldn\u2019t affect economic growth either way: \u201cThe additional debt incurred by indexing capital gains to inflation would most likely offset any stimulus that the smaller tax burden provided to the economy.\u201dEdmund Lee of the NYT was surprised:The lack of action by CBS was striking at a time when some media companies have swiftly removed prominent employees who were accused of misconduct.

{"Headline": "Long Dormant, Inflation Reawakens Investors\u2019 Fears", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the markets ignored inflation. Not anymore.Inflation may not be a major preoccupation \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but it\u2019s back as a real concern.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too long ago when all we were concerned about was deflation,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company. \u201cRight now, what we\u2019re seeing is a transition to a normalization of inflation.\u201dFor investors who\u2019ve been worrying more about deflation \u2014 falling prices \u2014 for the last decade, even \u201cnormal\u201d inflation may feel foreign, Mr. Smith said.Recently, inflation has definitely ticked upward. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent over 12 months through June, its biggest increase in six years. That\u2019s still below the long-term average of 3 percent. Yet a year ago, consumer prices were growing at a 1.6 percent annual rate. And 12 months before that, inflation was just 1 percent.The changes are striking even for producer prices, which reflect the wholesale cost of raw materials. The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent in June, the largest increase in more than six years.Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer for Westwood Holdings, said he wasn\u2019t necessarily worried about inflation growing out of control in the near term, because wages aren\u2019t soaring. In June, average hourly wages for all employees in private-sector nonfarm jobs rose to $26.98, a 2.7 percent increase over the last year.Still, he said it\u2019s more likely that inflation pressures will grow than shrink, \u201cespecially if you have things like tariffs come into the picture.\u201d A move away from free trade could reverse the disinflationary effects that globalization has had in recent decades, he said.So as inflation becomes part of the normal environment again, he said, \u201cinvestors should be normalizing their portfolios along with it.\u201dThat needn\u2019t entail big changes overnight.Areas that were traditionally sensitive to inflation haven\u2019t been affected much, at least not yet. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that specialize in precious metals lost 5.6 percent, on average, over the last year, according to Morningstar. And funds that specialize in real estate \u2014 which tend to rise when inflation does \u2014 returned a mere 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.But it may make sense for investors to assess their comfort with their overall mix of stocks and bonds.Mr. Smith of Haverford agreed. \u201cIf this is truly a normalization of inflation, then that would pressure fixed income more than equities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is that within whatever range for stocks that investors believe they can tolerate, they should have maximum exposure to equities.\u201dHe said investors ought to tilt their stock portfolios slightly toward economically sensitive areas of the market to ride the tailwind of economic growth that is propelling inflation. Those sectors include industrials and technology.\u201cAt the margins, we\u2019re putting a little more into playing offense, with names like Honeywell and FedEx,\u201d he said.Though Honeywell is a giant industrial conglomerate, it has been growing four times as fast as its peers in terms of earnings over the last five years, according to Zacks.com. That has been helped by Honeywell\u2019s push into industrial automation and internet connectivity.FedEx is another beneficiary of the accelerating economy in the short run as well as long-term growth \u2014 in this case, from e-commerce. But the express delivery giant could benefit from rising inflation for another reason.Historically, low inflation has usually coincided with higher valuations in the stock market, as price stability offers companies a greater margin of safety. Yet as inflation heats up, the price that investors are willing to pay for every $1 of corporate earnings has tended to fall.Since 1958, the average price/earnings ratio for stocks when the inflation rate has been 2 to 3 percent has been 17.6, according to an analysis by Charles Schwab. But once inflation is between 3 and 4 percent, P/E ratios have historically fallen nearly 10 percent.At FedEx\u2019s current price/earnings ratio of 14.3, the company\u2019s shares aren\u2019t just trading below the market average, they are at a 47 percent discount to the company\u2019s five-year average, according to Morningstar.Another strategy is to look for stocks that aren\u2019t just growing faster than inflation but that also have a track record of passing on that growth to shareholders in the form of dividends.\u201cWhat you want is to own companies that have the ability to grow their dividends in excess of the rate of inflation,\u201d Mr. Freeman of Westwood Holdings said. These so-called dividend growers can be found, he said, among companies whose profits are rising faster than the market as a whole.\u201cMicrosoft has been the poster child of that over the past decade, thanks to their steady, significant earnings growth,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. And over the last eight years, the stock\u2019s dividend payout has grown 15 percent annually.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, said investors shouldn\u2019t restrict themselves to giant companies. Mr. Paulsen said that historically, large stocks have actually thrived in periods when inflation has been slowing, not accelerating.Smaller companies, on the other hand, can often thrive in an inflationary time. \u201cSmall companies are run more lean and mean, with narrow margins,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. As a result, if their revenues were to increase because of a modest rise in prices, that would have a bigger impact on their profits than it would for much larger businesses.In the recently ended quarter, small stocks have outpaced larger ones by a wide margin. The Russell 2000 small-company index returned nearly 8 percent in the quarter, compared with 1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average, which contains big companies.The recent small-stock outperformance may derive from fears over the impact of a trade war with China on big, trade-oriented companies. Small stocks tend to be more resistant to tariffs because they are usually domestically oriented. But Mr. Paulsen said investors should not underestimate inflation\u2019s effect on this recent trend.\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the peak for small-stock outperformance was in 1983,\u201d he said, when inflation was finally being brought under control after a huge increase in the 1970s.More recently, Mr. Paulsen pointed out: \u201cThe best period for small stocks was in the early 2000s, when commodity prices were booming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There, rum became a refined drink, and its signature cocktail still thrills. What El Traguito does have is Eduardo Corona, its cantinero, or head bartender. Bald, compact, animated and wearing sunglasses even in the bar\u2019s dark, cool interior, Mr. Corona is a master craftsman, whose rapid-fire patter counterpoints the slow precision with which he makes his drinks. He is also a fierce advocate for Santiago de Cuba\u2019s underappreciated legacy as the birthplace of not just Cuban rum, but its most popular vehicle, the daiquiri.200 MilesHavanaCubaSantiago de CubaUnited StatesAtlanticOceanGulf ofMexicoCubaMexicoCaribbeanSeaBy The New York TimesSantiago\u2019s rum culture, Mr. Corona says, is as much about the relaxed pace of life, and bartending, on Cuba\u2019s Caribbean coast as it is about the history and character of the drink itself.\u201cEl Floridita prepares its drinks too quickly,\u201d Mr. Corona told me. To drive his point home, he spent the next 10 minutes making a mojito, a process that begins with a barrel stave doused in Santiago de Cuba rum, which he lights on fire; he catches the smoke in a tumbler glass, where he then builds the drink. It is refreshing, not too sweet \u2014 and delicious.People have been making rum in the Caribbean for centuries, ever since Spanish settlers imported sugar cane plants in the early 16th century. But it was not until the mid-19th century that Facundo Bacardi, a distiller in Santiago, perfected what is now regarded as the Cuban style: refined, even delicate, with none of the heavy, funky flavors of its predecessors.But bartenders in Santiago still prefer the brands produced at Bacardi\u2019s original distillery, on the northern edge of the city\u2019s downtown. These include El Caney and Santiago de Cuba, which are prized for their rich, complex flavors \u2014 and are hard to find outside the island.According to Mr. Corona and others, one secret to the Santiago distillery\u2019s high-quality rums is its enormous library of aging barrels. \u201cSome of that rum is 40, 50 even 60 years old,\u201d he said. Blenders draw from those superannuated barrels to add depth and character to much younger rums.\u201cEven the best Havana Club rums, they use some of Santiago\u2019s old stocks to round them out,\u201d Mr. Cabrera said. \u201cRum from Santiago is really good.\u201dWith those restrictions in mind, I recently flew to Cuba from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to do research for a book on the Rough Riders, the cavalry regiment led by Theodore Roosevelt that helped capture the city during the Spanish-American War in 1898. I knew that Santiago had a long history of rum making, but it turns out that the history of the war and the history of Cuban rum have deeper links than I had thought.It was a simple innovation, but the cooling cocktail was an immediate hit on the island, and quickly made its way north, bearing the beach\u2019s name. The drink was refreshing, and so was the scenery. Unlike Havana, Santiago is isolated enough that it is still largely untouched by tourists, and the crowds at the bar and down in the streets appeared to be mostly locals. Everyone, it seemed, was drinking mojitos and daiquiris, reveling in their city\u2019s open secret \u2014 one that, for just that moment, I was able to share.Advertisement"}

The average domestic stock fund did even better, rising 3.8 percent in the second quarter, led by portfolios that focus on real estate, health care, technology and consumer cyclical issues.

GrowthVulcan ValuePartners Sm CapCook & BynumUSAA TotalReturn StrategyUSA MutualsVice InvestorCGM FocusBy The New York Times | Source: MorningstarShare prices have tended to ignore announcements of new tariffs or other events that signal worsening trade relations, or else they have experienced declines that were almost immediately erased. But that could change if the outlook worsens.A report last month by Bank of America rated the odds of a prolonged trade war low, but estimated that one could knock 1.2 percentage points off economic growth over three years and add half a percentage point to the unemployment rate.It could also intensify the impact of any other \u201cconfidence shock,\u201d a large, unforeseen negative event that raises doubts about economic growth.\u201cA major global trade confrontation would likely push the U.S. and the rest of the world to the brink of recession,\u201d the report warned.An axiom of Wall Street is that markets hate uncertainty, but they seem to become desensitized to it. That may explain why harsh talk and higher tariffs have not shaken the stock market as much lately as they did earlier in the year.\u201cRising above the noise is what the market has decided to do,\u201d said Satyam Panday, chief United States economist for S&P Global. \u201cOn the trade channel, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. There really has to be a big global supply chain disruption for the market to believe it\u2019s going to be bad for corporate earnings.\u201dAs for tighter monetary policy \u2014 the other development that hit stocks several months ago and was on display in mid-June when the Fed raised rates again \u2014 investors may not like it, but they can\u2019t say there\u2019s much uncertainty about it.\u201cThe Fed has been pretty clear on policy,\u201d Mr. Panday said. It has signaled that it will raise interest rates \u201cat a slow and gradual pace, and the market has come to believe in it.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he added, \u201cthe fundamental driver of the market is growth, the labor market, consumer spending, and that\u2019s been holding up rather well.\u201dMr. Sri-Kumar is not as optimistic. If the economy is humming along \u2014 as of July 11, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model was estimating a 3.9 percent annual growth rate for economic output in the second quarter \u2014 then why, he wonders, aren\u2019t wages picking up appreciably?As for the sharp rise in earnings, he attributed it mainly to the sudden impact of the tax cut last year and not to a significant improvement in business conditions. By early next year, after earnings fully reflect the lower tax rates, earnings growth may start to decline, he said.Investors may be pleased enough with the economy and earnings to excuse a harsh backdrop on trade and a miserly Fed, at least for now, but disquieting developments overseas have arisen or worsened lately.For example, Italian elections in March led to the formation of a populist government that some fear will try to make Italy great again by leaving the European Union. That could create a debt crisis dwarfing the one centered on Greece a few years ago.More important, a departure from the union by Italy so soon after Britain voted to leave could threaten the union\u2019s viability. Yields on some European bonds have been rising in an apparent response to these problems.In addition, rising yields on Treasury bonds and a sharp rise in the dollar during the last few months are straining finances in emerging economies, many of which use dollar-denominated debt to stimulate economic growth.A rising dollar increases the value of dollar debt in local currencies, making repayment more difficult and depressing currencies further in a vicious cycle.Borrowers in the developing world are having an especially hard time acquiring dollars because so many are being used to buy the additional Treasury instruments coming on the market. The Fed is selling them to unwind years of purchases in its quantitative easing program, and the Treasury is raising money to cover the shortfall in revenues arising from the December tax bill.\u201cResources are being taken away for second- and third-tier borrowers,\u201d said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW. \u201cCentral banks have been running a buffet, putting out more food for years\u201d through quantitative easing.\u201cIn an era of quantitative tightening, they\u2019re taking away plates,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople recognize some of these folks are not going to be able to get a full meal out of what\u2019s left.\u201dJust who will suffer and how much remain to be seen.\u201cThere\u2019s greater awareness\u201d of the dilemma, Mr. Rivelle said. \u201cAre Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa isolated events, or are they systemic? The emerging perception is there\u2019s something systemic.\u201dInvesting in emerging markets in the second quarter was painful for bond and stock investors alike.Emerging market bond funds were down 4.8 percent, according to Morningstar, with ones that focus on debt denominated in local currencies falling 11.3 percent. Emerging market stock funds lost 8.9 percent.While it may be scant consolation, at least that was better return than the 10.3 percent drop of iShares MSCI Emerging Markets, a popular exchange-traded fund that specializes in the niche.Bond funds of all kinds lost 0.4 percent over all. Specialists in long-term government issues were up 0.4 percent, and high-yield funds rose 0.6 percent.Ten-year Treasury yields started the quarter at 2.74 percent, breached 3 percent for the first time since 2013, then fell back to 2.84 percent. The late decline provides another hint that economic growth may be more subdued.High-yield funds benefited from persistently tight yield spreads over Treasury debt, a condition that worries Mr. Rivelle.Spreads \u201care within spitting distance of where they were in 2006 and 2007,\u201d just before the financial crisis, he said. \u201cThe superficial explanation is default rates are quite low, but the skeptical investor is supposed to recognize a few things.\u201d They include loan terms that have become exceedingly lax and high indebtedness generally among corporate borrowers, Mr. Rivelle added.\u201cThe high-yield market is uniquely vulnerable to any economic disruption or something happening in emerging markets or Europe,\u201d he said.Despite the risks in many foreign markets, some investment advisers find more opportunities in them than in American stocks because there\u2019s more room for improvement.They carry lower valuations, and \u201ccyclically the U.S. is probably further along,\u201d said Martin Schulz, manager of the PNC International Equity fund. He meant that economic expansion and loose monetary policy may have longer to run overseas.Mr. Schulz acknowledged the political risk in countries like Italy but identified other places with healthier balances of risk and reward. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for good valuations, but also for markets that don\u2019t have the inherent risks we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d he said. In particular, he favors investments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Thailand and Singapore.Mr. Sri-Kumar also prefers foreign stock markets, but wherever you invest now, \u201cyou need to be more defensive in your approach,\u201d he said. \u201cTake money off from risk assets.\u201d He would emphasize stocks with high dividend yields, such as utilities, and the highest-quality bonds, such as Treasuries and bunds, their German equivalents.Mr. Rivelle recommends the same cautious posture as the end of the economic expansion draws closer.\u201cBe defensive, don\u2019t reach for yield, take a safe yield where you can get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more bad news to come, so a defensive mind-set is appropriate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bail After Federal Convictions Tells Prosecutors \u2018It Ain\u2019t Over\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchYogi Berra once famously said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\u201d Federal prosecutors learned the truth of that statement last month.In Mr. Stewart\u2019s case, the crucial evidence at his trial was a recording of his father speaking with a cooperating trader who had earlier pleaded guilty. In the conversation, the father recounted that Mr. Stewart had once said to him, \u201cI handed you this on a silver platter, and you didn\u2019t invest in this.\u201d The government portrayed this statement as evidence of Mr. Stewart\u2019s apparently berating his father for not taking advantage of the inside information, which was crucial to showing that there was an unlawful tip rather than just mistaken disclosure of confidential information.At the oral argument of the appeal in February, the Second Circuit was troubled by the admission of that statement. The trial judge did not allow Mr. Stewart to introduce evidence that his father had meant to say only that he could have profited from the information but did not, not that there was illegal tipping. Moreover, prosecutors refused to grant the father immunity to permit him to testify on his son\u2019s behalf, so that all the jury heard was the \u201csilver platter\u201d comment \u2014 evidence prosecutors highlighted in their closing argument.The appeals court asked for additional briefing on the issue of whether the trial judge improperly admitted the recording by not allowing Mr. Stewart to try to undermine that evidence. Ordering his release from prison is a strong indication that the court will reverse the conviction and order a new trial.Whether prosecutors would seek to retry remains to be seen. He has already served over a year in prison, and his three-year sentence was one of the longest for a defendant who did not personally profit from the trading. The Justice Department may try to work out a deal, such as a deferred prosecution agreement, that would not require another trial or additional time in prison.Mr. Johnson\u2019s case has not been argued before the Second Circuit court yet, so the issue under federal law is whether the appeal \u201craises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in\u201d reversal of the conviction or a new trial.His case involved trading ahead of a large foreign exchange transaction that HSBC conducted for Cairn Energy to convert $3.5 billion into British pounds. A trade of that size would most likely push up the value of the pound, and Mr. Johnson was convicted of using the confidential client information to trade profitably in the days ahead of the transaction.The defense sought bail on the ground that the prosecution was \u201ccompletely unprecedented.\u201d The government claimed Mr. Johnson had misappropriated client information to defraud it. But the defense argued that HSBC had been acting only under a contract, and that Cairn had received the full benefit of the trade it negotiated. That the bank made a small profit of about $7 million was largely irrelevant, the defense claims.The Cairn trade also involved a sophisticated client, and Mr. Johnson argues that the company knew HSBC would have to trade ahead of it to be able to amass enough pounds to complete the deal and would profit off its trades. Even if he was not entirely aboveboard with the company, that might not rise to the level of wire fraud if the client got the benefit of the agreement it negotiated.Unlike Mr. Stewart\u2019s case, Mr. Johnson\u2019s release signals only that the appeals court views his argument as having enough substance to allow him to go free until a final decision. But the Second Circuit court has questioned recently whether aggressive fraud prosecutions involving sophisticated parties are pushing the limits of the law too far by turning sharp business practices into federal crimes.Granting bail during an appeal is uncommon. It shows that the appeals court is taking the case seriously and giving at least some credence to the defendant\u2019s argument. If nothing else, that provides a ray of hope in a system in which the vast majority of criminal appeals are rejected.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Nasdaq for Sneakerheads? E-Commerce Site Aims to Tame \u2018Chaos\u2019 of Luxury Market", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 Standing among more than 350 pairs of sneakers in his converted attic, Josh Luber, a self-proclaimed \u201csneakerhead,\u201d held a pair of nearly identical Nike Air Jordan IVs in each hand. He eyed them as if they were rare biological specimens.One was a standard model of the shoe that typically sells on secondary markets for $160; the other was an ultrarare model designed by the rapper Eminem that can fetch more than $20,000.\u201cThis is the sneaker industry right here,\u201d he said, referring to how brands use scarcity and buzz to drive up prices in secondary markets and create brand cachet.So Mr. Luber, the company\u2019s chief executive, and his co-founders, including Dan Gilbert, the billionaire founder of Quicken Loans, came up with what they believe to be an elegant solution to determine the value of high-end goods: Treat them as if they were stocks.On StockX, products, which include streetwear, handbags and watches in addition to sneakers, are assigned ticker symbols. Sellers put out asking prices, and buyers bid. Users can see data like recent sale figures from across the internet, price volatility, and 52-week highs and lows. Once a bid and an ask coincide, the sale is automatically made.Niche marketplaces for high-end goods are not new: Before sneakerheads connected on the internet, there were consignment shops reselling shoes and stores that specialized in just one brand of watches. But when people have access to hard data on how a product is selling across the market, they can best understand its true value, which has the potential to bring down prices, Mr. Luber argued.His goal is to work directly with retailers and have products open on StockX in an initial public offering of sorts. He said that this would provide more pricing stability, and that allowing average consumers access when new products were released could help brands expand their customer bases.\u201cBrands love the fact that, \u2018Oh, yeah, people waited three days outside of the store to get my product,\u2019\u201d Mr. Luber said of traditional product releases. \u201cOur whole idea is, \u2018Look, there\u2019s just a different way to benefit from that that adds order to it.\u2019\u201dOnstage, Mr. Luber, 40, teased the 56-year-old Mr. Gilbert, wearing a pair of brown hiking boots, like a son poking fun at his decidedly unhip father. Three years as business partners, \u201cand I still can\u2019t get you to wear a pair of sneakers,\u201d Mr. Luber said.Mr. Luber, who, like many sneakerheads, speaks of his footwear collection as if it were an ever-expanding portfolio, started collecting at age 10. In 2012, while an analyst at IBM, he founded Campless, a website he described as the Kelley Blue Book for sneakers. When he met with brand representatives, he would describe his dream of a marketplace that treated sneakers as if they were assets. Companies were interested in his data but uninterested in overhauling their sale process.In April 2015, Mr. Luber was summoned to a meeting with Mr. Gilbert, who had started an in-house incubator and was exploring new business ideas. Mr. Gilbert was intrigued by the idea of a stock-market model for e-commerce and, as the father of a teenage sneakerhead, was convinced that sneakers were a perfect starting point to test the concept.To protect against knockoffs, sellers ship purchased products to StockX, which authenticates the items and sends them to buyers by day\u2019s end, similar to services provided by other high-end marketplaces. StockX takes a 9.5 percent commission on each sale.Since starting in February 2016, StockX has grown to more than 10,000 transactions per day. It has added nearly 170 of its more than 370 employees since the end of April.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from zero to $700 million in sales in two years, and most of the world doesn\u2019t even know this exists,\u201d said Greg Schwartz, 37, a co-founder and now the company\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cThis then becomes true commodities trading,\u201d Mr. Luber said. It\u2019s not dissimilar from trading oil futures, he said. In fact, because the items were resold without physically changing hands, StockX worried the shoes might be considered futures and \u201cspent a lot of time talking to lawyers making sure we weren\u2019t running afoul of any securities laws,\u201d Mr. Luber said.With a billionaire co-founder, capital has not been an issue, but StockX has still sought out investors who Mr. Schwartz said \u201cprovide outside value\u201d or cultural cachet: Eminem and his manager, Paul Rosenberg; the actor Mark Wahlberg; Scooter Braun, Justin Bieber\u2019s manager; and Steve Case and Tim Armstrong, former chief executives of AOL.Noting that AOL aimed to give more Americans access to the internet, Mr. Case said StockX was similarly centered on giving average consumers access to scarce luxury goods, which are often scooped up by insiders. There\u2019s no guarantee those consumers will be able to afford the items, but the prices will at least be fairer, he said.StockX has two authentication centers and more than 100 authenticators, who go through a 90-day training course. As the authenticators receive items, the details of the product and the sale are available on a computer screen at their station. Once they have performed all the steps in the authentication \u2014 which can include smelling the shoe \u2014 a shipping label is printed and the seller is automatically paid.When StockX started, Mr. Luber personally authenticated sneakers in a room of the office before taking them downstairs to be shipped. \u201cAnd then if the freight elevator would break down for the day, we\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, our whole business is done,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schwartz recalled with a laugh.But Mr. Luber said the business wasn\u2019t just an excuse to play with sneakers.\u201cEveryone feels like it\u2019s impossible to get a pair of Off-White Jordans for retail\u201d unless you have insider connections, Mr. Luber said, adding: \u201cThere was a reason the Foot Locker manager\u2019s brother won the raffle every time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How about a revival of \u201cCobra\u201d (1984), one of his most famous so-called game pieces? This collaborative work \u2014 based on some set rules regarding cue cards, hats and headbands \u2014 involves a \u201cprompter\u201d (who holds all those cards), as well as improvising musicians who can \u201cpitch\u201d various possibilities.The anarchy of \u201cCobra\u201d can suffer a bit on recordings. It\u2019s far easier to appreciate the piece in a live setting, as you watch Mr. Zorn place and remove his hat, or excitedly point at subsections of performers. Yet the group of 12 female musicians who performed it on Saturday created such a memorable squall that it might communicate just as well over headphones.The veteran electric harpist Zeena Parkins was often a key agent in the swirl: sometimes using a whammy bar on her idiosyncratic instrument as part of a punkish tutti section, or else providing shimmering textures alongside vibraphone work by Sae Hashimoto.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How It Got Riskier to Own High-Quality Corporate Bonds", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBonds issued by United States companies with strong balance sheets have been delivering the weakest returns of all major American bond categories this year, adding to the headaches of fixed-income investors.There have been plenty of problems affecting all bonds. Rising interest rates pushed yields higher and bond prices lower.So far, higher yields have not offset the declines in bond prices. (Total return in a bond fund is the combination of a portfolio\u2019s yield and the changes to the price of its bonds.)Even junk funds, which invest in bonds issued by companies on shakier financial footing, managed to lose less than 0.2 percent on average in the first half of the year.\u201cThe way we are framing this for clients right now is that if you are investing in investment-grade corporate bonds, you are likely taking on more credit and interest rate risk than you think,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.That interest rate risk results from the decision by many companies to exploit the low interest rates created by the Federal Reserve after the financial crisis by borrowing heavily, locking in those rates for a long time.The $6 trillion in investment-grade bonds issued in the last five calendar years is 55 percent higher than the borrowing in the five years before the financial crisis. The average maturity of investment-grade bonds issued last year was 15.3 years, down from the high of 17 years in 2015, but still higher than the 13.6 years average of a decade ago.The longer a bond\u2019s maturity, the greater its price drop when interest rates rise, as has happened in 2018. This relationship can be understood through a bond statistic called duration: an estimate of how a fund\u2019s price will change for every 1 percentage point change in interest rates. For instance, a fund with a five-year duration would experience a 5 percent price drop when rates rise one percentage point.The duration of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is now stretched to 5.9 years. The Bloomberg Barclays index of high-grade corporate bonds is even more rate sensitive, with a duration of 7.3 years.While longer bonds are at the heart of recent underperformance, rates are not expected to climb much more this year, which could give a second-half boost to total returns.And the corporate bond market is not yet pricing in a possible recession. \u201cWe are later in the game, but the innings are longer,\u201d said Mary Ellen Stanek, chief investment officer of Baird Advisors, and co-manager of Baird\u2019s suite of bond funds. \u201cWe are now in the second-longest post-World War II economic cycle, with no end in sight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty smart that they have issued a lot of long-term debt at very low interest rates,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cI am not saying they are completely insulated from rising interest rates, but it has been good financial management.\u201dThe other noteworthy shift in investment-grade corporate bonds is a deterioration in overall quality. In 2007, 27 percent of the total value of bonds issued by companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were rated BBB, the lowest rung of investment grade. Today, 50 percent of the market value of S.&P. 500 bonds have that rating.Mariarosa Verde, senior credit officer at the bond-rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Services, said the ratings slide is, for the most part, a result of corporate intent. Companies that once had sterling ratings are \u201cstrategically deciding to take on more leverage,\u201d she said, perhaps to finance a merger or acquisition.Bayer, CVS, General Mills and AT&T are among the deal makers whose investment-grade bond ratings have fallen as they have borrowed more.When bonds are downgraded because of purposeful corporate borrowing, it \u201ccan be a good time to invest,\u201d Ms. Emery said, assuming a company has the will and the cash flow to repay that debt and crawl back up the rating ladder. That value-seeking approach helped Dodge & Cox Income to earn a 4.9 percent annualized return over the last 10 years. That was one percentage point ahead of the benchmark aggregate index.Nonetheless, the bulge of BBB bonds could be a recipe for more volatility at the next downturn. According to Moody\u2019s, in a recession year, 10 percent of investment-grade bonds at that lowest investment-grade tier become fallen angels, the industry term for bonds downgraded to junk status. \u201cIn the next recession, there will be more investment-grade companies at risk of becoming fallen angels than at any other time in the past,\u201d Ms. Verde said.That could hit index funds hardest. Once a bond is booted from investment grade down to high yield, high-grade indexes \u2014 and the funds that track them \u2014 are typically required to dispose of the bond promptly, forcing funds to sell when prices have fallen. Actively managed funds are not typically bound by such a strict sell rule.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Elden, Innovative Hedge Fund Investor, Is Dead at 84", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRichard Elden, a journalist-turned-investment manager who was an early investor in a number of notable hedge funds, died on June 27 at his home in Chicago. He was 84.The cause was metastatic melanoma, his son, Tom, said.The previous two years had been rough for the stock market. And Mr. Elden, as an analyst for the Chicago brokerage and investment bank A. G. Becker & Company at the time, had become intrigued by the notion that high returns \u2014 with relatively low exposure to the ups and downs of the broader market \u2014 could be achieved by using strategies that involved non-stock investments in options markets.\u201cHe was producing better absolute returns and, more importantly, better risk-adjusted returns than investing in a good portfolio of stocks,\u201d Mr. Elden said of Professor Thorp in a 2014 article published in Institutional Investor.In its early years, Grosvenor focused on placing clients\u2019 money in investments similar to those described in Professor Thorp\u2019s book. But rather than invest solely in a single fund, Mr. Elden decided to parcel out investments among a number of funds, similar to the diversification strategies that came to be known as modern portfolio theory.That approach essentially marked the start of the American fund-of-funds industry.Funds-of-funds are essentially hedge funds that try to manage risk by diversifying their investments in a number of other hedge funds. While such an approach had been taken by funds in Europe, Grosvenor Partners is widely considered the first American fund-of-funds.\u201cThe idea was to have some diversification in terms of manager and strategy and have a portfolio of investments like this, instead of investing in the stock market, which was more challenging,\u201d Tom Elden said.That search for diversification, and a career that spanned virtually the entire history of the hedge fund industry, brought Mr. Elden into contact with some of the world\u2019s most prominent hedge fund managers, including Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, Michael Steinhardt of Steinhardt Partners and the well-known activist investor Carl Icahn.In 1998, the Connecticut-based company Value Asset Management bought a majority stake in Grosvenor. Mr. Elden left Grosvenor in 2005, when the fund was managing $13.4 billion, according to a statement from his family. Today the firm has roughly $50 billion in assets under management.Besides his son, Mr. Elden is survived by his wife of 57 years, Gail; his daughter, Cindy Elden; and his sister, Joan Feitler.Richard Elden was born on Aug. 2, 1933, in Chicago. His father, Abe, worked in the financial division of Esquire Inc., the media company best known for its men\u2019s magazines. His mother, Vera, was a homemaker and the sister of David Smart, Esquire\u2019s publisher.Mr. Elden worked on the student newspaper at Northwestern University, where he studied political science. In 1953 he traveled to the Soviet Union with other student journalists and wrote articles about the journey.After his graduation in 1956, those articles helped him obtain reporting positions at the International News Service, which merged with United Press in 1958, as well as with the now-defunct City News Bureau of Chicago and The Chicago Sun-Times, where he worked as a business reporter. He attended business school at the University of Chicago, receiving a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1966.Mr. Elden was working as a financial analyst for a division of IBM that published educational materials when he was approached by a friend who appreciated Mr. Elden\u2019s reporter\u2019s instincts. The friend asked him to join A. G. Becker as an investment analyst with the job of scouring the markets for investment opportunities for the firm\u2019s clients.Throughout his career, Mr. Elden, a lifelong Chicago resident with a penchant for horn-rimmed glasses and bow ties, often referred to his reporting background as an ideal training ground.\u201cEssentially I\u2019ve been a reporter for 55 years, the last 38 applying my reporting skills to checking out money managers,\u201d he was quoted as saying in \u201cTop Hedge Fund Investors: Stories, Strategies, and Advice\u201d (2010), by Cathleen M. Rittereiser and Lawrence E. Kochard. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just an extension of reporting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pursuit of $1 Trillion: Amazon Closes In on Apple", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer.Amazon\u2019s market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple\u2019s market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006.Investors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple\u2019s.But Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon\u2019s move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon\u2019s gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon\u2019s increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.By comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company\u2019s market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday\u2019s close.Amazon\u2019s time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion.Apple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race.Advertisement"}

Its name entered Western history around 1699, in a grammar of the Kapampangan language of the Philippines written by a Spanish missionary, who defined it, briefly, as \u201cto cook with vinegar,\u201d giving no hint of its splendor.In its earliest form, it was simply unripened fruit, doused with vinegar to make it sourer yet, and used as a palliative for morning sickness. Over time, meat supplanted fruit, and in the late 1960s, a street vendor in Angeles City started making sisig with pig face, hacked with two cleavers into a merry hash and blackened in a hot skillet with onions, chiles, vinegar and a squeeze of calamansi (an indigenous citrus that out-stings lime). Now sisig numbers among the world\u2019s greatest foods to eat with beer, a sip and a bite, one consolation after another.Arcs of red onion gleam, while chiles lay low. Where cooks in the Philippines sometimes rely on pig brains to give the dish body, here the secret is cream. There\u2019s a trickle of vinegar and lemon in lieu of calamansi, but salt is in ascendance. Eating sisig leaves you parched and depleted, and still you can\u2019t stop.In sisig baboy, the chef, Carmen Sta Maria (pronounced Santa Maria), foregoes the usual pig ears, jowl and snout for pork belly and crumbled chicharr\u00f3n, to evoke the crunch, if not the chewiness, of cartilage. Better yet are versions featuring pusit (squid), so thoroughly broken down, it\u2019s impossible to distinguish arm from mantle, but tender and distinctly marine; bangus (milkfish), light and ready to flake; and tuna, rich and verging on beefy.Ms. Sta Maria, known as Aming, grew up in the Bicol region of the Philippines. She had never cooked professionally when she and her husband, Sam, the Bronx-born son of Filipino immigrants, opened the first Mama Fina\u2019s in New Jersey 14 years ago. In fact, she had hardly cooked at all before arriving in the United States in 2000. Missing the food of home, she consulted her mother, Delfina Dolor \u2014 Mama Fina \u2014 for recipes and carefully replicated each one.Her flavors are strong but balanced, as in sinigang, a soup suffused with tamarind to deliver an edifying sourness, and beef a lo pobre, so-called pauper\u2019s steak, a broad plank of Angus rib-eye anointed with the most minimal seasonings and tasting of plenty.Her food deserves a warmer space than this slightly unwieldy dining room that calls to mind a tavern. Orders are placed at the cash register up front, then brought to you. As the night gets busier, the time between dishes expands.Absent from the table is the typical battalion of condiments that Filipino diners use to recalibrate each dish to their taste. One exception \u2014 presented alongside kare-kare, an oxtail stew velvety with house-made peanut butter \u2014 is bagoong alamang (fermented shrimp paste), unsparing in funk. \u201cI don\u2019t eat it myself,\u201d Mr. Sta Maria said. \u201cBut if we run out, some customers really notice.\u201dAt the meal\u2019s end, there is showy halo-halo, made with a spill of evaporated milk over shattered ice and crowned with ube (purple yam) ice cream and house-made ube halaya (jam). You dive for treasure in the depths: jackfruit, pandan jelly, sweet beans and koang, translucent palm seeds with the butteriness of macadamia nuts.But I loved best leche flan, a small plateau of custard that sways gently at the touch, under a veil of caramel. Ms. Sta Maria lets the caramel go further than usual, closer to the edge of burned. In a lesser hand, it could easily tip into bitterness. Instead, it\u2019s better than sweet; it\u2019s dark and deep, and I am still dreaming of it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Troubles for Ford, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler Send Shares Diving", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy may be humming, but for American car companies, the year is looking less bright.All of Detroit\u2019s Big 3 automakers issued downward revisions on Wednesday in their financial forecasts for the year, with each highlighting rising commodities costs that stem in part from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The adjustments, made as the companies announced their second-quarter earnings, sent their shares down sharply.Ford Motor recorded the worst showing of the three, as net income fell by nearly half to $1.1 billion from the same period ago. Aside from higher materials costs, Ford is struggling in Europe, South America and especially China, where it has spent heavily in recent years to expand but made just $3 million in the quarter and has watched its sales fall.\u201cThe deterioration in this important global market has been swift,\u201d Jim Farley, Ford executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a conference call. He said Ford\u2019s joint ventures in China suffered from uncompetitive costs, weak dealer networks and a shortage of sport-utility vehicles in its model line. Ford is now \u201ctaking urgent action,\u201d although its troubles will linger, he said.Casting a further cloud over the company was news it was postponing a daylong meeting with analysts scheduled for September, when Ford was supposed to detail the turnaround plan of its chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was hired in May 2017 to reinvigorate Ford, but the lack of details on Ford\u2019s plans have frustrated some analysts.\u201cThe postponement of the capital markets day is a pretty big deal, Jim,\u201d Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said on the call. In an unusually blunt question, he then wondered about Mr. Hackett\u2019s future with Ford.\u201cWill you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?\u201d Mr. Jonas asked.After replying at some length about the progress he felt the company had made, Mr. Hackett concluded by saying: \u201cAnd hell, yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we\u2019re going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.\u201dFord delivered its news after the stock market close. In after-hours trading, its shares fell about 4 percent.General Motors and Fiat Chrysler both reported their earnings before the market opened. G.M. shares ended the day off 4.6 percent, and Fiat Chrysler was down 11.8 percent.The companies\u2019 references to commodities prices signaled that the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and trade policies were already hurting auto company profits and might yet worsen their situations, said Efraim Levy, a stock analyst at CFRA Research.\u201cIt\u2019s been a bad day for auto stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cCommodities and tariffs and their interrelationship are weighing. It\u2019s the big picture that\u2019s hitting the outlook.\u201dOn a conference call, Mary Barra, the G.M. chief executive, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to have a strong U.S. auto industry, a big provider of quality jobs.\u201d The company, she added, is \u201cmaking sure we spend a lot of time with the administration\u201d so that decisions \u201caren\u2019t made that have unintended consequences.\u201dIn its earnings report, G.M. said it now expected adjusted earnings of about $6 per share for 2018. Earlier this year, it forecast earnings in line with last year\u2019s figure, which was $6.62.\u201cNot overly concerned today, but we obviously need to keep an eye on commodity prices as we move into 2019,\u201d Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief financial officer, Richard K. Palmer, said in a conference call.Fiat Chrysler now expects adjusted pretax profit of 7.5 billion to 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion to $9.4 billion), a drop of up to 14 percent from the \u20ac8.7 billion it forecast on June 1, reflecting how rapidly conditions in the industry have changed.The company has been lagging behind its rivals in China, and on Wednesday its new chief executive, Mike Manley, blamed several factors: its dealer network, its marketing and growing competition from Chinese brands. \u201cSo there are certainly a combination of things that we need to fix,\u201d he said. \u201cThat process has started.\u201dFiat Chrysler has said it is making contingency plans to reduce the impact of tariffs, while BMW has already said it will shift some production from its plant in South Carolina to avoid any retaliatory tariffs other countries could levy on vehicles exported from the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From the Poker Table to Wall Street", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTPORT, Conn. \u2014 There is almost nothing on Vanessa Selbst\u2019s tidy, unadorned desk on the second floor of this suburban office building that would suggest its occupant is the most successful female player in the history of professional poker except, perhaps, a neat stack of $5 bills to the left of her three monitors.That\u2019s a collection she has taken from her colleagues at Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund where Ms. Selbst has worked since last fall, for a gambling guessing game she has introduced to the office on the arguable premise that it somehow might help sharpen their strategic acuity.For a 34-year-old whose nights and days used to be consumed by endless hours grinding at felt tables in casinos from Barcelona to Melbourne, it is evidence that she really can find action anywhere. \u201cI do try to get people gambling as often as I can,\u201d Ms. Selbst said, chuckling.Her bosses at Bridgewater clearly don\u2019t mind; a faux-hawk-sporting poker champ with a Yale law degree probably makes perfect sense for a firm guided by Ray Dalio, Bridgewater\u2019s chief executive, and his philosophy of assembling teams of disparate, iconoclastic people and seeing what happens.Ms. Selbst\u2019s decision to shed her PokerStars hoodie and submit to a 9-to-5 routine in suburban Connecticut is, in many ways, just another surprising choice for a woman known for making unconventional calls.After all, she first came to the notice of the wider poker world in 2006 for a disastrous bluff at her first final table of a World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas. (She went all in with a 5 and a 2 against, it turned out, a pair of aces.) She eventually won $101,000 and seventh place in that contest, but that bust gained her a reputation \u2014 bolstered later by several other awe-inspiringly successful or horrifically failed bluffs now central to her YouTube fame \u2014 as a reckless aggressor.\u201cI\u2019m also anticapitalist at heart,\u201d she added, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t really fit in with my values, I guess.\u201dNow, she said in an interview, she sees it both as a more stable lifestyle as she and her wife expect their first child in October and as an intellectually stimulating challenge.But even more than that, Ms. Selbst said, it\u2019s a means to an end, that end being making as much money as she can as quickly as she can to help finance the progressive causes she supports. She has long been an active philanthropist; her charitable foundation, Venture Justice, for instance, pays for a two-year fellowship for a lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund through a program organized by Equal Justice Works. She has also raised $500,000 for the Urban Justice Center via an annual charity poker tournament and served for a time on that organization\u2019s board.\u201cAm I going and working with clients in prison? No, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re investing money and we\u2019re making money, and that\u2019s important,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who earned her law degree in 2012 and worked part time in recent years for a police-misconduct litigation firm. \u201cHopefully, if I\u2019m good at this and I do well, then that\u2019s probably the most efficient way for me to support the causes that I care about.\u201dMs. Selbst\u2019s pivot also reflects her gimlet-eyed view of poker today.In the early 2000s, she was among the flood of players inspired to play by the 1998 film \u201cRounders\u201d and the out-of-nowhere $2.5 million World Series of Poker championship win in 2003 by a Tennessee accountant and online player, Chris Moneymaker. (Yes, his real name.) Curious, Ms. Selbst started playing online and built her account up to $150,000 by the time she graduated from Yale with a political science degree.After graduation, she worked as a management consultant in the New York office of McKinsey & Company, but the cards kept calling her back.\u201cI was playing poker for one-third the amount of time and making three times as much money,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who splits her time between the Brooklyn home she shares with her wife and a Westport residence near the Bridgewater offices. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve got to give this a shot.\u2019\u201dFor elite poker players, it was a golden age. Ms. Selbst found it easy to reliably haul in $500,000 in profit annually \u2014 and often a lot more. More recently, though, an industry of instructional videos and books on how to win has fueled a steep rise in good players even as the available money has remained the same.\u201cYou have no job security, no health insurance. You\u2019re traveling constantly. You have no stability in terms of your life,\u201d Ms. Selbst explained. \u201cAnd there are huge swings because if more people now have a chance to win, it\u2019s very easy to have a losing year.\u201dThe lifestyle was also hard on her wife, Miranda Selbst, who oversees a joint venture between the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Department of Education to improve learning at low-achieving elementary schools.\u201cA lot of poker spouses are put in the awkward position of having to give up their passions to just support this other person,\u201d Miranda Selbst, 37, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain to your friends at home who have 9-to-5 jobs and think you are on vacation all the time. People don\u2019t really know how lonely and boring that can feel.\u201dVanessa Selbst was introduced to Bridgewater by a pro-poker friend, Galen Hall, who left the circuit in 2011 to earn an M.B.A. at Stanford before the hedge firm hired him. As Ms. Selbst expressed frustrations with both poker and her ability to effectuate more good in the world, Mr. Hall urged her to visit Bridgewater.\u201cIf something\u2019s undervalued, does that mean you want to buy? Well, maybe, but if you buy it, how\u2019s it going to go up? Who are the other people who are going to buy? What are they thinking about? What\u2019s their motivations?\u201d she said, offering an analysis that could fit either an investment or a poker hand. \u201cYou have to be thinking about who the other players are and what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dFor now, Ms. Selbst is far too junior at Bridgewater to have a pivotal role in big decisions. She admitted, too, to having struggled through the firm\u2019s intensive nine-month crash course on economics and the company\u2019s trading philosophy. Her poker success relied largely on exploiting a personal image of being intimidating and terse; at Bridgewater, she discovered, she must be approachable and collaborative.\u201cIt was really hard initially, and I wasn\u2019t doing well at all, so it was less about wanting to be the star and more just not being used to doing poorly at something,\u201d she said. \u201cMy defensive mechanism kicked in, and so then people were like, \u2018You\u2019re really defensive.\u2019\u201dAt Bridgewater, she said, she has learned to tame that, but her more obstinate persona re-emerged this month when she was mocked for busting on a wild bluff the first day of the World Series of Poker\u2019s $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold \u2019Em Main Event in Las Vegas. (Despite her retirement, Ms. Selbst intends to play in occasional high-profile tournaments.)Mr. Hall, 32, pointed to Ms. Selbst\u2019s counterintuitive play the day before in explaining why she\u2019ll do well in her new job.\u201cHere\u2019s somebody who has won a ton of poker tournaments, so obviously she knows what the standard play is, but she does something different and you say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 instead of taking five seconds to think about what this hyper-intelligent, hyper-successful person is doing,\u201d he said of her critics. \u201cAt Bridgewater, what\u2019s really valuable is people who can think extremely independently.\u201dMs. Selbst expressed relief \u201cthat this is not my life anymore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very insular world,\u201d she said of poker. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to come back and play and see people, but it\u2019s also really nice to know I have somewhere else to get back to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Themes to Follow as Corporate America Reports a Surge in Profits", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarnings season is upon us once again, and analysts expect the strong economy and the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts to lead to another batch of knockout quarterly profits.Per-share earnings at companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index are forecast to have risen 20.8 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. That would be the second straight quarter of 20-percent-plus jumps, something that hasn\u2019t happened since late 2010.Tax cuts aren\u2019t responsible for all of that growth. Measures of sales, which are closely tied to the health of the economy, are also expected to rise at a robust 9 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by the data provider FactSet through Friday.Despite those leaps in sales and profit, the S. & P. 500 remains below the highs it hit in late January. Earnings reports look backward, and what really matters to investors is what lies ahead. These days that means companies have to consider a growing trade conflict and rising interest rates, wages, commodity prices and other costs that are clouding the economic outlook.Just which of these worries is front of mind is something that investors will try to divine from executives\u2019 assessments of earnings. Here are some key themes that could emerge.So far the Trump administration\u2019s trade war hasn\u2019t sunk the stock market, as many had predicted it would. Sure, there are pockets of trouble. Shares of the construction equipment company Caterpillar have struggled in part because the firm is considered doubly vulnerable to trade tensions; more than 50 percent of Caterpillar\u2019s sales last year came from outside North America. The company is also a large consumer of steel, which has risen in price thanks, in part, to Trump administration tariffs on imports.And some businesses are doing O.K. Shares of small companies, which tend to sell most of their products domestically, have performed well.But analysts and investors will pay attention for other indications that the expanding trade war is starting to delay plans for corporate spending. It hasn\u2019t materialized yet, executives say.\u201cIt is not at this point causing them to change the strategic actions and decisions that they\u2019re making,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s largest bank by assets, said on the bank\u2019s post-earnings call this month.With the economic expansion in its ninth year \u2014 the second-longest stretch of growth on record \u2014 a burst of corporate investment will be a key to keeping the streak alive. Key provisions of the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul were designed to provoke such a spending boom on new factories and equipment.In the first quarter, there was a solid uptick in business investment. Whether it\u2019s because of the tax bill or unrelated developments \u2014 such as the rebound in oil and gas prices \u2014 is a matter of some debate.\u201cWe are not yet seeing what I would call a lot of traditional capex spending occurring,\u201d Curtis Farmer, president of the midsize lender Comerica, told analysts on a conference call last Tuesday.When companies have cash to spend but are not willing to commit to big investments, they often buy up their own stock instead. A surge of buybacks, another byproduct of the tax-bill windfall, helped shore up the stock market earlier this year. When companies buy back shares, they cut the number of shares outstanding, raising earnings per share.The case for a buyback is that this can help push a stock price higher, and investors tend to applaud. Shares of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway jumped about 5 percent on Wednesday, after the company said it had removed a limit on share repurchases.Buybacks have their critics, too, who deride them as financial engineering that benefits only shareholders in the short run. Spending that money on new equipment or a factory might create jobs for the workers who will build a factory, say, and those who will be employed in it, and add to profits over the long term.In earnings updates, investors can often gauge the pace of corporate repurchases. If a company\u2019s shares have performed only modestly despite a binge of buybacks, that could mean investors\u2019 view of the stock is more pessimistic than the price might reflect.Wage growth is a key factor in the United States economy, as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. At the same time, for investors, wage growth isn\u2019t always positive. Rising labor costs can cut into profits, muting the impact of a robust economy. In some sectors, that seems to be happening.The trucking firm J. B. Hunt Transport Services reported better-than-expected profits last week. But its shares slid after the company cited \u201cdriver pay and retention costs\u201d and \u201cdriver recruiting costs\u201d as some of the outlays that nibbled away at the benefits of higher prices and booming volumes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ask Putin About the Nerve Agents", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1973 in Shikhany 1, a secret Russian military nerve gas laboratory near the city of Volsk on the Volga River, two scientists developed a nerve gas many times more powerful than any the world had seen. They called it Novichok, which means newcomer.In March of this year, experts in Britain said the nerve agent used to poison Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, and his daughter Yulia in the quiet English town of Salisbury was Novichok. Both were placed in intensive care and survived. Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the poison came from Russia.Then on July 4, Novichok was back in the news, with a new and deadly layer of mystery. A man and a woman who had visited Salisbury were stricken in nearby Amesbury. The victims were identified as Dawn Sturgess, 44, who died last Sunday, and her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, 45, who was hospitalized in critical condition. The police opened a murder investigation, and by Wednesday, Mr. Rowley\u2019s condition had improved to serious but stable, allowing him to speak with investigators.It was apparent that the pair, unlike Mr. Skripal, had not been targeted and had no connection to intelligence or espionage. The mystery was how and where they were exposed to Novichok four months after the Skripals. Friends said Mr. Rowley was a \u201cskip diver,\u201d someone who searched dumpsters for valuables. In London, the Metropolitan Police said that tests of samples from the pair showed that \u201cthey were exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated item.\u201d Mr. Rowley may have touched or brought back an object that Mr. Skripal\u2019s would-be assassin disposed of in a trash bin.Both Novichok poisonings pointed to Russia, the only country known to have made and stored it. The Russians have denied any role, suggesting darkly that some other group may have poisoned the Skripals \u2014 an absurd claim given how difficult and dangerous it is to make, store and use Novichok. While the Russians had a motive to attack Mr. Skripal, it was perhaps out of carelessness that they also sickened the two more recent victims, one of them mortally.Russia must be pressed to declare and destroy its stock of Novichok as required under the international Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia has been a signatory since 1997. At the planned meeting of President Trump and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, Mr. Trump should push Mr. Putin to comply with the convention.Not only have the Russians refused to take responsibility for the attacks in Britain, they also have denied knowing anything about Novichok. For decades, Moscow has concealed its lethal existence from the world. Almost all nations, including Russia and the United States, have signed the convention, which requires the signatories to disclose and destroy all stocks of such weapons.Russia has said it destroyed almost 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons under the treaty, including sarin and VX. But Novichok was conspicuously absent.According to Vil Mirzayanov, a scientist who worked in the nerve gas program, Novichok is colorless and, as far as anyone knows, odorless. \u201cIf you smell it, you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said. \u201cSo no one knows if it smells. It is basically invisible.\u201dThe amount of Novichok stockpiled in Russia is unknown, but even the 1,000 tons believed to have been initially produced in the 1970s would be enough to kill several hundred thousand people, Mr. Mirzyanov said.Nerve agents like Novichok kill by blocking an enzyme that controls the body\u2019s nervous system, including the brain, breathing and muscles. Victims generally die of asphyxiation.In 1995, Mr. Skripal, then a Russian military intelligence officer, began secretly spying for Britain. He was caught and convicted in Russia a decade later but in 2010 was freed in a spy trade along with three other Russians held by Moscow, in exchange for 10 Russians caught posing as Americans in the United States.The Skripals apparently thought they were safe, living years later in a quiet rural town in England. But at the time of the spy trade, Mr. Putin warned that \u201ctraitors\u201d would come to a bad end. \u201cTraitors will kick the bucket,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me. These people betrayed their friends, their brothers in arms. Whatever they got in exchange, those 30 pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them.\u201d It was a chilling warning.In the worldwide reaction to the poisoning of Mr. Skripal, the United States and many other Western countries expelled dozens of Russian diplomats. In turn, Moscow expelled similar numbers of American officials. The resulting tension reached a level not seen since the height of the Cold War.The assault on the Skripals echoed the murder in London in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of President Putin who had been an officer in the F.S.B., a successor to the K.G.B. He was killed with radioactive polonium-210 in a cup of tea that he drank while with a known Russian intelligence agent. It was widely believed that the substance could have come only from a Russian government laboratory.Russia\u2019s hidden arsenal of Novichok makes a mockery of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There is no evident way for the world to control the deadly nerve gas, since Russia has never admitted it has it. If Novichok was unleashed in a war, the casualties could be enormous.Nerve gas is a weapon of mass destruction. It receives far less attention than nuclear proliferation. But like nuclear weapons, it is designed to kill. And it is clear from the attempted murder of the former spy in Britain and the latest deadly episode that the threat is real.David Wise, an intelligence historian, is the author, most recently, of \u201cTiger Trap: American\u2019s Secret Spy War With China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Should Be Thriving Right Now. They Aren\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseHighly paid hedge fund managers have complained for years that it\u2019s unfair to compare their performance with the broad stock market during prolonged bullish periods. Hedge funds are designed to mitigate risk, the argument goes, and so investors in them might sacrifice some gains as markets rise while waiting for hedge funds to prove themselves in more challenging times.Those times would seem to have arrived.So far this year, stock markets have delivered weak returns, bond markets have turned in negative performances, and everything is much more volatile \u2014 just the environment that many hedge funds say they\u2019ve been waiting for.That\u2019s because most stock-investing hedge funds can bet against particular shares, rather than just making bullish bets like mutual funds, and thus can profit even in flat or down markets. And hedge funds that wager on things like bonds, currencies and the likelihood of corporate mergers boast that their performances are unconnected to the stock markets and can rise in bull and bear markets alike.The results for the first six months are now in \u2014 and they shatter the myth of hedge funds thriving in turbulent markets.Hedge funds, on average, underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index yet again. An index of hedge fund performance, calculated by the research firm HFR, gained just 0.81 percent in the first half of 2018. That is less than half of the S. & P. 500\u2019s 1.67 percent gain.\u201cHedge funds simply do not do what they claim from a risk or return perspective,\u201d said Yogesh Dewan, chief executive of Hassium Asset Management in London, which invests for wealthy families. Mr. Dewan said he\u2019s been investing in hedge funds for more than 20 years. \u201cThey really have not lived up to expectations.\u201dHow could hedge funds underperform even in a lackluster year like 2018?Two kinds of hedge funds, in particular, dragged down the average performance: quantitative funds, which use complex trading algorithms, and long-short funds, which take both bullish and bearish positions in stocks.Computer-driven quantitative funds, which were all the rage just two years ago, have lost more than 4 percent so far this year and were \u201cthe worst-performing category,\u201d according to Ken Heinz, HFR\u2019s president. Many computer-driven strategies rely on correctly reading market and economic trends, and the strong bull-market trend ended abruptly in February, sending many surprised quant-fund managers scrambling to rewrite their algorithms.Other so-called macro strategy hedge funds, including those focused on commodities and currencies markets, were also weak.Long-short funds, sometimes known as market-neutral funds, eked out gains of just 0.25 percent this year, well behind the S. & P. 500, suggesting that these fund managers were worse stock pickers than most people, even in a market with many declining stocks.He pointed out that in the early days of hedge funds, there were no management fees \u2014 just a percentage of whatever money their funds earned. He said institutional investors should now insist that hedge funds reduce their management fees.Despite what now amounts to nearly a decade of underperformance, money keeps pouring into hedge funds. Hedge fund assets stood at $3.2 trillion at the end of 2017 and hit a record at the end of March, according to Mr. Heinz of HFR.That seems a paradox, but the longer the bull market continues \u2014 it\u2019s the second-longest ever, and is closing in on the record \u2014 the more institutional investors worry that another bear market is imminent and that hedge funds might provide protection.\u201cNo one is forecasting a bear market,\u201d Mr. Heinz said, \u201cbut things can change quickly. Given all the trade and tariff issues, we\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201dHedge fund marketers have shrewdly exploited those fears and the still-vivid memories of 2008\u2019s market rout, which left many pension funds and endowments reeling. \u201cIt is fair to say the hedge-fund guys are very smart in the way they market the asset class,\u201d Mr. Dewan said.Hedge funds didn\u2019t protect investors from losses in the last bear market, but they did fare better than the S. & P. 500. Hedge funds on average lost 18.3 percent in 2008. The S. & P. 500 dropped 38.5 percent.Given the weak returns, hedge-fund marketers have largely abandoned their strategy of pitching themselves as \u201cabsolute return\u201d investments that perform well in both strong and weak stock markets. Now, at a time of low and rising interest rates, they\u2019re describing themselves as more attractive than fixed-income assets like bonds, which have traditionally provided a haven when investors thought stocks were overvalued. Bonds and bond funds also tend to have much lower fees.Hedge funds this year have outperformed the S. & P.\u2019s United States bond index, which has lost 1.17 percent. But virtually risk-free two-year Treasury notes are currently yielding 2.55 percent \u2014 more than what hedge funds, which are far from risk-free, are on track to generate this year.In any event, comparing hedge funds with low-yielding bonds after years of promising much higher returns is just \u201cmoving the goal posts,\u201d said Simon Lack, author of \u201cThe Hedge Fund Mirage.\u201dOf course, the weak average returns mask the fact that some hedge funds have done comparatively well. So far this year, so-called activist funds, whose managers take positions and call for board and management change, have gained 2.78 percent. Merger arbitrage funds, which bet on whether corporate deals will come to fruition, gained 2.63 percent. But nothing comes close to last year\u2019s 21.14 percent gain in the S. & P. 500 (including reinvested dividends).Mr. Heinz conceded that the average hedge fund\u2019s return of 0.81 percent \u201cisn\u2019t exactly hitting it out of the park,\u201d but it is still better than most European and Asian stock indexes as well as the Dow Jones industrial average, which has declined 1.81 percent.Mr. Lack said he isn\u2019t surprised that hedge funds keep attracting new money. Inertia is powerful, and the industry of hedge-fund boosters is loud. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to meet a public pension plan interested in paying a consulting fee for a critical analysis of their hedge-fund allocation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cost of Policing Facebook and Twitter Is Spooking Wall St. It Shouldn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine it\u2019s next December and evidence is mounting that Russian-backed entities were widely active across Facebook and Twitter ahead of the midterm elections.Users are fleeing the social media companies, and members of Congress are talking about stringent legislation to restrict what the two firms can and can\u2019t do. The stocks of Twitter and Facebook go into free fall.Today, the two companies are spending large sums to prevent that outcome. But, in a possible sign of Wall Street\u2019s myopia, investors are punishing them for doing so. When Facebook and Twitter this week reported a surge in costs, driven by efforts to secure their networks, investors dumped their stocks. Facebook\u2019s shares plunged 19 percent on Thursday, and Twitter\u2019s slid 21 percent on Friday.The sheer amount of the spending may explain some of Wall Street\u2019s nervousness. Facebook and Twitter don\u2019t break out the costs directly related to locking down and cleaning up their networks, but broader measures of expenses ballooned. Company executives said the increases were partly driven by extra outlays related to making their services safe.In the second quarter, Facebook\u2019s costs totaled $7.4 billion, a 50 percent increase from a year earlier. Revenue growth was 42 percent. In the first half of 2018, Facebook\u2019s capital expenditures, or spending on items like new servers and offices, rose 133 percent from the same period last year. At Twitter, they were up 243 percent.Investors might be cautious because they don\u2019t know how big the security bill will be and whether the spending will be effective. But shareholders have been happy to go along with higher costs at Twitter and Facebook when it was for improving their networks for users and advertisers.Senior executives at Facebook and Twitter seem to understand that if they don\u2019t want to be closely regulated by the government, the companies need to show they can police themselves. The coming months should shed some light on whether they can.But Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth, financial success and stock performance almost depend on maintaining networks that feel safe to users. Explaining the investments in security, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday, \u201cWe do believe, ultimately, over time, that this will help our growth story and encourage more people to stay with Twitter and also tell their friends, family and colleagues about all the value they\u2019re getting out of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Doomsday Prepping\u2019 for Another Round of Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Zentner is the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.Even if all the proposed actions don\u2019t go into effect, prolonged uncertainty alone can have a measurable impact on economic growth, and we should not underestimate the risks.Estimating the magnitude of the impact can be tricky. Consider this: Just the threat of trade actions, even if there is no follow-through, is enough to dent business sentiment and investment. Most business decisions are based on a five-year horizon. That means you need to be able to predict what you can charge for your product, and what it will cost to make it. Trade disputes provide a murky lens at best, which most likely delays investment.Nevertheless, the United States is on track for G.D.P. growth of more than 4 percent in the second quarter, according to my estimates. This may lead some folks to conclude that concerns over trade are overblown.I caution strongly against that conclusion.First of all, this growth is taking place against the backdrop of corporate tax cuts, which are expected to lift business spending on capital and equipment. If not for the lingering uncertainty over trade, investment in the United States might have been even stronger.Second, roughly half of the growth we are seeing now is a result of a side effect of trade tensions \u2014 \u201cdoomsday prepping.\u201d Global companies are stockpiling raw materials, intermediate goods and finished goods before tariffs take effect and raise the prices of those goods. Once the bite of tariffs hits demand, companies will no longer need to build inventories, and this boost to economic growth could end. Such a reversal is not likely to sit well with investors as they witness a potentially sharp slowdown in the second half of the year, and that could affect both stock and bond markets.Economists who believe tariffs will have only a small impact on growth need to cast a wider net. While the most direct effects will likely come from retaliatory measures that dent American exports, those impacts are just a fraction of what should be considered. Economists also need to consider the indirect effects of tariffs on consumer demand. Of the first $50 billion of announced tariffs, less than 2 percent apply to consumer goods. So the spillover effect on consumer demand \u2014 tariffs passed on as higher prices to consumers \u2014 should be quite small. But consumer goods represent more than 30 percent of the latest round of tariffs, which affect $200 billion in Chinese goods and could go into effect as soon as September.Not all industries can pass on the cost of tariffs to the consumer. There are a few other options. Companies can pursue cost-sharing with their trade partners to preserve business on both sides. Or they could choose to absorb higher costs and live with smaller profit margins. Of course, investors don\u2019t take kindly to companies facing margin squeezes. Finally, firms can absorb the tariffs and cut costs elsewhere, but labor is the largest line item, which means layoffs or slower hiring.Changes in how financial markets respond will also amplify the effects of tariffs. We\u2019ve already seen a good deal of volatility in markets every time there is news about escalating trade tensions. Since the start of the year, financial markets have become increasingly sensitive to the risks of further tensions. As the actual direct effects of each round of tariffs become clear, we should not assume that financial markets will continue to absorb the news smoothly.I believe this is perhaps the single biggest risk to the global economy: At some point, investors will start to question whether global supply chains can withstand the escalating pressures from multiple rounds of tariffs, and financial markets may start to react in unpredictable ways.The Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, has acknowledged that businesses are increasingly concerned, but the Fed has not built any negative effects from trade into its outlook \u201cjust yet.\u201d Perhaps a sharp slowdown in growth in the second half of the year will convince them it\u2019s time.Advertisement"}

Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry.

GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.\u201cCancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., if you get cancer, you\u2019re likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time.

{"Headline": "In House Race, 2 Female Candidates Clash on Economy and Guns", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWATERTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 On a sultry day at the Jefferson County Fair, Tedra Cobb, a Democratic nominee for Congress in New York\u2019s North Country, posed with alpacas, sampled fried dough and admired blue-ribbon Guernseys.Wherever Ms. Cobb goes, she tries to make the case to potential voters that they would be better served by a Democrat in Washington, rather than the two-term Republican incumbent, Elise Stefanik.But on this day, Ms. Cobb also took time to engage people like Kim Slate, who said she had voted for Ms. Stefanik in the past, about the challenges of dairy farming and foster parenting. (Ms. Cobb\u2019s parents ran a foster-care agency and adopted nine children.)\u201cI\u2019m impressed because she wanted to listen and was sympathetic,\u201d said Mrs. Slate, 45, who adopted three foster children and operates a farm with her husband. \u201cShe has my vote. First of all, she\u2019s in with the cattle, and I haven\u2019t seen the other one here.\u201dThe district is considered reliably Republican, with registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 50,000 voters. And Ms. Stefanik, 34, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she first ran in 2014, won her last election by 35 points.Still, Ms. Stefanik\u2019s predecessor was a two-term Democrat, and the district\u2019s 94,000 independents could constitute a powerful voting bloc in a season when President Trump has alienated many voters.Mostly, Ms. Cobb hammers away at the notion that Ms. Stefanik is out of touch with a district where rural poverty is a fact of life. After graduating from Harvard in 2006, Ms. Stefanik worked in Washington, first in the White House under President George W. Bush and then for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.Indeed, the Democrat has revived the carpetbagger label that followed Ms. Stefanik during her first run for Congress. Ms. Stefanik spent summers in the district near Lake Champlain, but was born and raised in the Albany area, where she attended a private girls\u2019 high school.By contrast, Ms. Cobb said, she has lived in the district for 30 years, since attending the State University of New York at Potsdam. She has experience in several fields that put her in contact with residents. She has worked as an AIDS educator, substitute teacher, founder of a health care nonprofit, strategic planner and two-term county lawmaker.When she and her husband, Scott Shipley, had a tough time making ends meet after the birth of their second child, they briefly collected federal food assistance to help pay for infant formula.\u201cI loved being a legislator,\u201d Ms. Cobb said. \u201cI liked going to the grocery store and hearing people\u2019s stories. To me, that\u2019s why you want a congressperson who lives in your district and shares your values and understands the struggle you are having economically.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Ms. Stefanik countered Ms. Cobb\u2019s narrative, saying that her family has had a home in Willsboro, N.Y., since she was 3 years old. \u201cI have very deep ties to the district,\u201d she said. \u201cI am home almost every weekend. I have had over 750 constituent outreach events.\u201dMs. Stefanik, who is a polished debater, having prepared House Speaker Paul D. Ryan for his vice-presidential debate, called her opponent \u201ca desperate candidate who was one of the weakest in the Democratic field,\u201d adding that she \u201ccontinues to struggle both substantively on very basic issues, but also in terms of fund-raising and getting attention at the national level.\u201dMs. Cobb\u2019s campaign did receive some recent national attention, though of the unwelcome variety. Ms. Cobb was talking with teenagers at an event about gun violence in May when she relayed her conversation with a gun-control advocate at an earlier event that day.The National Rifle Association and the Stefanik campaign pounced on the recording, which found its way to the internet, as evidence that Ms. Cobb, who has publicly called for a ban on bump stocks and silencers, but not assault weapons, would push for such a ban if elected to Congress.\u201cI think it\u2019s a form of lying,\u201d said Ms. Stefanik, who owns a Remington 870 shotgun and has an A rating from the N.R.A. \u201cIt\u2019s really important as a candidate to be clear about what your positions are.\u201d\u201cWe were talking about their very real fear of gun violence in their schools, and I told them the truth,\u201d Ms. Cobb said in a statement.Preserving gun access is just one of the accomplishments that Ms. Stefanik points to. She touts her defense of the Army\u2019s Fort Drum military base in Watertown, which was threatened with the loss of thousands of positions. In the end, it shed only 100 jobs.Ms. Stefanik also sponsored a bill to extend federal Pell grants, which provide financial aid for low-income students, year-round. \u201cI have a lot of nontraditional students in my district,\u201d she said.But to Ms. Cobb\u2019s supporters, Ms. Stefanik\u2019s record in Washington is no match for their candidate\u2019s rural bona fides.For 11 years when her children were young, she and her husband, who installs solar panels, lived off the grid and used a hand pump for water. But Ms. Cobb is used to a little chaos. After all, her own parents raised 11 children (the nine they adopted, as well as Ms. Cobb and a biological brother) on a schoolteacher\u2019s salary.\u201cIt was mayhem,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it made me the compassionate person I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix, the Stock Market\u2019s Big Hope, Disappoints", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen rising interest rates and trade tensions weighed on the stock market in recent months, investors could always comfort themselves with four words: \u201cThere is always Netflix.\u201dNot on Monday.Netflix disappointed investors with news that it added substantially fewer subscribers in the second quarter than expected. The company\u2019s stock, which had more than doubled this year as the wider market stalled, plunged 14 percent after the close of regular trading.While Netflix\u2019s revenue and profits are still surging, the shortfall in subscriber growth is a reminder that companies priced for perfection can disappoint when optimism seems to be at a peak. And the slip-up will revive skepticism about Netflix\u2019s business model.Netflix had forecast that it would add 1.2 million new United States subscribers in the second quarter, but it signed up only 674,000. Internationally, the company gained 4.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, below Netflix\u2019s expectations for five million. Revenue rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $3.91 billion but was slightly below the total that Wall Street analysts had expected.Netflix is hardly in trouble. Paid subscriptions were still up 26 percent from a year earlier. And in recent quarters, subscriber numbers exceeded Netflix\u2019s projections, so Monday\u2019s disappointment may not amount to much in the scheme of things.Still, the company\u2019s stock shows that Netflix has a lot to live up to. The company\u2019s share price, after Monday\u2019s plunge, is equivalent to 107 times the per-share earnings that analysts expect Netflix to make this year. This price-to-earnings ratio is far higher than it is on the stocks of many other technology companies. Bullish investors may contend that such a ratio is justifiable, given that analysts expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to keep growing quickly. Profits are expected to rise 58 percent this year, and 66 percent next.But the subscriber growth fell short at what could turn out to be a challenging time for Netflix. It\u2019s facing competition from Amazon, Hulu, Google and, perhaps, Apple. The Walt Disney Company is buying much of Fox, in part, to bolster its planned streaming service. And, of course, AT&T has big ambitions for Time Warner, which it is acquiring for its video content. Big hit shows, like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d helped Netflix attract new subscribers. The more companies striving to produce blockbusters, the harder it may become for Netflix to maintain the pace of its subscriber growth.And in a drawn-out fight, in which everyone is spending large sums on programming, investors may find it harder to overlook Netflix\u2019s negative cash flows. The company made $674 million in the first half of this year. But its operations used up $755 million of cash during that period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High-Skilled White-Collar Work? Machines Can Do That, Too", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the best-selling T-shirts for the Indian e-commerce site Myntra is an olive, blue and yellow colorblocked design. It was conceived not by a human but by a computer algorithm \u2014 or rather two algorithms.The first algorithm generated random images that it tried to pass off as clothing. The second had to distinguish between those images and clothes in Myntra\u2019s inventory. Through a long game of one-upmanship, the first algorithm got better at producing images that resembled clothing, and the second got better at determining whether they were like \u2014 but not identical to \u2014 actual products.This back and forth, an example of artificial intelligence at work, created designs whose sales are now \u201cgrowing at 100 percent,\u201d said Ananth Narayanan, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201dClothing design is only the leading edge of the way algorithms are transforming the fashion and retail industries. Companies now routinely use artificial intelligence to decide which clothes to stock and what to recommend to customers.The fashion industry illustrates how machines can intrude even on workers known more for their creativity than for cold empirical judgments. Among those directly affected will be the buyers and merchandise planners who decide which dresses, tops and pants should populate their stores\u2019 inventory.A key part of a buyer\u2019s job is to anticipate what customers will want using a well-honed sense of where fashion trends are headed. \u201cBased on the fact that you sold 500 pairs of platform shoes last month, maybe you could sell 1,000 next month,\u201d said Kristina Shiroka, who spent several years as a buyer for the Outnet, an online retailer. \u201cBut people might be over it by then, so you cut the buy.\u201dMerchandise planners then use the buyer\u2019s input to figure out what mix of clothing \u2014 say, how many sandals, pumps and flats \u2014 will help the company reach its sales goals.In the small but growing precincts of the industry where high-powered algorithms roam free, however, it is the machine \u2014 and not the buyer\u2019s gut \u2014 that often anticipates what customers will want.That\u2019s the case at Stitch Fix, an online styling service that sends customers boxes of clothing whose contents they can keep or return, and maintains detailed profiles of customers to personalize their shipments.Stitch Fix relies heavily on algorithms to guide its buying decisions \u2014 in fact, its business probably could not exist without them. Those algorithms project how many clients will be in a given situation, or \u201cstate,\u201d several months into the future (like expanding their wardrobe after, say, starting a new job), and what volume of clothes people tend to buy in each situation. The algorithms also know which styles people with different profiles tend to favor \u2014 say, a petite nurse with children who lives in Texas.Myntra, the Indian online retailer, arms its buyers with algorithms that calculate the probability that an item will sell well based on how clothes with similar attributes \u2014 sleeves, colors, fabric \u2014 have sold in the past. (The buyers are free to ignore the projection.)All of this has clouded the future of buyers and merchandise planners, high-status workers whose annual earnings can exceed $100,000.At more conventional retailers, a team of buyers and support workers is assigned to each type of clothing (like designer, contemporary or casual) or each apparel category, like dresses or tops. Some retailers have separate teams for knit tops and woven tops. A parallel merchandise-planning group could employ nearly as many people.Buyers say this specialization helps them intuitively understand trends in styles and colors. \u201cYou\u2019re so immersed in it, you almost get a feeling,\u201d said Helena Levin, a longtime buyer at retailers like Charlotte Russe and ModCloth.Ms. Levin cited mint-green dresses, a top seller earlier this decade. \u201cOne day it just died,\u201d she said. \u201cIt stopped. \u2018O.K., everything mint, get out.\u2019 Right after, it looked old. You could feel it.\u201dBut retailers adept at using algorithms and big data tend to employ fewer buyers and assign each a wider range of categories, partly because they rely less on intuition.At Le Tote, an online rental and retail service for women\u2019s clothing that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business each year, a six-person team handles buying for all branded apparel \u2014 dresses, tops, pants, jackets.Brett Northart, a co-founder, said the company\u2019s algorithms could identify what to add to its stock based on how many customers placed the items on their digital wish lists, along with factors like online ratings and recent purchases.Bombfell, a box service similar to Stitch Fix catering only to men, relies on a single employee, Nathan Cates, to buy all of its tops and accessories.The company has built algorithmic tools and a vast repository of data to help Mr. Cates, who said he could more accurately project demand for clothing than a buyer at a traditional operation.\u201cWe know exactly who our customers are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know exactly where they live, what their jobs are, what their sizing is.\u201dFor now, at least, only a human can do parts of his job. Mr. Cates is obsessive about touching the fabric before purchasing an item and almost always tries it on first.\u201cIf this is a light color, are we going to see your nipples?\u201d he explained. (The verdict on a mint T-shirt he donned at the company\u2019s headquarters in New York? \u201cA little nipply.\u201d)There are other checks on automation. Negotiations with suppliers typically require a human touch. Even if an algorithm can help buyers make decisions more quickly and accurately, there are limits to the number of supplier relationships they can juggle.There is at least one area of the industry where the machines are creating jobs rather than eliminating them, however. Bombfell, Stitch Fix and many competitors in the box-fashion niche employ a growing army of human stylists who receive recommendations from algorithms about clothes that might work for a customer, but decide for themselves what to send.\u201cIf they\u2019re not overly enthusiastic upfront when I ask how do you feel about it, I\u2019m making a note of it,\u201d said Jade Carmosino, a sales manager and stylist at Trunk Club, a Stitch Fix competitor owned by Nordstrom.In this, stylists appear to reflect a broader trend in industries where artificial intelligence is automating white-collar jobs: the hiring of more humans to stand between machines and customers.The downside is that work as a stylist or financial adviser will probably pay less than the lost jobs of buyers and stock pickers. The good news, said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who studies automation, is that these jobs may still pay substantially more than many positions available to low- and middle-skilled workers in recent decades.And these jobs may be hard to automate in the end.\u201cIf I\u2019m the customer explaining what I want, humans need to be involved,\u201d Mr. Khatua said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know what I really want.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Marijuana Goes Mainstream, Investors Rush In", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cannabis industry is growing and, naturally, investors are taking notice.Late last year, the first marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., listed in the United States began trading, making it easier for investors to buy into a swath of companies connected to the industry.While investors are optimistic that companies linked to the marijuana industry will continue to grow, the performance of the Alternative Harvest E.T.F. has been uneven. The E.T.F. hit a high of $39.72 in January, but it has slipped about 25 percent since then. The value of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has barely changed over that same period.But many thematic E.T.F.s invest in stocks that are included in broad-based stock indexes like the S.&.P. 500.\u201cThere are a lot more niche products, but most of the assets are in plain vanilla stock indexes,\u201d said Alex Bryan, who follows E.T.F.s for Morningstar. \u201cYou are making an active bet when you invest in a fund that tracks a subset of that index. Sometimes those bets will pay off, sometimes they won\u2019t. If you\u2019re going to do it, make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201dIn a broad sense, the prospects for the marijuana industry appear to be strong. Growth rates in states like Colorado, which has some of the most permissive laws on marijuana use, have started to slow. But the market nationwide is expected to continue expanding as more states decriminalize marijuana use.Matt Karnes, the founder of GreenWave Advisors, a financial research firm focused on the industry, estimates that legal retail cannabis sales will grow about 35 percent a year, to $35 billion, by 2022, assuming every state legalizes some form of marijuana use.About 70 percent of the companies tracked by the Alternative Harvest fund either focus on the production and sale of medicinal cannabis or are pharmaceutical companies that make cannabis-based products. Some of those companies, like Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis, are growers, while others have licenses to run dispensaries in the United States.Other companies included in the E.T.F. have tangential links to marijuana, like the Altria Group and British American Tobacco, or Scotts Miracle-Gro, the lawn and garden company.The bulk of the companies, though, are small Canadian ventures, which means that investors who buy into the fund are essentially betting on young, riskier companies, only some of which will survive as the market develops.\u201cYou should think about this fund the same way you might think about, say, Chinese internet stocks,\u201d said Dave Nadig, the managing director of ETF.com, a news and analysis website. \u201cThis might be speculative, but it could pay off.\u201dSamuel Masucci, chief executive of the E.T.F. Managers Group, which created the Alternative Harvest fund, said the companies in the fund are poised to grow as the laws regulating the marijuana industry are clarified. Investors, he said, have bought into that concept. E.T.F.s, he said, need about $50 million in assets to break even, a figure the Alternative Harvest raised soon after it was introduced.\u201cThe train left the station on this,\u201d Mr. Masucci said. \u201cI expect the fund to get larger, but a lot will depend on companies coming into the market globally, U.S. regulatory issues and people having a handle on what is going to happen.\u201dThe Alternative Harvest fund began as an E.T.F. focused on real estate in Latin America. Political uncertainty in the region limited the growth of the fund, so Mr. Masucci reconfigured its mission. To do that, he had to notify investors, who had a chance to get their money back. The bulk of them decided to take shares in the Alternative Harvest fund.An earlier version of this article misstated the focus of the Rogers AI Global Macro E.T.F. The fund uses artificial intelligence to spot economic trends. It does not invest in companies investing in artificial intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Starts Paying a Price for Scandals", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network.But the Silicon Valley company\u2019s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business \u2014 and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months.In response, Facebook\u2019s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebook\u2019s history.\u201cThis is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook,\u201d said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform.Facebook reported a 42 percent increase in revenue and a 31 percent jump in profits for its second quarter, compared with a year earlier. But the revenue of $13.2 billion missed Wall Street estimates of $13.4 billion. In addition, Facebook said its daily active users rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 1.47 billion, compared with 13 percent growth in the previous quarter.On a conference call to discuss earnings, Mr. Zuckerberg said profits would most likely take a further hit because the company planned to spend more on security. And the chief financial officer, David Wehner, said revenue growth would substantially decline for the rest of the year, partly because Facebook planned to give people more options with their privacy settings, including letting them limit the kinds of ads they saw.Facebook has also said it wanted to hire 20,000 people by the end of 2018 to help review content posted on the site and to work on its security team. The company\u2019s head count has already risen 47 percent since last year, to 30,275.\u201cLooking ahead, we will continue to invest heavily in security and privacy because we have a responsibility to keep people safe,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on the call.Other factors have also hurt Facebook\u2019s number of users, Mr. Zuckerberg said, including tough European rules that went into effect in May to protect people\u2019s online data. The legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, cost Facebook about one million users in Europe, he said.Facebook is now gearing up to face one of its biggest tests to date: ensuring that no one meddles in the 2018 midterm elections through the social network.Mr. Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that he was hopeful Facebook would be able to limit disinformation and fake accounts, and that the company was able to do so in elections this year in France, Mexico and Germany.\u201cWe are much more confident that we are going to get this right in the elections in 2018,\u201d he said, adding that the company had begun proactively looking for fake accounts.Facebook has other bright spots. Even with its loss of market value after reporting its financial results, it may not lose its spot as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States. The company held a nearly $140 billion lead on Berkshire Hathaway, the sixth largest, at the end of trading on Wednesday. And through Wednesday\u2019s market close, Facebook\u2019s stock had gained 43 percent from its lows in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March.Still, the challenge will be how to stem further losses. Given all the questions about the misuse of the platform, \u201cto explain that there are a couple million people who chose not to continue using Facebook is unsurprising,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.Stephen Grocer and Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The steep growth was driven by a series of new products that upended the technology industry \u2014 and, in some cases, society \u2014 and that remain big sellers.Apple said it sold 41.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up less than 1 percent from a year earlier. But iPhone revenues rose 20 percent because Apple is getting customers to pay nearly 20 percent more for the devices on average, a trend driven by its flagship $1,000 iPhone X.\u201cThat\u2019s a sign that the iPhone X, despite its high price, is resonating with consumers,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research.Apple is also offsetting some slowing growth of its hardware sales with an accelerating business charging customers for apps, data storage and other services. Revenue from those services grew 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the quarter, and Apple Music surpassed Spotify in the quarter as the most popular music-streaming service in North America, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, suggested on the company\u2019s earnings call.Total revenues in the quarter were $53.27 billion, up 17 percent from a year earlier.Buying back so much stock helps keep its price high, rewarding investors. \u201cThey have so much cash and so much buying power, they can synthetically support the stock.

{"Headline": "Decade After Crisis, a $600 Trillion Market Remains Murky to Regulators", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the maze of subsidiaries that make up Goldman Sachs Group, two in London have nearly identical names: Goldman Sachs International and Goldman Sachs International Bank.Both trade financial instruments known as derivatives with hedge funds, insurers, governments and other clients.United States regulators, however, get detailed information only about the derivatives traded by Goldman Sachs International. Thanks to a loophole in laws enacted in response to the financial crisis, trades by Goldman Sachs International Bank don\u2019t have to be reported.A decade after a financial crisis fueled in part by a tangled web of derivatives, regulators still have an incomplete picture of who holds what in this $600 trillion market.Derivatives are instruments whose values are derived from the prices of other things, like a stock or a barrel of oil or a bundle of mortgages. Originally designed to protect their holders against future risks, they evolved into vehicles that traders used for financial speculation. Unlike stocks, they often aren\u2019t traded over public exchanges, which means the market \u2014 and who is exposed to what \u2014 is opaque.The 2010 Dodd-Frank law was supposed to improve regulators\u2019 ability to monitor derivatives. American banks had to start reporting specifics about their trades, including whom they traded with, to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The goal was to prevent a recurrence of the financial crisis, when fatal problems at Lehman Brothers caused a tidal wave of troubles at other banks that were connected through derivatives. In part because nobody could map out those connections, nobody knew where problems lurked, and fearful banks stopped lending to one another.But the Dodd-Frank Act contained a big gap: Banks don\u2019t have to disclose to American regulators their holdings of derivatives housed in certain offshore entities. The critical variable is whether the American parent company is legally on the hook to bail out its foreign subsidiary if it gets into trouble. As long as the answer is no, the foreign entity isn\u2019t subject to the Dodd-Frank requirements.Other countries\u2019 regulators can seek information about those holdings, but they generally do not collect the same data that is reported to American regulators.The Dodd-Frank law \u201cdidn\u2019t really give a mandate to coordinate on the things that naturally would benefit most from coordination, one of which is the flow of information,\u201d said Guy Dempsey, a derivatives lawyer.Goldman, for example, reports its total exposure to the derivatives market as a single number: The bank had $45 billion in over-the-counter derivatives alone on its balance sheet at the end of 2017. Because of the trading in its Goldman Sachs International Bank unit and other foreign subsidiaries, a certain amount of those trades are invisible to American regulators.A Goldman spokesman said less than 1 percent of the bank\u2019s global derivatives activity wasn\u2019t visible to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, but he declined to comment further.For JPMorgan Chase, trades not reported to the commission account for less than 10 percent of all the bank\u2019s derivatives, a spokesman said. (The firm reported $56.5 billion in outstanding derivatives for 2017.)A Citigroup spokeswoman said the bank\u2019s European derivatives trades were made \u201cpredominantly\u201d through subsidiaries that reported their trades to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The portion of Bank of America\u2019s derivatives portfolio that isn\u2019t reported to regulators is not discernible in its public filings. A bank spokesman would say only that the percentage is small. A Morgan Stanley spokesman said \u201cvirtually all\u201d of its trades were reported to American regulators.The banks say that they aren\u2019t trying to hide anything and that in some cases they are responding to demands from overseas clients who don\u2019t want the United States government looking at their transactions. Even foreign bank regulators argue there\u2019s no reason American law should apply to financial instruments held outside the United States.\u201cThis problem, I think, is really driven more by regulators each wanting their own silo,\u201d said Sheila Bair, a former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u201cI think the industry would be fine with some type of consolidated reporting.\u201dMr. Dempsey, the lawyer, said, \u201cWhat you have is a picture that has more clarity to it than what the regulators had in 2008, but you still don\u2019t have maximum clarity.\u201dRegulators can still monitor risk for individual institutions. The Federal Reserve, for example, can ask for specific information about derivatives trades as it sees fit. But because the trades aren\u2019t automatically reported, the regulator would have to decide which trades to ask about beforehand. Theoretically, the Fed could ask for banks to report every single trade, but the central bank hasn\u2019t done that.In October 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed a rule that would have closed the reporting loophole by requiring all American bank subsidiaries to report their derivatives exposure. It also would have subjected the subsidiaries to financial regulations that would have made derivatives trading less profitable.The banking industry opposed the rule. After President Trump took office, it was never authorized.Officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission acknowledge that there is a problem. The agency noted in an April paper that the current reporting \u201ccannot provide regulators with a complete and accurate picture\u201d of risks in the market.Even so, Amir Zaidi, the director of the commission\u2019s market oversight division, said more data was available to regulators now than before the financial crisis, enough to enable \u201ceffective oversight.\u201dThe largest banks \u201chave engineered a way to evade Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulations at will,\u201d Mr. Greenberger wrote. He warned that in a period of financial stress, derivatives cause cascading losses. Because the ownership and connections of those derivatives remain murky, he wrote, \u201cthe economic chaos and harm of the 2008 financial meltdown may very well be repeated.\u201dMr. Greenberger\u2019s warnings \u2014 published last month by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a progressive think tank \u2014 have been endorsed by the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Thomas M. Hoenig, who stepped down as vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April.Mr. Hoenig noted that the universe of derivatives was already very complicated, \u201cand so when you make it even more opaque in a foreign subsidiary, I think the ability to control outcomes is very different.\u201dHe recalled earlier efforts to bring transparency to the derivatives markets. Such proposals were derailed by senior officials in the Clinton administration, and Mr. Hoenig warned against repeating that mistake.Follow Emily Flitter on Twitter: @FlitterOnFraudAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dell to Return to Public Markets With Stock Deal", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Michael S. Dell took his namesake technology company private in 2013, he said that doing so would give him the freedom to prepare it for a future that stretched well beyond personal computers.Having expanded Dell into a huge one-stop technology shop for businesses, he and his financial partner, the investment firm Silver Lake, plan to bring the company back to the public markets \u2014 albeit in a complicated fashion that keeps them firmly in control.The deal, which was approved by the boards of Dell and VMware on Sunday evening, would simplify the stock structure of Dell and its publicly traded subsidiary. But it would also mark the return of Dell to the public markets, with a twist: The special shares held by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake would give them more votes than other investors.The transaction represents in some ways the culmination of a nearly $100 billion bet by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake that, away from the harsh glare of public markets, they could retool a company best-known for making personal computers and traditional servers for an age of smartphones and cloud computing. Dell still supplies the machines that sit on the desks inside many office buildings, and has also found a ready market selling equipment and software to the kinds of networked computing services that were once thought to spell its end.\u201cIn 2012, people were saying the PC was dead. It wasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Dell said in a telephone interview. \u201cThree years ago, people were saying that everything\u2019s going to the public cloud. Turns out that was completely wrong, too.\u201dDell has increased its share of both the PC and the server markets. The research firm IDC estimated that Dell\u2019s worldwide server revenue jumped more than 50 percent in the first quarter, taking the top spot from the longtime sector leader Hewlett Packard as it sells more equipment to cloud service providers. Dell also moved into the top spot in United States PC shipments in the first quarter, according to estimates by the research firm Gartner.And Mr. Dell has pushed the company into areas like internet-connected devices and artificial intelligence.With much of the transformation work done, Dell\u2019s owners are ready to make the company public once again.Under the terms of the deal, Dell will offer either $109 a share in cash or 1.3665 shares of newly issued Class C stock in itself for each share of the tracking stock, known by its ticker, DVMT. The cash portion of the transaction will come from an $11 billion special dividend that VMware will issue to all its shareholders \u2014 $9 billion of which will go to Dell.The transaction would help simplify what has been a complicated stock structure. If the deal is approved by shareholders of the DVMT stock, there will be only two publicly traded types of shares tied to Dell: Dell\u2019s Class C shares and the regular shares in VMware.While the transaction would return Dell to the public markets, the new stock structure would leave Mr. Dell with a free hand to keep making changes in the company to adapt to new trends.\u201cI believe we\u2019ve accomplished what we set out to do in evolving the business,\u201d Mr. Dell said. \u201cBut the work of evolving a company is never done.\u201dDon Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laos Dam Collapse Leaves Hundreds Missing and Homes Washed Away", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 The wall of water, unleashed by a dam failure, roared through a half-dozen rural villages in Laos, sweeping away hundreds of people in its torrents.On Tuesday, many of those people were nowhere to be found, and while only several people have been confirmed killed, Laotian officials feared the worst.The dam, which was still under construction, gave way on Monday, forcing nearly 7,000 people to flee their homes.Photos and videos from the scene showed murky, brown water covering a vast area, with residents seeking refuge on rooftops that barely remained dry. Others could be seen walking knee deep in water out of the flooded area or escaping on boats with only a few possessions in hand.The dam was part of a billion-dollar hydropower project that the Laotian government sees as critical for economic development. Opponents argued that the risks to local people and to fisheries did not justify the economic benefits.The failure of the structure, one of the smaller of more than a half-dozen dams being built on three tributaries of the Mekong River in Laos, released about 175 billion cubic feet of water, washing away homes in the southern province of Attapeu, near the border with Vietnam and Cambodia.The state news agency did not give an exact death toll, but it is feared the number will grow, with the search for victims in the devastated area still in its early stages.Though the flooding was widely described as a result of a dam collapse, the South Korean company building the dams, SK Engineering & Construction, said it was investigating whether the structure failed or whether water swept over it as a result of heavy rain. The rainfall was three times heavier than normal, according to the Yonhap News Agency in South Korea.The company sent helicopters, boats and personnel to aid rescue operations, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The project \u2014 which includes three major dams in addition to at least three smaller auxiliary dams, or saddle dams, like the one that failed \u2014 is designed to generate electricity from the water of three rivers, which all ultimately flow into the Mekong.laosXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamOther damsAttapeuMain floodedareaAttapeulaos10 MilesXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamOther damsAttapeuMain floodedarealaos10 MilesBy Tim Wallace | Source: Global Disaster Alerting Coordination SystemThe electricity is to be produced in southern Laos, but 90 percent is to be purchased by Thailand. The project, begun in 2013, was scheduled to begin operation next year.The damming of the Mekong and its tributaries has been highly controversial.The Mekong stretches about 2,700 miles from the Tibetan Plateau in China to the vast Mekong Delta of Vietnam, passing along the borders of Myanmar and Thailand and flowing through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam before spilling into the South China Sea.China, Laos and Cambodia have begun massive hydroelectric development programs, with more than a dozen dams planned, under construction or completed on the main river and many more dams on tributaries.Laos, a landlocked, communist state that is largely isolated from the rest of the world, is one of Asia\u2019s poorest countries. Its leaders see harnessing hydroelectric power as key to growth.Opponents fear that damming the Mekong River will cause greater economic harm than good by destroying fisheries and damaging the delta\u2019s rich farming region, which depends on the flow of sediment from the upper stretches of the river.The electricity the dams generate can serve growing urban populations and provide a financial boon for provincial officials, powerful militaries and giant conglomerates. International development agencies often agree to partially finance the dams, despite concerns about corruption, in part because hydroelectric power is seen as preferable to coal-power plants and other fossil fuel projects that contribute to global warming.But many independent studies have demonstrated that hydropower projects in Southeast Asia \u2014 especially large ones \u2014 directly contribute to erosion, the decimation of fish stocks and biodiversity, and the further impoverishment of rural communities that are forced to leave the dam sites and move to less-fertile land.The collapse of the dam Monday was not the first in Laos. Last year, a dam on the Nam Ao River that was being built as part of a hydropower project burst, although no deaths were reported after that accident.The 410-megawatt dam is being built by the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company, a joint venture that includes two companies from South Korea, one from Thailand and one from Laos.SK E & C, one of those South Korean companies, is an affiliate of SK Group, one of South Korea\u2019s largest business conglomerates, and has built power plants at home and abroad.The phone lines of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company\u2019s two offices in Laos were either busy or rang unanswered on Tuesday.Some residents whose villages were in the way of the hydropower project have resisted moving, saying the compensation they were offered was too small and the land they were offered was unsuitable for farming.\u201cIn addition, families have found that the shallow soil around their homes is inappropriate for growing vegetables, fruits or staple crops, and consistently attest to going hungry,\u201d the letter said.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Muktita Suhartono from Jakarta, Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Successful Investing", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfIt really is a shame that Taylor Larimore chooses to use the word \u201cBoglehead\u201d in the title of his compelling new book: \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio\u201d (Wiley, $24.95.)There is nothing really wrong with the word. It refers to people who follow the investment principles of John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, the huge mutual fund company known for offering index funds.Mr. Bogle passionately believes in paying the absolute minimum when buying and selling stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds, investing for the long haul \u2014 to minimize both trading costs and capital gains \u2014 and diversifying your holdings.Mr. Larimore, who has been described by Mr. Bogle as \u201cking of the Bogleheads,\u201d accepts these ideas as gospel. And then he goes further, arguing convincingly in this short \u2014 112-page \u2014 engaging book that you can create a solid performing diversified portfolio with just three index funds.One fund invests in just about all United States stocks. Another holds almost every international equity. A third fund is made up of bonds from thousands of United States companies and government agencies. All three are what is typically known as total market index funds \u2014 one for domestic stocks, one for international stocks and one for bonds.So what\u2019s my problem with the word Boglehead? The word, coupled with Mr. Bogle\u2019s introduction to the book and the fact that three funds Mr. Larimore uses as his primary example come from Vanguard, can lead people to think they can only create a three-fund portfolio using Vanguard funds.That is simply not true as even Mr. Larimore \u2014 94 and a self-taught investor \u2014 points out.For many years, \u201cVanguard was the only mutual fund company where total market index funds were available,\u201d he writes. \u201cInvestors are now able to construct the three-fund portfolio with whichever company they prefer.\u201dStill, Mr. Larimore is a \u201cBoglehead\u201d and a co-author of two other \u201cBoglehead\u201d books (\u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing,\u201d Wiley, $26.95, and \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Retirement Planning,\u201d Wiley, $16.95), so we are stuck with the word.But that it is not unique does not minimize the appeal of Mr. Larimore\u2019s idea. People who think investing is difficult and time consuming tend to put it off, and this could get them to act.That is a good thing, as is the fact that Mr. Larimore advocates using index funds, which not only come with lower costs than actively managed ones but typically outperform them.In addition, using only three distinct funds eliminates potential overlap. When you own many mutual funds, the odds are that the same holding (say Apple) will appear in two or more of them, which could reduce the overall diversification of your portfolio.And, of course, having only three funds makes rebalancing your portfolio easier, when stock market gains, for example, leave you with a greater percentage of your wealth in equities than you want.As much as I like this book, I have two and a half bones to pick.The half first. I could have done without the constant praise from his fellow Bogleheads \u2014 who are known only by their initials in the book \u2014 for the three-fund idea. It\u2019s a good idea. Fine. No need to keep saying so.But after repeating that old investment chestnut that you should hold a percentage of stocks equal to 100 minus your age \u2014 for example, if you are 35, your portfolio should be 65 percent stocks and the rest bonds \u2014 he doesn\u2019t really say more.The problem with that is twofold. One size does not fit all. And second, subtracting your age from 100 produces what I think is a fairly conservative portfolio. My rule of thumb, if you need one, would be to subtract your age from 110 to establish a baseline for your stock holdings.My second problem with the book is that the three-fund portfolio he advocates includes no corporate bonds or government bonds from countries other than the United States. If you are going to have international stocks in your portfolio, shouldn\u2019t you have foreign bonds as well?I have been writing and talking about personal finance as part of my living for more than 30 years, and one thing I believe passionately is that people like me \u2014 those who want to help you manage your money better \u2014 tend to make things more complicated than necessary.We do it, I think, not to show off but because we find the subject fascinating. And so we go on at interminable length talking about basis points (one hundredth of 1 percent), inverted yield curves (when long-term debt pays a lower interest rate than short-term borrowings), and decumulation (how you use your savings to fund your retirement.)As a result, we often scare or confuse people.Mr. Larimore\u2019s prose won\u2019t scare anyone.It\u2019s accessible and his tone is friendly. And if it prompts people to create a diversified portfolio that keeps fees and taxes to a minimum and gets them to invest for the long haul, he will have performed a great service.Advertisement"}

Mr. Vald\u00e9s is a community organizer.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to separate migrant children and their parents at the border and its anemic efforts to reunite families since the reversal of that policy have been widely condemned as cruel. But the president\u2019s so-called solution \u2014 to imprison immigrants as families in detention centers \u2014 is equally abhorrent.In recent decades, private prison operators have opened facilities that detain immigrants and their children. This means that many times, when a mother escapes life-threatening dangers in her home country and arrives in the United States only to be imprisoned in one of these facilities, they profit. When a family seeking refuge in this country is put behind bars, they profit. When a new center needs to be opened because law enforcement officers are arresting more immigrants, they profit.This industry has turned human suffering into a billion-dollar business.They also explain why New York City was proud to be the first city in the country to divest from private prison companies in its pension fund investments.Pension funds have a fiduciary duty to make sound investments that grow their portfolios and help fund retirement benefits for their members. That means constantly evaluating the long-term viability and risk of investments across the pension funds\u2019 portfolios, which is what the New York City Comptroller\u2019s Office does every day.Private prisons fail that basic risk assessment. That\u2019s because the industry\u2019s bottom line depends on locking people up. And when you imprison people for money, it means you have to choose between padding the bottom line and spending the money needed to create safe and healthy conditions. Too often, the bottom line wins out. These companies have a financial interest in perpetuating the inhumane \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies whose consequences we now see on the front page of the news each day. Consequently, as an investment, they\u2019re at the whims of a seesawing political climate. This combined with the moral issues surrounding private prisons has convinced us that they are imprudent for investors to own and for banks to finance.Leaders across the country should recognize that in addition to their human costs, private prison companies are part of an industry that poses major financial risks to cities and states. It\u2019s clearer than ever that we should put our money elsewhere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Countdown to Retirement: A Five-Year Plan", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringFor most of your working life, it wasn\u2019t exactly a pressing concern. You might have pondered it for a few minutes as you skimmed your company\u2019s benefits handout, checking to see if your new glasses were covered or if you\u2019ll be reimbursed for your gym membership. Retirement was more like a vague, distant concept rather than something that would actually happen one day.Then, suddenly, you hit your late 50s or early 60s and you realize, almost without being aware of it, that you\u2019ve begun paying closer attention to those commercials about annuities, reverse mortgages and Medicare Part B, and you\u2019re no longer reflexively tossing those AARP mailings straight into the trash.This abrupt awakening/panic attack often hits five years or so before retirement \u2014 and that can be a good thing, financial advisers agree. Because those years can be critical. You can make moves now that will substantially improve your life in retirement.\u201cWe call the five years right before and right after retirement \u2018the fragile decade,\u2019 because your investment returns then are disproportionately important,\u201d says Alex Murguia, managing principal of McLean Asset Management, a Virginia investment firm.That doesn\u2019t mean you have to make every retirement decision right this second. Many of these choices can wait, at least for a while. Spread the work out over a few years \u201cand do it at a comfortable pace,\u201d suggests Ren\u00e9 Bruer, a fee-only financial planner in Tallahassee, Fla.\u201cIf you give yourself just six months,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be some long nights and weekends and hair-pulling to get it all done.\u201dSo what are the key things to concentrate on each year? Here, based on interviews with financial advisers, economists and retirees, is our suggested \u201cfive-year countdown to retirement.\u201dYour first step is, admittedly, a daunting one. But the rest of your retirement planning depends on it. Before anything else, you need to see where you stand financially. How much have you saved, and will that money, plus Social Security and any other pension income, generate enough cash to cover your expenses in retirement?You may already have a bad feeling about what these numbers will tell you. Don\u2019t sweat it, advisers suggest. This is the moment to confront the truth, knowing that there\u2019s still time to change your investments to generate bigger returns, cut back your current spending to find more money for savings or (worst case) rethink your retirement expectations.Let\u2019s say you are a single 60-year-old earning $140,000 a year. You have $1.5 million in your 401(k) and will contribute 6 percent of your salary to it, or $8,400, a year, along with a 3 percent match from your employer until your planned retirement at 65. You will get roughly $500 a month from the pension plan that your company phased out several years ago but that you are still eligible to collect from, and can receive $3,150 a month from Social Security if you wait until you are 67 before you start taking it. (MaxiFi will help you calculate your Social Security income.) Also, you own a $500,000 home in New York State that costs you $25,000 a year in property tax, insurance and maintenance, and you plan to stay there.The MaxiFi program estimates that your fixed annual spending on housing, taxes and insurance should range from $52,000 to $61,000 from ages 65 to 100, and that you\u2019ll have enough left over for \u201cdiscretionary spending\u201d \u2014 money you can freely spend on food, travel, clothes and entertainment \u2014 of around $64,000 a year.Unsatisfied with that amount? It\u2019s easy to run an almost endless series of what-if scenarios to see how they would affect your retirement income and spending. For example: If at 65 you downsized into a $250,000 home that cost you $12,500 a year, it would make a huge difference over time. The money available for your annual discretionary spending would climb by $23,000, to $87,000, according to MaxiFi Planner.This is a good time to take a look at your overall asset allocation \u2014 that is, how you\u2019ve spread your savings among stocks, bonds and cash. Most investment company and brokerage websites have sections where you can review your allocation, including investments held at other firms (though you may have to enter this data yourself). Unless you\u2019re depending on big investment gains over the next five years to make retirement doable, a balanced allocation of 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds is reasonable for someone expecting to live another 30 years or more.It\u2019s easy to get caught up in what happens right after you quit working, but take some time now to consider the later years in your retirement.Think you might live in a retirement community one day? Though most people don\u2019t move into them until their 70s, it\u2019s smart to begin researching communities now. You\u2019ll find there\u2019s a wide variety of amenities and price ranges, and the most popular ones have waiting lists that you can join with a refundable deposit.Kathryn Olive of Durham, N.C., and her husband, Bruce, both 63, are drawn to continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs. These communities allow you to start out living in a townhouse or apartment and then move into assisted living or hospice care as you need it. The Olives have already gotten on one waiting list (it\u2019s currently 10 years long for the larger cottage-style home they have in mind) and may join two or three more.\u201cOne thing people tell us is \u2018Don\u2019t come too early \u2014 wait until you\u2019re 73 or 75 \u2014 but also don\u2019t come too late, because you won\u2019t make the friendships and enjoy all the benefits of living here,\u2019\u201d Ms. Olive says. \u201cI want to be sure there\u2019s a place for us when we\u2019re ready.\u201dBefore you make room in your budget for a long-term-care policy, it\u2019s worth considering whether you truly need it. Working with a financial planner or crunching the numbers yourself, you may find you have enough assets to pay for those expenses without insurance. Rick Waechter, a fee-only financial planner in Chapel Hill, N.C., figures long-term-care insurance makes sense for about a third to a half of his clients ages 55 and up.\u201cIt\u2019s popular for people with net worths of $500,000 to $2 million,\u201d he says. \u201cThat would be the sweet spot. Once you get meaningfully above $2 million, you probably don\u2019t need it.\u201dKnow, too, that the insurance itself is pricey. To cover $500,000 of expenses over five years, the insurer Genworth would charge a 60-year-old couple living in New York $3,800 a year per person, and insurers reserve the right to bump up your premiums in the future.Mr. Waechter suggests looking at policies that would cover only part of your expenses. A policy paying for $100,000 in long-term care over three years, for example, would cost around $1,100 per person annually for the same couple. The fact is, there\u2019s a limited chance you\u2019ll ever need long-term care, and if you do, \u201cthere\u2019s a less than 10 percent chance you\u2019ll need it for more than three years,\u201d Mr. Waechter says.One other important item to handle while you\u2019re thinking of your mortality: your will. If you don\u2019t have one yet, by all means get it done this year. It makes things much easier for your heirs when you die. Depending on the complexity of your estate and where you live, it should cost $1,000 to $4,000 to prepare. If you already have a will but haven\u2019t looked at it in a few years, this is a good time to reach out to your lawyer and revisit it.\u201cPeople often fail to consider how they will feel once they\u2019re removed from the work force,\u201d says Andrew Russell, a fee-only financial planner in San Diego. \u201cWhile work can be stressful, it can also be rewarding to feel important and a sense of accomplishment.\u201dMr. Russell suggests taking classes, joining a social group or exploring hobbies you enjoy while still working. \u201cThis can help keep you engaged in activity even once you\u2019re retired,\u201d he says.Larry Stein, a Chicago planner, tries to get his soon-to-retire clients to focus on what\u2019s most important to them. \u201cWhat if you had three years to live?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat would be your top three or five priorities?\u201dIf they balk, he puts a finer point on it: \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s say a doctor said you had three hours to live. What would be your regrets? What do you wish you\u2019d done with your time on earth?\u2019 That sometimes gets people a little more charged up.\u201dTake a good look at your house this year, too. Whether you\u2019re thinking about selling it to downsize or determined to stay in it forever, it may need some updating. Better to pay for it now while you\u2019re drawing a salary.You might also look at refinancing your mortgage or even opening a home equity line of credit, which will be easier to do while you\u2019re still earning income. Your goal should ultimately be to reduce debt, not take on more of it, but a line of credit could come in handy in an emergency.Some potentially big tax-saving opportunities await you early in retirement, and this is when you lay the groundwork for them. It\u2019s possible your taxable income will drop by a lot in the calendar year after you stop working. If you don\u2019t start taking Social Security payments and withdrawals from your tax-deferred individual retirement account until later years, you may find yourself in the 22 percent or even the 12 percent federal tax bracket for a while. Your federal long-term capital gains tax rate could drop to zero for this stretch.You can take advantage of this by converting some of the money in your tax-deferred I.R.A. into a Roth I.R.A. during this window. It\u2019s complex, and you should discuss it with a tax professional. You\u2019ll owe tax on the money as it comes out of the I.R.A., but you\u2019ll be in a lower tax bracket then. Once it converts to a Roth, you won\u2019t owe any federal tax when you take it out later. And unlike a traditional I.R.A., which requires minimum annual withdrawals starting at 70\u00bd, the Roth I.R.A. allows you to take the money out anytime, tax free, as long as you\u2019ve held the Roth I.R.A. for five years or more.Following a Roth conversion strategy requires some planning. You\u2019ll need to have access to enough cash to cover your living expenses while you\u2019re in this low-income, low-tax-bracket period. If you\u2019re going to generate that cash by selling stocks, mutual funds or other investments that have appreciated a lot over the years, see if you can hold off on the sale until the calendar year after you\u2019ve retired. There\u2019s a chance you will owe little or no federal capital gains tax on it.Before this year is out, you should rerun all the numbers on your financial plan, whether through an adviser or online. What does your expected retirement income look like now?\u201cOne thing I insist on when a client is two years from retirement is that they \u2018practice being retired,\u2019\u201d says James Moore, a fee-only adviser with Campbell Financial Partners in Fort Myers, Fla. \u201cBy that I mean living off the annual cash flow you anticipate during retirement, before you retire.\u201dShirley Curtis of Cincinnati is one client of Mr. Moore\u2019s who has been \u201cpracticing\u201d this year. She figured out how much she and her husband, David Tobergte, would be getting from Social Security and their pensions, and they have been trying to live off that sum.\u201cIt is a good experience, but it\u2019s scary at the same time,\u201d Ms. Curtis, 61, says. \u201cWhile I thought I had two years to retirement, now maybe I\u2019ll work another six months. I want a little bigger cushion\u201d of savings.Ms. Curtis\u2019s reaction is fairly typical, advisers say. But there are other options besides remaining in the labor force, and this is a good time to explore them. Start by looking at ways to reduce spending.One way to make ends meet, if you\u2019re planning to stay in your current home, is a reverse mortgage. This is a deal in which you hand over the equity in your home to a lender and get regular monthly payments in return.But approach this option skeptically. Reverse mortgages are a \u201cfourth- or fifth-tier line of defense,\u201d says Jennipher Lommen, a fee-only financial planner in Santa Cruz, Calif.If you are concerned about running out of money in retirement, \u201cthey can be a good resource,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you\u2019ll need to continue to maintain the home and pay the property tax, and you have to understand what will happen if you leave the home. The bank may get it, not your heirs.\u201dNow, take another look at your investment portfolio. If your savings appear on target to deliver the income you need in retirement, many advisers recommend pulling back on your stock holdings and adding cash and other short-term investments as your final day at work nears. Ms. Lommen encourages her clients to allocate a year\u2019s expenses or more to cash, certificates of deposit or short-term bonds, if possible.It\u2019s not that you suddenly must become an ultraconservative investor. You still need your portfolio to grow over the next couple of decades or more, and that means exposure to stocks. But should the market take a big hit right as you retire, you don\u2019t want to be selling stocks or long-term bonds at a loss to cover your expenses.\u201cThink about somebody who was due to retire in 2008 and was basing their assumptions from 2007,\u201d says Mr. Bruer, the Tallahassee planner. \u201cIt would have been a very sour, negative surprise that could have upended everything they did.\u201dMike Teitelbaum knows exactly what Mr. Bruer means. The retired Illinois certified public accountant used to keep 100 percent of his portfolio in stocks, \u201calways looking for that home run,\u201d he says.Working with an adviser, Larry Stein, whom he met a few years before retiring in 2015, he knows he can\u2019t afford that kind of risk any longer. \u201cHe\u2019s changed my whole investment philosophy,\u201d Mr. Teitelbaum says. \u201cNow I\u2019m 50-50 stocks and bonds, and I sleep at night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "George Soros Bet Big on Liberal Democracy. Now He Fears He Is Losing.", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "FeatureHis enemies paint him as all-powerful, but the billionaire philanthropist believes that his political legacy has never been in greater jeopardy.Supported byWearing a dark suit, tieless and with the collar of his blue shirt outside the lapel of his jacket, Soros took the stage with the determined stride of an 87-year-old who still plays tennis a few times a week. But there were some concessions to age. He gave his speech sitting down and used a desk lamp to illuminate the text. (In fairness, the hotel conference room hosting the event was morosely dark.) He turned the pages with his right hand while keeping his left hand on his left knee, as if propping himself up. There were moments when he seemed on the verge of losing his place, although he never did.In person, Soros is quite charming, with a wry sense of humor. But his writings \u2014 he has published 14 books \u2014 and speeches can be a little wooden, and this occasion was no exception. He barely acknowledged the audience, which included the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Albania, except to say, \u201cI think this is the right place to discuss how to save Europe.\u201d But apart from urging the European Union to direct more aid to Africa, which he said would ameliorate the refugee crisis that has led to so much of the recent political upheaval in Europe, his remarks were more descriptive than prescriptive. The European Union, he said, faced an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201dBriefly touching on Europe\u2019s economic outlook, he said, \u201cWe may be heading for another major financial crisis.\u201d Partly in response to his warning, the Dow fell nearly 400 points that day. Soros is generally considered the greatest speculator Wall Street has known, and though he stopped managing other people\u2019s money years ago, the reaction was a real-time display of his continued ability to move markets. The attention given to that comment also underscored, in a subtle way, an enduring frustration of his life: His financial thoughts still tend to carry more weight than his political reflections.Yet the political realm is where Soros has made his most audacious wager. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, he poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the former Soviet-bloc countries to promote civil society and liberal democracy. It was a one-man Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, a private initiative without historical precedent. It was also a gamble that a part of the world that had mostly known tyranny would embrace ideas like government accountability and ethnic tolerance. In London in the 1950s, Soros was a student of the expatriated Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, who championed the notion of an \u201copen society,\u201d in which individual liberty, pluralism and free inquiry prevailed. Popper\u2019s concept became Soros\u2019s cause.It is an embattled cause these days. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has reverted to autocracy, and Poland and Hungary are moving in the same direction. With the rise of Donald Trump in the United States, where Soros is a major donor to Democratic candidates and progressive groups, and the growing strength of right-wing populist parties in Western Europe, Soros\u2019s vision of liberal democracy is under threat in its longtime strongholds. Nationalism and tribalism are resurgent, barriers are being raised and borders reinforced and Soros is confronting the possibility that the goal to which he has devoted most of his wealth and the last chapter of his life will end in failure. Not only that: He also finds himself in the unsettling position of being the designated villain of this anti-globalization backlash, his Judaism and career in finance rendering him a made-to-order phantasm for reactionaries worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m standing for principles whether I win or lose,\u201d Soros told me this spring. But, he went on, \u201cunfortunately, I\u2019m losing too much in too many places right now.\u201dParis was the first stop for Soros on a monthlong spring trip to Europe. He normally would have visited Budapest, but not this time. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a former Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was re-elected in April after running a campaign in which he effectively made Soros his opponent. Orban accused Soros, who is an American citizen, of plotting to overwhelm Hungary with Muslim immigrants in order to undermine its Christian heritage. He attacked Soros during campaign rallies, and his government plastered the country with anti-Soros billboards. In the aftermath of the election, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office because of concerns for the safety of its employees. The fate of the Soros-founded Central European University, based in Budapest, was also in doubt.Soros said he couldn\u2019t visit Hungary under present circumstances: \u201cIt would be toxic,\u201d he said. He told me that Orban\u2019s campaign was \u201ca big disappointment,\u201d but quickly added, \u201cI think I must be doing something right to look at who my enemies are.\u201d Last autumn, he signaled that same sense of defiance when he announced that he was in the process of transferring the bulk of his remaining wealth, $18 billion in total at the time, to the O.S.F. That will potentially make it the second-largest philanthropic organization in the United States, in assets, after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is already a sprawling entity, with some 1,800 employees in 35 countries, a global advisory board, eight regional boards and 17 issue-oriented boards. Its annual budget of around $1 billion finances projects in education, public health, independent media, immigration and criminal-justice reform and other areas. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood are among its grantees.Soros originally planned to close the O.S.F. in 2010. He didn\u2019t want it to outlive him, because he feared it might then lose its dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit. But he changed his mind when he realized that, as he put it, \u201cI had more money than I can realistically or usefully spend in my lifetime.\u201d He also saw that, with liberal values and civil society fragile in so many places, the O.S.F.\u2019s work was becoming ever more essential. \u201cI found a mission, a niche, that I felt could be carried on,\u201d he said as we finished dinner.A few minutes later came an unexpected reminder of what he and the O.S.F. are up against. A Soros aide and I took the elevator back down together, and when we stepped into the Bristol\u2019s lobby, we found ourselves in the middle of a reception line that stretched the length of the room. It had formed there to greet one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving autocrats, Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of Congo. The next day, a few hours after Soros spoke to the European Council on Foreign Relations, Roseanne Barr went on a Twitter rant that served as a vivid demonstration of what he is up against personally. Soros was maneuvering to bring about \u201cthe overthrow of us constitutional republic,\u201d Barr tweeted. She also claimed that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, had actually been a Nazi. Among those who retweeted the Nazi gibe was Donald Trump Jr.In 1946, as Communists were rising to power in Hungary, Soros fled to England. He earned a degree from the London School of Economics, where Karl Popper was a professor. In 1945, Popper published a political treatise, \u201cThe Open Society and Its Enemies,\u201d a fierce assault on totalitarianism, in both its fascist and Marxist forms, and a ringing defense of liberal democracy. Soros left Popper\u2019s classroom with not only the idea that would later animate his philanthropy but also the desire to live a life of the mind. He had to make money first, though. When he moved to New York in 1956 to take a job on Wall Street, his goal, he told me, was to sock away $100,000 in five years, which would allow him to quit finance and turn to scholarly pursuits. But instead, he quipped during our dinner, \u201cI overperformed.\u201dIn 1969, Soros formed what would become the Quantum Fund. It was one of a new breed of investment vehicles known as hedge funds, which catered to institutional investors and wealthy individuals and which used leverage \u2014 borrowed money \u2014 to make huge bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Quantum was wildly successful from its start, delivering 40 percent annual returns. Soros would later attribute his knack for playing the markets to what he called his \u201ctheory of reflexivity\u201d \u2014 basically, the idea that people\u2019s biases and perceptions can move prices in directions that don\u2019t accord with the underlying reality. Soros claimed his strength as an investor was in recognizing and acting on what he referred to as \u201cfar from equilibrium\u201d moments. (His oldest son, Robert, once claimed the \u201creflexivity\u201d explanation was bunk; he said the tip-off for his father that the market was nearing a major move was when his bad back flared up.)By the late 1970s, Soros had become a very wealthy man. Now he had the means to make himself an agent of history. He was frank about his ambition, though also self-deprecating. As he wrote in his 1991 book, \u201cUnderwriting Democracy\u201d: \u201cI was a confirmed egoist but I considered the pursuit of self-interest as too narrow a base for my rather inflated self. If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me into trouble. But when I had made my way in the world I wanted to indulge my fantasies to the extent that I could afford.\u201dHe decided that his goal would be opening closed societies. He created a philanthropic organization, then called the Open Society Fund, in 1979 and began sponsoring college scholarships for black South African students. But he soon turned his attention to Eastern Europe, where he started financing dissident groups. He funneled money to the Solidarity strikers in Poland in 1981 and to Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia. In one especially ingenious move, he sent hundreds of Xerox copiers to Hungary to make it easier for underground publications to disseminate their newsletters. In the late 1980s, he provided dozens of Eastern European students with scholarships to study in the West, with the aim of fostering a generation of liberal democratic leaders. One of those students was Viktor Orban, who studied civil society at Oxford. From his Manhattan trading desk, Soros became a strange sort of expat anticommunist revolutionary.In the meantime, Quantum grew into a multibillion-dollar colossus. Soros made his most famous trade in 1992, when he bet against the British pound. The currency was vulnerable because it had been pegged at what seemed an unsustainably high rate against the German mark; with Britain in recession, Soros reasoned, the British government would ultimately choose to see the pound devalued rather than maintain the high interest rates needed to defend it from speculative investors. Soros\u2019s terse command to his head trader, Stanley Druckenmiller, was to \u201cgo for the jugular.\u201d Druckenmiller did, and on Wednesday, Sept. 16 \u2014 Black Wednesday, as it came to be known \u2014 the Bank of England stopped trying to prop up the pound\u2019s value. It promptly sank against the mark, falling out of Europe\u2019s Exchange Rate Mechanism and dealing a setback to the push for greater European integration. The sterling crisis turned hedge funds into the glamorous rogues of finance and demonstrated the punitive power that they could wield against policymakers in a world of free-flowing capital. The trade made $1.5 billion for Quantum, and Soros, whom the British tabloids dubbed \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England,\u201d became a household name.By then, the Soviet empire had collapsed, and Soros was devoting huge sums of his own money to try to smooth its transition from Communist rule. For example, he donated $100 million to support Russian scientists and keep them from selling their services to countries hostile to the West; he spent $250 million on a program to revise Russian textbooks and train teachers to promote critical thinking. While the era was one of Western triumphalism, when it was widely assumed that Russia and other newly freed countries would inevitably embrace liberal democracy \u2014 a view most famously expressed in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1989 essay, \u201cThe End of History\u201d \u2014 Soros did not share that certitude. This part of the world had little tradition of civil society and liberal democracy, and in his view these needed to be nurtured if the region was to avoid backsliding into autocracy. \u201cI generally have a bias to see the darkest potential,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is something that I have practiced in the financial markets to very good effect, and I have transferred it to politics.\u201dDuring the 1990s, Soros toggled between his day job and his philanthropy, and it was not always easy to disentangle his dual roles. For a time, Quantum and O.S.F. were run out of the same offices. In December 1992, three months after his bet against the British pound, Soros announced a $50 million donation to build a water-treatment facility in war-ravaged Sarajevo, and it was hard not to see that money as having been sucked straight from the British treasury. Soros once described his bifurcated existence rather graphically, writing that he \u201cfelt like a giant digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other.\u201dIf that was the case, indigestion was inevitable, and it came in 1997, when Quantum was at the center of a speculative attack on the Thai baht. The episode was a nearly identical reprise of what happened to the British pound. (Quantum made roughly $750 million this time.) There was one critical difference, however: While Britain was a major industrialized country that ultimately had little trouble absorbing the blow to its currency, Thailand was an emerging economy for which the consequences were devastating. Economic output plunged, banks and businesses folded and huge numbers of people were thrown out of work. The baht crisis rippled into other Asian economies. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, called Soros and other speculators \u201cunscrupulous profiteers\u201d whose immoral work served no social value. Soros publicly rejected the criticism, but when investors took aim at the Indonesian rupiah in the fall of 1997, Quantum was not among them. Nor did it join other hedge funds when they targeted the Russian ruble the following year. Having already invested hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stabilize Russia, Soros would have been undercutting his own work by betting against the Russian currency. He ended up taking a $400 million loss.\u201cThat was where the crossroads between the philanthropist and the investor became difficult,\u201d says Rob Johnson, a longtime Soros associate who worked as a portfolio manager at Quantum in the 1990s. But by then, according to Johnson, the only reason that Soros was still running a hedge fund was to generate more money for his causes.During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soros also cultivated a number of young activists he believed could advance his dream of remaking Hungary as a place he would never again feel compelled to leave. Among them was Viktor Orban, a bright, charismatic student who was ardently pro-democracy, or so it seemed. In addition to providing Orban with a scholarship at Oxford, Soros donated money to Fidesz (the Alliance of Young Democrats), a student organization that Orban helped found and that evolved into his political party.But during the 1990s, Orban drifted to the right. Elected prime minister in 1998, he governed as a mainstream conservative, emphasizing patriotism and traditional values. Outwardly, he remained pro-Western. Under his leadership, Hungary entered NATO, and he also laid the groundwork for its admission to the European Union. But a shock defeat in the 2002 election seemed to radicalize Orban. When he reclaimed the prime minister\u2019s office in 2010, he began ruthlessly consolidating power. He packed the courts with Fidesz loyalists, and various independent media were bought out by Orban supporters. At the same time, he turned away from the West and drew close to Vladimir Putin. Orban was re-elected in 2014. The following year, the European refugee crisis hit. Tens of thousands of refugees passed through the Balkans and arrived on Hungary\u2019s border. Orban\u2019s government erected a 109-mile fence in order to keep them out, and it later refused to comply with a European Union quota plan that would have required it to take in asylum-seekers.Groups that received financial support from the O.S.F. were providing assistance to the refugees massed along Hungary\u2019s border, and this became a pretext for Orban\u2019s war on Soros. The Hungarian Parliament enacted legislation requiring NGOs to register with the government and disclose foreign sources of income above a certain threshold; it passed a bill that would have stripped Central European University of the right to award diplomas in Hungary. Orban\u2019s government introduced what it called the \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill making it a crime to assist illegal immigrants. (Parliament passed the bill last month.)In one campaign rally in Budapest, Orban referred to Soros as \u201cUncle George,\u201d telling tens of thousands of supporters that \u201cwe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the world.\u201d Along with the fiery speeches, there were the billboards, which featured a picture of a smiling Soros and the message, \u201cLet\u2019s not let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d The laughing Jew had been a trope of Nazi propaganda, but Orban denied that the billboards were anti-Semitic.Orban\u2019s coalition won 49 percent of the vote, enough to give it a supermajority in Parliament. But the anti-Soros campaign didn\u2019t end with the election. Days after the vote, a magazine owned by a pro-Orban businesswoman published the names of more than 200 people in Hungary that it claimed were Soros \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The list included representatives of human rights groups, anticorruption watchdogs and Central European University faculty members and administrators. In mid-May, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office, which was responsible for almost half its international grants. Patrick Gaspard, the O.S.F.\u2019s president, says that the language and imagery Orban used to go after Soros was \u201cnothing short of violent\u201d and that the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s threat to turn the country\u2019s intelligence services on the O.S.F. made it impossible to remain in Budapest. \u201cI have the habit of taking autocrats at their word,\u201d Gaspard says. \u201cWe have to protect the security of our staff and of our data.\u201d The office is relocating to Berlin.In recent years, governments throughout Eastern Europe have attacked Soros. But why Orban, personally popular and facing hopelessly divided opponents, chose to make Soros-bashing the centerpiece of his campaign puzzled many observers. Orban \u201cis extremely successful,\u201d Michael Ignatieff, the president of Central European University and the former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party, told me in London in April. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better politician than any of his opposition. He has intelligence and charm. He\u2019s funny and reads a room well. What\u2019s crazy is that he feels he needs to delegitimize Soros in order to win an election.\u201d Some observers offered a psychological explanation: Noting that Orban had had a turbulent relationship with his own father and a tendency to chafe under authority, they suggested that bludgeoning Soros was a form of patricide, a way of slaying his political godfather. But Thomas Carothers, a senior vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes that Soros was simply a useful cudgel for Orban. Civic groups were the last source of potential opposition, he says, and because some of them were backed by the O.S.F., going after Soros was a way to undermine their credibility. \u201cStrongman leaders want to de-universalize human rights and civic liberties,\u201d says Carothers, who has served on various O.S.F. advisory boards. \u201cIt is much harder for Orban to say that he rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is much easier to say, \u2018I push back against this intrusive man sitting in New York.\u2019 Soros is a very convenient bogeyman.\u201dBut Fukuyama went on to say that it takes events and skillful manipulators to rouse the forces of intolerance. In Hungary, the global financial crisis and the refugee crisis were the fuses, and Orban proved very adept at providing the spark. Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., made a similar observation. He said resentment of the European Union, which came to be seen as an \u201cemasculating force of Hungarian identity,\u201d as he put it, coupled with economic anxiety, left Hungarians receptive to Orban\u2019s appeal. \u201cHungarians are not irredeemably racist,\u201d Benardo said. \u201cEthnic entrepreneurs like Orban play upon the darkest fears of people to produce political support and an us-versus-them mentality.\u201dIn contrast to Benardo, my grandfather was not a social scientist. But like Soros, he was a Hungarian-born Jew who ended up in the United States, and he believed that anti-Semitism was a habit of mind that Hungarians would never kick. He admired Soros, but thought he was wasting his money in Hungary. When I told Soros about my grandfather, he smiled and shook his head knowingly. He said that his brother, a shipping magnate, had felt the same way. Soros did not.\u201cI don\u2019t blame the Hungarian people at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I admire them for their willingness to stand up to oppression and to fight for their freedom.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to distinguish between the people and the government.\u201dHe then told me a story from 1944, about a Nazi officer his father met in a cafe. During the course of the conversation, the officer quietly admitted to misgivings about the orders he was obliged to carry out. His father, a Jew in hiding and virulently opposed to the Nazis, tried to comfort the officer, telling him that it was a difficult situation. Throughout his life, the elder Soros shared this story to make the point that circumstances matter and that how people act isn\u2019t necessarily how they feel, a lesson that his son was now applying to Orban\u2019s Hungary. I asked him if he expected to visit Hungary again in his lifetime. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, but without much conviction.Two weeks later, President Trump called Orban to congratulate him on his re-election.Soros was an early backer of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. In Paris, Soros told me that Obama was \u201cactually my greatest disappointment.\u201d Prompted by an aide, he immediately qualified himself, saying that he hadn\u2019t been disappointed by Obama\u2019s presidency but felt let down on a professional level. While he had no desire for a formal role in the administration, he had hoped that Obama would seek his counsel, especially on financial and economic matters. Instead, he was frozen out.After Obama was elected, \u201che closed the door on me,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.\u201d He suggested that he had fallen victim to an Obama personality trait. \u201cHe was someone who was known from the time when he was competing for the editorship of The Harvard Law Review to take his supporters for granted and to woo his opponents,\u201d Soros said.During the 2016 election cycle, Soros contributed more than $25 million to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates and causes. While he had foreseen the possibility of a Trump-like figure emerging (\u201cThe American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth, which increasingly dominates the country\u2019s political discourse,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian in 2007), he was as surprised as everyone else that the Trump-like figure turned out to be Donald Trump. Soros told me that he had known Trump casually and had even socialized with him (about 30 years ago, a friend of Soros\u2019s dated one of Trump\u2019s senior people, and they all went out for dinner a few times). \u201cI had no idea he had any political ambition,\u201d Soros said. Trump had tried to coax him into becoming the lead tenant in one of his commercial buildings, he said. \u201cI told him I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Soros recalled with a chuckle.He said that he had been \u201cvery afraid\u201d that Trump would \u201cblow up the world rather than suffer a setback to his narcissism\u201d but was pleased that the president\u2019s ego had instead led him to reach out to North Korea. \u201cI think the danger of nuclear war has been greatly reduced, and that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d In his annual state-of-the-world speech in Davos this year, Soros said Trump \u201cwould like to establish a mafia state, but he can\u2019t, because the Constitution, other institutions and a vibrant civil society won\u2019t allow it.\u201d He also characterized Trump as a \u201cpurely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020, or even sooner,\u201d and predicted a Democratic landslide in the 2018 midterm elections. Five months on, he was sticking by those predictions. \u201cFor every Trump follower who follows Trump through thick and thin, there is more than one Trump enemy who will be more intent, more determined,\u201d Soros told me. He is doing his part to shorten the Trump era: In advance of the midterm elections, Soros has so far contributed at least $15 million to support Democratic candidates and causes.Asked if he would support Bernie Sanders if the Vermont senator won the Democratic nomination in 2020, Soros said it was too soon to say. He expressed displeasure with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, another possible candidate, over her role in ousting Al Franken from Congress: \u201cShe was using #MeToo to promote herself.\u201d He said his main goal as a political activist was to see a return to bipartisanship, a surprising claim in light of his lavish support for the Democrats. It was the extremism of the Republican Party that had prompted him to become a major Democratic donor, he said; he wanted the Republican Party to reform itself into a more moderate party. He said he was not especially partisan himself: \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be a Democrat.\u201d He spoke of his respect for John McCain. He even said he would be inclined to give financial support to moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, although he quickly walked back that comment: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that. That would hurt them.\u201d And while the Republicans had made bipartisanship impossible, he didn\u2019t want to see the Democrats become more ideologically rigid and confrontational.If Soros views his relationship with the Democratic Party as mostly transactional, for some Democrats the feeling appears to be mutual. While his money is welcome and needed, there seems to be a certain ambivalence about Soros within Democratic circles. It is partly because of his outspokenness. As Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Democratic strategist, puts it, \u201cThe best donors are silent donors; not talking is good.\u201d A bigger issue is that the Democratic Party remains committed to campaign-finance reform and abhors the effect that the Citizens United decision has had on American politics. That 2010 Supreme Court ruling gave billionaires like Soros the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns. Kamarck says that in the post-Citizens United world, Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t unilaterally disarm\u201d and spurn donations from plutocrats like Soros, but they are conflicted about billionaire donors in a way that the Republicans are not.Although Soros is squarely on the left on many issues \u2014 he supports a single-payer health care system and is a longtime advocate of criminal-justice reform \u2014 some on the left have long been dubious of him. In the 1990s, he was portrayed by the far left as an agent of American imperialism, helping to foist the so-called neoliberal agenda (mass privatization, for example) on Eastern Europe. For some critics, Soros\u2019s Wall Street background has always been a mark against him. There is also discomfort with his philanthropy \u2014 not its goals, certainly, but what it is seen to represent. Soros is at the vanguard of what has come to be known as \u201cphilanthrocapitalism,\u201d essentially large-scale social investing by billionaires like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Soros. (Last year Forbes magazine ranked Soros the 20th-richest American.) To those who object, this represents the privatization of social policy and, through the substantial tax benefits that charitable donations receive, it deprives the public sector of money that could be used to promote social welfare.When I asked Soros to describe himself ideologically, he laughed. \u201cMy ideology is nonideological,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the club of nonclubs.\u201d When I suggested that \u201ccenter-left\u201d might characterize his views, he demurred; he said it wasn\u2019t clear where he stood now because the left had moved further left, a development that did not please him. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to the extreme left,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should stop trying to keep up with the extremists on the right.\u201dBut Soros\u2019s Jewish identity, coupled with his status as a Wall Street billionaire, gave those disinclined to support his agenda an easy means to foment suspicion and resentment, and from the moment that he became involved in Eastern Europe, he was confronted with anti-Semitism. The dog-whistling has not abated with time; some would argue that anti-Semitism directed at Soros has become, at least under Orban, a state-sponsored contagion. But it has also lately taken some bizarre twists. Last year, a son of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon of Soros on his Facebook page. (Netanyahu has frequently disparaged Soros because of his financial support for groups critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.) And, of course, Soros is also routinely accused of having been a Nazi.Anti-Soros sentiment is a more recent phenomenon in the United States. Soros became a focal point of right-wing vitriol when he started contributing to the Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News in 2004, Dennis Hastert, who was at the time the speaker of the House, suggested that Soros was involved with drug cartels, telling Chris Wallace that \u201cI don\u2019t know where George Soros gets his money. I don\u2019t know where \u2014 if it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes from.\u201d The effort to demonize Soros has been unrelenting and quite successful. In suggesting that Soros was plotting a coup against the American government, Roseanne Barr was repeating a claim made by, among others, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had posted a meme on her Facebook page suggesting that Soros was conspiring to topple President Trump and \u201cour constitutional republic.\u201dSoros is regularly portrayed as the deus ex machina of American politics, a vast left-wing conspiracy unto himself. His wily hand \u2014 and wallet \u2014 have been blamed for the national-anthem protests in the N.F.L.; the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.; and the violence in Charlottesville. On Twitter, Soros haters trace virtually every national trauma, as well as every setback for conservatives, to him, or anything with the flimsiest connection to him. This stuff isn\u2019t confined to the digital fringes either. The claim about Charlottesville, for instance, was leveled by Paul Gosar, a Republican member of Congress. After news broke of a sex scandal involving the former governor of Missouri, Eric Greitens, that state\u2019s Republican Party issued a statement claiming that he had fallen victim to a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d orchestrated by Soros.At this point, it is fair to say that \u201cSoros\u201d has eclipsed even \u201cHillary\u201d as a trigger for a certain large subset of Republicans and conservatives. In April, conservative media outlets reported that Kimba Wood, the judge presiding over the case of President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had officiated at Soros\u2019s third wedding, in 2013. None of them attempted to explain why this was a problem; it was apparently self-evident. In 2014, Mark Malloch-Brown, a former United Nations deputy secretary general and a longtime Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, became head of a company called Smartmatic, which specializes in electronic voting technology. Soros obsessives eventually seized on this as proof that he was now intent on manipulating election outcomes. In response, the company felt obliged to post a disclaimer on its website stating that Soros had no stake in Smartmatic and that its technology was not used during the 2016 United States presidential election. When I spoke with Malloch-Brown, he told me that this was the price of being associated in any way with Soros. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge I wear with honor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it attaches to everything I do.\u201dMuch of what is said about Soros on Facebook, Twitter and in right-wing media outlets is not overtly anti-Semitic, and it is possible that some of the people pushing these views are not even aware that he is Jewish. But the echoes are there. Glenn Beck used his show on Fox to peddle wild conspiracy theories about Soros. In 2010, he aired a multipart special called \u201cGeorge Soros: The Puppet Master,\u201d which was widely condemned for its anti-Semitic overtones, beginning with its title (the Jew as puppet master, pulling the strings of humanity, is another age-old anti-Semitic trope). In recent years, the so-called alt-right has become a key driver of Soros paranoia. Breitbart portrays him as an arch-\u201cglobalist\u201d who backs unrestricted immigration and a border-free world. (Neither claim is true.) Soros was one of the prominent Jews featured in the last ad of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, which many regarded as anti-Semitic. Steve Bannon, formerly the head of Breitbart, led Trump\u2019s campaign at the time. On a trip to Europe in March, Bannon lauded Viktor Orban as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cthe most significant guy on the scene today.\u201dAlthough the broadsides at Soros are often highly suggestive, the people behind them are usually careful to maintain a degree of deniability when it comes to the question of anti-Semitism. But not always. On his radio show last year, Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy website Infowars, told listeners, \u201cthere is undoubtedly a Jewish mafia\u201d and that it was headed by Soros. Offering the same twist that would later appear in Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet, Jones said that \u201cone of the biggest enemies of Jews was the Jewish mafia\u201d and that Soros was \u201cout to get Jews.\u201dIn April, I met with Lamont. Now a member of the House of Lords and an ardent Brexit supporter, he insisted that he bore no ill will toward Soros because of Black Wednesday. But he regarded Brexit as a domestic political matter in which foreign money should play no part. That Soros had a home and office in London was irrelevant. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote here,\u201d Lamont said. In his view, Soros\u2019s effort to get a do-over vote was undermining British democracy. \u201cI think there would be incredible disillusionment with the political process if this vote was annulled,\u201d he said.During my dinner with Soros, I pointed out that some political observers drew a straight line from Black Wednesday to Brexit, in that the 1992 crisis strengthened the position of the Euroskeptics in Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, the faction that ultimately pushed for and prevailed on the vote to leave the European Union. I asked Soros what he would say to a Brexit supporter puzzled by his seemingly contradictory roles in Black Wednesday and Brexit. His reply suggested he thought the answer was obvious. \u201cThis is the difference between my engagement in the markets, where my only interest is to get it right and make money, and my political engagement, where I stand for what I really believe in,\u201d he said.It is a comment that gets to the heart of the Soros conundrum. Even if you concede that policymakers are ultimately to blame for the income inequality that has fueled so much of the current backlash against globalization, the financial sector has had a major role in worsening it, and hedge-fund titans like Soros are powerful symbols of that inequality. And while Soros has written very candidly and persuasively about the pitfalls of casino capitalism \u2014 most notably in a 1997 Atlantic essay, subsequently expanded into a book called \u201cThe Crisis of Global Capitalism,\u201d in which he acknowledged the destabilizing effect of financial markets \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make him any less of a symbol. When pressed, Soros has said that if he hadn\u2019t gone after the British pound or the Thai baht, someone else would have. That is unquestionably true (and in fact, Quantum was not the only hedge fund targeting those currencies). But that is not a particularly satisfying answer, and certainly not after the Great Recession, in which investment banks and hedge funds played such a destructive role. The industry that made him a billionaire contributed significantly to the circumstances that now imperil what Soros the philanthropist has tried to achieve.On the other hand, if Soros\u2019s riches had gone to someone else, would that person have put the money to the same use? It might have gone to a noble cause, but almost certainly not to something as ambitious and quixotic \u2014 or as dangerous \u2014 as the promotion of liberal values and democracy. (As Putin and Orban have shown, independent civil society is inevitably regarded as oppositional by governments that don\u2019t want their powers checked.) Most plutocrats measure progress in numbers, but the kind of work that Soros, through the O.S.F., has done generally defies quantification. And as Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., noted when we spoke a few months ago, that work can be unpopular in the countries where it is done.Soros\u2019s efforts on behalf of one group in particular, the Roma, seem especially germane right now. In June, the new Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League party, commissioned a census of the country\u2019s Roma. As an \u201canswer to the Roma question,\u201d as he menacingly phrased it, Salvini vowed to expel all non-Italian Roma and added, \u201cUnfortunately, we will have to keep the Italian Roma.\u201d Even in the age of Trump, his words were shocking, but he has refused to disavow them or back down. Improving the status of Europe\u2019s estimated 10 to 12 million Roma has been a major priority for Soros and the O.S.F. since the early 1990s. The organization has contributed more than $300 million to projects combating discrimination against the Roma and providing them with greater education, employment and civic opportunities. It is a struggle because anti-Roma sentiment remains a potent force, a reality underscored by Salvini\u2019s actions and statements. Given the political currents in Europe, this is another battle that Soros may well be losing. Salvini\u2019s popularity has soared.But it is also a clarifying battle. Setting aside all of the complications that come with being George Soros, would you rather live in the world that he has tried to create, or in the world that Salvini and Orban (and, for that matter, Trump) seem to be pushing us toward? In the aftermath of the Great Recession, it can certainly be argued that how Soros earned his money, and the fact that he accumulated such wealth, ought to carry more moral opprobrium in 2018 than maybe it did in 2008. But there is also a case to be made that in the present moment, with its echoes of the 1930s, how he amassed his fortune matters a lot less than what he has chosen to do with it.There have been mistakes; by his own admission, Soros erred in championing Mikheil Saakashvili, the mercurial former president of Georgia, and also became too directly involved in the country\u2019s politics in the early 2000s. He clearly misjudged Orban. But as Victoria Nuland, a former American diplomat who worked for both Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, put it when I spoke to her recently, \u201cGeorge is a freedom fighter.\u201dA household employee showed me to a table in the dining room and offered me some ginger tea: \u201ca specialty of the house.\u201d A few minutes later, Soros walked in. He was dressed in a white linen shirt, dark trousers and sandals. He hadn\u2019t been on the tennis court that morning; he was busy with phone calls instead.In the five weeks since I had seen Soros in Paris, the Trump administration had slapped new trade sanctions on China and imposed tariffs on goods from Canada and the European Union. I asked why the markets and the broader economy were holding up so well in the face of a possible global trade war, the breakdown of the trans-Atlantic alliance and the political turmoil in Washington. Soros said these developments would eventually drag down the market, but he couldn\u2019t say when. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my capacity to anticipate the markets,\u201d he said, adding with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m an amateur now.\u201d It was like hearing Roger Federer saying he had lost his touch around the net. Soros claimed that because the financial world was no longer his main focus, he was unable to time the markets the way that he used to. Politics now commanded his attention.Soros was in a reflective mood. He said democracy was in trouble because in many countries it had become sclerotic, insufficiently responsive to the public\u2019s needs. \u201cIt\u2019s losing out,\u201d he said. Illiberal democracy, of the sort that Orban had fashioned in Hungary, was proving to be \u201cmore effective,\u201d for the time being at least. The new-age autocrats had shown themselves to be particularly cunning in going after civil society as a means of consolidating their power. \u201cIt\u2019s a less abrasive way of exercising control than actually killing people who disagree with you,\u201d he said.It had become clear to him that his mentor and inspiration, Karl Popper, had been wrong in one critical respect. In a democratic society, politics wasn\u2019t ultimately a quest to arrive at the truth; it was about gaining and holding power and manipulating public sentiment in order to do that. \u201cHe was a philosopher of science, and science is a search for reality,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe did not understand politics. In politics, you are spinning the truth, not discovering it.\u201d I asked what Popper, who died in 1994, had thought of his political philanthropy. \u201cHe was very supportive, which means he didn\u2019t take me seriously,\u201d Soros said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Popper would be so happy with my current position, because I\u2019m critical of him.\u201dSoros acknowledged that he had said things in the past that he now regretted \u2014 not necessarily the sentiments, but the way he had expressed them. Referring to the Nazi comments that he made during the Bush years, he said, \u201cThat was probably a mistake.\u201d He told me that he was now choosing his words more cautiously, eschewing comparisons to the Third Reich and the use of the word \u201cfascism\u201d to describe political conditions in the United States and Europe.In Paris, Alex Soros had told me that his father, while an excellent parent, had been emotionally distant. It was, he said, a defense mechanism born of his wartime experience: \u201cTo be emotional, to give off emotion, could be a sign of vulnerability.\u201d But he said his father had started to open up in recent years.As my conversation with Soros in Southampton drew to a close, I thought I picked up a little vulnerability. He was talking about his wealth and the opportunities it had given him. \u201cFor me, money represents freedom and not power,\u201d he said. For a long time, money had given him the freedom to do and say what he pleased, and also the freedom not to care what other people said and thought about him. But he conceded that he had started to care. \u201cI have become a bit more concerned about my image, because it is disturbing to have those lies out there,\u201d he said, citing Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet as an example. He also admitted that being the anointed villain for so many people around the world was unpleasant. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to have that many enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I had more friends.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Viktor Orban was elected to a second term as prime minister of Hungary. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How E.U. Is Getting Ready for Chaos in a Worst-Case Brexit", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dutch government is hiring nearly 1,000 customs officials. Britain\u2019s health agency is mulling how to ensure medicine supplies. Ireland is preparing border inspections for food shipments and even racehorses.Call it contingency planning. Call it preparedness. Just try not to call it panic.But countries that conduct a lot of trade with Europe\u2019s second-largest economy face a particular challenge: How to manage the massive flow of TVs, car parts, drugs and every other product that cross their borders to get to and from Britain.Many have been preparing for a nightmare scenario in which Britain fails to negotiate an orderly departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, while assuming that a rosier outcome will prevail. That would involve keeping Britain tied to European regulations and customs arrangements, allowing goods to continue traveling easily across borders and safeguarding critical supply chains and jobs.Britain\u2019s neighbors are taking no chances.The government had been hoping for an outcome along the lines presented by Mrs. May, which would let the Netherlands and other European countries keep moving goods across borders with only slightly more red tape than now.A so-called hard Brexit, in which no such arrangement is made, would instead require strict new customs controls and a tangle of tariffs for each chocolate bar, computer or car part that passes through the Rotterdam port to and from Britain.The Dutch are bracing for the worst.\u201cAs far as we know, Brexit is happening,\u201d said Erik Jeene, a spokesman for the Dutch finance ministry, which oversees spending for the customs authority. \u201cHard Brexit is still a possibility, so we are preparing.\u201dIn addition to customs agents, the government is recruiting up to 90 veterinarians for animal and food inspection. New agents will have to have uniforms and other equipment. Warehouses to hold goods for inspection may be needed, adding to the nearly 35 million euro, or around $40 million, expense.In the event of a hard Brexit, ships sailing to Rotterdam from Britain could no longer pass through a type of express lane for customs clearance. Instead, Mr. Jeene said, they would be diverted into a different lane reserved for vessels from so-called third countries, which are not part of the European Union and undergo more extensive inspections to ensure cargo meets strict regional standards.\u201cIf we import apples from Germany, they can just cross the border,\u201d Mr. Jeene said. \u201cIn a new situation for Britain, that wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d The customs inspection load could be enormous. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of containers a day,\u201d he said.With Mrs. May\u2019s plan rapidly careening off course, a clear answer looks increasingly out of reach.\u201cIt\u2019s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly,\u201d the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday.As part of its contingency plans, Ireland is also considering whether to relocate part of the emergency oil stocks that it stores at British refineries back to Ireland or to other countries in the union, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported. A government spokesman said such stocks may be held only in European Union countries.Brexit, even in its tidiest form, could create paralysis at the Channel Tunnel crossing between France and Britain. In the French city of Calais, the deputy mayor, Philippe Mignonet, has warned that Brexit could result in round-the-clock traffic jams, and an increased risk of migrants trying to smuggle themselves into waiting payloads.France is accelerating the recruitment of up to 700 customs officers before Brexit. \u201cThe more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it\u2019s not impossible it could eventually happen,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said last week.Companies worried about supply chain disruptions are scrambling to cope. The European aerospace giant Airbus employs over 14,000 people in Britain making massive wings for its planes. Some parts must go back and forth between Britain and the European Union before final assembly. So any transport holdup could wreak havoc with production.Other firms have been stockpiling goods to prepare for an Armageddon scenario. Warehouse space in Britain has been filling up at record rates as companies from electronics producers to appliance makers stock inventories to meet demand in case they cannot get supplies quickly, according to KPMG, the professional services firm.Even Britain\u2019s own Department of Health is examining how to ensure continuity in the supply chain for medicines, vaccines, radioisotope products and medical devices under different Brexit outcomes \u2014 including if the country comes crashing out, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the National Health Service, told a parliamentary committee.\u201cNobody,\u201d Mr. Stevens said, \u201cis suggesting that this is a desirable situation in which to find ourselves.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of France\u2019s prime minister.

It did not say whether it sought rebates for work already delivered.Tesla\u2019s shares were down sharply Monday morning and ended the day with a decline of 3.3 percent, to $303.20.While squeezing cost savings out of suppliers is a common tactic in the auto industry, it most often involves future contracts rather than rebates for work already done, said Mike Jackson, executive director of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association.\u201cThere have been instances of it, but it\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said.Pressuring suppliers was a regular tactic of the three Detroit automakers a decade ago as they were scrambling to avoid bankruptcy, a fate General Motors and Chrysler were unable to evade. Many suppliers also slipped into bankruptcy, in part because constant price reductions made many lines of business unprofitable.Tesla\u2019s appeal to suppliers emerged after a series of incidents involving Mr. Musk that have raised concerns among at least some Tesla shareholders.The billionaire entrepreneur also offered, through Twitter, to help solve the water crisis in Flint, Mich., and sparred repeatedly with short sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla.Gene Munster, managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures, warned Mr. Musk in an open letter to him that his actions were \u201cshaking investor confidence\u201d in Tesla.\u201cYour behavior is fueling an unhelpful perception of your leadership \u2014 thin-skinned and short-tempered,\u201d Mr. Munster wrote. \u201cTwitter might keep Tesla in the news, but it won\u2019t help continued improvements in production and product.\u201dRight now, Tesla has no more important product than the Model 3. The car, which is so far available only in versions selling for $49,000 or more, is supposed to provide revenue as the company spends heavily to develop future models. Tesla has not made a profit since it was founded in 2003, and in the first quarter it recorded a loss of $785 million. It also used up $745 million in cash.Mr. Musk had once predicted Tesla would produce a half a million cars in 2018, most of them Model 3s, but production has been hampered by glitches and bottlenecks involving complicated robotic machinery the company is using. Mr. Musk has said he was sleeping at the company\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., to solve manufacturing problems.Tesla has taken reservations for more than 400,000 Model 3s, each secured by a $1,000 deposit. But analysts are concerned that some customers may cancel reservations because a $7,500 tax credit available to buyers will begin phasing out next year, increasing the car\u2019s cost.Furthermore, Tesla originally said the Model 3 would be available in a base model selling for $35,000, but the company has acknowledged that it will be difficult to hit its profit goals with that version right now. It recently removed the $35,000 version from the website where customers place orders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strong Economic Growth Figures Belie Signs of Weakness", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 On the surface, China\u2019s economy is humming along smoothly. It\u2019s the numbers behind the numbers that point to mounting challenges for the world\u2019s other economic superpower.The Chinese government on Monday reported that the economy grew 6.7 percent in the three months that ended in June compared with a year ago. That is pretty close to the rate that China has reported quarter after quarter over the past two and a half years. The pace puts it comfortably within its target of achieving growth of around 6.5 percent for the full year.It may just get tougher from here.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced on Monday that it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization about the possible additional American tariffs; Beijing had already filed a complaint in early April about a batch of American levies in a dispute over alleged violations of intellectual property.China has options, but they have drawbacks. It could put more money into its banking system, which would juice growth. It could also ramp up spending on big projects like highways and airports. But both could undermine its efforts to break the country\u2019s addiction to borrowing.Now that investment has begun to falter.China\u2019s annual infrastructure investment growth, which has consistently risen about 20 percent in recent years, has slowed to less than half that rate so far this year. That slowdown has coincided with renewed pledges by Beijing to tackle its debt problems, which stem from heavy spending by local governments and big Chinese state-controlled companies.Signs of a deliberate slowdown were apparent during the second quarter. In China\u2019s sparsely populated Xinjiang region in the far west, local and regional agencies halted or ordered immediate reviews of the viability of many projects.Several other inland provinces, plus coastal Shandong Province, ordered halts or financial reviews of infrastructure projects at about the same time. Particularly targeted for suspension have been projects that were being built by so-called public-private partnerships.Beijing has encouraged local and regional governments to engage in partnerships with private investors over the last several years as an alternative to heavy borrowing by government agencies. But evidence has mounted that many such agencies promised fixed rates of return to their private sector partners. That has fostered concern that it is essentially more borrowing in disguise.China now appears to be splitting the difference. In a complex edict on Friday, it forbade cities below a certain size from building subways systems, even as it indicated that delayed projects in larger cities could go forward with some limits.That boom may be easing. Retail sales growth slowed earlier in the quarter, official data showed, though it picked up a bit in June.The slowdown may have a number of underlying reasons, like a decline in consumer lending for cars and a flattening of the market for smartphones. But China\u2019s bean counters may also be missing some vibrant activity. They may not, for example, capture the full scope of online shopping.Consumer pessimism over China\u2019s economy may be overstated, according to the China Beige Book, a quarterly survey of big businesses across China. The Beige Book survey suggested that the government\u2019s statisticians might have overestimated retail sales growth in previous years, and are now compensating with low estimates of current sales.\u201cThe current weakness in official data is better understood as a lagged reflection of past softness,\u201d the Beige Book\u2019s second-quarter report said in late June. \u201cThe retail sector may be seeing a turn higher, with profit and investment growth improving.\u201dOne new analysis suggests that the Chinese economy grew even faster last year than official data showed. The analysis, by professors at Cambridge University in Britain and two Dutch universities, was based on sales and gross margin data from 150 of China\u2019s biggest companies.How is it possible that China understated its own growth last year? The analysis also indicates that China was over-reporting growth in 2015 and 2016, when China suffered a stock market crash and a disorderly currency devaluation. So some of the growth last year may have been catch-up \u2014 and that has now faded.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
