{"Headline": "HBO Must Get Bigger and Broader, Says Its New Overseer", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChange is coming to HBO, now that it is part of the AT&T corporate family. That much was clear to the 150 employees who attended a recent town hall meeting at the network\u2019s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The main speaker was John Stankey, a longtime AT&T executive who now oversees HBO in his new role as chief executive of Warner Media. During a straight-shooting, hourlong talk, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, he laid out his rough vision for the network, and warned his audience that the months ahead would not be easy.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough year,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work to alter and change direction a little bit.\u201dBut the town hall meeting suggested that AT&T would not be a passive corporate parent.Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s gregarious and urbane chief executive, hosted the talk at the cozy HBO Theater on the building\u2019s 15th floor. Mr. Stankey\u2019s appearance came as part of a tour that included stops at Warner Bros. and Turner, the media properties that were once part of Time Warner and now belong to AT&T\u2019s Warner Media division.Mr. Plepler, 58, and Mr. Stankey, 55, sat angled slightly toward each other on the modest stage. During the conversation, which began at noon on June 19, Mr. Stankey never uttered the word \u201cNetflix,\u201d but he did suggest that HBO would have to become more like a streaming giant to thrive in the new media landscape.Mr. Stankey described a future in which HBO would substantially increase its subscriber base and the number of hours that viewers spend watching its shows. To pull it off, the network will have to come up with more content, transforming itself from a boutique operation, with a focus on its signature Sunday night lineup, into something bigger and broader.\u201cWe need hours a day,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. \u201cIt\u2019s not hours a week, and it\u2019s not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people\u2019s hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.\u201dContinuing the theme, he added: \u201cI want more hours of engagement. Why are more hours of engagement important? Because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrow\u2019s world.\u201dKnown for \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d HBO has long favored quality over quantity. Its high-gloss productions often take years to develop and can cost millions per episode. That approach has won the network more Primetime Emmy Awards than any of its competitors over the last 16 years, with Mr. Plepler the master curator.In recent years, Mr. Plepler has emphasized HBO\u2019s \u201cbespoke culture\u201d and its enduring appeal to A-list producers and stars at a time when Netflix, Amazon and Apple have bottomless budgets. On his watch, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d has brought the Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep to the network, and shows like \u201cBarry\u201d and \u201cInsecure\u201d have charmed critics. But during the town hall meeting, Mr. Stankey said HBO should consider trying something new.\u201cAs I step back and think about what\u2019s unique about the brand and where it needs to go, there\u2019s got to be a little more depth to it, there\u2019s got to be more frequent engagement,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. Bringing the point home, he added that HBO must \u201cbuild that brand so that it\u2019s broad enough to make that happen.\u201dMr. Plepler tried to pin down Mr. Stankey on the question of how much AT&T planned to invest. Without specifying any certain amount, Mr. Stankey said, \u201cI do believe there needs to be stepped-up investment.\u201dMr. Plepler interjected: \u201cLet\u2019s give him a hand for that simple sentence! That simple sentence deserves a hand!\u201d\u201cAlso,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?\u201d\u201cWe do that,\u201d Mr. Plepler responded, to scattered applause.\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cJust not enough.\u201d\u201cOh, now, now, be careful,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.HBO has, in fact, been a consistent moneymaker. Over the last three years, while allocating more than $2 billion a year to its programming, the network has made nearly $6 billion in profit. But if it is to compete with upstart rivals like Netflix, which plans to lay out some $8 billion this year, its level of spending must increase considerably.\u201cWe well understand that we played the best hand we could with the hand we had,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cAnd we well understand that that is not going to be sustainable going forward.\u201dMr. Stankey also said that the network\u2019s number of subscribers \u2014 40 million in the United States, out of 142 million worldwide \u2014 was not going to cut it. HBO will have to find a way \u201cto move beyond 35 to 40 percent penetration to have this become a much more common product,\u201d he said, referring to its current market size.At the same time, he acknowledged that HBO has commanded deep loyalty: \u201cYou\u2019ve earned the dynamic amongst your customer base that when you put a new piece of content out there, people will try it, just because they trust you\u2019re going to be putting something in front of them that they might like. We now need to figure out how to expand the aperture of it without losing the quality.\u201dRepresentatives for the network and Warner Media declined to comment for this article.To make a bigger, broader HBO, while also guarding its distinctive identity, the two executives will have to find a way to work together despite their differences.The California-born Mr. Stankey, who lives in Texas and has donated to a number of Republican campaigns, cuts a lower profile. He started his telecommunications career at Pacific Bell in 1985 and has served in various roles at AT&T, including chief technology officer and head of the company\u2019s DirecTV unit. On the stage of the HBO Theater, he described himself as a \u201cBell-head,\u201d a term that was probably lost on the people in the seats.During the talk, Mr. Plepler seemed willing to make changes. \u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018More is not better, only better is better,\u2019 because that was the hand we had,\u201d he said, as Mr. Stankey looked on. \u201cI\u2019ve switched that, now that you\u2019re here, to: \u2018More isn\u2019t better, only better is better \u2014 but we need a lot more to be even better.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey\u2019s experience at AT&T \u2014 which offers two streaming services, DirectTV Now and WatchTV \u2014 has given him a deep familiarity with the recent shift in how media is distributed. He warned that there would be only so many streaming companies in the future. If HBO would like to end up as a heavyweight in the industry, he said, it would be wise to add \u201cother types of content\u201d to what is available on its stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now.He also made the case that HBO\u2019s employees should consider themselves fortunate to have AT&T as their new corporate parent, rather than a company in the same business.\u201cThe good news for many of you in this organization is that it\u2019s not Fox or Disney sitting up on this stage now,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no duplication with AT&T in what we do.\u201dIn other words, your jobs are safe.But he cautioned that HBO\u2019s employees would notice a change in tempo and metabolism in the days ahead. \u201cI suspect if we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re going to be investing heavier, that means that there\u2019s going to be more work for all of you to do \u2014 and you\u2019re going to be working a little bit harder,\u201d Mr. Stankey said.After comparing the next 12 months to a \u201cdog year,\u201d he invoked another metaphor.\u201cYou will work very hard, and this next year will \u2014 my wife hates it when I say this \u2014 feel like childbirth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll look back on it and be very fond of it, but it\u2019s not going to feel great while you\u2019re in the middle of it. She says, \u2018What do you know about this?\u2019 I just observe, \u2018Honey. We love our kids.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey also said he was starting to get used to the media glare that has gone along with his new, high-profile job. When he mentioned that the newspapers have lately shown an interest in his personal life, Mr. Plepler cut him off.\u201cYou\u2019re now in the entertainment business, John,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no secrets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After long hours on-set shooting such like \u201cZiegfeld Girl\u201d (1941), Lamarr spent her evenings at home, working on inventions.

When school boards cut funding for high school extra-curriculars in recent years, journalism programs were impacted disproportionately. Not only have school newspapers been shelved, but the classes that supported them have been cancelled. Yet, reading deeper into the article, I was even more alarmed by stories about censorship and the blatant disregard for student voice.Journalism is most effective when it informs and challenges its readers and expresses divergent opinions. I would argue that this is even more important among teens, who are in the throes of exploring issues and developing values. Today\u2019s student newspapers offer a much-needed alternative to the adult-centric media, giving teens the opportunity to cover topics relevant to them. In 2018, no issue has provoked more youth expression (and youth activism) than the tragic shootings on school campuses. School papers have provided a needed outlet for the expression of student angst about shootings. Ms. Peiser describes zealous officials shutting down papers after articles criticizing school administrators were published. Instead of silencing students, schools should promote student voice and a robust exchange of ideas, just as our Founding Fathers intended._________Advertisement"}

Experts say the direct-to-consumer model also helps compete with streaming services like Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.\u201cThey all look at Netflix and say, \u2018Why do I need an intermediary?\u2019\u201d said Milton Griepp, the chief executive of ICv2, an online magazine that covers the industry. \u201cThat\u2019s where this battle is being fought.\u201dOne of the biggest direct-to-consumer efforts is DC Universe, a platform from DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Digital Networks that will offer streaming content, including original and classic TV series.DC Universe is \u201ca huge opportunity\u201d that offers \u201cultimate creative control,\u201d said Jim Lee, a co-publisher of DC Entertainment. \u201cIt allows you to look at wider adaptations of the source material.\u201dTaking advantage of that freedom, DC is planning six new series, starting with \u201cTitans,\u201d a dark tale about a band of young heroes. Also in the works are the horror-themed \u201cSwamp Thing\u201d and two animated shows, one featuring the character Harley Quinn, a fan favorite.Several movies and TV series from the Warner Bros. library will be added to the lineup, including the four \u201cSuperman\u201d movies starring Christopher Reeve, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d with Lynda Carter and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d\u201cWithin the app, there will be all different kinds of content aimed at all ages of fans,\u201d Mr. Lee said.DC announced the details on Thursday at Comic-Con International, the annual comic book convention in San Diego. Membership will be $8 a month, roughly in line with other stand-alone streaming services, and also includes access to digital comic books and exclusive merchandise.Faced with sluggish sales, comic book publishers can use the direct-to-consumer efforts to create a stronger relationship with their readers, Mr. Griepp said.\u201cThey present their brands and their content directly to these fans and expand their brand footprint,\u201d he said.Fans, in turn, can find a space to interact with each other and with the writers and artists of the comic books, said Mr. Lee of DC. \u201cWe want to build a gold standard,\u201d he said.Mr. Griepp said DC had tested the waters with DC Super Hero Girls, a franchise that included streaming animated shorts and an array of licensed merchandise like books, clothing and toys. He sees a similar move from Marvel Entertainment with Marvel Rising, a new property about the next generation of Marvel heroes including animated shorts, a TV movie and comic books.Mr. Griepp said that could mean Marvel ends up with a platform of streaming content of smaller properties. Marvel declined to comment on its plans.Smaller comic book publishers are testing their own direct-to-consumer platforms. Image Comics, the publisher of popular titles like The Walking Dead and Saga, started a direct-to-consumer platform in 2015 to sell comic book subscriptions and apparel.\u201cWhile there are many incredible brick-and-mortar stores, unfortunately not everyone is lucky enough to have one in their area,\u201d Corey Hart, director of sales at Image Comics, said in a statement. \u201cImage Direct was built in order to reach those exact readers.\u201dThis month, Dark Horse Comics announced its service, Dark Horse Direct, which will focus on high-end products like statues.\u201cThe goal is getting our products into as many hands a possible,\u201d said Melissa Lomax, the director of e-commerce for Dark Horse, which promoted the service at Comic-Con. \u201cWe want to try to reach fans that may not necessarily have seen our product elsewhere.\u201dThat access is important, Mr. Griepp said, because some comic book shops will not carry expensive merchandise.\u201cThe strategy is just to make sure there is no unfilled demand in a rural area or small town,\u201d he said.Comic book publishers are quick to point out that their initiatives are intended to augment retail sales, not cannibalize them. In fact, DC recently announced a deal to reprint comic books and sell them in more than 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.Dan DiDio, the other co-publisher of DC Entertainment, said that if the program is successful, he hoped to broaden it to include other retailers.\u201cWe want to find a way to put these in the hands of folks who don\u2019t have a chance to read them other ways,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of one of the partner companies in the DC Universe platform.

{"Headline": "How Consumers Can Resist Companies\u2019 Market Power", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewA basic rule of economics is that the price depends on how willing consumers are to buy something else.The less consumers pay attention when they buy \u2014 and the more they just follow a set shopping pattern \u2014 the greater the market power possessed by the seller, and the more that seller can charge.Modern companies know this very well, and they do what they can to improve their advantages over unwary consumers.I\u2019ve unwittingly been caught in consumer traps myself.About 15 years ago, for example, my wife and I decided to send out holiday cards using an online photo service rather than writing them out and sending them by hand. We picked Shutterfly, which did a good job. And we\u2019re still using it, largely because after we had typed 100 addresses into the Shutterfly site, it would have taken a heck of a deal to persuaded us to type them in again somewhere else.So the truth is we haven\u2019t bothered to shop around much. We\u2019ve just stuck with Shutterfly, and that is undoubtedly costing us money.Economists have thought a lot about markets like the one exemplified by Shutterfly \u2014 those with significant \u201cswitching costs\u201d and \u201clock-in effects.\u201dIn such markets, companies should be extremely generous up front trying to earn your business, knowing you will be stuck with them. And, in theory, you will think about their future market power carefully when you first decide whether to sign up. That\u2019s what a rational, forward-looking consumer should do.But that theory might not describe the actual marketplace that well. When my wife and I chose Shutterfly, we didn\u2019t really think about what competitors might exist 14 years later or how the prices might change once they got us signed up in 2004.We probably should have thought about all of that, realizing that, down the road, cloud storage prices would become immensely cheaper and we could get better deals if we maintained our flexibility. Instead, we bumbled our way into giving a company the power to monopolize us.That kind of thing happens a lot these days. People make quick shopping decisions that have long-term consequences.Big companies know that the more convenient they make their product or service, the less you will shop around and the more market power they will have. Plus they\u2019ve gotten good at tailoring products to certain consumers to get them to give up comparison shopping altogether.The researchers (who are, incidentally, my friends and colleagues) found that while companies sell many more products than before, as individuals we are increasingly buying only our one favored product in a given category. In other words, we are not comparison shopping or forcing companies to compete for business.Take the case of tortilla chips. Fifteen years ago, Tostitos dominated all other chip makers, but sometimes consumers would buy Mission chips or a local brand if they were cheaper or the mood struck them.Today, Tostitos is still the dominant brand but has expanded into 13 specialized varieties like Tostitos Hint of Lime, Tostitos Bite Size and Tostitos Multigrain. It also has five party sizes, four Simply Tostitos organic or sea-salted varieties and three different Tostitos Cantina styles.Today, the same consumer tends to go into the store looking just to buy one of the specialized varieties of Tostitos: She really loves Hint of Lime or is intent on buying Tostitos Scoops (chips in the shape of tiny taco bowls). People don\u2019t try alternatives the way they used to. They act as if they are locked in.But this innovation comes with a downside. The more specific consumer tastes get, the more the companies can exploit their ability to cater to those tastes without competition. The Neiman and Vavra study shows exactly what you would expect: The more specialized the demand, the higher the prices people pay and the greater the market power possessed by a company.Creating specialized demand is an intriguing way of locking customers into a product. Another method is selling a discount subscription \u2014 cable, magazines, pest control \u2014 that automatically renews at a higher price. Consumers have to remember and make the effort to cancel if they want to shop around. Companies offer convenience, but they make the consumers pay for it.But even as we debate these larger notions, let us not forget the ways in which we, consumers at the very base of the economy, increase corporate market power with the ways we shop.That isn\u2019t meant to deny the importance of conventional macroeconomic factors in the rise of market power. And it certainly isn\u2019t meant to play down the role that could be played by government policy like more aggressive antitrust enforcement, consumer protection or regulation.But beyond the effects of government or technology or globalization, individual choices matter. Companies don\u2019t want you to comparison shop, which could force them to compete for your business. They want you to develop regular shopping habits. The more people do that, the higher the prices everyone will pay.I try to remember that when I shop now. I remind myself not to just buy the first thing listed on a website or displayed on the rack at the checkout aisle. When I take a ride-hailing service, I will check both Uber and Lyft before choosing. Sometimes I check the price of things online without logging in or shift my browser to private mode to see if a company is offering better deals to new customers.For an individual shopper, these actions are a bit of a pain, and they may not do much to improve matters over all. But if enough people behave this way \u2014 keeping companies guessing and making them work for our business \u2014 these small acts of consumer resistance can help keep corporate market power in check.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.

{"Headline": "Shonda Rhimes Describes Her Grand Netflix Ambitions", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "The star producer reveals the eight shows she plans to make for the streaming service, which wooed her away from ABC with a nine-figure deal.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Shonda Rhimes achieved almost everything a television producer could hope for during her long run at ABC. She made herself into not only one of the most prolific writer-producers in the business, but also a mogul, as the founder and head of the Shondaland production company. ABC filled its entire Thursday night lineup with shows created or produced by her \u2014 a body of work that includes \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d \u2014 but Ms. Rhimes was restless.Now, after signing a multiyear, nine-figure deal with Netflix, Ms. Rhimes will try to match or top her network success in the wide-open expanse of streaming, free of time slots, commercial interruptions, and restrictions on language and content.In an interview at a NeueHouse work space here \u2014 during which she laid out her Netflix plans for the first time \u2014 Ms. Rhimes sounded confident that she will deliver something unexpected.\u201cEverybody thinks that there\u2019s a \u2018Shondaland show,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s a Shondaland show that we made for ABC. Now I can\u2019t wait to show everybody what a Shondaland show is that we make for the world.\u201dNetflix\u2019s courtship of Ms. Rhimes began, in earnest, in the late fall of 2016. At the time, she had more than a year to go on her ABC contract, so she didn\u2019t tell anyone at the network about the breakfast she had planned with Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix.With her agent, Chris Silbermann of ICM Partners, in tow, Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Sarandos took a table in the back of Republique, a casual restaurant on South La Brea Avenue. During the sit-down, Ms. Rhimes was frank with Mr. Sarandos about how she viewed her next act.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to make you a second \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cThat was one of the first things I said. And he said, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in you making a second \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u2019\u201dWord of the breakfast made its way to The Hollywood Reporter \u2014 but the brief item that ran soon afterward in the trade publication\u2019s Power Dining column failed to identify Ms. Rhimes correctly: \u201cNetflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos and wife Nicole Avant ate breakfast with ICM Partners\u2019 Chris Silbermann at Republique,\u201d the item read.\u201cI was like, \u2018For once, bias is working in my favor!\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cNicole and I are both black women. We couldn\u2019t look more not alike. But somebody decided that\u2019s who that must be. And it saved me a whole lot of trouble.\u201dLast August, Netflix and Ms. Rhimes had an agreement for a contract with a base salary of around $150 million, with incentives that could kick the producer\u2019s earnings much higher, according to two people with knowledge of the deal.The news of a streaming company\u2019s successful wooing of a major network producer hit Hollywood like an earthquake. As Dana Walden, co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, described it this year, \u201cThat sent a message to the entire talent community: There\u2019s a new template in town. For any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.\u201dMs. Rhimes, 48, is among the select few television producers whose work has helped define a cultural moment. In the \u201980s, there was Steven Bochco, with \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d and \u201cL.A. Law.\u201d Next came David E. Kelley, of \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d and \u201cThe Practice\u201d fame. And then there was Ms. Rhimes, who made her mark during what would turn out to be the last years of appointment television viewing.The producer and director J. J. Abrams, who has known Ms. Rhimes for several years, said she brought something distinctive to network programming.\u201cThe thing that you can\u2019t deny is her characters are surprising, her characters are vulnerable, her characters are ambitious, her characters are broken, and her characters are involved in situations that are shocking and stressful,\u201d Mr. Abrams said. \u201cShe is able to tell real stories in ways that feel relatable.\u201dMs. Rhimes said she had two principal goals for her time at Netflix. One is to come up with shows that are more expansive than her ABC fare. The other is to turn Shondaland into an enduring company that will live within Netflix in the same way that Marvel exists inside the Walt Disney Company.\u201cIt would be really amazing to me at some point down the line \u2014 not now \u2014 if somebody said, \u2018There was a Shonda for Shondaland?\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cIt needs to be bigger than me.\u201dIn the days after signing the deal, she was enthusiastic about the creative freedom Netflix had promised her, but found herself with an immediate problem: She had no idea what she was going to write.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I had a treasure trove of ideas in the back of my head that I\u2019d been hiding and saving,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the panic overtook me for a while.\u201dMr. Abrams had sympathy for his friend\u2019s plight. \u201cYou can have all the success in the world, but none of it matters when you\u2019re there alone with the blank computer screen,\u201d he said.Over the next few months, Ms. Rhimes tended her continuing ABC work and scouted material that could be a fit for Netflix. But she still had no clue about what, exactly, she would throw herself into as a writer-producer.\u201cIn October,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause of who I am, I was like: \u2018Why don\u2019t I have a show yet? I should have a show all written and ready to go. I should have eight episodes all written.\u2019\u201dMr. Sarandos reassured her: You just started, take a breath. Colleagues said there was no way Ms. Rhimes could go deep into something new when she still had to wrap up the seventh and final season of \u201cScandal.\u201dShe flirted with a sci-fi project \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with that, but it hasn\u2019t cracked yet\u201d \u2014 while warding off the well-meaning but irksome questions from people curious about her Netflix plans. After Memorial Day, she escaped the noise of Los Angeles for the quiet of Arizona.\u201cI was trying to meditate, which I can\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said.\u201cI knew exactly what the show was,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said, \u201cwhich is a very clear indicator.\u201dShe bought the rights to the story, by a New York magazine staff writer, Jessica Pressler, and started writing almost immediately.\u201cI felt comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cI slept differently.\u201dBetsy Beers, Ms. Rhimes\u2019s producing partner since 2002, said she could tell Ms. Rhimes was onto something.\u201cWhat I heard was the excitement,\u201d Ms. Beers said. \u201cWhat I wait for is a tone in her voice \u2014 you hear this level of excitement in her voice, where she can\u2019t stop talking about it.\u201dIn addition to the show about the grifter, Ms. Rhimes has seven other series in the works at Netflix, ranging from period dramas to a documentary.\u25a0 \u201cPico & Sepulveda,\u201d a series set in Mexican California during the 1840s.\u25a0 An upstairs-downstairs series called \u201cThe Residence,\u201d based on the 2015 nonfiction book of the same title, by Kate Andersen Brower, about the private lives of United States presidents, their families and White House staff.\u25a0 \u201cSunshine Scouts,\u201d a series that Ms. Rhimes described as a \u201cdarkly comic, ironic, twisty show about some foul-mouthed teenage girls who are trapped at the end of the world.\u201d The writer and director Jill Alexander will be in charge of this one.\u25a0 \u201cHot Chocolate Nutcracker,\u201d a documentary centered on the dancer and choreographer Debbie Allen and her reimagining of the holiday ballet.Ms. Rhimes said the idea of building out Shondaland had been with her for some time. She stressed that she had not grown bored with the work she had been doing for ABC \u2014 far from it \u2014 but she found that she was able to solve crises that once occupied a week of her time in 30 minutes flat. She added that she remained proud of her ABC shows and the spotlight they threw on characters who had gone underrepresented in Hollywood.\u201cWe created a brand and an audience for ABC that they did not necessarily have before, which was a certain kind of woman,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cI literally remember when we started, them saying that no woman is going to watch a woman who is this \u2018not nice\u2019 and this sexually active and this competitive.\u201cI really hate the phrase \u2018smart, strong women,\u2019 but the \u2018smart, strong women\u2019 thing really exploded with the shows we made,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd people followed along in a way that felt really good for network television.\u201dIn contrast with her fellow super producer Ryan Murphy, who had talks with Amazon and Fox, his studio at the time, before he decamped to Netflix, Ms. Rhimes knew exactly where she wanted to achieve her Shondaland dream: Netflix.Mr. Sarandos was eager to sign her not only because he was a fan of her work but because of something he noticed in Netflix\u2019s closely guarded data. \u201cMore than half\u201d of Netflix\u2019s 124 million paying subscribers have sampled one of the Shondaland shows available on the streaming service, he said in an interview.As Ms. Rhimes works to develop her lineup, her production company is on its way to a new location: Raleigh Studios, in Hollywood, about a mile from the Netflix headquarters.

{"Headline": "On a Colombian Savanna, Hawks, Caimans and So Many Stars", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "Colombia RisingThe region called the Llanos Orientales is vast, with an abundance of wildlife. An eco-lodge offers memorable safaris, fishing, strong coffee and some mystery.Supported byThis vast region \u2014 extending from the Andes to the Orinoco River, and Venezuela beyond, is known as the Llanos Orientales \u2014 or eastern plains. It\u2019s a broad, flat savanna split by slow, muddy rivers lined with gallery forests. In the rainy season, from May to October, tropical downpours turn muddy trickles into rivers, plains to lakes, and dry ground to mud. In the dry season, lakes shrink, rivers drop and the land becomes parched and sun-baked. It all combines to create an otherworldly landscape, teeming with wildlife.\u201cThe plains surrounding us seemed to reach the sky, and looked to us like an ocean covered with seaweed,\u201d wrote the Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who crossed the llanos in 1800. \u201cSky and land merged.\u201dTourists stay at Juan Solito and spend their days exploring the ranch, which is managed as a wildlife reserve through Colombia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.\u201cThe ranch serves as a refuge for species at risk, and teaches visitors about the culture of the llanos,\u201d Mr. Barrag\u00e1n told me. \u201cThe idea is to support the natural ecosystem and maintain them in their wild state, so people can see the wild animals and the wild lands as they were before.\u201d Elsewhere, the llanos environment is threatened by oil drilling, intensive agriculture and overgrazing.Mr. Barrag\u00e1n is a pure llanero, as natives of the region are known. He sometimes plays the lively yet plaintive llanero music for guests, on the harp, or the four-stringed cuatro. During the wet season, he rides alongside the other vaqueros to round up the cattle.On my first morning, Mr. Barrag\u00e1n outlined the options for exploring the area. Over several cups of tinto, the strong black coffee that keeps Colombia caffeinated, we came up with a three-day plan \u2014 a wildlife safari, a fishing expedition and a search for snakes.Wildlife was abundant and conspicuous. A barefaced ibis foraged through the grass as a crested caracara hunted for turtle eggs along the mud bank of a small creek. Deer grazed in the near distance, and beyond, next to a small muddy pond, a pair of jabirus \u2014 large, ridiculous-looking storks with red, pelican-like pouches.At a larger pond just down the road, a dozen spectacled caiman lounged in the shallows, and a long-toed bird called a wattled ja\u00e7ana waded alongside a roseate spoonbill. A pair of Orinoco geese tended goslings, and two dozen capybara sat half-submerged, looking docile, some with mud caked across their backs. Profiled on a sandy bench a few feet above the rest of the plain, four pairs of burrowing owls stood by their dens.It was a lot to take in, and there was more. Off in the distance, I noticed what first looked like clouds to the west. Looking closer, it was the white glaciers of the 17,000-foot peaks of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, resting atop the bluish Andes.All the while we traveled among livestock \u2014 the Barrag\u00e1ns run 5,000 head of cattle, along with horses and a small herd of water buffalo. Stopping for lunch at Hato Agua Verde, one of several haciendas on the ranch, we saw a lasso stretched along a fence, freshly made from pure leather. One of the cowboys gave us an introduction to the llanero art of making these \u201crejos.\u201d The process involves wetting a cowhide, slicing it into a long, slender strip, then twisting, stretching, and drying the rope.Returning late to Juan Solito, we crossed the river in the dark. Fruit bats flew about, and a yellowish snake, an Amazon tree boa, hunted them from the thatched roof of an outbuilding. The sky was a brilliant bowlful of stars accented by a crescent moon, utterly undiminished by light pollution. On the second morning, Mr. Castilla and I traveled to a far corner of the ranch to do some fishing. As we drove over the plains, a lesser yellow-headed vulture soared overhead, and a great black hawk flew by, one talon clutching a large iguana by the neck. Another big lizard darted shrub-to-shrub over the plain. It was darker and stockier than an iguana \u2014 a golden tegu.We left the truck at an impassable creek crossing and set off walking through a patch of jungle. This corner of the ranch felt wilder. It was easy to imagine jaguars roaming the land, and they do.A hoatzin, a primitive bird like a living archaeopteryx, called in the distance as we baited hand-lines with \u2014 what else? \u2014 gristly chunks of local beef. Drifting the bait in the slow current, we quickly started catching fish. First, a couple of small catfish nibbled, then toothy piranhas hit the bait savagely. A couple of hours later, we hiked out with a fine stringer of plump piranhas, which we ate that night \u2014 scored, fried and delicious.The main building has eight rooms and a patio strung with hammocks. Another building has six more rustic rooms, and a set of bookshelves overflowing with well-worn field guides (handy for identifying endemic birds like the pale-headed jacamars that hang around the buildings).It\u2019s clean, comfortable, and basic, but it\u2019s not for everyone. There\u2019s not an infinity pool, nor a hint of a yoga mat. You\u2019ll not get cellphone service or Wi-Fi, and English words are in short supply. The showers aren\u2019t cold, per se, nor is the water heated. The nearly equatorial sun, on the other hand, is relentless at midday. And there are chiggers, ticks and mosquitoes, and venomous fer-de-lance snakes. An English-speaking tourist who arrived just before I left was unimpressed. \u201cIf this is the way eco-tourism is developing in this country,\u201d he told his wife, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very successful.\u201dCaribbeanSea200 milesCartegenavenezuelaOrinocoRiverAriporoRivercolombiaJuan SolitoEcolodgeMetaRiverBogot\u00e1LlanosOrientalesBy The New York TimesA week before I arrived, a large anaconda had eaten a caiman in a small pond near Juan Solito, then spent the day digesting on the bank. So on my third day, Mr. Castilla and I walked over to look for it, distracted along the way by dozens of birds. Small, medium and large parrots flew by \u2014 brown-throated parakeets, yellow-headed parrots, and chestnut-fronted macaws.Nearby, a refined-looking raptor perched in a low tree, a savanna hawk. Arriving at the pond, we saw a similar hawk scanning the water, but this one had a paler head. It was a black collared hawk, which preys on fish. But the anacondas stayed hidden.Later that day, I set off with another guide, Jeremias Tumay, to search for anacondas in another corner of the ranch, this time on horseback. Though motorcycles, jeeps and pickups are popular on the plains, horses are better for fording rivers and creeks.Llaneros have earned reputations as excellent horsemen, and Sim\u00f3n Bolivar relied on them in his fight for independence. In \u201cBolivar: American Liberator,\u201d Marie Arana wrote: \u201cThe llaneros were accomplished horsemen, well trained in the art of warfare \u2026 They made tents from hides, slept on earth, reveled in hardship. They lived on the open prairie, which was parched by heat, impassable in the rains.\u201dOn the sure-footed horses, we descended the steep muddy bank, and crossed the Ariporo River, stirrup-deep in the opaque flow. Then we rode an hour over the llanos to a small lake, where hundreds of ducks dabbled amid a large herd of capybara and dozens of shorebirds.After a brief glimpse, the crocodile disappeared into the water, in a corner of the llanos still big and wild enough to keep a few secrets.Murray Carpenter is the author of \u201cCaffeinated: How Our Daily Habit Helps, Hurts, and Hooks Us.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Delivers a Pile of Cash, but No Fireworks", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hold that champagne.Expectations for Amazon\u2019s second quarter were extremely high, and in some respects the company exceeded them when it released results on Thursday. But any hope that it would be the event that hurtled the company\u2019s valuation above the trillion-dollar mark will have to wait.Net sales increased 39 percent, to $52.9 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. Analysts predicted $53.37 billion. What\u2019s a $500 million miss from a highflier? Well, Facebook on Wednesday missed its estimates by about $200 million, on revenue that was a quarter of Amazon\u2019s, and the stock tumbled 19 percent.But Amazon leads a charmed life: Good results mean things are working out, and weak results mean it is investing so things will work out in the future.Net income for the quarter was impressive: $2.5 billion, or $5.07 per share, compared with $197 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2017. Analysts anticipated only about half that. Amazon has now been consistently profitable since early 2015, something a few analysts \u2014 and quite a few short-sellers, who were betting on the stock dropping \u2014 thought they would never see.\u201cA blowout quarter by virtually any measurement,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, Moody\u2019s lead retail analyst.The company\u2019s result eased some tech investor worries that Facebook\u2019s problems would spread elsewhere. Amazon fell $56, or about 3 percent, in regular trading Thursday \u2014 a minor blip in the stock\u2019s relentless march upward over the last decade. The company\u2019s results, posted after the markets closed, made up those losses plus a few dollars more in after-hours trading.Last week, both the power and the perils of Amazon were on vivid display. The company had its fourth-annual Prime Day, a made-up shopping holiday that is available only to Prime customers. It was so successful that the site crashed. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, estimated that Prime Day sales rose 33 percent from last year.But the sale was conducted against the backdrop of work stoppages in Europe that lasted as long as three days, one of the biggest labor actions in the company\u2019s history. The strikes, which happened in Germany, Poland and Spain, did not involve all the workers in those countries. In Spain, the police clashed with the strikers, resulting in at least one worker injury.Amazon responded with a statement saying it was \u201ca fair and responsible employer\u201d that was offering Europeans \u201cgood jobs with highly competitive pay, full benefits and innovative training programs.\u201dIn its announcement about its earnings, Amazon brought up the things it cares most about: its membership club, Prime; its market-leading cloud division, Amazon Web Services; and Alexa, the voice technology that powers the Echo devices people use in their homes.While Amazon gives few numbers on Alexa and Echo, the research firm eMarketer says 41 million people in the United States will use an Echo this year, up 31 percent over last year. Echo has about twice the market share of its closest competitor, Google Home.Amazon is so dominant in e-commerce that it barely needed to mention it in the earnings announcement. It controls exactly half of the online market in the United States. Its next competitors, including eBay and Walmart, own market shares mired in the single digits. Ebay, which bested Amazon in auctions long ago, has been struggling. It said it would lay off hundreds of employees this month.For years, Amazon has been on a hiring binge \u2014 world domination needs many hands. But in the second quarter, it slowed a bit, increasing only 12,000 from the first quarter. In 2017, employment grew 31,000 between the first and second quarters.Daniel Ives, head of technology research for GBH Insights, reaffirmed Thursday his $2,000 target for Amazon\u2019s shares, a price that would make it a trillion-dollar company.\u201cAfter the Facebook debacle last night,\u201d Mr. Ives wrote in a research note, \u201cwe believe the Street will be somewhat relieved to see Amazon deliver another strong quarter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely.Unlike Mr. Pruitt \u2014 who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending \u2014 Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules.America\u2019s biggest retailer has headquarters in the deeply red state of Arkansas, and its core customer base tends to be politically conservative.

{"Headline": "In Georgia Governor\u2019s Race, a Defining Moment for a Southern State", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Georgia\u2019s political middle, long the dominant force behind the state\u2019s thriving commerce and pragmatic leadership, suddenly finds itself all but abandoned.More starkly than in most midterm campaigns, the contest between Mr. Kemp, the two-term Republican secretary of state, and Ms. Abrams, a former Democratic leader in the State Legislature, has come to mirror the disorienting polarization of the Trump era and expose the consequences of a primary system that increasingly rewards those who appeal to the fringes.But to date, neither Ms. Abrams nor Mr. Kemp has rushed to occupy that political space. With both candidates bolstered by huge wins in their primaries, there is no clear indication that either plans to abandon their base-driven strategies for a wholesale pivot toward the center. The race has come to be seen, in the words of Mr. Kemp at a Republican unity rally near Atlanta on Thursday night, as a battle for \u201cliterally the soul of our state.\u201dMs. Abrams, 44, a brainy Yale Law graduate from Atlanta, has leveraged the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first female African-American governor to nationalize her campaign and its fund-raising. By contrast, Mr. Kemp, 54, is a drawling agri-businessman from Athens who has revived a populist style that has lain dormant in Georgia since the late 1960s. Both campaigns say they are committed to maximizing turnout by their most rabid supporters rather than moderating in order to broaden their appeal to centrists and independents.\u201cThis is a conversation about what direction we move Georgia in,\u201d Ms. Abrams said at a campaign stop in Atlanta on Friday.In an interview a day earlier, David Ralston, a Republican who is the Georgia House speaker, said, \u201cGeorgians are going to have the clearest choice that they\u2019ve probably ever had in a general election for the office of governor.\u201dTo those in between, the chasm between Mr. Kemp, who has adopted President Trump\u2019s language on guns and immigration, and Ms. Abrams, who supports an assault rifle ban and says her \u201csoul rests with those seeking asylum,\u201d feels as vast as Tallulah Gorge.\u201cIt would be nice if we had a more moderate option,\u201d said Kathrine DeLash, who works at a pet store in suburban Cobb County and doesn\u2019t identify with either political party. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that with the candidates we have right now. The people who shout the most to their own people get the most attention, and it doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re saying as long as they shout the loudest.\u201dLynn Westmoreland, a former Republican congressman from western Georgia, said he could not remember another Georgia campaign where candidates did not reflexively move to the center after securing their nominations. \u201cI think the Republicans are losing the middle, I think the Democrats are losing the middle, and the middle is kind of shrugging like, \u2018O.K., what am I supposed to be doing?\u2019\u201d he said.Former Gov. Roy E. Barnes, the last Democrat to hold the office, mourned what he depicted as the disenfranchisement of the state\u2019s political center.\u201cIn Georgia, we always enjoyed a broad middle and we had a broad consensus,\u201d said Mr. Barnes, who served one term but lost his re-election in 2002 and a comeback bid eight years later. \u201cWe were all very much in favor of public education. We kept really controversial issues down by an unwritten agreement. But the middle has gone, and it has gone to the extremes unfortunately. It is a microcosm of what is happening in the country.\u201dMr. Barnes asserted that neither he nor his two Democratic predecessors, Zell Miller and Joe Frank Harris, could have won their party\u2019s nomination today. Nor, he speculated, could the state\u2019s center-right senior United States senator, Johnny Isakson, win in a Republican primary if he were running without the benefit of incumbency.\u201cI would never write myself off,\u201d said Mr. Isakson, who is serving his third term, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a point. It is a totally different situation.\u201dThe narrow appeals by both candidates have been made possible, to some extent, by the strength of Georgia\u2019s economy. With fewer financial concerns, voters have been freer to side with candidates on the basis of cultural affinity. Mr. Kemp stepped into the spotlight as the homebred embodiment of blunt-talking Trumpism, while Ms. Abrams lent forlorn Georgia Democrats star power and the draw of history.Ms. Abrams streaked into the general election after taking 76 percent of the vote in a two-person primary in May. The results seemed to validate her strategy of registering thousands of young and minority voters and exciting them with an unapologetic appeal to the left. Turnout in the Democratic primary was two-thirds higher than in 2014, nearly equaling that in the Republican primary for the first time in a dozen years.The state\u2019s demographics are shifting rapidly in Ms. Abrams\u2019 favor. Over the last 20 years, when the state\u2019s population ballooned nearly 30 percent to 10.4 million, the share of registered voters who are not white increased to 46 percent from 27 percent, state election data shows. Two of the suburban Atlanta counties that fueled the Republican rise \u2014 Cobb and Gwinnett \u2014 are now so populated by immigrants and African-Americans that they voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump.As in the last several campaign cycles, the question for Ms. Abrams will be whether the electorate has changed enough that a well-funded ground operation can transform a trend into victory.After finishing second in a crowded Republican primary in May, Mr. Kemp stunned his party\u2019s establishment with the magnitude of his victory in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. He took 69 percent against his better-funded rival, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, winning 157 of 159 counties, and finished 12 points ahead in Mr. Cagle\u2019s home county. Mr. Cagle had been the choice of many elected officials and donors, and had won a late endorsement from Governor Deal.Mr. Kemp tied himself inseparably to Mr. Trump. And with shotguns, chain saws and a Ford F-350 as props, his ruthlessly effective ads transformed a man largely unknown into a swaggering defender of restricted borders and the Second Amendment.It is an image, once cemented, that may be tough to soften for female suburban swing voters, a potential opportunity for Ms. Abrams. She said on Friday that she would not be \u201cengaging in divisive culture arguments about who\u2019s angrier or who\u2019s meaner.\u201dAt Thursday\u2019s Republican unity event, where Mr. Cagle and Mr. Deal endorsed Mr. Kemp, there were no boasts of political incorrectness, almost no mentions of Mr. Trump and more focus on continuing the legacy of job growth than deporting undocumented immigrants. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me and my big truck,\u201d Mr. Kemp even said.Instead, Mr. Kemp and his surrogates turned their attention to labeling Ms. Abrams, who has had two unobstructed months to establish herself. Ms. Abrams, Mr. Kemp said, was \u201cbacked by billionaires and socialists who want to make Georgia into California.\u201dBut Mr. Kemp\u2019s strategists said that the more muted tone did not signify a lasting change, and that they planned to hew closely to stimulating the base that gave Mr. Trump a 51 percent to 46 percent victory in Georgia in 2016. Speaking after the rally, for instance, Mr. Kemp reiterated his support for state legislation that would replicate a federal law providing legal protection to individuals and businesses who tailor business practices to their religious beliefs. Opponents of the laws, which exist in several neighboring states, argue that they allow discrimination against serving or employing homosexuals and transgender people.That pledge, and the countrified image Mr. Kemp created for himself in his ads, has prompted nervousness among some business leaders, particularly in Atlanta. The city\u2019s cottage industry is corporate recruitment, often of global firms with diverse workforces, and it remains among the 20 locations in the running for Amazon\u2019s coveted second headquarters. The film industry is now a major presence, thanks to generous tax incentives, and the Super Bowl comes to Atlanta in February.Concerned about condemnation and boycotts, business leaders convinced Mr. Deal to veto so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation in 2016, but some wonder whether they would have the same success with Mr. Kemp. A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown business group, said industries that normally support Republicans were waiting to learn more.\u201cThe main thing is, let\u2019s not do anything to mess up our historic business environment, particularly discriminatory practices of any kind,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cPeople have seen what it\u2019s done in other states.\u201dState Representative Brenda Lopez, a Democrat from Gwinnett County, said voters needed to consider the long-term consequences of the campaign and November\u2019s vote.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about one election cycle of the next governor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what the image of Georgia is going to continue to be nationally and internationally.\u201dFollow Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder on Twitter: @ksacknyt and @alanblinder.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brexit Plans Raise Fears of Food Shortages and Jammed Ports", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Trucks parked along freeways or stuck in gridlocked ports. Food disappearing from supermarket shelves and stocks of medicines under strain. The military on standby, ready to step in to avert crisis.For a British public that has often tuned out from the mind-numbing complexities of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, recent government statements, amplified by raucous newspaper headlines, have finally become comprehensible \u2014 and alarming.For days, talk has swirled about government preparations for a disruptive departure from the European Union without any agreement \u2014 a scenario that could mean new border checks, log-jammed ports, marooned trucks, and food, drugs and other essential supplies drying up.The speculation was prompted by a government promise to prepare for all eventualities, including the extreme one of a \u201cno deal\u201d departure from the European Union, or Brexit. But even before the first of around 70 official \u201cno deal\u201d warning documents for businesses and consumers was published, they had \u2014 through the filter of the British news media \u2014 started to sound ominously reminiscent of rationing and other preparations during World War II.On Monday, the government insisted that it had \u201cno plans\u201d to involve the army and was backpedaling over the timing of the 70 warning notices. They were originally scheduled to appear regularly throughout the summer, something that would have generated maximum publicity. Now, the documents are expected in August and early September, probably in two batches.Already, however, efforts to prepare for the possibility of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit have backfired by drawing attention to the extreme consequences Britain might face, and to the fact that it might not be able to do much to mitigate them.And they have angered the very people they were meant to please: hard-line supporters of Brexit who had been pressing the government to make \u201cno deal\u201d preparations so the country could threaten to walk away from negotiations with the European Union.\u201cIt has not been a tremendous success, and I don\u2019t know what the hell the thinking is,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London.\u201cThis started off as a way to placate the Brexiteers,\u201d he said, \u201cand then it turned into something that the Brexiteers hate because the contingency planning sounds so awful.\u201dNow, with opinion surveys suggesting that worries about chaos are rippling through to the public, Brexit supporters have renewed their denunciations of \u201cproject fear\u201d \u2014 a term they used successfully in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign.They have only themselves to blame. For months they urged the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario to strengthen its negotiating position with the European Union, and Prime Minister Theresa May ultimately relented.Last week Mr. Raab said he would ensure \u201cadequate food supplies\u201d in the event of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, but suggested that this would be the responsibility of the food industry as it would \u201cbe wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling.\u201dIf he expected retailers and suppliers to begin quietly stocking up on essential goods, he seems not to have spoken first to key figures.\u201cStockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit and industry has not been approached by Government to begin planning for this,\u201d the British Retail Consortium, which represents many retail firms, said in a curt statement.\u201cRetailers do not have the facilities to house stockpiled goods and in the case of fresh produce, it is simply not possible to do so,\u201d it added.Others complained that the government looked incompetent and na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea of stockpiling and storage is a red herring,\u201d said Shane Brennan, the chief executive of the Food Storage and Distribution Federation, a trade lobby group.\u201cFood supply systems don\u2019t work like that,\u201d he added. \u201cFood is kept moving. It\u2019s out of the ground and to the point of sale as quickly as possible. The idea of stockpiling it suggests a lack of understanding about how things work.\u201dContracts for food supplies are typically set 12 months ahead, with food arriving via a complex logistics system that runs on a just-in-time basis and often provides three to five days\u2019 supply, it said.\u201cIf there are delays due to added inspections, you have all the Armageddon that goes with that,\u201d said Nigel Jenney, the chief executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, a group that represents companies in that part of the food sector. \u201cThese things are highly perishable, and they can\u2019t sit there for days.\u201dIn theory, both the European Union and Britain have an interest in keeping trade flowing.The British government has negotiated a standstill transition period, during which trading ties would remain the same, from the departure date in March next year until December 2020. The catch is that this is conditional on a withdrawal agreement that still has to be finalized.Robert Hardy, the commercial director of Oakland International, a logistics and distribution specialist, dismissed some of the more dire scenarios and argued that the British authorities would waive the need for trucks to be stopped at key ports like Dover.Customs formalities could be performed later in the process, something permitted under existing rules, Mr. Hardy said.\u201cFor imports I don\u2019t see any major changes,\u201d he said.That said, he acknowledged that there could be big problems for exporters if \u2014 as is likely \u2014 officials in France were to impose new checks. Others point out that trucks delivering supplies to Britain would have difficulties getting home, thereby disrupting the supply chain and affecting imports.Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents food and nonalcoholic drinks manufacturers, said the group was investigating strategies to limit the impact of a no-deal Brexit.But the scope for stockpiling is limited by the cost, the availability of storage space and by the fact that fresh food spoils quickly.\u201cWe are not going to run out of food \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the return of rationing,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cBut there could be some shortages and an erosion of choice.\u201dFor the government, there is one small silver lining to yet another bad Brexit news story.If Mrs. May can negotiate a deal with the European Union in the fall, and avoid a disruptive exit from the bloc, her agreement will sound better than the chaos of the \u201cno deal\u201d alternative, Mr. Menon said. \u201cPerhaps it helps Theresa May to point back to all the speculation about \u2018no deal\u2019 and say, \u2018At least I have avoided all that,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cisco Chief Executive\u2019s New Mantra: Simplify Computer Networks", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Over more than three decades, Cisco Systems became a Silicon Valley giant partly because of one facet of its business: technological complexity.Managing Cisco\u2019s many varieties of networking equipment, which help computers exchange data, became such a convoluted process over time that customers who learned to do so became loath to try competing products.\u201cThe networks that we build we\u2019re going to have to think about fundamentally differently,\u201d Mr. Robbins, 52, told attendees.New Cisco offerings that are based on Mr. Robbins\u2019s streamlining strategy seem to be selling well, reversing years of revenue stagnation for the company\u2019s core business. Since 2015, Cisco\u2019s market capitalization has risen by more than 50 percent to around $200 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s now getting better understood by investors that Cisco is not an incumbent being killed by the cloud,\u201d said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research.Cisco\u2019s momentum is representative of how some older technology giants are finding ways to survive vast changes in their markets, forces that felled earlier standard-bearers like IBM in personal computers and Nokia in mobile phones.\u201cThere is no room for technology religion,\u201d Mr. Robbins said in a recent interview at Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose, indicating that he is open to changing longtime practices.Ten of Cisco\u2019s most prominent executives soon left. Some other senior managers have exited more recently, while the company has also recruited from outside. Of 13 people in Mr. Robbins\u2019s top executive circle, 12 are new to that role. One key appointment was David Goeckeler, an executive vice president who was given responsibility for all networking offerings and security products. Mr. Robbins said Cisco needed faster decision-making and new skills.One reason for urgency: By mid-2015, Cisco\u2019s business of networking switches and routers was no longer growing predictably. Some longtime telecom customers had turned to lower-priced networking hardware and new software that made it easier to run systems from multiple vendors. Cisco had also largely failed to win over big cloud-computing specialists, a group led by Amazon.Mr. Robbins persuaded Cisco\u2019s board to shift research and development dollars back to networking. One key focus was a little-noticed company stronghold: the closets of many businesses where boxes, wires and Wi-Fi connect PCs and other devices to the internet.Those campus networks, as they are called, are not easily disrupted by newer technologies like cloud computing; even ardent fans of such services need boxes to connect users to the web.Mr. Robbins specifically pointed to a new line of switching systems called the Catalyst 9000, which has some novel features, including the ability to scan packets of data for malicious software even if they are encrypted. In just the past three quarters, it has been purchased by 5,800 customers, a record order rate for the company.Catalyst 9000 also comes with new software used to manage the systems, called DNA Center, which provides a kind of digital dashboard for all the devices connected to a corporate network. The software streamlines what technicians need to do, which previously involved typing in an arcane set of text commands for each networking device to configure and make changes to a network. Cisco estimates that it has taught that skill to more than six million people over the years, building customer loyalty through their investment in training.But the labor to manage that complexity has turned into a liability, Mr. Robbins said. Companies often spend $15 in operating costs over five years for each dollar spent on network technology, he said.Seth Price, who manages networks operated by Durham County, N.C., estimated that DNA Center and other Cisco software had reduced the time needed to resolve service problems by 80 percent. Finding and isolating a computer infected with malware \u2014 a job that once took months \u2014 now takes hours, he said.DNA Center is also designed to improve security by making it easier to restrict what devices can communicate with one another. That was a key selling point for Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, which has to worry about protecting computers, medical instruments and other devices, said Steven Garske, its chief information officer. The hospital decided to buy 350 of the Catalyst devices last July.The latest Cisco technology works like \u201cdigital alchemy,\u201d said Jerry Sheehan, chief information officer at Montana State University, which is also testing DNA Center.Some competitors question whether Cisco, which has long specialized in hardware, has what it takes to thrive as software becomes a decisive differentiator.\u201cI think they have a difficult transition from where they are,\u201d said Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey are running uncontested,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Facial Recognition Wrongly Identifies 28 Lawmakers, A.C.L.U. Says", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepresentative John Lewis of Georgia and Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois are both Democrats, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights leaders.But facial recognition technology made by Amazon, which is being used by some police departments and other organizations, incorrectly matched the lawmakers with people who had been charged with a crime, the American Civil Liberties Union reported on Thursday morning.The errors emerged as part of a larger test in which the civil liberties group used Amazon\u2019s facial software to compare the photos of all federal lawmakers against a database of 25,000 publicly available mug shots. In the test, the Amazon technology incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress with people who had been arrested, amounting to a 5 percent error rate among legislators.The test disproportionally misidentified African-American and Latino members of Congress as the people in mug shots.In the letter, the lawmakers asked for details on how Amazon tested its facial technology for accuracy and bias. They also requested a list of all government agencies using Amazon\u2019s facial technology as well as all law enforcement and intelligence agencies Amazon had communicated with about the system.Nina Lindsey, an Amazon Web Services spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company\u2019s customers had used its facial recognition technology for various beneficial purposes, including preventing human trafficking and reuniting missing children with their families. She added that the A.C.L.U. had used the company\u2019s face-matching technology, called Amazon Rekognition, differently during its test than the company recommended for law enforcement customers.For one thing, she said, police departments do not typically use the software to make fully autonomous decisions about people\u2019s identities. \u201cIt is worth noting that in real-world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgment,\u201d Ms. Lindsey said in the statement.She also noted that the A.C.L.U had used the system\u2019s default setting for matches, called a \u201cconfidence threshold,\u201d of 80 percent. That means the group counted any face matches the system proposed that had a similarity score of 80 percent or more. Amazon itself uses the same percentage in one facial recognition example on its site describing matching an employee\u2019s face with a work ID badge. But Ms. Lindsey said Amazon recommended that police departments use a much higher similarity score \u2014 95 percent \u2014 to reduce the likelihood of erroneous matches.Facial recognition \u2014 a technology that can be used to identify unknown people in photos or videos without their knowledge or permission \u2014 is fast becoming a top target for civil liberties groups and privacy experts.Over the last two months, Amazon has come under increasing pressure for selling its Rekognition technology to law enforcement agencies. The company has sold the service as a way for police departments to easily identify suspects in photos or videos.Mr. Snow of the A.C.L.U. said his group\u2019s test of Amazon\u2019s software should push Congress to put a moratorium on law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition technology.In the civil liberties group\u2019s test, the Amazon software misidentified several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Mr. Lewis and Mr. Rush, as other people who had been arrested.\u201cWe think these test results really raise the concern that facial recognition has a race problem,\u201d said Mr. Snow, the A.C.L.U. lawyer.Advertisement"}

No one mistook it for the real thing, but it did lend him a raffish Sammy Davis Jr.-like charm.\u201cAmerica\u2019s house pets have worked their way into a new place in the hearts, homes, and wallets of their owners,\u201d Michael Schaffer wrote in \u201cOne Nation Under Dog: Americans\u2019 Love Affair With Our Dogs.\u201d Not for nothing are they now nicknamed \u201cfur babies\u201d: Stop by Urth Caffe in West Hollywood, Calif., or Barking Dog Restaurant in New York on any given afternoon and you\u2019ll find the place crawling with strollers that hold not mewling infants but yapping Havanese and drooling doodles.Some dogs and cats are having as much so-called work done as Beverly Hills house spouses.Dogs and cats are also going under the knife for hip replacements, heart surgery, even gender reassignment. Transgender pets usually fall into one of two categories: animals whose birth sex poses health issues (like Bishop, a German shepherd from Chicago who became Bishy to get rid of the stones lodged in his bladder and penis) or those with risks tied to being born intersex (Red, a California Pomeranian whose male organs were removed to reduce the chance of cancer). But perhaps in time the growing trans pet community will embrace its gender-nonconforming brothers and sisters (male dogs who squat to urinate, females who mount).As for cisgender pets, they have plenty of opportunities these days to express themselves. Dog grooming, for instance, no longer means a flea bath and a clipping. Dogs are having their tresses colored, straightened, curled and waved. They\u2019re getting mohawks and fauxhawks, lion cuts and teddy bear cuts. They\u2019re volumizing with feathers and accessorizing with beads.Mr. Bendersky is also getting a lot of requests for French \u201cpawdicures,\u201d pink and purple highlights, and, \u201cfor that extra rock \u2019n\u2019 roll edge,\u201d glitter tattoos.A busy day at the salon may be followed by a chill session at the spa. Dogs are wallowing in mud baths and detox wraps, hot oil treatments and blueberry facials. The Deep Sea mineral mud mask and oatmeal soak with \u201chydrosurge\u201d are popular treatments at the Barkley Pet Hotel and Day Spa in Westlake Village, Calif., a luxurious resort where four-legged guests can sprawl on wrought iron beds and watch DOGTV on flat screens.(Like their human equivalents, the pet resorts and boutique hotels that have sprung up across the country build their brands with distinctive amenities: Stay Dog Hotel, in Chicago, has riverfront suites and a lap pool; Oh My Dog!, in Scottsdale, Ariz., offers dog yoga (\u201cdoga\u201d) and a retail boutique with handmade, locally sourced apparel.) As our dogs\u2019 and cats\u2019 \u201clifestyles\u201d \u2014 a popular term in the pet care industry \u2014 increasingly mirror our own, greenness, mindfulness and wellness have become other marketing buzzwords. The food aisles at the local pet store look more and more like those at the nearest Whole Foods: locally sourced produce; cage-free poultry; grain-free, pesticide-free, gluten-free everything else. Dogs are losing weight and gaining muscle on the canine version of the Paleo diet: raw vegetables and raw meat, just like they consumed in the Stone Age, except now it comes frozen or freeze-dried. Petco recently signed a deal with JustFoodForDogs, a Southern California purveyor of \u201chandcrafted\u201d meals with \u201chuman quality ingredients,\u201d to install in its stores the answer to Whole Foods\u2019 juice bars and sushi stations: exhibition kitchens and pantries where pets and pet parents will be able to watch chefs prepare the company\u2019s signature dishes \u2014 venison and squash, say, or chicken stir fry. Couch potatoes (biped and quadruped) can enjoy home delivery of prepared meals from JustFoodForDogs and other takeout services; for a festive touch, serve with dog beer or cat wine (nonalcoholic, available through Amazon).Dogs and cats are indulging in cannabis as well, and not just by getting into their owners\u2019 weed brownies. Start-up companies are marketing CBD, or cannabidiol (a non-psychoactive compound in cannabis), in the form of pet treats, sprays, even lip balms that provide relief, they promise, from ailments including anxiety and cancer. \u201cThere are a hundred claims for what it does,\u201d said Lynn Hirshfield, whose Los Angeles-based business Leafy Dog makes peanut butter and grain-free CBD pet treats. \u201cCan I send you some biscuits for Miles?\u201dAt 5 months old, Miles was afflicted with nothing more serious than a surplus of energy, I thought. But after speaking with Ms. Hirshfield I wondered if he may also have a touch of obsessive-compulsive disorder. She sent over a box of artisanal hemp dog biscuits. Strangely \u2014 because this is a dog whose appetite extends to ear plugs, coffee beans and small rocks \u2014 he sniffed at one of the cute bone-shaped crackers, then wandered off to consume some more pebbles.Remember when alternative health care for your pet meant acupuncture or chiropractic? I recently learned that a friend is treating his pit mix\u2019s stress with lavender aromatherapy. Does your cat have arthritis? Consider the Ayurvedic herbs boswellia and ashwagandha. Is your dog constipated? Book a Tui-Na massage to balance her chi. Is she just run down? Hire a reiki master to realign her chakras.Perhaps the problem is more psychological than somatic. A growing number of animal shrinks, or veterinary behaviorists, are treating pets with drugs and therapy for issues rooted in early childhood and beyond. \u201cWhen they find themselves in the pressure cooker of life, animals\u2019 emotions can erupt into psychological problems that in many ways are similar to the ones we get,\u201d said Nicholas Dodman, the program director of the animal behavior department of clinical sciences at Tufts University and the author of \u201cPets on the Couch: Neurotic Dogs, Compulsive Cats, Anxious Birds, and the New Science of Animal Psychiatry.\u201d In particular, veterinarians are making use of advances in psychopharmacology. \u201cPuppy Prozac\u201d is so last decade: Dr. Dodman, who has diagnosed Tourette\u2019s syndrome in racehorses and autism in bull terriers, ticked off an extensive if familiar-sounding list of remedies for mental disorders in animals: Buspar to treat anxiety, Ritalin for A.D.H.D., Xanax for phobias, an arsenal of S.S.R.I.s for depression, PTSD, and O.C.D.For a less clinical approach to little Bella\u2019s acting out, there are, perhaps not surprisingly, life coaches. \u201cFor me and for my clients the dog is a family member,\u201d said Tamar Geller, a dog life coach and an author of \u201cThe Loved Dog.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m interested in how I can empower that family member to be all that she can be.\u201d I mentioned to her that Miles tended to be a little over-caffeinated. \u201cChances are he has a lot more to offer, like a gifted child,\u201d Ms. Geller said. \u201cThat takes a different level of you showing up as a parent. There are some dogs who are just the Ferrari of dogs, and we treat them as if they are Hondas.\u201dThe opportunities for treating our pets like Ferraris, or at least like high-maintenance children, would seem to be as plentiful as those for coddling ourselves. Maybe more so. Cloning is not the only form of extreme pet devotion to elicit pushback. Many trainers take a dim view of babying and otherwise anthropomorphizing our pets. \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes that dog owners can make is assuming that dogs feel and think like people do,\u201d warns the best known dog trainer in the country, Cesar Millan, a.k.a. the dog whisperer, on his website. (Mr. Millan was unavailable for comment, presumably because he was busy manifesting calm, assertive energy in the company of alpha Rottweilers and snarling Chihuahuas.) \u201cDogs live solely in an instinctual world,\u201d the site also says, \u201cand it is up to us as Pack Leaders to meet them there.\u201d I\u2019m not sure whose world we\u2019ve been living in at our house, but it\u2019s definitely a new one. In addition to my experiments with hemp biscuits and life coaching, I recently upgraded Miles\u2019s wardrobe. I got him a vibey, tribal-looking \u201cMama\u2019s Mambo\u201d collar, made of a repurposed textile, from Beast and Babe, a company in Venice, Calif., that donates a percentage of its proceeds to a nonprofit offering free spaying and neutering in Mexico. The collar only added to the natural swagger of a pug with a Don Corleone underbite. (If he suspects he\u2019s not the local \u201cpack leader,\u201d he\u2019s not letting on.) And it felt good to know we were helping to address dog overpopulation in Mexico. Even if it seemed unlikely that any of the beneficiaries would ever see a pair of Neuticles.  Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employee Uprisings Sweep Many Tech Companies. Not Twitter.", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWorkers across the technology industry are forcing their employers to reconsider how their products are being used by the United States government.But it\u2019s premature to declare those giant tech companies as suddenly woke. The government contracts in question are inconsequential to their fortunes.A better test of tech-worker activism would involve a company with a primary product that is being used to inject misinformation and authoritarian speech into mainstream conversation \u2014 and, more to the point, a company that appears to have directly benefited from the toxic flood of political vitriol in which all of us are now drowning.In other words: Will there be an employee uprising at Twitter?The social network favored by President Trump has a complicated political ethos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, and the company has reveled in its centrality to viral progressive movements \u2014 the Arab Spring, #BlackLivesMatter, #metoo and #MarchForOurLives were all animated by forces on Twitter.The tension between Twitter\u2019s liberal employee base and the service\u2019s role in news and politics has only heightened recently. For years, Twitter\u2019s business looked gloomy; with about 300 million users, it had a fraction of Facebook\u2019s billions of members, and it struggled to convince advertisers and the mainstream public of its relevance. But in the last 18 months, Twitter found a new focus in the news. The company shed ancillary businesses and tweaked its central feed to highlight virality, turning Twitter into a bruising barroom brawl featuring the most contentious political and cultural fights of the day.Perhaps. But at what cost to the world?Twitter declined to make Mr. Dorsey available for an interview. The company did put me on the phone with Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal, policy, trust and safety, who echoed the idea that there is robust debate within Twitter about its impact on the world.\u201cA lot of our employees are here because they\u2019re tied to the mission that we\u2019re serving and to our purpose in the world,\u201d Ms. Gadde said. She defined that mission as providing \u201ca healthy public conversation,\u201d but acknowledged the company has had trouble defining exactly what such a healthy conversation might look like.To critics, Twitter\u2019s call for outside help in deciding the most straightforward element of its platform feels like part of a familiar pattern at the company \u2014 slow-walking a response to problems that have long been obvious to users, and that grow more obvious by the day.After all, isn\u2019t there enough evidence already that conversations on Twitter aren\u2019t very healthy?Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was the study\u2019s lead author, suggested that there were several ways Twitter could address this disparity, including by providing users with stats on their behavior. She also said that what happened on Twitter had real-world consequences.\u201cBecause it\u2019s this insular community of journalists following other journalists, when people think of someone who they might like to hire, people whose names keep showing up in their Twitter feeds are first of mind,\u201d Dr. Usher said.You might argue that it is too much to ask Twitter to consider its effect on long-simmering social problems like gender inequality. So let\u2019s look at a more direct way that Twitter impacts discourse: Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, which are very likely to become even more important as the political season heats up before the midterms.But what if that \u201cimportant information\u201d conflicts with Twitter\u2019s mission to promote a healthy public conversation?Sooner or later, Twitter\u2019s executives and employees are going to have to make a decision about which is more important, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets or the company\u2019s desire to promote a healthy public conversation. It\u2019s hard to see how both are tenable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Combat China\u2019s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAt the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow?These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn\u2019t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout?Here\u2019s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you\u2019re used to, could plan a role in the future.Does this sound un-American? It shouldn\u2019t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries\u2019 advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries.But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of \u2014 and will own \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy.You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in?But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. \u201cLife science and software get a lot of money,\u201d he said.I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development.But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China\u2019s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry.One huge problem with today\u2019s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now \u2014 as we\u2019re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy \u2014 there\u2019s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise.Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today\u2019s miracles.It\u2019s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes.A federal plan to win this or that industry isn\u2019t guaranteed to work. But at least it will prompt us, as a country, to think about what\u2019s coming.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How 2 Media Moguls\u2019 Once-Warm Friendship Turned Frigid", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen CBS filed suit to strip Shari E. Redstone of her voting control of the company in May, no one purported to be more surprised \u2014 and hurt \u2014 than Ms. Redstone herself.Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have been.Ms. Redstone gained control of National Amusements, the Redstone family enterprise, from her 95-year-old father, Sumner M. Redstone. He had turned a small chain of movie theaters into a multibillion-dollar media empire spanning broadcast networks, cable television and films.It was Mr. Redstone\u2019s idea back in 2005 to split CBS and Viacom, on the then-reasonable theory that Viacom, with its Paramount film studio and cable channels Nickelodeon and MTV, would command a higher stock price on its own than coupled with the slower-growth CBS, with its broadcast network and book publisher, Simon and Schuster.But CBS, under Mr. Moonves\u2019s leadership, proved far more adept than Viacom at navigating a fast-changing media landscape.Once Ms. Redstone gained control of Viacom two years ago, the company\u2019s board fired its chief executive and replaced him with Robert A. Bakish, who had worked at Viacom for over 20 years. That decision has loomed over the CBS drama.On Jan. 16, the two met alone at Mr. Moonves\u2019s CBS office in Los Angeles, and Ms. Redstone told him that she would be willing to give up voting control of a reunited company. She, too, was eager to focus more on her family and philanthropic interests, she said.Ms. Redstone also proposed adding Richard Parsons, the former chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, to CBS\u2019s board. Mr. Moonves didn\u2019t object; Mr. Parsons is much admired in the media and entertainment industries.Still, to CBS it was a sign that Ms. Redstone was injecting herself into the choice of board members. That raised the specter of a repeat of what had happened at Viacom \u2014 when Ms. Redstone had purged the board allied with the previous chief executive \u2014 especially since Ms. Redstone also wanted to remove another CBS director and Moonves ally, Charles Gifford.According to the National Amusements complaint, Ms. Redstone wasn\u2019t trying to wrest control of CBS\u2019s board. Rather, Mr. Gifford, a former top banking executive, had offended Ms. Redstone at the 2017 Super Bowl in Houston when he acted in an \u201cintimidating and bullying\u201d manner, \u201cgrabbing her face and directing her to listen to him.\u201dMr. Gifford, who was using a cane as he walked on the field before the game, has said he was simply trying to hug Ms. Redstone as a greeting.Adding to Mr. Moonves\u2019s anxieties about Ms. Redstone\u2019s intentions, she told him at the January meeting that it was important for Viacom\u2019s Mr. Bakish to have a \u201csignificant\u201d role in a merged CBS-Viacom. According to National Amusements, Mr. Moonves asked if that meant Mr. Bakish had to be his \u201cNo. 2,\u201d and Ms. Redstone stressed that it only meant he had to have a \u201cmeaningful role.\u201d (CBS acknowledges that Mr. Bakish\u2019s role was discussed, but otherwise denies this account.) For his part, Mr. Moonves felt the merger could succeed only if he had the unfettered ability to select his own management team.Despite the tension, in the next few months special committees of each company\u2019s board began discussing a potential merger. On April 3, CNBC\u2019s David Faber reported CBS\u2019s proposed merger terms \u2014 which is how Ms. Redstone first learned them, according to National Amusements. As the controlling shareholder, she felt she at least deserved a phone call.A month later, on May 1, Mr. Moonves and Ms. Redstone met at Mr. Moonves\u2019s Park Avenue apartment to discuss the Gifford and Bakish issues. This time, each brought along a witness: Mr. Parsons for Ms. Redstone, and the CBS director Bruce S. Gordon, a former chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., for Mr. Moonves. It was hardly a sign of mutual trust.From Ms. Redstone\u2019s standpoint, Mr. Moonves seemed jealous of Mr. Bakish, who she felt was doing a good job reviving a demoralized Viacom. Mr. Moonves complained that she \u201cliked Mr. Bakish more than him,\u201d according to National Amusements. Ms. Redstone tried to assuage Mr. Moonves\u2019s concerns, telling him that she \u201chad a closer personal relationship with Mr. Moonves than with Mr. Bakish\u201d and that she wanted Mr. Moonves to run the combined company. Still, she wouldn\u2019t insist that Mr. Bakish be part of the management team, she at least wanted him on the board of the combined company. Mr. Moonves was noncommittal. (CBS denies that any of this was said.)The conversation turned to Joseph Ianniello, CBS\u2019s chief operating officer and Mr. Moonves\u2019s No. 2. Mr. Moonves complained that Ms. Redstone didn\u2019t like Mr. Ianniello. She responded that she \u201cbarely knew him\u201d but that he shouldn\u2019t be a candidate to run the merged company or be Mr. Moonves\u2019s heir because he\u2019d never been a chief executive. (CBS acknowledges that Mr. Moonves raised the issue of \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d Ms. Redstone had made about Mr. Ianniello, but otherwise denies she made those comments.)And Ms. Redstone again insisted that Mr. Gifford leave the board.When the meeting ended, the two sides were at loggerheads over who would run the merged company and whether Mr. Gifford would serve on the board.In what is likely the most startling revelation in the lawsuit, National Amusements maintains that Ms. Redstone was cooling on the idea of the merger, not because she felt it no longer made strategic sense, but because she doubted that Mr. Moonves would accept Mr. Bakish in any capacity, and without him, she didn\u2019t believe that a merger would work. She began expressing this view to Viacom directors and to Mr. Bakish, though not to anyone at CBS.Mr. Moonves and CBS had also turned against the merger, though they still believed Ms. Redstone was likely to force it through, even if the CBS board recommended against it. From CBS\u2019s perspective, that was why Ms. Redstone wanted to get rid of Mr. Gifford \u2014 it was a first step toward handpicking a board that would execute the merger.Mr. Moonves never got back to Ms. Redstone about Mr. Bakish and Mr. Gifford. Instead, on May 14, CBS filed the lawsuit to strip Ms. Redstone of voting control, dropping any pretense of friendliness or cooperation.The irony is that, although both sides deeply distrust each other, the broad contours of the narrative aren\u2019t in dispute. That suggests the two sides aren\u2019t really that far apart.Most important, neither wants a merger. If CBS and Viacom remain separate companies, with separate boards and management, there\u2019s no need to pick between Mr. Moonves, who could remain CBS\u2019s chief executive, and Mr. Bakish, who could continue his turnaround effort at Viacom. The CBS board could develop its own succession plan.Alone or together, CBS and Viacom are potential takeover candidates, as shown by the recent bidding war for most assets of 21st Century Fox. The companies would be even more attractive \u2014 and would very likely fetch more money \u2014 if Ms. Redstone gave up her voting control. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to go that far, she could signal her openness to acquisition offers.In short, if Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves really care about shareholders as much as they claim, they should bury the hatchet and drop the lawsuits.That is probably too much to hope for. Feelings are so intense that Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves can hardly be in the same room together. This month, they both attended the media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, and pointedly avoided each other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Les Moonves, CBS Chief, Faces Inquiry Over Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Corporation and one of the most powerful people in the media business, is facing an investigation after a report published on Friday revealed allegations of sexual harassment made against him by six women.\u201cUpon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action,\u201d the statement said. The board plans to hire a law firm to conduct the review before it takes any action, the company said.CBS shares fell by more than 6 percent Friday when news of the impending New Yorker article was reported.The article, written by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, describes sexual harassment alleged by six women in the entertainment business against Mr. Moonves. It links the accusations to a broader culture of sexual harassment at CBS, with a special focus on CBS News.Four women spoke to Mr. Farrow on the record, including the film and television actress Illeana Douglas. Ms. Douglas described a meeting with Mr. Moonves in 1997 during which, she said, he was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her while holding her down. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous,\u201d she told The New Yorker.Mr. Moonves, 68, began his career as an actor before recasting himself as a Hollywood producer and, later, as a network executive. Under his watch, CBS went from last place in the ratings to the most-watched television network, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon.\u201dMr. Moonves, who became the president of CBS Entertainment in 1995 and the chief executive of the company in 2006, draws an annual pay package of $69.3 million. But his role as company head has been in jeopardy because of his part in a continuing legal battle against CBS\u2019s parent company, National Amusements.In addition to Ms. Douglas, the women who made on-the-record accusations were the writer Janet Jones and the producers Christine Peters and Dinah Kirgo. All of the women said Mr. Moonves had insisted on sexual favors and retaliated against them when they turned him down. The earliest allegations in the article date to the mid-1980s, and the most recent to 2006.In a statement that CBS had earlier shared with The New Yorker, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dCBS, in a separate statement, said it \u201cis very mindful of all workplace issues and takes each report of misconduct very seriously.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe do not believe, however, that the picture of our company created in The New Yorker represents a larger organization that does its best to treat its tens of thousands of employees with dignity and respect.\u201dAfter the CBS board noted the timing of the New Yorker article relative to the legal dispute as part of its statement, Ms. Redstone denied that she had anything to do with Mr. Farrow\u2019s work.\u201cThe malicious insinuation that Ms. Redstone is somehow behind the allegations of inappropriate personal behavior by Mr. Moonves or today\u2019s reports is false and self-serving,\u201d a statement from her representative said. \u201cMs. Redstone hopes that the investigation of these allegations is thorough, open and transparent.\u201dCBS, for years the No. 1 broadcast network, has been one of the best-performing businesses in the media industry. Its success has largely been attributed to Mr. Moonves, who has been praised for his ability to select hit shows. He moves comfortably among Wall Street investors and Hollywood producers, speaking as easily about negotiating carriage fees as he does programming for prime-time audiences.Two months ago, during the network\u2019s rollout of its fall lineup before an audience of advertisers, Mr. Moonves stood on the stage of Carnegie Hall, basking in applause. Those in the crowd were under the impression that they might have been seeing the network\u2019s leader for the last time, because of his battle against Ms. Redstone.As technology giants like Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have pushed into entertainment, media businesses have responded by bulking up through acquisitions. This year, Ms. Redstone asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded that a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenues at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, have been shrinking over the last few years.In May, CBS and Mr. Moonves lost one of the early rounds of the dispute when a judge ruled against CBS\u2019s effort to reduce Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the network.

But he has responded to outsiders with hostility. In 2005, he wounded a Funai official by firing an arrow.Since then, the government has chosen to help the mysterious man from afar, leaving tools and seeds for him to grow crops, and seeking to keep invaders from his habitat, which is a protected indigenous territory.Funai recorded the man at a distance in the new video. Videos such as these are made to justify the legal and regulatory protections that are extended to indigenous territories.Altair Algayer, a Funai official who has been involved in monitoring the man and safeguarding his territory, said he has marveled at the survivor\u2019s determination.For decades, anthropologists and indigenous activists have debated whether they should seek to establish contact with isolated tribes to vaccinate them against diseases that could quickly wipe out isolated communities.Since the late 1980s, the Brazilian government has sought to contact isolated tribes only if it believes they are in imminent danger.Experts say protecting isolated tribes is ever more challenging.\u201cThe problem is that there are no empty spaces in the Amazon,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Carlos Meirelles, a former Funai official who has been working with isolated tribes since 1971. \u201cYou fly over it and see all that forest, but down there, it\u2019s full of people \u2014 drug dealers, illegal loggers and others.\u201d\u201cHe looks healthy, which is very encouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has survived this long in a very violent frontier region of the Amazon.\u201dBudget cuts have forced Funai to shut down monitoring posts in remote areas and its installations have come under attack as miners and loggers have forged deeper into the Amazon. The post responsible for monitoring the lone survivor was ransacked in 2009.Ms. Watson said the man in the video embodied the right to self-determination that the world\u2019s last isolated people should be entitled to.\u201cHe is the ultimate symbol of resilience and resistance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are witnessing genocide in real time.

{"Headline": "Comcast and Fox Engage in Bidding War for Control of Sky", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Comcast\u2019s bid to acquire the bulk of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets appears to be over. Instead, the cable giant will focus on fighting Fox for control of Sky, one of Europe\u2019s most prized media companies.The Philadelphia-based Comcast increased its offer for Sky on Wednesday, valuing the satellite broadcaster at $34 billion, or 26 billion pounds. That topped a bid from 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, that came earlier in the day. Fox\u2019s offer valued Sky at about $32.5 billion. Sky\u2019s independent board had already recommended Comcast\u2019s new terms.But Sky is just one element in a larger, complex corporate showdown. The latest move escalates a war between rival media companies being waged across two continents and involving two different transactions exceeding $100 billion in value in total.Both the Walt Disney Company and Comcast have bid to buy most of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets, including Sky and another growing international business, Star India, which would help increase their global reach. Now, Comcast is unlikely to continue pursuing Fox and will instead concentrate its efforts on acquiring Sky, the people familiar with the process said.Fox has endured a stringent 18-month review of its pursuit of the broadcaster by the British government, which has worried about the potential of Mr. Murdoch acquiring an outsize role in the country\u2019s news industry.The bidding war for Sky comes amid a complex set of requirements under British takeover rules. Disney\u2019s increased bid for Fox also raised the value of the 39 percent of Sky that Fox owns, putting those shares out of sync with the remaining 61 percent. Fox\u2019s original bid for Sky valued it at 23 billion pounds.Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel, the government agency reviewing Sky\u2019s deal, said it had not yet determined if the requirement, known as the \u201cchain principle,\u201d would apply in this case. Normally, the agency mandates a higher price for the full company when one portion of shares are bought through another company. That possibility could tamp down interest in higher bids for Fox, because an increase in Fox\u2019s value could set off rules that would require the buyer to also offer more for the rest of Sky.The panel also has the authority to institute an auction process at any point to determine the best price for Sky.Under the terms of its revised offer, Comcast said it would pay 14.75 pounds per Sky share, about 5 percent higher than Fox\u2019s bid of 14 pounds per Sky share.Both Disney and Comcast consider Sky, which Mr. Murdoch founded three decades ago, to be among Fox\u2019s most desirable assets because its international presence would bolster either company\u2019s global reach. And Sky\u2019s ownership of sports broadcasting rights, notably those for the English Premier League, is especially attractive.Sky has the ability to create content and distribute it through satellite and online video services, a model that American media and telecommunications companies hope to to copy. This would help either Disney or Comcast compete against the streaming services of technology giants like Netflix and Amazon that have upended the media landscape.Keeping up with Silicon Valley\u2019s video ambitions has been a priority for traditional media companies, which have largely decided to compete by opening their wallets to make acquisitions.Comcast said in a statement that it \u201chas long admired Sky and believes it is an outstanding company and a great fit.\u201dEarlier in the day, Fox said in its statement, \u201cThis transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world, but none of whom have demonstrated the same local depth of investment and commitment to the U.K. and to Europe.\u201dHe mounted his latest push in 2016. The effort has been weighed down by British regulators\u2019 concerns that the Murdoch family already exerts too much control over the country\u2019s media. Gaining full control of Sky, including its 24-hour news operation, could go too far, government officials have said.Comcast said it expected to close the Sky acquisition by October.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breaking the Binary", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took anarchy and ayahuasca for a person with retail expertise to see that \u201cthe world\u2019s first gender-free store\u201d was a worthy idea. Rob Smith, the founder of the Phluid Project, went to Burning Man and then a two-week psychedelic-consuming retreat in the Amazon last year and came back committed to leaving his 30-year corporate retail career. Mr. Smith pursued his new dream and opened the Phluid Project in the NoHo section of Manhattan. Though the concept of gender-free may feel familiar in fashion, to invest in actual space for it still requires a revelation in the desert. Then one in the jungle.Retail is an incredibly gender-delineated space. For proof, look no further than this column: It\u2019s traditionally written by a cisgender man and a cisgender woman so that the two distinct categories in the industry can be reviewed. Though New York Fashion Week now has a nonbinary category, and many brands advertise that they embrace any customer (and why wouldn\u2019t they?), brick-and-mortar stores are still mostly organized by gender. To be a gender-nonconforming or nonbinary individual in a retail space can be tense.\u201cI\u2019ve been learning the art of tension diffusion since I was a child,\u201d the comedian Hannah Gadsby said of presenting as \u201cgender not normal\u201d in her Netflix special, \u201cNanette.\u201d \u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t have to invent the tension. I was the tension. And I\u2019m tired of tension. Tension is making me sick.\u201dInside the Phluid Project, tension melted away when I smelled Glisten, a candle with fig, white tea and ginger root. The store\u2019s candles ($40) will be my go-to housewarming gift as long as there are friends in new apartments to sort-of willingly receive them. All of the proceeds from the candle line go to organizations that support L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ communities and youth, like the Trans Women of Color Collective and the Hetrick-Martin Institute. The Phluid Project is a new kind of queer space. At first I wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a store, it\u2019s a community center,\u201d but I realized the truth that honors my understanding of queer history is: It\u2019s not just a community center, it\u2019s a store. \u201cThe world\u2019s first gender-free store\u201d is trademarked. There are rainbow-embroidered shorts ($69.50) and jackets ($98) from Levi\u2019s pride collection, and Superga sneakers with rainbow soles ($85). But there are also capitalist quips on tees, like \u201cGender-Phluid\u201d in the style of the Chick-fil-A logo, and \u201cOptimist\u201d in the style of the Supreme logo.Events at the store include a talk about life hacks (for cutting crop tops and starting a business) with Rio Uribe, the founder of Gypsy Sport, whose long-sleeve tie-dye tees ($128) and velvet skirts ($198) are for sale; Queer Comedy Night; and a Design Challenge, with the prize of having your line manufactured and sold in the store. I love seeing pieces from labels like Gypsy Sport and Chromat, but I think there could be much more.Prices at the Phluid Project go up to $300 so that more people can afford what they see in the store. But shopping is not only for buying. It\u2019s for learning, inspiration and discovery, especially for those who want to be designers or who are finding their personal style. Having a place for everyone to touch and try on well-made clothes without a double take (real or imagined in fear) would be a gift. A credit card can get you helped at most any store. A safe space will let you be.An in-house tailor would be an asset here, too. The Phluid Project has a section dedicated to boxy Champion sweatshirts, basketball shorts ($58) and WeSC bomber jackets. These pieces are extremely cool and do not have gendered labels, which is great. But as I was leaving the store, my impression was that gender-free clothing is shapeless clothing. Still, I know there are to be new designer pop-ups regularly (a \u201cnonbinary beachwear concept collection\u201d by Official Rebrand this week), and the store is evolving. Fluid.As I paid, I noticed a child sitting on a stool peacefully reading \u201cSideways Stories From Wayside School,\u201d guardian shopping nearby. I wished this store had been here when I was this kid's age, even when I was three times as old.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Amazon\u2019s Push Into Prescription Drugs Isn\u2019t a Guaranteed Success", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, but with drugs, it will need to work with powerful entrenched players. But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That\u2019s because to succeed, it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well. As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues, PillPack most likely didn\u2019t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry\u2019s giants, said Eric Percher, an equity research analyst at Nephron Research. PillPack, which was founded in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken. While the company had a niche appeal, many analysts have speculated that Amazon\u2019s true motivation for buying PillPack is to leapfrog its way into the broader prescription drug business because PillPack has pharmacy licenses in 50 states. It also has relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health, that serve as gatekeepers to the majority of Americans who are covered by health insurance.Although that dispute was resolved, Express Scripts said on Friday that its network agreement with PillPack was expiring in July and that the two companies had not reached an agreement on rates. It also said that it was investigating PillPack for \u201cprovider compliance,\u201d although it did not elaborate. CVS Health said PillPack is in \u201cmany\u201d of its pharmacy networks, including for commercially insured consumers as well as Medicare beneficiaries. OptumRx, another large benefit manager, did not comment, although a spokeswoman for PillPack said the company was in OptumRx\u2019s commercial pharmacy network. She declined to comment on the negotiations over the Express Scripts contract.But Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said she was skeptical that Amazon would link up with an established company. \u201cIt\u2019s looking to partner with other innovators, not just your standard vendors like your traditional P.B.M.s,\u201d she said. Any partner \u201cwould have to be one that brings something to the table in an innovative way.\u201dThe months of speculation have allowed competitors to prepare, acting as \u201ca catalyst for participants to close ranks against competition and invest to improve the consumer experience,\u201d Mr. Percher wrote in a research note last week. In a statement, Express Scripts touted the breadth of its services, saying it delivered more than 100 million prescriptions to patients around the country in 2017. \u201cOur scale and quality of care provides patients with access to a broader suite of products than other smaller pharmacies,\u201d the company said.Peter Blicher, 70, of Vacaville, Calif., said he has used several different mail-order pharmacies over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do business with them, takes multiple interaction, the customer service is very poor,\u201d he said. If Amazon were to begin selling prescription drugs, he said, he would sign up. \u201cI haven\u2019t found another e-commerce website that can compare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.Yet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.Facebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.Facial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201dBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.Rochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.At the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.European regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.Nikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201dFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.People could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.But Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.One patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.Another Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.But legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.The case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.If the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Record $2.5 Trillion in Mergers Were Announced in the First Half of 2018", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than $2.5 trillion in mergers were announced during the first half of the year, as fears of Silicon Valley\u2019s growing ambitions helped drive a record run of deal-making.Four of the 10 biggest deals were struck in part to fend off competition from the largest technology companies as the value of acquisitions announced during the first six months of the year increased 61 percent from the same period in 2017, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That has put mergers in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion, which would top 2015 as the largest yearly total on record.Even rising global trade tensions did not manage to stifle acquisitions: Deals involving companies based in different countries nearly doubled compared with the first half of last year, and accounted for more than 40 percent of all announced transactions.Big deals, a number of them in media and health care, have driven much of the activity. So far this year, companies have announced 36 transactions valued at $10 billion or more, according to Thomson Reuters. They combined for $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38 percent of all activity.Competition from the tech sector has pushed the largest media firms to own both the content and the platforms on which it appears. So far this year, the value of the announced media deals has jumped to $323 billion, up nearly 440 percent from a year ago.Even so, the value of so-called cross-border deals jumped to more than $1 trillion in the first half of the year, its second-highest level on record. Acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers jumped 48 percent to $206 billion.A pickup in deal-making since 2015, if history is any indicator, is not necessarily a positive sign for the economy. Other recent peaks in merger and acquisition activity have been followed in short order by a recession.In 1989, deal-making topped out at $558 billion. By July of 1990, though, a recession had set in. Companies announced acquisitions worth a then-record $3.4 trillion in 2000, and within three months the dot-com bubble had burst and the United States economy had fallen into recession. Seven years later, merger activity hit another record, topping $4.1 trillion, but the economy had already slipped into recession as the year came to a close.Stephen F. Arcano, a partner specializing in mergers at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said that while the market for mergers is strong now, there could be reasons to be concerned about a slowdown.\u201cThe fundamentals for a strong M. & A. market are still in place, but there are risks that could become headwinds, such as the concerns regarding potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and, in the longer term, rising interest rates,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Those investments would build on billions of dollars that investors have already put into the companies.The investments reflect facial recognition\u2019s embrace by Beijing, which has created a better environment for companies to test the technology than in the West. And that could help China deploy advanced systems faster and more broadly than America.SenseTime has already raised over $1.6 billion in funding since it was founded in 2014, according to data from S & P Global Market Intelligence, and as recently as May was valued at about $4.5 billion.

{"Headline": "A Cult Show\u2019s Recipe for Success: Whiskey, Twitter and Complex Women", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the Syfy horror western \u201cWynonna Earp,\u201d Tim Rozon plays a version of the gunslinger Doc Holliday, a role that requires him to rock an exceptional mustache and dodge long-limbed monsters while negotiating the existential ups and downs of immortality (it\u2019s a long story).A fan encounter at the first EarperCon UK in London last year brought up none of those things. Rather than discuss an obscure plot point, a young woman wanted to share how the show, which has a number of L.G.B.T. characters, had helped her come out to her father, who brought her to the convention.\u201cIt was awesome and overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Rozon said. \u201cI was thinking, this is about way more than my character running from a tentacle.\u201dThe relationships among the cast and showrunner and \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d fans \u2014 known as \u201cEarpers\u201d \u2014 are so intense, the next year will bring conventions devoted solely to the show in Toronto, Minneapolis, New Orleans and London (again).It\u2019s a striking level of commitment for a program that only debuted two years ago and has aired a total of 25 episodes. But it\u2019s a bond that has helped the Syfy series, which returns July 20 for its third season, not just survive but thrive within the ever-changing pressure cooker of peak TV.With its modest Nielsen ratings, which average less than 900,000 viewers a week, \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d may not have made it past its first season. But as social media and a growing array of viewing platforms give networks more ways to gauge the value of niche audiences \u2014 and executives become more creative about monetizing them \u2014 \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d demonstrates how a distinctive premise, a passionate fan base and a creative team that respects and nurtures that enthusiasm can help an under-the-radar program flourish in a TV landscape that is tough even on acclaimed shows.By contrast, Syfy\u2019s deal with IDW Entertainment, the studio behind \u201cWynonna\u201d \u2014 struck a couple of years after it signed contracts for \u201cThe Expanse\u201d \u2014 gives the network more ways to make money. Commercials in on-air broadcasts, ads within online and app views and a Netflix streaming deal all bring Syfy revenue. It also helps that \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d costs less than \u201cThe Expanse.\u201dBut \u201cWynonna Earp,\u201d the tale of a woman and her allies battling monsters, has a value for Syfy beyond balance sheets, according to Chris McCumber, president of Syfy. Viewership among women aged 18-34 was up 44 percent in the show\u2019s second year, and more than half of the audience is women \u2014 the highest ratio within the otherwise male-skewing Syfy viewership.According to the lore of the show, Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano) is a descendant of Wyatt Earp, who got the clan put under a curse. As the Earp heir, Wynonna is fated to protect the hamlet of Purgatory \u2014 and the world \u2014 from the demons that bedevil the town. She has the special ability to wield Peacemaker, Wyatt\u2019s gun, which she uses to send Purgatory\u2019s \u201cRevenants\u201d back to hell, usually with a quip \u2014 and whiskey \u2014 at the ready.It\u2019s not for every taste \u2014 nor was it meant to be.The show has \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d on the social-media front, Mr. McCumber said. Last year, \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d had an average of 224,000 day-of-air Twitter engagements \u2014 seven times the next highest Syfy series. Overall Twitter activity was up 874 percent in Season 2, according to the firm ListenFirst. \u201cI\u2019m a real believer in social media and people using word of mouth \u2014 that matters more than ever,\u201d Mr. McCumber said.A year ago, Syfy made the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s a Fan Thing\u201d key to its marketing campaigns, thus \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d and its energetic supporters \u201cfit in perfectly with where we were going with the rebrand,\u201d Mr. McCumber said.The core elements of the premise \u2014 rogue tentacles, prickly villains, a found family and swoon-worthy romances \u2014 are familiar to aficionados of genre entertainment. But the twist it put on those basics helped \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d stand out and win fans.Ms. Andras\u2019s feminist outlook is much in evidence. Last season, Wynonna was pregnant (as was Ms. Scrofano), but she didn\u2019t let that slow her down. Both Doc and the former federal agent Xavier Dolls (Shamier Anderson) are attracted to Wynonna, but the romantic possibilities are just a part of the story, not the main point.\u201cShe\u2019s a female protagonist who is likable, but I think she\u2019s likable because of the freedom we had \u2014 she didn\u2019t have to live up to this weird archetype of the \u2018strong female character,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d Ms. Scrofano said.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re moving into a new neighborhood and everyone\u2019s there with cookies. It\u2019s an openhearted fandom,\u201d said David Ozer, the president of IDW Entertainment.They and other fandom leaders, like Bridget Liszewski, the editor of the site The TV Junkies, actively promote and encourage a friendly, tolerant Earper culture that emphasizes consideration and community-building over factional flame wars or personal attacks. Respectful differences are accommodated; toxic meltdowns, like the ones glimpsed in certain sectors of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d fandom, are not. They don\u2019t even record the video hangouts, a decision that aims to make guests, famous and not, \u201cfeel comfortable popping in to have fun,\u201d Mr. Bachelder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to live forever on the internet \u2014 everybody can just be themselves.\u201dAt that point, the most high-profile \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d couple was Waverly (Dominique Provost-Chalkley) and Purgatory cop Nicole Haught (Katherine Barrell) \u2014 a pairing known as \u201cWayHaught.\u201d\u201cI remember someone tweeting to me \u2018I\u2019m scared to fall in love with WayHaught,\u2019 and it broke my heart,\u201d Ms. Ferrar said.Aware of the worry, Ms. Andras made a bold and unusual move, in this era of spoiler-phobic showrunners. She told Ms. Liszewski and others in the media that Waverly and Nicole would survive the first season, and those TV writers spread the news weeks before the season finale.\u201cThe feeling was, \u2018We can enjoy the rest of this ride,\u2019\u201d Liszewski said.\u201cWynonna Earp\u2019s\u201d profile only grew once L.G.B.T. fans came on board in a big way. Twitter trending happened regularly during Season 2 and WayHaught fan art, fan fiction and T-shirts proliferated.\u201cFans love the exploration of L.G.B.T. romance on television. Contrary to the media\u2019s obsession with toxic male fandom, female fandom right now is pushing hard for more diverse and inclusive representation,\u201d said Henry Jenkins, a professor at the University of Southern California and a leading scholar of fan communities. \u201cThese changes can\u2019t happen fast enough, and this show is out front on those issues.\u201dBeing out front on the business side, in creative arenas and in the realms of inclusion and representation has led to a \u201cbright future,\u201d according to Mr. McCumber. And to a packed travel schedule for Ms. Andras and the cast, many of whom will be trekking to multiple conventions during the next year.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade the cult success of this show for billions of dollars,\u201d Ms. Andras said, and then paused. \u201cMaybe one more dollar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Online Hobbyists Can Reaffirm Your Faith in the Internet", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtTo me, a serial hobbyist who has been looking for a saner balance with tech, all this sounded wonderful. In January, I began taking a weekly pottery class at a local arts school. I\u2019m still a novice ceramist at best, but every week, bowl by bowl, I get a little better.There\u2019s something else that has been magical about the experience. Although I took up pottery to go offline, it has driven something surprising for me online: It helped restore my faith in the possibilities and the basic humanity of the internet. Pottery has helped me find a saner, friendlier corner of the internet than the social-networking feeds we are addicted to, one that isn\u2019t completely obsessed with Donald J. Trump, where you get ahead not through pointed, viral quips but through collaboration, persistence and shared ingenuity.I speak of the hobbyist internet. These days, any pastime worth pursuing \u2014 pottery, cooking, gardening, quilting, woodworking and beyond \u2014 attracts a constellation of blogs, message boards, Facebook groups, Amazon reviewers, Instagram and Etsy influencers, and many hundreds of YouTube stars. Collectively, they form the online social structure around any hobby, a group of folks who are only too happy to help you learn whatever you are trying to master.But on the hobbyist internet, the opposite applies.Consider how one gets started with pottery. To make a pot on a potter\u2019s wheel, you must first manipulate your ball of clay so that its center of mass matches the rotational center of the spinning wheel. This goal \u2014 \u201ccentering,\u201d in the jargon \u2014 sounds simple, but figuring out how to do it is a subtle process of trial and error, and there is really only one way to get it right: to try again and again until it clicks.Three months ago, I was stuck in centering hell. I would spend most of my time at the wheel trying to center, but with only two hours a week in class, I was not making much progress. Then I discovered a way to supercharge my training: YouTube, where thousands of ceramists from around the world post videos of themselves making pots.They were revelatory. From the videos, I learned there was no one way to center \u2014 that different potters had developed different techniques and that, by watching closely, I could ape the styles that worked best for me. The videos were no substitute for actual practice, but they were a kind of catalyst. One night a few weeks ago, I spent an hour watching dozens of centering videos. Later, at the wheel, I had a breakthrough; because I had absorbed the online potters\u2019 tricks, centering had clicked for me.While much of this is not new, the way the internet can help steer us toward something useful bears mentioning in a time of growing digital skepticism. It is a reminder that the internet\u2019s most effective trick is connecting disparate individuals into a coherent whole. There are only a small number of potters in any given city, but online there is a whole ceramics metropolis willing to help.This sort of hobbyist collective builds on itself. It lets people new to the hobby pick up the basics \u2014 but by creating new markets for content and equipment, and connecting every hobbyist who has discovered something new to an audience eager to learn every trick, it heightens the experience for people at every level.\u201cThere\u2019s no way anyone would have published that in print,\u201d he said.Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt said the internet still played a key part in expanding his cooking skills. If he is working on a dish from another country, especially one he has not visited, he will often hit YouTube first.\u201cI watch lots of videos of people cooking with their grandmother,\u201d he said.And not just cooking. After moving into a new house that needed remodeling, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt spent the last few months teaching himself a new skill, woodworking, almost entirely from watching YouTube videos. He and his wife have since altered much of their home, raising walls, putting up crown molding and building a laundry room and bathroom from scratch \u2014 including a linen closet with drawers.In some respects, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s experience with woodworking sounds unsurprising: Of course, if you put your mind to it, you can learn something new online.Yet it is rare to hear about the internet\u2019s leading to productive ends anymore. In this era of fakery and propaganda, where everything you encounter online comes to you through a partisan fog, it can sometimes seem as if all that\u2019s connected to the internet turns sour. The beauty of the hobbyist internet is not that it is free of partisan fighting, but that the fighting rarely takes center stage, because everyone is there to get something else done.\u201cI often find it\u2019s a more productive conversation when we\u2019re doing art,\u201d said Leah Kohlenberg, a painter and art teacher who lives in Portland, Ore., and has a thriving business teaching drawing to adults and teenagers around the world over Skype.Ms. Kohlenberg is a liberal who does not support Mr. Trump. \u201cI do have Trump supporters I teach, but when we\u2019re making something, because you\u2019re in the middle of doing it, we\u2019re all focused on something else,\u201d she said.And when people reach artistic breakthroughs together, differences begin to feel minor.\u201cArt is an empowering thing,\u201d Ms. Kohlenberg said. \u201cMost people think they can\u2019t do it, and when they realize they can, it\u2019s amazing \u2014 it opens up a whole new world, and that world doesn\u2019t really have time for a lot of fighting and fussing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

King on a home camcorder; and in 2011, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter helped to fuel the Arab Spring.\u201cIt definitely was one of the reasons why we were able to publish many stories on that,\u201d said Sona Patel, a senior social strategy and U.G.C. editor.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to source 200 people talking about times that they had done something like this,\u201d said Kelly Virella, a Reader Center editor. \u201cA wall automatically goes up.\u201dAnd sometimes, the audience does its own crowdsourcing. Ms. Vaughn, the art teacher, received donations through DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding website for classroom projects, and contributions from her Amazon wish list, in addition to the Durfees\u2019 care package.\u201cThe second I opened the box, the kids had the stencils. They are so starved for supplies,\u201d Ms. Vaughn said. \u201cIt was like Christmas.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Weekend Update anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che will host the ceremony.It\u2019s a new era for the Emmys.The streaming service Netflix led the way with 112 nominations when they were announced on Thursday, snapping HBO\u2019s 17-year streak of being the most nominated network for TV\u2019s most coveted prize.HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d did lead all series with 22 nominations, followed by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC) and \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO), which each had 21, and Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which had 20.The awards will be handed out on Sept. 17.But Netflix\u2019s ascension is one that Hollywood has been anticipating. The streaming service pumps out new shows at a dizzying pace and spends plenty to make them \u2014 it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year, compared with HBO\u2019s $2.5 billion.Netflix\u2019s growth at the Emmys has been staggering. Three years ago it had just 34 nominations, an amount it more than tripled this year.\u201cWe are particularly enthused to see the breadth of our programming celebrated with nominations spread across 40 new and returning titles which showcase our varied and expansive slate \u2014 comedies, dramas, movies, limited series, documentary, variety, animation and reality,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in a statement.Still, Netflix\u2019s Emmy contenders are not expected to capture the top drama and comedy awards. And HBO, which nabbed 108 nominations, does have a 16-year streak of winning the most Emmys.Here are a few other story lines to keep an eye on as the awards show approaches.One of the key questions for Emmy voters: Will it be Westeros or Gilead?With \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d eligible at this year\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards for its not-so-recent seventh season, there will be a showdown between the dragon-fueled HBO juggernaut, twice recognized as best drama, and last year\u2019s top winner, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from Hulu.Or perhaps things will go in another direction.Last year was a year of change at the Emmys with rookie shows like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d all nabbing best drama nominations. They were all among the seven nominees in the best drama category again, with FX\u2019s critical darling \u201cThe Americans\u201d also getting a nod for its final season. It is not unheard-of for Emmy voters to give shows a big trophy on their way out: Series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d all claimed top prizes for their final seasons.The last time the Emmy for best actress in a comedy went to someone not named Julia Louis-Dreyfus, President Barack Obama was in his first term.The race is wide open. Rachel Brosnahan, who stars as a 1950s housewife-turned-comedian in Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d is an early favorite. (She won the Golden Globe in the same category in January.) Others in the running are the two-time nominee Tracee Ellis Ross from \u201cblack-ish,\u201d the seven-time Emmy winner Allison Janney for the CBS sitcom \u201cMom,\u201d Issa Rae from HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d Lily Tomlin from Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d and Pamela Adlon from FX\u2019s \u201cBetter Things.\u201dThe absence of \u201cVeep\u201d also means there will be a new winner in best comedy for the first time in four years. (Since 2007, there have been, remarkably, only three best comedy winners: \u201cVeep,\u201d \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201c30 Rock.\u201d) Donald Glover\u2019s boundary-pushing comedy, \u201cAtlanta,\u201d will be a favorite, along with \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d And for the first time since it has been on the air, the five-time best comedy winner \u201cModern Family\u201d was not nominated.John Oliver stands as the clear favorite in the best variety talk show category, with his weekly HBO series, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d winning the last two years.The show will have a prominent role: Its Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che are hosting this year\u2019s Emmys, and will likely bring several cast members along for the ride. And the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d impresario Lorne Michaels will executive produce the show, the first time he has done so since 1988.NBC\u2019s \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d could make some pop culture history. There are three people attached to NBC\u2019s live musical who are at the doorstep of joining the EGOT club \u2014 the exclusive and somewhat random assortment of people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.John Legend, who played Jesus Christ in the musical and was nominated for best actor in a limited series or movie, won an Oscar in 2015 for best original song for \u201cGlory\u201d from the movie \u201cSelma,\u201d and a Tony for serving as a producer for \u201cJitney,\u201d which won best revival of a play last year. He has also won several Grammys.The musical was nominated for best live variety special.

{"Headline": "There Are No Real Roads in Guadalupe Park. You Earn the Incredible Views.", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecret National ParksGuadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas has a reputation as a hiker\u2019s paradise. It\u2019s deserved. Before we drove the 500 miles from Austin to spend a few days amid the anomalous archipelago of \u201csky islands\u201d that the 86,000-acre park protects, I\u2019d heard two things about Guadalupe: Most people come here to hike to the highest point in Texas. And hardly anybody comes here. This is not well-trod ground. Guadalupe is one of the least visited of the country\u2019s 60 national parks, welcoming just 225,257 people in 2017. By comparison, several million more people swarmed the perennially popular Great Smoky Mountains National Park last year than have wandered out to Guadalupe in the last 47.The land here bears compelling witness to some of the powerful geological forces that have shaped our planet. Two hundred and sixty million years ago, in the age of supercontinent Pangea, this region wasn\u2019t terra firma but a tropical inland sea teeming with still-evolving life-forms; a proto-Vegas pool party of single-celled organisms, algae and sponges with skeletons.Over millions of years, these marine creatures formed a 400-mile-long reef, which ringed the sea\u2019s shoreline. The sea eventually dried up, some 90 percent of all life mysteriously went extinct at the end of the Permian era and the horseshoe-shaped reef was buried for eons beneath mineral salts and sediments. And then, many more millenniums later, large chunks of it were exhumed as uplift pushed its fossil-studded remains skyward and erosion dusted them off. Now, geologists (and the oil and gas companies that employ them) come from around the world to study the well-preserved stratotypes in this extensive desert laboratory.

(The ultra hard-core can now tackle the hundred-mile Guadalupe Ridge Trail, which starts in the park and ends just past Carlsbad Caverns; you\u2019ll need to hire an outfitter to drop water caches along the route.) If I were to boil down my own philosophy on ideal outdoor recreation, \u00e0 la Michael Pollan, it would be, \u201cLong walks. Not too difficult. Mostly shaded.\u201d So, a few phrases jumped out as I skimmed a brochure promoting the park\u2019s day hikes: \u201cExtremely rocky.\u201d \u201cAvoid in midday heat.\u201d \u201cNo trail the last \u00bc mile.\u201d \u201cAvoid during high winds.\u201d \u201cInvolves some scrambling.\u201d There was a chance that I might not be the park\u2019s target audience.At least with three full days ahead of us, we had time to ease our way in before tackling Guadalupe Peak. We poked around a few of the park\u2019s Old West structures, like the rock ruins of the Pinery Station, once a stopover on the Butterfield Overland Mail Route, and the rugged Frijole Ranch compound. Its 1876 stone house and red schoolhouse are now a cultural museum that traces the stories of the region\u2019s early inhabitants, from the Mescalero Apaches, whose mescal cooking pits and petroglyphs have been found nearby, to the hardy (and yes, legume-loving) homesteaders who ingeniously rigged all kinds of handmade contraptions to pump water and keep the gas lamps lit. Behind Frijole, we picked up a trail that leads to two of the six springs that keep this part of the park golf-course green. The only obstacles along the short, wheelchair-accessible paved path to Manzanita Spring, a reed-lined pond that used to be the local swimming hole, were copious ringtail droppings, which looked a little too similar to the cherry pie Larabars I had stashed in my pack. The route got a little rockier as we continued past well-named Nipple Hill until the desert petered out, overtaken by a woodland of maples and oaks, fiery-limbed Texas madrones and maidenhair ferns. \u201cPlease protect this fragile moist oasis,\u201d read a sign near where Smith Spring bubbles up out of the limestone escarpment, \u201cby remaining in the \u2018people section.\u2019\u201d That there is a public \u201cpeople section\u201d is a testament to the vision of a couple of conservation-minded landowners who fell for this alluringly inhospitable part of the world. Both J.C. Hunter, a local county judge, and Wallace Pratt, who was the first geologist on the Humble Oil Company payroll, bought up sizable spreads that were eventually donated or sold to the National Park Service, paving the way for Guadalupe Mountains National Park to be established in 1972. In those early days, it was hotly debated whether the new park should build any roads or facilities to accommodate visitors, or if, as per the Wilderness Act of 1964, it should be left \u201cuntrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\u201d Some boosters worried that without any amenities, only a small segment of the population would be sprightly enough to traverse Guadalupe\u2019s undomesticated backcountry. \u201cGo in while you\u2019re young,\u201d was one wilderness advocate\u2019s rejoinder.As we lumbered along through a sea of spiny ocotillos with red blooms on their fingertips, we had an unadulterated view of the Guads\u2019 much-studied rock exposures. The drive turned out to be a succession of lesser-evil decisions: Do we avoid the small boulder or steer clear of the crater? Gun it up the gravel hill or chance getting stuck in a gully? Sharp tendrils of mesquite scraped the car\u2019s flanks like nails on a chalkboard. It took us an hour to go a little more than seven miles. Lord knows how long it took the mule train that hauled the ranch house\u2019s lumber all this way, but the teal-trimmed structure still stands proud. It\u2019s a tribute to the grit of those for whom the solitude and breathtaking panorama outweighed the lonely toil (though one well-worn, if unconfirmed, story involves a new bride who high-tailed it back to civilization after just one night). After a quick jaunt on foot to get a better look at the oldest rocks in the range, we capped off our brief residency with a picnic on the porch. And then it was back, slow and steady, the way we came.Guadalupe Peak may be the hook that draws visitors in, but it\u2019s just the tip of the park\u2019s sublime iceberg. One route recommended repeatedly was the nearly nine-mile loop through the Bowl, the alpine island in the sky, to Hunter Peak (at 8,377 feet, merely the sixth-highest in Texas). The vistas, we were assured, were even more stunning, plus we wouldn\u2019t have to do any backtracking (though we would have to trudge up one of the steepest grades in the park) and it was far less trafficked. By all accounts, it would be more bang for our buck. I queried the park ranger on duty at the visitor center: Was there any convincing reason we should hike to Guadalupe Peak instead? \u201cWell, you would have that accomplishment,\u201d she said. After roaming through the Bowl\u2019s shallow, secluded valley (we\u2019d see only one other hiker all day), we ascended one more rocky staircase to get to the top of Hunter Peak. There were hundred-mile views of the park\u2019s \u201cgreatest hits\u201d in every direction: We could see the gypsum dunes shimmering on the desert floor, the 45,000-acre relict forest just behind us, El Capitan\u2019s noble profile and, rising above it all, Guadalupe Peak. As we made the long descent, I found myself fixating on the contradictory meanings of the phrase \u201cit\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d Going down proved no easier as we tested fears both known (my husband got to see a rattlesnake\u2019s tonsils) and previously unidentified (I started to panic along several no-margin-for-error precipices). And even though we had been told, insistently and many times, to bring at least a gallon of water per person, we had brought two-ish gallons and ran out less than halfway through. Such a rookie mistake. That evening, after eight hours and four minutes on the trail, as we limped back into the hotel, we passed the Blue Origin team. They were gathered around the courtyard\u2019s fountain, drinking celebratory beers, seemingly as giddy with relief as we were to have made it back down in one piece. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would You Pay $1 Billion for This View?", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "A 157-acre hilltop plot in Los Angeles is being pitched as the city\u2019s most expensive residential property ever.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A property about to go on the market here consists of 157 acres of hilltop land in the coveted Beverly Hills 90210 ZIP code, a 10-minute drive from Rodeo Drive. With its 360-degree views, you can spot many of Los Angeles\u2019s major landmarks in the distance, from Century City to downtown, and even \u2014 on a clear day \u2014 the Pacific Ocean. There are winding, private roads that lead to big, flat lawns the size of football fields.The asking price? A cool $1 billion.Aaron Kirman of Pacific Union Real Estate, the listing agent, recently drove a couple of visitors around the property, reeling off its numerous highlights and noting more than once that it was large enough to hold all of both Disneyland and California Adventure, another Disney park. (The site, which is in an area of Los Angeles known as Beverly Hills Post Office and has been newly branded as the Mountain of Beverly Hills, comes with permission to build nearly 1.5 million square feet of living space across multiple buildings.)With views into some of Los Angeles\u2019s priciest mansions and their swimming pools below, it had the surreal feel of an empty, mountaintop golf course in the middle of a city, with large, manicured lawns kept green by plentiful sprinklers.As Mr. Kirman drove up toward the highest point, a helicopter buzzed by in the distance, not much higher than eye level.Mr. Kirman said the $1 billion price was justified partly because it would be impossible to assemble so much acreage in such a prime location ever again.\u201cThis is a crown jewel,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that billionaire who wants that privacy on the highest peak of Beverly Hills, it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201dAll these properties included houses. This Mountain of Beverly Hills does not. (Up to now, the most expensive vacant properties for sale in the area were 120 acres in Beverly Hills that the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen listed this month for $150 million and a 97-acre lot nearby that is listed at $250 million. Both have yet to find buyers.)Billy Rose, a co-founder and the president of the Agency, a luxury real estate brokerage that is unaffiliated with the billion-dollar listing, said flat lots in the priciest neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills could go for nearly $20 million per acre, and higher if they have views.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing prices for land that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said.Over the past decade or so, Los Angeles\u2019s luxury real estate market \u2014 which, until recently, was considered a bargain compared with other global hubs, like New York and London \u2014 has been experiencing an unprecedented boom. The city is increasingly a draw for wealthy buyers looking for properties that have plentiful indoor and outdoor space.\u201cYou can have a palatial estate here,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy land like this in other major metropolitan cities. Here you can have your house and your car and your garage.\u201dWith so much money pouring into Los Angeles, large estates that were divided into smaller lots in the 1950s and \u201960s are being reassembled, said Jeff Hyland, of Hilton & Hyland, who has Mr. Allen\u2019s listing. But unlike properties during previous booms, the priciest today are often out of reach for Hollywood stars.Billionaires and tech titans are the new trophy estate buyers, said Mr. Hyland, who is also the author of \u201cThe Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills.\u201d Recently, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive, paid $12.9 million for his neighbor\u2019s half-acre, bringing his estate to a total of 2.5 acres.Stephen Shapiro, the president of Westside Estate Agency, said that the market for properties above $60 million was particularly strong but that the Mountain of Beverly Hills was wildly overpriced.\u201cFor a billion dollars, you could buy it multiple times,\u201d he said, adding that he had gotten feelers that suggest $200 million might be within negotiable reach. (Ronald Richards, a lawyer who represents Secured Capital Partners, the current titleholder on the property, said such queries were a common way for lenders to get a sense of whether their debts could quickly be recovered if necessary, not an indicator of the property\u2019s market value.)Though this prime parcel is zoned for six lots, Mr. Kirman is marketing it as a family compound for a single buyer. Pulling out a color-coded spreadsheet that he said included the names of about 2,800 billionaires, he explained that by his calculation, roughly 50 to 100 of the people on that list would be in the market for such a property \u2014 Middle Eastern royalty or a Russian oligarch being a few of the possibilities he bandied about. (It\u2019s unlikely that a developer would be able to make enough money by subdividing such pricey land and building multiple nine-figure mansions to justify the risk.)One challenge: The buyer will have to come with not only an extremely high net worth but also some vision. \u201cTo be impressed by dirt is hard,\u201d Mr. Kirman admitted.Another challenge: This dirt has quite the history. Decades of legal battles, scuttled mansion plans and huge egos partly explain why such vast, beautiful piece of land in the middle of one of the hottest real estate markets in the country remains vacant. Known until recently as the Vineyard Beverly Hills, the property has been the subject of so many lawsuits and ownership disputes that even the lawyers seem to have lost count. Celebrities, including Tom Cruise, have tried to buy it in the past. Previous owners have drawn up grand plans to build homes, never to follow through.In the late 1970s, Shams Pahlavi, an Iranian princess and the older sister of the last shah of Iran, bought the land and made plans to build a giant estate for her family. But in 1979, in the midst of her home country\u2019s revolution, Iranian students in Los Angeles stormed another property she owned in the area, throwing firebombs. That, along with the death of the shah in 1980, prompted her to abandon the plans.In 1987, Merv Griffin, the talk-show host and game-show producer, bought the property with the goal of building a home that would be slightly larger than the producer Aaron Spelling\u2019s mansion \u2014 the largest in Los Angeles at the time, with 56,000 square feet. But he, too, eventually abandoned his plans and sold the Vineyard for $8.5 million in 1997 to Mark R. Hughes, the founder and chief executive of Herbalife.Mr. Hughes, like the owners before him, planned to build a grand home with a bird\u2019s-eye view of the celebrity estates below. In 2000, at 44, he died from an overdose of alcohol and antidepressants. Mr. Hughes had put the property into a family trust, and the sole beneficiary was his son, an only child who was just 8 when his father died.In the years since, the trust\u2019s handling of the property has prompted numerous lawsuits and legal challenges. In 2004, the trustees lent money to an Atlanta developer, Charles Dickens, to buy the property for no money down. Public records show the land sold for $23.75 million. Mr. Dickens, along with Victorino Noval, a philanthropist who, in 1997, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail fraud charges and spent three years at a federal prison, managed the property through a limited liability company for over a decade. They obtained approval to build multiple homes, but they never did.The Mark Hughes Family Trust remained a lender on the property, though its original trustees were removed after a lengthy legal battle, largely as a result of their mismanagement of the Vineyard, according to court documents. (Mr. Dickens couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Victorino Noval did not respond to requests for comment sent through his personal and family foundation websites.)In recent years, the land has been the site of a handful of high-profile events and parties, including Rihanna\u2019s 2014 Diamond Ball, attended by celebrities like Brad Pitt and Kim Kardashian, as well as Oscar parties and other benefits.Public records show that it changed hands most recently in July 2016 when Tower Park Properties L.L.C., which lists Mr. Dickens as an officer, transferred the property to Secured Capital Partners, a separate limited liability company managed by Mr. Noval\u2019s son, Victor Franco Noval.Mr. Richards, the lawyer for Secured Capital Partners, said the elder Mr. Noval was no longer involved. His son took a management role because \u201cit was such a mess that only someone with inside knowledge like a relative would have the sense to say, \u2018This is a good business risk,\u2019\u201d Mr. Richards said. He said Secured Capital Partners had spent \u201cmillions\u201d upgrading the property\u2019s infrastructure, but declined to offer specifics. Victor Franco Noval declined to comment.Partly to emphasize the property\u2019s fresh start, the new ownership changed the name from the Vineyard to the Mountain of Beverly Hills, since it is so large that it\u2019s visible from the flats of Beverly Hills (and because there is, in fact, no vineyard on the property). Mr. Kirman said \u201cauthenticity\u201d was going to be a big part of the branding.Mr. Kirman said he had reached out to five of the billionaires on his list and planned to fly to London, Qatar, Russia and China to meet with as many of them who are already in his network as possible. \u201cEveryone so far has been super intrigued,\u201d he said.He added that in the next few weeks he\u2019d be commissioning a designer to build a large glass cube on the property where he can entertain potential buyers, and that he was considering ways to allow qualified billionaires to spend a night there, possibly Bedouin-tent style.The next owner of the property, Mr. Kirman said, will most likely come from overseas and be looking to make a splash with a bold purchase. \u201cI think the price will make someone quite well known,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

You are right to be scared.Mr. Vaidhyanathan is the author of a book about Facebook.Mail.ru ran applications on Facebook for years before 2015, allowing it to delve into Facebook profiles and activity from millions of users around the world. This was standard Facebook policy. Thousands of companies that built applications on the Facebook platform had access to potentially millions of users\u2019 information. While Americans have been justifiably appalled that an obscure political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had rich behavioral data on at least 87 million voters, we should be more concerned that companies like Mail.ru had access to the same data. A review of the company\u2019s patents indicates Facebook\u2019s commitment to collecting and exploiting detailed personal information.Facebook has no idea how much personal data it let companies have or how far it might have traveled. It might never know. And neither will we. We do know about Mail.ru, although we do not know how the company might have used Facebook data, or what other groups in Russia might have then acquired or used that data. That should be enough to call for stiffer regulatory penalties on Facebook. The European Union\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation might prevent future excesses. Brazil, Japan and South Korea are considering similar protections for its citizens.The process of holding Facebook to account will take many years.

The gaming expo E3 hosted a 100-player tournament that included the rapper Vince Staples, the actor Jon Heder and the mixed martial arts fighter Demetrious Johnson.But what, exactly, is Fortnite? If you are older than, say, 30, and not a teacher or a parent, you might have no idea. This is a guide for the perplexed.Fortnite Battle Royale is a video game that allows as many as 100 people to meet on a virtual island and battle it out to be No. 1.Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, reported in June that 40 million people log on to play it each month.It is available on every major gaming platform, including PC; Mac; consoles like Xbox One, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch; and, most recently, smartphones.The point of the game is simple: Be the last man, woman or child standing. Kill everyone else.It is animated in a fantasy style, more \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d than \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d The effects are not bloody or gruesome. Players can create their own characters and customize them, from what they wear to their victory dances. Accessories and appearances are very important. As in \u201cMinecraft,\u201d there\u2019s a building element.But make no mistake: You are there to kill. You\u2019re running out of time from the moment your feet touch the ground.Another difference from other popular multiplayer games: You can\u2019t save your progress or spawn again after your player dies.Dead is dead.You have to start over, making each match brand-new. Learning survival skills becomes important.Also important: finding weapons. Your character arrives unarmed on the island via hang glider, dropping into the action.A shrinking, bubblelike force field overhead corrals players into an ever-smaller area of the island, forcing them to move around constantly. You can\u2019t just hide and wait to ambush other players. You have to stay on the map, creating fresh opportunities for confrontations with other players that reduce everyone\u2019s chance at survival.\u201cIn Fortnite, you don\u2019t know where everything is,\u201d said Clint Burkhardt, 29, a teacher in the Bronx. \u201cYou constantly have to watch your back, and it is never safe.\u201dFor gamers, particularly those under 18 who play in teams, Fortnite became something of a social club.Most play with a squad of friends from real life or buddies made online. In schools, the game\u2019s arrival on phones meant many distracted students before the end of the recent academic year.\u201cYou can play with your classmates or mostly anybody around the world and maybe you can become best friends,\u201d said Jaden China, 11, of Bergenfield, N.J. They talk over their microphones in the game.It can be addictive.Kevin China, Jaden\u2019s father, said that during the school year he limits his son to only a couple of hours a day, or 10 to 15 hours a week.\u201cHe is just so captivated by the game,\u201d Mr. China said. \u201cWe have to pull him off of it.\u201dMr. China has placed parental controls on the Xbox One he got Jaden for Christmas. He\u2019s not concerned about violence, just screen time \u2014 and accumulating in-game purchases.In four months, Mr. China has spent $140 of real money on things like skins and victory dances for his son. \u201cIt\u2019s $20, or $25, for this or that.\u201dWhen they are not themselves playing, fans of the game are watching others play. Videos of highly skilled players on YouTube and Twitch, the gaming network owned by Amazon, draw large audiences of those hoping to pick up skills and tips from more experienced gamers.Mr. Burkhardt, who teaches students from sixth to 12th grade, said he could usually tell when a student had been up all night playing Fortnite. They would fall asleep in class.\u201cSometimes when a kid does something bad,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll suggest to the parent to take their Fortnite away.\u201dPerhaps. Just this month, a new season timed perfectly for the rest of the summer vacation debuted on Fortnite, bringing new challenges every week for 10 weeks, featuring historical scenarios that include Vikings, pirates and ancient Egyptians, and new tools like a cart to drive around.So, what is Fortnite?\u201cIt\u2019s a good game,\u201d Jaden said.His father disagreed.\u201cI\u2019ve tried to play it,\u201d Mr. China said, \u201cbut long have been the days since I played my Nintendo in 1989.\u201dThe old Nintendo had simple controls, he said, but the Xbox controller \u201chas so many buttons your hand eye coordination has to be super good. It\u2019s like being in a spaceship now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If that doesn\u2019t sit right with you, here\u2019s how to turn it off.Your smart TV is probably tracking everything that appears on the screen. While ad tracking is par for the course on the internet in 2018, smart TVs are particularly interesting. They don\u2019t just track the shows you stream on their built-in apps: they can recognize any show you\u2019re watching, any game you\u2019re playing, or any ad that appears on the screen \u2014 from any device connected to the TV.First, if you don\u2019t use the smart features on your TV, you can block this tracking by simply disconnecting your TV from the internet. Either unplug the Ethernet cable or disconnect it from your Wi-Fi network in the TV\u2019s settings. Without internet access, the TV can\u2019t send information to anyone, meaning your data stays at home. However, it also means your TV\u2019s built-in apps won\u2019t be able to stream any movies or shows, so this solution works only if you get your streaming from a set-top box like the Apple TV (or don\u2019t stream at all).If that isn\u2019t an option, you can keep streaming from your TV and turn automatic content recognition off. The instructions are a little different depending on what model TV you have, but here\u2019s where to look on the most popular brands.If you have a Samsung smart TV, open the home menu and head to Settings > Support > Terms & Policies. Turn off the \u201cViewing Information Services\u201d and \u201cInterest-Based Advertising\u201d options. (Some older models may call this feature \u201cSyncPlus and Marketing\u201d instead.)For LG sets, press the Settings button on your remote and head to All Settings > General > LivePlus and turn it off. You may also want to turn off personalized advertising from All Settings > General > About This TV > User Agreements from the General page. Vizio users will find this option by opening the menu and looking under System > Reset & Admin. Highlight the \u201cViewing Data\u201d option and press the right arrow to turn it off. Some older sets may call this \u201cSmart Interactivity\u201d instead. TVs from TCL, Philips, Sharp and some other brands use Roku as their built-in smart software. On these TVs, you can disable Automatic Content Recognition by opening the home screen heading to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience and disabling \u201cUse Information for TV Inputs\u201d. You may also want to head to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and turn on \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d.Your TV isn\u2019t the only thing tracking your usage. Independent set-top boxes like the Roku and Apple TV don\u2019t use Automatic Content Recognition \u2014 the feature that scans everything from your screen \u2014 but they do still have certain tracking features built-in, usually logging which apps you use and when. If you\u2019re interested in increasing your privacy, you may want to disable these features as well. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find them:There\u2019s no way to escape all tracking, of course, especially if you\u2019re streaming. These settings may limit some data collection, but even they won\u2019t stop the streaming services themselves: apps like Netflix will always track what you watch to provide recommendations, and there\u2019s no getting around that. So if you want true privacy, you\u2019ll need to divorce yourself from streaming services entirely. You\u2019ll just need to decide how much you really care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Want This Tattoo? Get in Line", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeith McCurdy, the owner of Bang Bang, has transformed the body-art industry with his diverse hiring and high prices. Of course there\u2019s a wait list.In a city where high-end hairdressers charge upward of $500 an appointment, it was only a matter of time before tattoos ceased to be a bargain.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d said Jack Powers, a 22-year-old operations manager at a logistics company, putting aside the stuff about death and body decomposition. \u201cYou got to go to the best of the best.\u201d Part of the price is attributable to a so-called celebrity tax: Professionals like personal trainers and cosmetic dermatologists can often double or triple prices after getting publicity from famous clients. It was Rihanna who put the \u201cbang\u201d in Bang Bang.She stumbled upon the shop\u2019s owner, Keith McCurdy, 11 years ago, when he was working at a tattoo and piercing shop on West Fourth Street, one of the few remaining blocks in Lower Manhattan that hasn\u2019t been transformed by luxury-goods boutiques. Rihanna came in for a nipple piercing and walked out with several lines of Sanskrit inked on her hip. Last month, Bang Bang opened a second shop, on Grand Street in SoHo, mere feet from an Alexander Wang store. Mr. McCurdy said the cost of the renovation there was north of $1 million. A look around provides little reason to doubt him. The floors are covered in freshly pressed concrete. A wall of screens displays promotional material about the store\u2019s artists, all shot by a full-time videographer. A large aquarium filled with koi runs across the back wall, by a black steel staircase leading to a downstairs lounge where Fiji water is served by the caseload.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Apple store in here,\u201d Miley Cyrus said Saturday night, when she showed up with a friend to have her mother\u2019s signature inked on her arm and then decided to get a second tattoo on her ankle: slang for part of the female genitalia. For four hours, I was at the next station over, getting a bird tattooed on my arm, at a price that exceeded my last paycheck. (The New York Times does not take freebies.)The fancy digs, celebrity adherents and notorious waits for appointments have earned Mr. McCurdy a fair amount of ire in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m public enemy No. 1,\u201d he said. Really?In a movie about his life, Mr. McCurdy, 32, might be played by Seth Rogen: also a bearish guy who is both delightful and aggressive, nerdy and cool, stoner-ish and Type A \u2014 an empath who loves a brawl.Although Mr. McCurdy has made millions of dollars with his craft, he has no interest in fancy watches, art or real estate. Instead, he sermonizes about simple pleasures like Popsicles and amusement parks, particularly Disney World, which he visits multiple times a year with his employees and sees as a metaphor for what America (and his business) should be: futuristic, easy, open to all races, ages and religions. \u201cThey\u2019re the best people in the world at tricking your eye,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said of Disney, sitting in the lounge on Grand Street, wearing Y3 sweat shorts and a black $10 Goonies T-shirt from Target. Mr. McCurdy\u2019s own story is a triumph of American possibility. He grew up in Claymont, Del. His father, Vincent Lacava, was 16 when Keith was born, and his mother, Susan McCurdy, was 17. Ms. McCurdy and Mr. Lacava broke up soon after. He went off to college, and she dropped out of high school and became a stripper. \u201cThere was no shame around it,\u201d said Mr. McCurdy, who dedicated his book to her. \u201cShe was a feminist, and she paid the bills.\u201d Eventually, she opened a cleaning business, relying heavily on her son. \u201cOne of his chores was to rake the leaves,\u201d Ms. McCurdy said. \u201cI remember one day, I walked onto the deck and he had the other kids raking them for him. But he got it done. He was always a delegator.\u201dAt 15, Mr. McCurdy pressured his mother to let him get a tattoo and they struck a deal. If he made the honor roll \u2014 he was not a good student \u2014 he could get one. Soon enough, they drove to a nearby parlor, where Mr. McCurdy got what he describes as \u201cthe cheesiest version of the Superman logo you have ever seen.\u201dUnlike Clark Kent, though, he dropped out of high school, bought a tattoo kit online for $268 and began practicing on a cousin, Edward Borew, now the manager of the store. In 2004, Mr. McCurdy got his first job as a tattooer, working at Rage of the Needle in New Castle, Del. \u201cIf I made $200 a day, it was awesome,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cThe most money I got was from doing tattoo parties in clients\u2019 houses. Then I could make five or six hundred dollars in a night.\u201dLess than a year later, Mr. McCurdy moved to New York, where he lived with his father, who was working as a video-game designer, in a tiny Midtown studio. Mr. McCurdy took a job tattooing the most inebriated among the Verrazano bridge set, at a West 4th street shop called Crazy Fantasy that also sold sex toys and did piercings, and shared a bathroom with the Papaya Dog next door.Mr. Borew had arrived in New York soon after Mr. McCurdy and had gone to work for Andre Balazs at the Mercer Hotel, where he earned a doctorate in tending to fancy people. Mr. McCurdy moved from Crazy Fantasy to what he called a \u201cslightly less disgusting\u201d shop, Whatever Tattoo.In the foreword for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s book, Rihanna writes that Mr. McCurdy did not even know who she was the night she rolled into Whatever, to her delight: \u201cI remember thinking this guy is gangsta.\u201d Impressed by the Freddy Krueger tattoo he had inked on the shop\u2019s manager and his input on where to place the Sanskrit message, she not only returned for more tattoos but also connected various people in her orbit to Mr. McCurdy.After tabloid coverage, demand for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services grew exponentially. He bounced between Last Rites and East Side Ink, two of New York\u2019s best known high-end tattoo shops, burnishing his star and alienating his bosses.\u201cPeople told me I stepped on people to get where I am,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stepped on people, but I sometimes pushed them out of my way. Wouldn\u2019t everybody?\u201dAt East Side Ink he determined that he was the shop\u2019s biggest earner and pressed for an ownership stake in the business. \u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d said Josh Lord, the owner. At the time, Mr. McCurdy and his wife, Etsuko Tsujimoto, had a young daughter and another one on the way. Soon, he started making arrangements to open his own shop and made offers to a number of people on the staff. Mr. Lord found out about this, and Mr. McCurdy was ultimately fired. Today, Mr. Lord calls Mr. McCurdy \u201cthe worst person\u201d who ever worked for him, which seems slightly out of sync with the offense committed. Unfazed, Mr. McCurdy professes a continued desire to steal Mr. Lord\u2019s best artist, Cheo Park. \u201cI\u2019d make him more money too,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said, adding that it has been a pleasure to \u201ckick their\u201d butts, referring to East Side.Paul Booth, the renowned owner of Last Rites, agreed to give Mr. McCurdy a chair while he was setting up his business. But when Mr. McCurdy was ready to go, he offered jobs to people on Mr. Booth\u2019s staff.In an interview last week, Mr. Booth accused Mr. McCurdy of being a sellout, a man who made \u201ctattooing dumb little things\u201d on celebrities a bigger priority than the art itself. \u201cYou can run for the money or you can run for the art,\u201d Mr. Booth said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could be much richer, but I lay down at night with my integrity intact.\u201d\u201cPlease,\u201d said Mr. Borew, sitting with his cousin. \u201cI was with Paul Booth when Nicolas Cage called him about doing a tattoo. Paul didn\u2019t even get to do it and he was so excited.\u201d The first Bang Bang, on Clinton Street, opened in 2013. Investment money came from Mr. Lacava. But according to Mr. McCurdy, the relationship between father and son deteriorated quickly. \u201cHe was supposed to be handling business matters \u2014 financial, insurance and everything entailing back of the house,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cIt was a disaster. For months, we didn\u2019t even have furniture.\u201d In a text message, Mr. Lacava said, \u201cAlthough Keith and I have different views about what happened with the shop, I wish him continued success.\u201d One day, employees strolled up to the store and found that someone had changed the locks and removed everything overnight. His shop gone and his marriage suffering, Mr. McCurdy moved onto an air mattress in Mr. Borew\u2019s apartment in Queens and spent several months tattooing clients including Selena Gomez at a small studio he rented in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He and his wife went into counseling with Karen Bridbord, a therapist and executive coach. Soon, Dr. Bridbord was advising Mr. McCurdy on how to restart his business. He found a new store (on Broome Street), borrowed money from friends and opened just as Instagram was taking off. Mr. McCurdy posted selfies with his famous clients and sent direct messages to talented artists around the globe, sponsoring some of their visas. He made hiring women a priority and was clear with his staff that tattoo-world misogyny would not be tolerated beneath his roof. \u201cMy daughter is 9,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a feminist button on her backpack and she doesn\u2019t really know what it means, but I want her to have the sense that she can do anything she wants with her life. Sixty-five percent of our customers are women. And we have employees and they have rights.\u201d Inevitably, there has been some #MeTattoo.The issue, JonBoy said in an interview, was \u201cthe perverted jokes I told, the way I behaved in the presence of females.\u201d After four months, Mr. McCurdy and Dr. Bridbord determined that JonBoy had to go. At least for a while. They provided him with the name of a therapist and told him to stay in touch. A year later, he was hired back, on the condition that he remain in treatment. \u201cI see someone every week, and it\u2019s been so helpful,\u201d he said. And the celebrities kept coming. One is Justin Bieber, who has spent more than $60,000 on Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services. He pays a premium to transport his tattooer between coasts and around the world. \u201cUsually it\u2019s a last-minute thing,\u201d Mr. Bieber said by phone last week, as Mr. McCurdy patched him into a call with me and chuckled in the background. \u201cThat makes it difficult on Bang, but he always goes out of his way to make me a priority and it\u2019s why I love him so much. I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in Panama. Can you come out?\u2019\u201d (For $10,000 he did. \u201cI\u2019ve got kids,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cTell me he\u2019s not awesome.\u201d) And sometimes discreet. Mr. McCurdy agreed to tattoo her current favorite food, bacon, only if she put it on the bottom of one of her feet. In retrospect, she thinks that was a fine decision. \u201cI might become a vegan,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are great people who can\u2019t afford to get tattooed by us,\u201d said Balazs Bercsenyi, the 29-year-old artist from Hungary who inked me.One night, a man delivering an Amazon package to the store asked if Kristi Walls worked there. \u201cShe used to be my tattooer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was when she cost less.\u201d But mostly, Mr. Bercsenyi and the other artists are enjoying the premium fees they command.With the SoHo store up and running, Mr. McCurdy is, inevitably, mulling other brand extensions. Later this year, he is introducing a line of tattoo aftercare products. He\u2019d also like to do a show for Netflix and open a Bang Bang in Los Angeles. \u201cWith a pool on the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York is so boring.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018A Different World\u2019 Survived the Downfall of Bill Cosby", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut \u201cA Different World,\u201d the popular \u201cCosby\u201d spinoff that ended its original run 25 years ago this week, doesn\u2019t seem to have inspired the same amount of hand-wringing as its predecessor.Some of the reasons for this continued affection are obvious. While Mr. Cosby\u2019s name appears in the credits for each episode, he only appeared on screen in three of them, all in Season 1. And after that season, which centered on Denise Huxtable\u2019s (Lisa Bonet) transition to university life at the fictional Hillman College, the series was completely revamped.The result of \u2014 and possibly a motivation for \u2014 this separating of art from artist allows the show to be a repository for the tender sentiments that have been displaced by the retroactive tarnishing of \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d\u201cDo we have to cut off the contributions that the show itself made,\u201d she continued, \u201cand all the people that helped contribute to what that was? It\u2019s a tension that feels gross, but at the same time feels necessary.\u201dI agree. But such compartmentalization isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 even if the man himself is not the face of the show, its origins as a spinoff will always linger in plain sight. This becomes particularly noticeable when one considers how some of the subjects \u201cA Different World\u201d addressed, such as sexual assault, have dark resonance in its creator\u2019s private life.Perhaps the comfort of nostalgia cannot and should not ever be completely divorced from the realities of its roots, but the way some of us cope is by transferring all those warm memories onto one work and discarding the ugliest bits of the rest.It\u2019s a selfish compromise, to be sure, one that the women who have come forward with allegations against Mr. Cosby most likely can\u2019t even consider. But it is impossible to totally erase a history as influential as Mr. Cosby\u2019s, and as consumers we can choose how we engage with it ourselves. For me, at least, the choice is holding on tight to the one part that turned out to be the most progressive and ahead of its time \u2014 the part that least resembles its devious creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stream These 10 Emmy Nominees You May Not Have Seen", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere has always been a disparity between critical acclaim and viewership numbers for this consistently excellent series from Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg about Soviet spies in suburbia, but latecomers can be assured that the ending will pay off their investment. The sixth and final season unspools as a nuclear deal between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan brings an end to the Cold War that the central couple, Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, have been fighting so faithfully and catastrophically. The growing divisions within the K.G.B. are manifested in their marriage, which faces its stiffest test as forces gather to upend their cover as a normal American family.Scratch the surface of any do-it-yourself TV cooking and craft show and there\u2019s a whiff of existential despair, a natural byproduct of the relentlessly cheery attitude of hosts who create dishes and tchotchkes for guests that never arrive. \u201cAt Home With Amy Sedaris\u201d evokes that feeling through spectacularly deranged comedy: Although Sedaris\u2019s down-the-dial Martha Stewart labors under a sign that reads \u201cBeing Alone Is A-OK,\u201d she craves company so much, she lets a murderer (Michael Shannon) into the house in the Agatha Christie-themed season finale. Paul Giamatti, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Dratch, Chris Elliott and Michael Stipe are among the many friends who pop in for cameos, but it\u2019s Sedaris, in multiple roles, whose manic brilliance sets the tone.The premise for this black comedy from Bill Hader and Alec Berg makes it sound frivolous and disposable, like a TV version of \u201cGrosse Pointe Blank,\u201d following a contract killer who mingles with ordinary people during off hours. But while \u201cBarry\u201d gets plenty of laughs from Hader\u2019s former-Marine-turned-hit man wandering into the Los Angeles theater scene \u2014 particularly Henry Winkler\u2019s standout performance as a vain yet lovable acting teacher \u2014 the series\u2019 inaugural season grew darker and more emotionally rich as it progressed. Suddenly, a show about a killer\u2019s whimsical side project morphed into a tragicomedy about the torments of a man who can\u2019t transcend or escape the life he\u2019s chosen.The second season of this frank comedy by Pamela Adlon was wrapping up just as news broke that her co-creator and frequent writer, Louis C.K., had been involved in sexual misconduct. Yet the show makes it easy to imagine Adlon\u2019s character, a divorced actress struggling to raise three daughters on her own, persevering through such a terrible setback and continuing to do the best she can. Season 2 of \u201cBetter Things\u201d opens with Adlon\u2019s Sam Fox deftly peeling her 16-year-old away from a suitor 20 years her senior and reaches a touching apotheosis with \u201cEulogy,\u201d in which Sam asks her loved ones to eulogize her while she\u2019s still alive. As ever, she\u2019s bruised but unbowed.Back when he was one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after genre specialists, the creator of \u201cGodless,\u201d Scott Frank (\u201cDead Again,\u201d \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and \u201cMinority Report\u201d), conceived the show as a feature film. But he could never raise the money from a studio system in which the Western had fallen out of favor. By expanding it for a seven-episode Netflix series, Frank takes \u201cGodless\u201d in several directions at once, lifting from sources as diverse as Howard Hawks\u2019s classic jailhouse shoot \u2019em up, \u201cRio Bravo,\u201d and the pitiless Judge Holden character from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d The compelling hook at its core, however, is a besieged town run by the widows of men who lost their lives in a mining accident. Do they even need men? Or rather, will they have a choice?What happens to a show after it essentially blows up its entire premise? That was the question that lingered between the first and second seasons of this much-loved, ratings-deficient afterlife comedy from NBC, which had to pivot from a twist that made its title ironic. Creator Michael Schur (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d) surely has a grand plan in mind, but the second season felt improvised in the best possible sense, shuttling Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and her fellow Good Place residents through multiple fake utopias and celestial bureaucracies, all under the eye of Ted Danson\u2019s cackling architect. But for as much as \u201cThe Good Place\u201d had to change, the show still clung to its optimistic theme about the capacity for self-improvement and how it might be rewarded down the line.After writing and starring in the caustic black comedy \u201cFleabag,\u201d creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge turned to Luke Jennings\u2019s novella series \u201cCodename Villanelle\u201d for her follow-up, a cat-and-mouse thriller that has the same tart, irreverent edge of her previous work. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is a psychopathic assassin, barely contained by the shadowy organization that employs her, and Eve (Sandra Oh) is an MI5 analyst who leaves her post and risks losing everything in an obsessive quest to track her down. As the first season unfolds, Villanelle and Eve start to develop an odd intimacy, as if the efforts to monitor the other inadvertently resulted in a dangerous and unsavory tango. Their relationship nudges \u201cKilling Eve\u201d far-off its expected course and lands the show in fascinating new terrain.The creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) is one of a small handful of television writers whose voice is instantly recognizable \u2014 fast and quippy, with a gift for stylized dialogue that recalls Old Hollywood screwball comedies. With \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d Sherman-Palladino has finally found a period that fully accommodates her sensibility, giving her the opportunity to tell a personal story about a Jewish comedian asserting herself in a male-dominated field. In the impeccably realized world of 1958 New York City, \u201cMidge\u201d Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) plays the role of dutiful housewife until her husband leaves her and she reinvents herself as a stand-up comedian at a Greenwich Village comedy club. Sherman-Palladino spins Midge\u2019s domestic crises into uproarious stage material and keeps the laughs coming as Midge\u2019s life is turned upside down.Based on a series of novels by Edward St Aubyn, \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d sounds like an insufferable dirge, following an upper-class addict as he reels from the death of his abusive father in the 1980s. But although the show does marinate in grief, privilege, self-pity and escalating drug and alcohol consumption, it is also mordantly funny and unexpectedly heartbreaking, grounded by a tour de force performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role. The voiceover narration grants direct access into Patrick\u2019s addled thought processes, but it\u2019s Cumberbatch\u2019s fits of arrogance and despair that hold the series aloft, making it possible to think well of a hero who treats others nearly as shabbily as he treats himself.Amid the current mini-boom of true-crime documentary series, \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d stands out for the complicated questions it raises about spiritual questing, immigration rights and the true beneficiaries of religious freedom in America. The directors Maclain and Chapman Way unearth the forgotten story of the provocative Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his efforts to relocate his followers to a barren ranch in Wasco County, Ore. The Rajneeshees seem like a dangerous cult, as evidenced by its leader\u2019s fleet of Rolls Royces and growing weapons cache, but \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d approaches this story with an even-handedness that doesn\u2019t make them so easy to dismiss. The doc also has an endlessly fascinating anchor in Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh\u2019s former secretary, who led the commune with intimidation and devotion behind the scenes.Advertisement"}

The story of a super-cop literally fighting against his own programming in order to reclaim his humanity \u2014 in a city being stripped for parts by the superrich \u2014 is as poignant now as it was in Reagan\u2019s America.Almost as soon as the TV show \u201cBatman\u201d went off the air, darker material began to ferment in the comic-book depictions of the Caped Crusader and his peers. \u201cBatman\u201d was the blockbuster that brought this grimmer vision roaring into multiplexes and the mainstream consciousness. Directed with confident neo-noir style by Tim Burton, the movie pivoted off works like the cartoonist Frank Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight Returns\u201d and employed an array of talent \u2014 the composer Danny Elfman; the production designer Anton Furst; and Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson as Batman and his psychopathic nemesis, the Joker \u2014 working at or near their career peaks.Almost as soon as the TV show \u201cBatman\u201d went off the air, darker material began to ferment in the comic-book depictions of the Caped Crusader and his peers. \u201cBatman\u201d was the blockbuster that brought this grimmer vision roaring into multiplexes and the mainstream consciousness.

Saturated with songs from \u201990s alt-rock bands like the Cure, Nine Inch Nails, and Stone Temple Pilots, it\u2019s so unrelentingly dark that it crosses the threshold of self-parody and passes right into the sublime.James O\u2019Barr\u2019s cult-favorite black-and-white comic \u201cThe Crow\u201d centers on a beautiful young man named Eric Draven, who is killed by a gang during a vicious sexual assault on his girlfriend and then resurrected to kill them one by one, like a cross between Batman and Jason from \u201cFriday the 13th.\u201d For his live-action adaptation, director Alex Proyas simply imported the comic\u2019s aesthetic and gave it a slight tweak for the post-Nirvana era.

{"Headline": "How the 52 Places Traveler Stays Charged While Chronicling the World", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingYou are endlessly traveling, and you must have to pack light. What are the most crucial tech tools that you pack?Funny thing is, I\u2019d be traveling much lighter if I weren\u2019t dragging around so much tech!Because I\u2019m carting all my own stuff and moving every four or five days, I have to think a lot about size and weight. My MacBook Pro and iPhone X are essentials, as are a Bluetooth keyboard (which I hook up to my phone to write articles when I don\u2019t have my computer), a 2TB hard drive, and a USB-C dongle with multiple USB ports and an SD card reader.You shoot lots of photo and videos to document your travels. What do you do to stay organized or do quick edits on the road?I\u2019m new to iPhones \u2014 I had a Samsung phone I loved before this trip \u2014 and the magic of Airdrop has been a revelation to me. It lets me send photos to my computer and ruthlessly delete them from my phone.What apps have been most useful to you for planning trips or finding things to do?I like to book directly through hotels and airlines, and TripIt has saved me from endlessly searching through my email to find confirmations. You forward emails to the app, and it organizes the information into legs of travel. The app even helps you check into your flights.As for planning, I work with a researcher at The Times, and we communicate over Google Docs. But I\u2019ve found there isn\u2019t a single tech substitute out there for reading articles or random blogs, or doing a web search on \u201cwhere to eat in X,\u201d or asking locals where they like to go.Before I get to a city, I like to take all the recommendations I have and enter them into Google Maps. That way I can strategize my must-sees, but also know where to eat once I finish with that museum.It\u2019s a tossup between Maps and Evernote for which app I use most. Paper clutter is my constant enemy. To avoid taking brochures, I photograph each one I might want to refer to later and put it into Evernote.And a VPN, or a virtual private internet network, is a huge help in countries where I don\u2019t know the language. It makes my phone believe I\u2019m still in the States so my web searches come up in English.Which country has struck you as the most fascinating in terms of how it uses tech? What stood out about it?I was impressed by some 20-somethings from Mexico City who had planned their entire Baja Peninsula vacation through YouTube video searches. And I loved that in Oslo all the buses had USB chargers built into the wall. Not all of them worked, but it was the thoughtfulness that counted.Are there any common tech problems that people seem to experience everywhere? I expected to have bad cell reception in remote northern Iceland, but in Buffalo I couldn\u2019t call a ride share from outside my hotel \u2014 and I have Verizon! In New York State!Hotel Wi-Fi is notoriously awful worldwide. It\u2019s really important as a traveler to anticipate a lack of connectivity. Print out or take a screen shot of important tickets. Save your maps offline in Google or use Maps.me, a worldwide network of offline maps for your phone.Outside of the tech for work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? Is there an app or a piece of tech that you used at home that you would never use on the road?This was a surprise to me, but I had to cancel my Amazon Prime on the road. When I\u2019d fret about losing something, people would always say, \u201cYou can order it off Amazon!\u201d And you can \u2014 if you time it to ship three destinations down the road.But the real issue is returns. I\u2019d get a shipment and find out it had to be sent back through three different carriers, and I\u2019d have to hunt down extra boxes and pay for return shipping \u2014 plus find a shipping place that handled multiple carriers and was open when I could get to it. Instead, I\u2019m having a lot of fun shopping locally.Podcasts, too, were a big part of my New York City life. But on the road, I\u2019m less willing to take the safety risk of putting in earbuds on public transit. And I don\u2019t want to. Being on this trip is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I want to be tuned in as much as I can.Advertisement"}

The Los Angeles Police Department may be inept, the movie offers, but it doesn\u2019t have the wanton arrogance of the F.B.I.

A goofy meditation on trauma and spandex climbing shorts, \u201cCliffhanger\u201d relies on hammy performances and dialogue.

Of course, actions speak louder than words, especially when they involve thwarting a hostile takeover. Such is the maxim for this rafting adventure, which features Meryl Streep as a former river guide, on vacation with her son and distant husband (David Strathairn), navigating the throes of vicious rapids and hot-tempered criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C.

The criminals hold the family at gunpoint, hoping to transport stolen merchandise down river, but they need Streep\u2019s white-water expertise to get through the \u201cgauntlet,\u201d a series of deathly drops and converging currents. It\u2019s the performances that make Curtis Hanson\u2019s winding thriller a worthy ride, reminding us that, in Hollywood, surviving trauma together is the greatest form of marital reconciliation.The only reason McClane is inside his estranged wife\u2019s Century City office building is to extend an olive branch in the hopes of reconnecting with his family.

He\u2019s not exactly in physical shape to run laps around Orange County Pavilion\u2019s outlet stores (he suffers from Hypoglycemia), but thankfully he\u2019s got a Segway. Aside from protecting innocent employees and preventing a massive heist, McClane\u2019s heroics saved his marriage from collapsing. That same sense of personal romantic duty gives Blart all the motivation he needs to cut down a local gang that\u2019s taken shoppers \u2014 and his kiosk crush \u2014 hostage inside the mall\u2019s bank. James embraces the physical comedy, humanizing the action-movie staple of climbing through an air shaft, this time on an empty stomach.It\u2019s not only stamina that gives McClane the edge over the dozen terrorists trying to kill him, which is a relief for Paul Blart (Kevin James), the vainglorious and portly cop in charge of security at a suburban multilevel mall.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Emerges as Clear No. 2 in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Thomas M. Siebel often faced skepticism when encouraging big companies to adopt internet-style cloud computing. Many companies, he said, had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers.Now his customers have a different concern: One cloud service isn\u2019t enough.And Mr. Siebel is adapting. After initially working closely with Amazon, a pioneer in cloud computing, C3 IoT now also has a technology and marketing partnership with Microsoft. And it is negotiating a similar agreement with Google.For a few years, it looked like Amazon would run away with the cloud computing business, piling up market share as it has with online shopping. But in the past couple of years, many companies have decided that they don\u2019t want to depend on Amazon alone, and are spreading out their business.That has helped Microsoft most of all. And the software giant has emerged as a strong No. 2 in the cloud market. Microsoft provided further evidence of its rise in the cloud business on Thursday, when it reported its most recent quarterly financial results.Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit, which supplies cloud-based computer processing and storage, and competes most directly with Amazon Web Services, grew by 89 percent over the same period a year ago. The company also reported strong growth in its other cloud offerings.Microsoft\u2019s profit increased 5 percent to $8.8 billion, or $1.13 a share. That was slightly above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.08 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters IBES.Revenue rose 17 percent to $30.09 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in June, higher than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $29.21 billion.The competition to supply the foundation layer of computing and software \u2014 the cloud-era equivalent of an operating system \u2014 is heated and costly. The biggest players, analysts estimate, are spending up to $10 billion a year on their global networks of data centers.This core cloud business is a $60 billion-a-year market, which grew by 50 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Synergy Research Group. In that fast-growing market, Amazon holds a 33 percent share, unchanged since the end of 2015. Over the same span, Microsoft\u2019s share climbed from 7 percent to 13 percent, and Google\u2019s doubled to 6 percent.John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, predicted that the cloud giants will get bigger and capture a steadily rising share of corporate technology spending \u2014 especially as they add new capabilities, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, to their services.\u201cThe information technology market is going to increasingly gravitate towards a small number of hyperscale cloud providers,\u201d Mr. Dinsdale said.In a recent research report on that market, Gartner identified three top-tier companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google. And it listed only three others, Alibaba, Oracle and IBM, as their competitors.\u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft at this stage,\u201d said Raj Bala, a Gartner analyst. \u201cGoogle is making headway, nipping at their heels, but it\u2019s still behind the leaders.\u201dFor Amazon and Google, cloud-computing services were a natural outgrowth of their original businesses \u2014 e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google. Both companies were born on the internet.Not so for Microsoft, which has made the most striking transition to the cloud. Its heritage, corporate wealth and industry dominance was based on selling packaged software and its Windows operating system for personal computers.Microsoft\u2019s later forays into new markets were typically late and hobbled by the company\u2019s Windows fixation. Its failed mobile operating system, for example, was widely criticized as a kludgy attempt to shoehorn Windows onto a smartphone.The company\u2019s path to cloud computing was lengthy and sometimes halting, even if the technical roots stretch back many years. Its MSN online service and Internet Explorer browser had their heydays in the 1990s. More recently, the company poured resources into its Bing search engine.In 2008, two years after Amazon entered the cloud market, a team of the Microsoft\u2019s brightest scientists set to work on a cloud project, code-named Red Dog. In 2010, Microsoft introduced its cloud service, but it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Before he became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive in 2014, Satya Nadella held senior roles in its cloud, online services and search businesses. Once he took over, Mr. Nadella accelerated investment in the cloud unit and focused Microsoft\u2019s sales teams on the business, analysts say.Unlike his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, Mr. Nadella\u2019s career was not steeped in Windows and the business model of packaged software. The traditional software business relied on product licenses with hefty payments up front rather than the pay-for-use subscriptions of the cloud world.\u201cTechnology was not really the obstacle for Microsoft, the problem was the business model,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cNadella has changed the strategy and the culture.\u201dAmazon holds some formidable advantages in the cloud market. It has the most customers \u2014 some spending more than $100 million a year \u2014 and more than 2,000 consulting partners to help companies use increasing amounts of Amazon cloud services. Many corporate technology managers see Amazon as the safe choice.But Microsoft has the advantage of being mainly a supplier of technology to businesses, unlike Amazon and Google. Its longstanding relationships with corporate customers, analysts say, are helping Microsoft gain ground as mainstream companies increasingly move to cloud technology. Microsoft has recently announced cloud deals with companies including Walmart, General Electric, Bayer, Starbucks and Campbell Soup.Microsoft\u2019s offerings have steadily improved, but even Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer for Azure, pointed to the company\u2019s roots in business as a driving force.\u201cThe relationships we have with companies, understanding their needs, is really helping with these migrations to our cloud,\u201d Mr. Russinovich said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Pursuit of $1 Trillion: Amazon Closes In on Apple", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer.Amazon\u2019s market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple\u2019s market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006.Investors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple\u2019s.But Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon\u2019s move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon\u2019s gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon\u2019s increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.By comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company\u2019s market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday\u2019s close.Amazon\u2019s time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion.Apple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Airport Workers Pull Out of a Financial Nosedive?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.You could say America is heading toward a poverty-based economy. Less-skilled workers are paid as little as employers can get away with, so the products and services they produce will be as inexpensive as possible, so other insufficiently paid workers can afford them.The authority\u2019s current minimum wage is $10.45 an hour, but workers at the New York airports earn at least $13 an hour because of the state\u2019s minimum wage laws. Under the new measure, the minimum wage for workers at Newark Liberty would rise to $12.45 an hour in September. By Sept. 1, 2019, the minimum wage at all three airports would increase to $15.60 an hour, and then it would increase in steps to $19 an hour on Sept. 1, 2023.The higher pay can\u2019t come soon enough for Takiah Garrett, a wheelchair agent at Newark Liberty. A single mother with a son starting college and two younger daughters, she needs food stamps and Medicaid to get by, since she earns as little as $250 a week before tips. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have money to pay a baby sitter for the kids, I have to stay home,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have school, I have to stay home.\u201dDemocratic politicians like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York took up the cause legislatively, while Republicans like former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey resisted \u2014 which is why Newark airport workers are now paid less than other Port Authority workers. Gov. Phil Murphy has pledged to raise New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage to $15, from the current $8.60. And while his predecessor\u2019s appointees are still on the Port Authority board, it can\u2019t be lost on them that Mr. Murphy is now governor.Jason Styles, a 32BJ member, has a 10-year-old son whom he has raised alone since his wife died of cancer three years ago. You can see the sadness on his face when he says that his pay is so low that, even with occasional jobs as a bouncer, he cannot afford the fees for the summer football program his son loves. His family in the South helped pay for his wife\u2019s funeral, and his 80-year-old aunt sends him a little money when she can.But there are issues beyond pay. Mr. Styles runs a seven-person cabin-cleaning crew who sometimes have less than five minutes per plane to complete their job. \u201cI have been threatened with being suspended if my crew\u2019s work delayed the flight,\u201d he said.The Port Authority board can ease financial pressure on workers like Mr. Styles and Ms. Garrett by passing the wage resolution when it reconsiders it after an extended 30-pay period for comments, preferably without nickel-and-dime revisions that some employers want. It will take continued activism by unions to ease their pressures on the job and help restore some of the dignity that so many American workers have lost.An earlier version of this editorial misstated when the Port Authority board would vote on a new wage plan for airport workers. It will be in September, not in 30 days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Elon Musk Should Learn From the Thailand Cave Rescue", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Tufekci is a professor who\u00a0writes about the social\u00a0impact of technology.Silicon Valley moguls seem to believe they can fix most anything, and they appear befuddled when their attempts to do so aren\u2019t met with unbridled enthusiasm.He directed his engineers to build a miniature \u201csubmarine\u201d (basically a sophisticated metal cylinder) that he hoped could be used for the rescue. He shared videos of the submarine with his 22 million followers on Twitter. And he received widespread media coverage and encouragement from his many fans.Instead of venting, Mr. Musk \u2014 indeed, Silicon Valley as a whole \u2014 can perhaps see the Thai operation as a lesson. This was a most improbable rescue against the longest odds. Safely navigating 12 kids and one adult, many of whom were not swimmers, through a dangerous cave relied on a model of innovation that Silicon Valley can and should learn from.The Silicon Valley model for doing things is a mix of can-do optimism, a faith that expertise in one domain can be transferred seamlessly to another and a preference for rapid, flashy, high-profile action. But what got the kids and their coach out of the cave was a different model: a slower, more methodical, more narrowly specialized approach to problems, one that has turned many risky enterprises into safe endeavors \u2014 commercial airline travel, for example, or rock climbing, both of which have extensive protocols and safety procedures that have taken years to develop.This \u201csafety culture\u201d model is neither stilted nor uncreative. On the contrary, deep expertise, lengthy training and the ability to learn from experience (and to incorporate the lessons of those experiences into future practices) is a valuable form of ingenuity.This approach is what allowed the airline captain Chesley Sullenberger to safely land a commercial airplane on the Hudson River in 2009 after its engines were disabled. Captain Sullenberger\u2019s skill and composure were, of course, a credit to him personally. But they also rested on decades of training and learning in an industry that had been government-regulated and self-regulated to such a degree that hurling through the atmosphere in giant metal cans at 35,000 feet is now one of the safest ways to travel.By contrast, Silicon Valley moguls seem to favor spending money on improbable but impressive-sounding long shots. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, donated $100 million to New Jersey schools as part of a multiyear plan to improve them. The centerpiece of the plan was teacher evaluation and charter schools, but it didn\u2019t work well. Some aspects of the plan even made things worse. Education is a complex topic, and making a lot of money in tech is not a qualification for solving educational problems.Silicon Valley also tends to ignore problems in its own house. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has declared that space exploration is one of the main things he should spend his money on. But poorly paid workers in Amazon warehouses, who work under grueling conditions, may have other ideas about how Mr. Bezos might best spend his money.In the case of Mr. Musk and his submarine, the Thai authorities understood that they needed to let the expert cave divers plan and direct the rescue operation (and Mr. Musk, to his credit, said he would take the lead from the divers). But the kind of publicity Mr. Musk created can take on a life of its own and exert undue influence.I don\u2019t mean to dismiss the role of technological innovation. Maybe in the future, some version of Mr. Musk\u2019s contraption could be useful. But that would require long-term development, testing and collaboration with a variety of experts \u2014 not just a handful of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers.If Silicon Valley wants to help the world, there is a lot it can do, starting with making its own products safer and its own companies more just. Perhaps most important, it can develop respect for hard-earned expertise in areas other than its own.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Hollywood-Style Jailbreak, French Convict Flees Prison", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A jailbreak of the kind usually dreamed up for Hollywood screenplays unfolded in real life on Sunday in France when a helicopter landed in a prison courtyard and masked men leaped out and spirited away a well-known criminal.A manhunt was still underway on Sunday evening for the inmate, R\u00e9doine Fa\u00efd, 46, who was serving 25 years for his part in a 2010 robbery that resulted in the death of a young police officer.Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said the commando team that rescued Mr. Fa\u00efd from the R\u00e9au Prison on the outskirts of Paris had been \u201cvery well prepared and without a doubt had scoped out the place using drones.\u201d She added, in comments broadcast by the French television station BFMTV, that the staff had spotted drones over the prison several months ago.It was not the first time Mr. Fa\u00efd had escaped from prison.In 2013, he took four prison guards hostage while using plastic explosives to blast his way through five sets of prison doors, then meeting an accomplice who was waiting in a car. Mr. Fa\u00efd was recaptured several weeks later.On this occasion, Mr. Fa\u00efd was in the prison visitors\u2019 room when three armed men clad in black landed a small helicopter in the compound\u2019s central courtyard, jumped out and set off smoke bombs, according to Martial Delabroye, an official at a local prison workers\u2019 union.Two of the men, wearing balaclavas and police armbands, ran inside, used a grinding machine to cut through the doors to the visiting area and, with Mr. Fa\u00efd in tow, raced back to the helicopter, Mr. Delabroye said.They flew to the northeastern side of Paris \u2014 about 25 miles from the prison \u2014 before landing in the suburb of Gonesse, in a neighborhood with warehouses, small office buildings and roadways surrounded by tall leafy bushes \u2014 typically a quiet area on a Sunday morning.Ms. Belloubet, who called the jailbreak \u201ccompletely out of the ordinary,\u201d said the team had carried it out by taking a flight instructor hostage and forcing him to take them to the prison. She said drone surveillance might have helped them avoid other courtyards that were covered with netting; they chose the only courtyard where they could have landed.After landing at Gonesse, the group got into a car and drove away, later dumping that vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping mall in another Paris suburb, according to French news reports.Mr. Fa\u00efd, who grew up in the poor outskirts of Paris, was known in the 1990s for being part of a ring of thieves who specialized in robbing armored vans used to transport money and other valuables. He eluded capture for several years but was eventually arrested and tried. He served 10 years of a 20-year sentence before being released on good behavior, according to his publisher, La Manufacture.On emerging from prison then, he wrote an autobiography, \u201cGangster: From the Slums to Big Crime.\u201d The book\u2019s blurb on the French Amazon website describes him as being a long way from the petty thieves of the slums and instead one of the \u201ccriminal aristocracy.\u201d It also notes that although he was involved in a number of armed robberies, he had never hurt anyone.At the time, and during subsequent media appearances, Mr. Fa\u00efd said he had given up a life of crime.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Open: A Relaxed Kevin Kisner Putts His Way to an Early Lead", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARNOUSTIE, Scotland \u2014 Kevin Kisner spent the night before Thursday\u2019s first round of the British Open playing backyard soccer at a rental home with his housemates, a group that included five golfers with a combined eight major golf championships.There was little golf talk, however. Most of the attention was focused on a sometimes comedic penalty-kick competition \u2014 more on that later \u2014 involving golf luminaries like Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas.The laid-back atmosphere apparently inspired Kisner. He had never finished better than a tie for 54th in three previous British Opens, but Kisner finished Thursday in sole possession of the lead, at five-under-par 66, behind an early eagle and four subsequent birdies.Kisner, a 34-year-old from Aiken, S.C., whose once-middling career has surged in recent seasons, credited his performance in part to the frat-house ambience of his accommodations: one of two side-by-side houses whose other tenants include Spieth, Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Zach Johnson, Jimmy Walker and Jason Dufner. Only Kisner and Fowler have not won a major.\u201cWe\u2019re just playing soccer and hanging out,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cEveryone is just really chill; it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201dAlso in the top 10 were Johnson, Thomas and Rory McIlroy, all at two-under 69.Tiger Woods seemed poised to join that group as he stood at two-under through 12 holes. But he stumbled with two bogeys in the next three holes and finished at even par.Still, on the punishing and devilish Carnoustie Golf Links, Woods was in contention.\u201cI played better than what the score indicates, and I think it\u2019s reasonable where I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted something under par. I missed by a little.\u201dWoods played the round with black kinesiology tape on his neck that was visible just above his collar. He would say only that the tape was supporting something that was \u201cbugging him\u201d and insisted that it had had minimal effect on his play.\u201cEveryone acts like this is the first time I\u2019ve been bandaged up,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for years. So, braces and bandages, just that this time it\u2019s actually visible.\u201dWoods still finished ahead of several other prominent contenders. The reigning Masters champion Patrick Reed shot a four-over 75, and the world\u2019s top-ranked golfer, Dustin Johnson, shot a 76.Kisner, who started with the earliest wave of golfers on Thursday, left the course as the clubhouse leader just past noon, then proceeded to regale reporters with the humorous details of the previous evening\u2019s soccer contest.A soccer net in the backyard of one of the houses rented by the group spawned the idea of a penalty-kick challenge. Dufner, one of the more popular players on the PGA Tour, played goalkeeper for every shot. \u201cDuff is the all-time goalie,\u201d Kisner explained. But it was not necessarily because of his skill.\u201cHe provides plenty of comedy for the group,\u201d Fowler said.Kisner insisted that everyone was athletically gifted.\u201cExcept Duff,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m kidding. Duff is athletic, too.\u201dBut Kisner was far more eager to tweak Spieth, the event\u2019s defending champion. Asked if Spieth was good at soccer, Kisner answered: \u201cOh, yeah, absolutely \u2014 until he sends it over the goal and about four houses down, and we\u2019ve got to go knock on neighbors\u2019 doors for the soccer ball. We\u2019re going to have to Amazon Prime a couple new balls to replace the ones we lost.\u201dIf Kisner is the least bit superstitious, there is a good chance he was playing backyard soccer again Thursday night, hoping it would lead to more brilliant golf Friday.Kisner was one over par entering the par-5 sixth hole, which he eagled with a long, twisting putt from across the green. He birdied four of the next 12 holes without a bogey, needing just 22 putts. That kind of performance on the greens was a surprise of sorts to Kisner.At his last tournament on the PGA Tour, at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, Kisner said he had \u201cputted so bad.\u201d Most of his attempts at that event were drifting left of the hole, so he moved the golf ball back in his stance and, with some practice, his putting improved.Kisner, like many in the field, also thought the Carnoustie greens, which have been dried out by a summer drought, were quicker than usual. Among the challenges for American PGA Tour pros at this event is adjusting to the usually slower greens on the British Open links-style courses.\u201cSo far, the transition has been easier,\u201d Kisner said.But other modifications were necessary. The hard fairways meant 5-iron tee shots were rolling as far as 300 yards if they were downwind.Most players eschewed their drivers in those conditions, but gauging the roll of tee shots and approach shots was tricky.Spieth, who was at three under before recording two bogeys and a double bogey in the final four holes, said the winner of the tournament would be the player who executed the best before reaching the greens.\u201cThis course is about the first two shots,\u201d said Spieth, who called the greens flat and boring.But he added: \u201cThere\u2019s so little to them, and they\u2019re so big that sometimes you\u2019re kind of missing where these double breakers are. And they\u2019re sneaking pins on the locations where there is a little bit to it.\u201dKisner managed them well, and he was hoping to get further good fortune at Carnoustie from his friendship with Spieth. He mentioned that after last year\u2019s British Open he had flown home with Spieth and the claret jug, awarded to the event\u2019s winner.\u201cI spent a lot of time with Jordan and the claret jug,\u201d Kisner said with a smile. \u201cIt would be cool to return the favor and let him look at it a little bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if the Government Gave Everyone a Paycheck?", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAdvancing technologies aren\u2019t the only cause of this predicament, but notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claim to the contrary, technology is a bigger culprit than trade. The economy keeps growing yet most economic gains are going to a few \u2014 largely financiers and, increasingly, inventors and owners of the digitized devices that are replacing good jobs. Our economic system isn\u2019t designed for this. If the trend continues, it\u2019s unclear who will even earn enough to buy all the future robots.Economic change on this scale doesn\u2019t happen without something cracking. The shift from farm to factory featured decades of bloody labor conflict; the move from factory to office and other sedentary jobs caused more upheaval. What will happen when robots push most people out of steady work and into lower-wage gig jobs? I doubt we\u2019ll see a revolution. A more likely scenario is a slow slouch toward authoritarianism and xenophobia. We may already be there.What\u2019s the answer? Here in the Bay Area where I live, where inventors and engineers are busily digitizing everything, many civic and business leaders are touting something called a universal basic income, or U.B.I. It\u2019s universal in the sense that everyone would receive it, basic in that it would be just enough to live on and cash income rather than voucher-based, like food stamps or Section 8 housing. To the rest of America, a U.B.I. may seem like a pipe dream, but from my vantage point some form of it seems inevitable.U.B.I.\u2019s critics understandably worry that it would spur millions to drop out of the labor force, induce laziness or at least rob people of the structure and meaning work provides. Both Yang and Lowrey muster substantial research to rebut these claims. I\u2019m not sure they need it. After all, $12,000 a year doesn\u2019t deliver a comfortable life even in the lowest-cost precincts of America, so there would still be plenty of incentive to work. Most of today\u2019s jobs provide very little by way of fulfillment or creativity anyway.A U.B.I. might give recipients a bit more time to pursue socially beneficial activities, like helping the elderly or attending to kids with special needs or perhaps even starting a new business. Yang suggests it would spur a system of \u201csocial credits\u201d in which people trade their spare time by performing various helpful tasks for one another. (I.R.S. be warned.) Surely a U.B.I. would help compensate many people \u2014 especially women \u2014 for the unpaid labor they already contribute. As Lowrey points out, some 40 million family caregivers in America provide half a trillion dollars of unpaid adult care annually. Child care has become so expensive that one of every three stay-at-home mothers today lives below the poverty line (compared with 14 percent in 1970).But how could America possibly afford a U.B.I.? A $1,000-a-month grant to every American would cost about $3.9 trillion a year. That\u2019s about $1.3 trillion on top of existing welfare programs \u2014 roughly the equivalent of the entire federal budget, or about a fifth of the entire United States economy. Both Yang and Lowrey come up with laundry lists of potential funding sources \u2014 from soaking the rich (raising the top tax bracket to 55 percent, enlarging the estate tax and implementing new taxes on wealth, financial transactions and perhaps even the owners of the robots and related devices that are displacing jobs), to instituting a carbon tax or a value-added tax.Whatever the source of funds, it seems a safe bet that increased automation will allow the economy to continue to grow, making a U.B.I. more affordable. A U.B.I. would itself generate more consumer spending, stimulating additional economic activity. And less poverty would mean less crime, incarceration and other social costs associated with deprivation. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really expensive?\u201d Yang asks. \u201cDysfunction. Revolution.\u201dIf these measures still aren\u2019t enough to foot the bill, Lowrey suggests making a U.B.I. less universal by taxing away U.B.I. payments to high-income earners and reducing other forms of social insurance (for example, eliminating food stamps and welfare programs). As a last resort, she writes, a U.B.I. could be implemented as a kind of negative income tax, by which government simply ensures that every person or household has a certain minimum yearly income. This is what Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman had in mind. Lowrey figures that the cost of such a guarantee would approximate the current total costs of the earned-income tax credit, supplemental security income, housing assistance, food stamps and school lunches. She notes that the simplest way to achieve this would be to transform existing antipoverty programs into unconditional cash transfers.But there\u2019s a logical flaw in her argument. Once a U.B.I. is no longer universal or even basic (what if the poor are worse off when other forms of assistance are stripped away?), it\u2019s hard to see the point of having it in the first place. More troubling is Lowrey\u2019s blurring of the distinction between a U.B.I. that redistributes resources from the superrich to the growing number of vulnerable lower-income Americans and one that merely turns programs for the poor into cash assistance. The latter may be warranted, but it wouldn\u2019t touch America\u2019s growing scourge of inequality and economic insecurity, which will be made worse as robots take over good jobs.A core challenge in the future will be how to redistribute money from the ever richer owners of the robots and related technologies to the rest of us, who are otherwise likely to become poorer and less secure. This is not just an economic challenge but also a political one. As we know from recent history, vast fortunes translate directly into political power, and such power effectively resists redistribution. Sadly, neither of these authors discusses how to deal with this paradox.A world inhabited only by robots, their billionaire owners and a large and increasingly restive population is the plotline for countless dystopian fantasies, but it\u2019s a reality that appears to be drawing closer. If we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we will need to make fundamental choices about how to support human livelihoods and ensure equal participation in our economy and society. Most basically, we will have to confront the realities of vastly unequal economic and political power. Even if we manage to enact a U.B.I., it will not be nearly enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney and Fox Shareholders Approve Deal, Ending Corporate Duel", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne empire grows. Another shrinks.In separate ballrooms at the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan on Friday morning, shareholders of the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox agreed to a $71.3 billion purchase plan that gives Disney the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, substantially altering the entertainment landscape.Regulators in more than a dozen countries must still give their approval. But the shareholder votes brought to a close a six-month corporate showdown, waged across two continents by Disney and Comcast, for supremacy in the rapidly changing media business. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s trove represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain the bulk needed as a counterattack against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into Hollywood.\u201cAvatar,\u201d the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies, \u201cTitanic\u201d and TV shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d will now be owned by Disney. That adds to an already enviable content stockpile from divisions that include Lucasfilm, Marvel Entertainment and Pixar Animation Studios. The deal also gives Disney the cable networks FX and National Geographic; a controlling stake in the streaming service Hulu, which has more than 20 million subscribers; and Star, one of India\u2019s fastest growing media companies.Some people in Hollywood see the acquisition as the sad ending of an era. Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online, and this move could set off a wave of mergers in the film business, which has not seen significant consolidation since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox.A smaller number of companies control of a greater portion of TV shows and films, potentially altering where \u2014 and how \u2014 we see our favorite series, movies or actors.\u201cOne of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the deal in December. \u201cWe believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it\u2019s our highest priority.\u201d\u201cEveryone has decided that the future is owning both the content and the distribution,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a longtime media analyst.At the Disney meeting, shareholders voted on one item. Disney\u2019s final offer was made up of equal parts cash and stock \u2014 $35.7 billion in cash, 343 million shares \u2014 and Disney investors had to approve the issuing of those shares. The meeting lasted all of nine minutes. Disney said that voters controlling 68 percent of outstanding shares voted by proxy ahead of the meeting. Of those, 99 percent voted to approve. (There was a lone voice of dissent. When Alan N. Braverman, Disney\u2019s general counsel, opened the floor for shareholder comments, one man stood up and muttered, \u201cI think we are overpaying.\u201d)The Fox shareholder meeting took place in a much smaller ballroom on a subterranean level, with fewer than 60 people present. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. But near the end, a longtime shareholder, Philip Berman, stood up at the microphone and said, \u201cRupert\u2019s dream is complete.\u201dThe deal ends Mr. Murdoch\u2019s reign over an entertainment empire he spent six decades building. He will become a significant minority shareholder in Disney and will continue to run his remaining businesses, which include Fox News, the Fox broadcasting network, the cable network FS1 and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and The Sun in Britain.\u201cI want to thank all of our executives and colleagues for their enormous contributions in building 21st Century Fox over the past decades,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in a statement after the votes.Analysts expect that Disney will clear those hurdles by early 2019.American antitrust regulators approved the merger on the condition that Disney, which already owns ESPN, divest all of Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks, which include channels like the Yankees\u2019 YES network. Guggenheim Securities has estimated the value of the chain at $22 billion.\u201cWhile on paper the assets should be attractive, a lack of bidders could drive a relatively lower valuation,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a July 19 report.Mr. Iger said in a statement after the meetings that he was looking forward to \u201cwelcoming 21st Century Fox\u2019s stellar talent to Disney and ultimately integrating our businesses to provide consumers around the world with more appealing content and entertainment options.\u201dThere is no guarantee, however, that he will pull off the herculean task of integrating Fox, which has a drastically different corporate culture. And the clock is ticking: After delaying retirement multiple times, Mr. Iger is scheduled to depart in late 2021.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Urges Congress to Regulate Use of Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lengthy blog post about the potential uses and abuses of facial recognition, Bradford L. Smith, the company\u2019s president, compared the technology to products like medicines and cars that are highly regulated, and he urged Congress to study it and oversee its use.Tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, and Mr. Smith\u2019s unusual entreaty illustrates how powerful technologies involving artificial intelligence \u2014 including facial recognition \u2014 have set off a contentious battle among tech executives. These technologies have the potential to remake industries. They could also reduce workers\u2019 job prospects or result in unequal opportunities for consumers, leading some to argue that the products are too risky for tech companies to deploy without government oversight.Mr. Smith\u2019s appeal also comes as Silicon Valley is facing withering scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy experts. Several companies have been harshly criticized in recent months for their role in spreading false information during the 2016 election, and exploiting users\u2019 personal data. In response, some businesses, like Facebook, have expressed more openness to regulation of practices like political advertising.With many of its rivals under fire, Microsoft has aggressively tried to position itself as the moral compass of the industry. Company executives have been outspoken about safeguarding users\u2019 privacy as well as warning about the potential discriminatory effects of using automated algorithm to make important decisions like hiring.Now that facial recognition has become a new lightning rod for critics, Microsoft is taking the lead in calling for some regulatory restraint.The powerful technology can be used to identify people in photos or video feeds without their knowledge or permission. Proponents see it as a potentially important tool for identifying criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that the technology could enable mass surveillance, hindering people\u2019s ability to freely attend political protests or go about their day-to-day lives in anonymity.In calling for government oversight of facial recognition, Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of any new state efforts to tightly regulate the technology. Mr. Smith, the company\u2019s president, suggested that governments around the world examine both law enforcement and commercial uses of the technology.\u201cShould law enforcement use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould the law require that companies obtain prior consent before collecting individuals\u2019 images for facial recognition?\u201dIn the European Union, many of these questions have already been settled.Civil liberties and privacy advocates said they both welcomed and felt wary of Microsoft\u2019s push for government regulation, questioning how committed the company was to strong user privacy controls.April Isenhower, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said that the company had long been committed to privacy, including pushing for a national consumer privacy law in the United States since 2005.Tech companies are spreading facial recognition in part because it provides a powerful way for them to connect consumers\u2019 online and real lives.In addition to using facial recognition for its own consumer services, Microsoft \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 also sells the software to others.Mr. Smith wrote in the blog post that Microsoft was examining its own development and marketing of the technology.He also said Microsoft had rejected facial recognition requests from certain customers \u201cwhere we\u2019ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,\u201d and that the company was committed to \u201cestablishing a transparent set of principles\u201d for the technology.Microsoft employees recently protested the company\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that has been involved in the separation of migrant children from their families at the border. In his blog post, Mr. Smith wrote that the company\u2019s contract with that agency \u201cisn\u2019t being used for facial recognition\u201d or to separate families.Ms. Isenhower, the Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about whether the company provided facial recognition services to other government agencies or whether it had put any specific restrictions on its customers\u2019 use of the technology.

{"Headline": "How One Agency Built a Multimillion-Dollar Business in Migrant Children", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "Despite a troubled history, Cayuga Centers has quietly become the largest provider of foster care for unaccompanied minors in federal government custody.Supported byWhen 17-year-old Destani Williams ran away from an upstate New York residential treatment program in May 2017 and was found dead a week later, it was but the latest in a string of troubling incidents at Cayuga Centers, a 166-year-old child-welfare agency.In the year leading up to her death, three workers were arrested on charges of abuse, and the agency was sued for negligence as a result. The local police in Auburn, N.Y., complained about hundreds of emergency calls to deal with runaway residents and violent incidents on the campus, which included residents injuring police officers, throwing chairs through windows and wielding shards of glass to cut staff members.\u201cIt seems that Cayuga Centers has evolved into a business whose priority is making money as opposed to a family service that helps youth meet the challenges of life,\u201d Officer Joseph Villano, the president of the local police union, wrote in August 2017 to the agency\u2019s board of trustees in a letter that was made public.In 2013, the year before it first signed a contract with the federal government to provide foster care for migrant children, Cayuga Centers had a $1.1 million deficit. These days, it operates in three states, with $48.7 million in annual revenue in fiscal 2017. The bulk of that money has come from the federal government \u2014 a total of $123 million since 2014, including $29.5 million since May, in an apparent rush to increase its capacity to deal with the children entering from the Southwest border who had been separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy.In June, it was revealed that Cayuga was caring for more than 300 of those children in New York City.City and federal officials say they have had no major problems with Cayuga Centers\u2019 work in foster care and have plans to expand to accommodate more children.But an investigation into Cayuga\u2019s history found that as the agency was shifting its focus to working for the federal government, problems were festering at its upstate campus. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the office charged with the care of unaccompanied minors, declined to say whether HHS knew about the issues upstate as it kept pouring money into contracts with Cayuga.A growing number of the young people being placed at its upstate campus had serious behavioral issues, which earned Cayuga more money per child, but also presented more problems for which the staff was ill-prepared, according to former employees. Staff turnover accelerated, leaving less-experienced employees to care for residents.Some county caseworkers became reluctant to place children with Cayuga because of its poor reputation for safety, a former employee said. The beds were not being filled, and with losses of $2 million, Edward Myers Hayes, 65, the chief executive, closed the residential campus in February, laying off 120 workers. He said it was a business decision that had nothing to do with focusing on the immigrant program. \u201cWe had no idea that it would grow,\u201d Mr. Hayes said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad program for the agency to do fiscally,\u201d Mr. Hayes said of providing foster care for unaccompanied minors, then added, \u201cI think we all would tell you that we would gladly wave goodbye to the contract tomorrow if it meant that the root problems \u2014 poverty and violence and victimization in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 were solved.\u201dThe agency had the humblest of beginnings \u2014 as the Cayuga Asylum for Destitute Children, an orphanage that opened in 1852 at the tip of Owasco Lake in Auburn.A century later, Cayuga was operating group residential programs for troubled teens, many referred by state family courts, on its campus there. In the 1990s, it also offered a community-based program \u2014 services to families to keep their children out of foster care \u2014 and another for people with developmental disabilities.Mr. Hayes, who has a master\u2019s degree in public administration, took over Cayuga in 1995, and made his ambitions for expansion clear in an interview with the local paper, The Citizen. \u201cWhat are other people doing and how do we get that?\u201d he said.In 2002, the agency began offering foster care upstate, in which children were placed with families, rather than living in residential centers, and they went to public schools. It expanded that foster care model to the Bronx in 2003, and later to Florida and Delaware.By 2016, the agency, which could accommodate 53 young people at a time in four residential buildings, had shifted away from its youth drug recovery programs and began bringing in more difficult-to-place children. The \u201cenhanced\u201d daily rate the state paid Cayuga to care for them was $818, state records show.In August of that year, three employees were arrested on charges of dragging a 13-year-old resident across the floor, according to a Justice Center report. Two of the employees physically restrained the victim for 25 minutes by lying on top of her, and then falsified records of the incident, the report said. The employees pleaded guilty to lesser charges and did not do jail time, court records show. All three were fired, and a lawsuit against Cayuga Centers is pending.That same year, during a construction project at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Auburn, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Cayuga had improperly removed asbestos and four people were exposed to it, violations it deemed \u201cserious.\u201d It fined the agency $8,016.75.As word spread among county caseworkers about conditions on campus, they avoided sending children there. \u201cThey were concerned with the lack of programming and the lack of safety on the campus,\u201d said Sue Walsh, a former intake specialist at Cayuga, whose job was to solicit referrals.Officer Villano of the Auburn police said that Cayuga Centers treated the police like its own personal security staff. He said officers were constantly called to the campus to investigate violent incidents. Runaways were bolting at an alarming rate, Mr. Villano said: 515 calls from 2014 to 2017.Mr. Hayes noted that because Cayuga was designated a nonsecure residential program, the doors were not locked from the inside.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the trained staff to deal with the individuals they had there,\u201d Mr. Villano said.By last summer, he and his police force had enough, writing to Cayuga\u2019s board of directors, \u201cThey are in over their head and everyone else is paying the price.\u201dStaff turnover is always high when dealing with hard-to-place children in residential programs, social welfare officials say. But to John Henry, a former agency trainer who left Cayuga in 2015, the turnover was fed by the lack of emotional or educational support for staff members after their initial training.\u201cI walked away after 27 years because I was tired of seeing good people, people I was really rooting for, get chewed up and spit out,\u201d Mr. Henry said.The problem, he said, originated in the operating philosophy that Mr. Hayes, the executive director, reiterated: \u201cReady. Fire. Aim.\u201dThe motto was supposed to inspire staff to be entrepreneurial and to seize opportunities. But when it came to dealing with young people\u2019s lives, Mr. Henry said, it was irresponsible. \u201cYou\u2019re going into something unprepared,\u201d he said.But it was hard for employees to question Mr. Hayes for fear of being fired, Mr. Henry said, adding that the chief executive\u2019s management style was one of \u201cintimidation and bullying.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m demanding,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ve treated people fairly.\u201dThen came the death of the teenager, Destani Williams. Destani had already run away weeks earlier from the female-only residence on the Cayuga campus. One night in mid-May, when the residence was staffed with less-experienced employees, she ran away with another resident, Morgan Eppinger. A week later, Destani was brought to a hospital in the town of Dunkirk, N.Y., 170 miles away, where she was pronounced dead.The Erie County Medical Examiner said it was not authorized to reveal the cause of death. The police said an investigation is pending. Her grandmother, Mamie Harris, 80, said in an interview from Rochester that she still had not heard from Cayuga Centers about how Destani died. \u201cThey were supposed to help her,\u201d Ms. Harris said.The Justice Center conducted an investigation, but said it could not comment on its findings because of a state privacy law.\u201cThe state investigated this situation thoroughly and found that the agency did not have responsibility,\u201d Mr. Hayes said, and added that even he did not know the cause of death.Mr. Hayes said that other residential centers face similar challenges, which state officials acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work and we\u2019re dealing with very damaged children,\u201d he said.Caring for migrant children has proved less complicated for the agency because they live in foster homes until they can be placed with sponsors or relatives \u2014 generally for a few months or less. The children spend their days at one of the agency\u2019s centers where they receive educational instruction and clinical services.After starting with state foster care, in 2013, Cayuga responded to a request for proposals from the federal government, which was looking for care for unaccompanied minors who had been coming across the border in increasing numbers, by saying it could provide foster care for 48 children. In 2014, the government raised that number and signed a deal for 300 placements with Cayuga.According to Cayuga\u2019s most recent tax filings, from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017, the agency could care for about 400 children at a time; it served approximately 1,720 children over the course of the year. Cayuga received more than $28 million in governmental grants that year, for an average of about $16,000 per child, with the money allotted to building costs like rent, foster family payments, clothing, food, educational programming and medical care.In 2016, the agency tried to get into the business of running a residential shelter for the federal government, when Mr. Hayes jumped on an opportunity to operate a temporary shelter outside of Dallas. But the local juvenile justice board voted against it because it did not want to house undocumented immigrant children there.State welfare officials for both Florida and Delaware said that there were no allegations of abuse or neglect submitted for Cayuga\u2019s foster care programs in those states. Marisa Kaufman, a spokeswoman for New York\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services, said, \u201cCayuga\u2019s rate of maltreatment in foster homes is in line with the systemwide average.\u201d According to city statistics, about 1 percent to 2 percent of children in the system have been the subject of a substantiated abuse or neglect allegation.A.C.S. says it is helping the agency prepare to expand its program in the city.Cayuga said it could not disclose information about its program for unaccompanied minors \u2014 not even the number of children in its care \u2014 citing the demands of its contract with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency that oversees the care of unaccompanied minors.When asked about its monitoring of Cayuga, the spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Kenneth Wolfe, said that there had been three \u201csignificant incident reports\u201d involving the agency since December, but said he could not disclose the details. All three received an \u201cappropriate and thorough response,\u201d enabling Cayuga to be \u201ccompliant,\u201d he said.Though Cayuga\u2019s contract called for it to provide 600 placements this spring, administrators said they did not realize they were receiving children separated from their parents, as opposed to children who came to the border unaccompanied, until they arrived in New York. In those first few weeks, the agency seemed overwhelmed, according to lawyers visiting the center.\u201cWhen I first realized that there were separated children that we were taking, I was concerned that people were enabling it to happen,\u201d said David Connelly, the chairman of the board of Cayuga Centers. But he said he believed that his agency could provide a humane solution to the crisis, \u201cThe important thing is that these children are not warehoused \u2014 and that we are not warehousing them.\u201dEven as children were arriving, Cayuga Centers continued to advertise for more foster families and for staff, holding weekly on-the-spot job interviews. Separately, it has put out notices requesting bilingual foster families, advertising in English and Spanish the $1,000 a month per child in tax-free payments foster families could receive.Every morning, cars roll up to its two centers, one in East Harlem and another on 125th Street near Broadway, dropping children off for day programs. At night and on weekends, the children stay with foster families, as many as eight to a house, often sleeping in bunk beds. During the day, the children can be seen near the 125th Street center, playing soccer and other games on the grounds of Manhattanville Houses.Many of the separated children have now left Cayuga\u2019s care. In interviews, a dozen separated children ages 5 to 17 and some parents generally praised the treatment received while in Cayuga\u2019s care. The foster homes were mostly in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, with Spanish-speaking foster parents, many of them Dominican.Yolany Padilla, from Honduras, said her 6-year-old son, Jelsin, went to performances with his foster mother, a professional singer of traditional Dominican music, and danced bachata with her and the several other foster children living at her home.But Jefferson Che Pop, also 6, from an indigenous village in Guatemala, was returned to his father, Hermelindo Che Coc, with a rash on both arms, his stomach and back, and a bruise above his eye that he said he had received when he had fallen out of bed, his father said. Mr. Che Coc said in a telephone interview that he did not blame Cayuga Centers or the foster family for his son\u2019s physical condition. \u201cI thought I would never see him again,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, the federal government has asked Cayuga to increase its capacity to 900 children in the next month, said Alphonso David, the counsel for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who said all agencies were required to report an increase to the state. Cayuga had not yet done that, so it was unclear, Mr. David said, whether it would still be receiving unaccompanied children coming from the border in the coming weeks.And even despite the millions of dollars in government grants it received to care for these children, it is still soliciting donations through an Amazon Wish List for items for the children: backpacks, coloring books, crayons, jump ropes, lunchboxes, art supplies, a portable badminton net and other sporting equipment. A link on the Cayuga website allowed the public to donate through PayPal.Follow Liz Robbins on Twitter: @nytlizrobbinsAnnie Correal and Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed contributed reporting; Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quartz, Atlantic Media\u2019s Business News Start-Up, Is Sold to Japanese Firm", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAtlantic Media\u2019s business news site built for the digital age has turned into a good bit of business itself.Atlantic Media\u2019s sale of Quartz is also a rare success in a media industry that continues to struggle to adapt to the internet and the tech titans that dominate it.Five years later, Quartz itself, despite lacking a name as well known as that of The Post or The Globe, could fetch a comparable sum.\u201cUzabase\u2019s ambition echoes our own \u2014 to build the leading business news brand of our century \u2014 and now we are in this mission together,\u201d Kevin Delaney, Quartz\u2019s editor in chief and a founder of the site, wrote in a memo that was emailed to employees on Monday.Started with just 20 journalists, Quartz quickly found an audience by turning out a torrent of articles \u2014 some analytical, some quirky, most short \u2014 and charts geared toward tech-savvy business readers. With an editorial staff steeped in technology, the site has experimented with new ideas, including making bots that give readers the news and integrating ads into its newsfeed.The news site, the presentation said, is expected to bring in more than $35 million this year and will start a paid subscription model. \u201cDespite its strengths, Quartz needs to shift its business model,\u201d the presentation said. Quartz will retain its name, brand, staff and offices, according to the announcement. Mr. Delaney and the publisher, Jay Lauf, will share the title of chief executive, and will report to Yusuke Umeda, a Uzabase co-founder.In a memo of his own to Quartz staff members, David G. Bradley, Atlantic Media\u2019s chairman, recounted how, during a Christmas vacation trip several years ago to Beirut, Lebanon, he had discussed the future of the company with his three adult sons. After he decided that his sons would not succeed him in running Atlantic Media, Mr. Bradley said, his family then planned to divest all of its media properties by the time he was 70.\u201cWhere I am caught by surprise is in the timing,\u201d Mr. Bradley, 65, said. \u201cAfter selling the majority of The Atlantic to Emerson Collective, I had thought it would be a few years before we launched the search for a Quartz buyer. In fact, all of this \u2014 my partnership with Emerson on The Atlantic and the sale of Quartz \u2014 is coming years faster than I had imagined.\u201dHe praised Mr. Umeda, saying that he \u201creminds me of us at our best.\u201d\u201cHe is modest, thoughtful, appreciative, repeatedly true to his word and highly, highly intelligent,\u201d Mr. Bradley added. He said he would continue to work as an adviser to the company for at least the next year.Uzabase, which runs a business news aggregation app called NewsPicks, said it was buying Quartz to help expand its overseas business. Quartz will take over the English language version of NewsPicks and develop new paid products, according to the emailed memo.Uzabase and Mr. Umeda have tried to challenge a staid media environment in Japan by focusing coverage on emerging technology trends, according to Japanese media interviews with Mr. Umeda.Discussions between Uzabase and Quartz began in the fall and were rooted partly in Mr. Umeda\u2019s early admiration of Quartz, according to the statement.\u201cFive years ago, when I was originally thinking about launching a digital media business, I discovered Quartz for the first time,\u201d Mr. Umeda said in the statement. \u201cI thought that they were truly the first new media company to successfully combine quality journalism with mobile technology, and they played a big role in inspiring me to launch NewsPicks.\u201dStill, it appears that Quartz will now follow the direction set by Mr. Umeda and his NewsPicks product. Under the new leadership, Quartz is to focus on developing subscription products aimed at its current readership.\u201cWhile high-quality advertising will continue to represent the lion\u2019s share of Quartz\u2019s revenue in the coming years, we expect that the biggest source of growth in Quartz\u2019s next chapter will come from reader revenue,\u201d Mr. Delaney wrote in his email to employees.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Netflix, a Genuine Nail-Biter, and on Amazon, a Genuine Eccentric", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIt\u2019s well earned. \u201cCalibre,\u201d written and directed by Matt Palmer (making his first feature) follows two old friends, Marcus (Martin McCann) and Vaughn (Jack Lowden), on a hunting (or \u201cstalking,\u201d as the townspeople call it) trip to the Scottish Highlands. Vaughn has a fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s pregnant, and Marcus takes this occasion to crow to his buddy that he should \u201cenjoy the last few days\u201d of his freedom.The first \u201choly crap!\u201d moment of the movie occurs not even 20 minutes in, and at that point it\u2019s don\u2019t-get-up-from-the-sofa time. And because it\u2019s on Netflix, \u201cCalibre\u201d is a movie you can pause, but you\u2019re not going to want to. As the two friends get into one awful predicament after another, Marcus\u2019s \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what he\u2019s gotta do\u201d attitude rubs up against Vaughn\u2019s reticence, and over the course of the movie their friendship frays. The character dynamics are recognizable in the way they hew to genre conventions. But the details provided in the writing, and by the two leads\u2019 performances, add distinctive details and dimension here. This makes the film\u2019s harrowing action all the more believable. Ultimately, these fellows can\u2019t stop what\u2019s coming.His earliest available work, \u201cDawn of an Evil Millennium,\u201d from 1988, is a component of the anthology film \u201cDawn of Evil.\u201d Like some of Mr. Packard\u2019s shorts, \u201cEvil Millennium\u201d is a kind of trailer for a never-completed picture. Featuring blood-drenched characters staggering through the seedier areas of Hollywood, it plays like an amalgam of the works of the underground luminary Kenneth Anger, David Lynch, the B-movie schlock/shockmeister William Castle, and the barrel-scraping grindhouse auteur Andy Milligan.\u201cReflection of Evil\u201d doggedly defies conventional plot description. The cut of the film streaming on Amazon Prime is almost two hours and 20 minutes. (A shorter version can be rented on the site, but I didn\u2019t have time to watch it.) It begins with a badly redubbed introduction from Tony Curtis, lifted from a LaserLight \u201cclassic films\u201d DVD release. Mr. Packard frequently cuts to an aging couple watching a TV movie in their living room; in the film within this film, a young woman in a nightgown wanders tree-lined streets.In the middle of the street outside, a character named Bobby, played by Mr. Packard himself, materializes out of thin air. The already hefty actor-director is wearing padding to make himself look even bulkier. He paces the street screeching obscenities. Distracted by the noise outside, the man watching TV walks across the living room to his gun rack, which has a Nazi flag behind it. Bobby passes out on the street and regurgitates what looks like a gallon of Dinty Moore beef stew.There actually is a narrative: In the ever-warping alternate realities at play here, the woman in the nightgown is Bobby\u2019s older sister, who decades before had lost her brother somewhere at Universal Studios. This thread allows Mr. Packard to contemplate another one of his obsessions, Steven Spielberg, and he manages to blend archival footage of Mr. Spielberg directing the 1972 TV movie \u201cSomething Evil\u201d into his story line, such as it is.The perspective in Reflection of Evil\u201d is not \u201cmovie mad,\u201d or \u201cmovie crazy\u201d in the sense that people (perhaps insensitively) throw around those terms; it is more like movie deranged. And not in the slightly louche, aesthetically languid sense you get from the French Surrealist writings celebrating cinema\u2019s potential for a derangement of the senses. No, this is Hollywood pop-culture-hoarding derangement.An earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the surname of the director of the film \u201cCalibre.\u201d He is Matt Palmer, not Porter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Times Publisher and Trump Clash Over President\u2019s Threats Against Journalism", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump and the publisher of The New York Times, A. G. Sulzberger, engaged in a fierce public clash on Sunday over Mr. Trump\u2019s threats against journalism, after Mr. Sulzberger said the president misrepresented a private meeting and Mr. Trump accused The Times and other papers of putting lives at risk with irresponsible reporting.Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he and Mr. Sulzberger had discussed \u201cthe vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, \u2018Enemy of the People.\u2019 Sad!\u201d\u201cI told him that although the phrase \u2018fake news\u2019 is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists \u2018the enemy of the people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sulzberger continued. \u201cI warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.\u201dThis is particularly true overseas, Mr. Sulzberger said, where governments are using Mr. Trump\u2019s words as a pretext to crack down on journalists. He said he warned the president that his attacks were \u201cputting lives at risk\u201d and \u201cundermining the democratic ideals of our nation.\u201dMr. Sulzberger\u2019s lengthy, bluntly worded rebuttal was a striking rejoinder to the president by the 37-year-old publisher of a paper with which Mr. Trump has had a long, complicated relationship. And it apparently touched a nerve: The president fired off a series of angry tweets in the afternoon, accusing newspapers of being unpatriotic.He has continued to assail the news media at rallies and even at more formal presidential events, encouraging his audiences to chant \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d and to vent their anger at the reporters assembled in the back.In a statement, Mercedes Schlapp, a White House communications adviser, said, \u201cThe president regularly meets with members of the media, and we can confirm this meeting took place.\u201d She did not provide any further details of the meeting or explain why the president chose to publicize it.The White House had requested that the meeting be kept off the record, according to the statement from The Times.\u201cBut with Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet this morning,\u201d the statement said, \u201che has put the meeting on the record, so A. G. has decided to respond to the president\u2019s characterization of their conversation, based on detailed notes A. G. and James took.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Mr. Sulzberger described the meeting with Mr. Trump, whom he had met only once before, as cordial. But he said he went into the Oval Office determined to make a point about what he views as the dangers of the president\u2019s inflammatory language.Mr. Sulzberger recalled telling Mr. Trump at one point that newspapers had begun posting armed guards outside their offices because of a rise in threats against journalists. The president, he said, expressed surprise that they did not already have armed guards.At another point, Mr. Trump expressed pride in popularizing the phrase \u201cfake news,\u201d and said other countries had begun banning it. Mr. Sulzberger responded that those countries were dictatorships and that they were not banning \u201cfake news\u201d but rather independent scrutiny of their actions.Still, Mr. Sulzberger said, by the end of the session, he felt that Mr. Trump had listened to his arguments. The president, Mr. Sulzberger recalled, told him he was glad that he had raised those issues and would think about them.Mr. Sulzberger said he bore no illusions that his comments would prompt Mr. Trump to curb his attacks on the news media. He said he encouraged the president to complain about news coverage in The Times that he viewed as unfair. But he appealed to him not to systematically attack journalists and journalism around the world.Tensions between Times publishers and presidents are nothing new. Early in Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Mr. Clinton complained to Mr. Sulzberger\u2019s father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who was then publisher, about the paper\u2019s editorials.Mr. Sulzberger told the president he liked to think of them as \u201ctough love,\u201d according to Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones, who wrote a history of the Sulzberger family.\u201cWell, just don\u2019t forget the love part,\u201d Mr. Clinton replied.A decade later, Mr. Sulzberger and top editors of The Times were summoned to the Oval Office by President George W. Bush in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the paper from publishing a long-delayed article about the National Security Agency\u2019s monitoring of phone calls without court-approved warrants.\u201cGenerally speaking, presidents, in their dealings with newspaper publishers, have wanted to court them,\u201d said Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime expert in the relationship between the press and the White House. \u201cThey think if they bring the publishers in and explain their goals and intentions, that would be helpful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Robot Romance on Amazon, American Indies and a \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 Commentary", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingThe best way to approach \u201cZoe,\u201d a science-fiction romance that debuts on Amazon Prime on July 20, would be to skip past the first 25 minutes. At this point, you can enjoy a good swath of the chemistry between the lead actors, Ewan McGregor and L\u00e9a Seydoux, as their characters discover each other and enrich their time together. They really do make a nice couple. It\u2019s the buildup to this section, and the subsequent fallout from it, where you find trouble areas.After shrugging off the interest shown in her by Ash, a very sleek synthetic, Zoe wonders why her compatibility test with Cole came up with zero chance for a successful relationship. Those of you lucky enough to have seen the 1962 cult film \u201cCreation of the Humanoids\u201d will have guessed the answer by now. Hell, you\u2019ve probably guessed even if you haven\u2019t seen that film.Despite all the complications, Cole and Zoe take a chance on love. And it\u2019s in these scenes that the movie exhibits the most charm.The yearning displayed by Cole and Zoe is meant to be profound. But at a certain point the examination of loss in love ceases to show sensitivity and begins to look like emotional immaturity. Throughout \u201cZoe,\u201d characters talk about how wonderful it would be to have a companion who would never leave you, who could always understand you completely, and more. But let\u2019s get real. Once you\u2019ve acquired a fair amount of life experience, you learn to accept that bad things happen and other people, even ones with the best intentions, can be unreliable, and can hurt you.In \u201cZoe,\u201d the characters, all in their 30s at least (except for the robots, I know, but bear with me), still believe that 100-percent glitch-free everlasting love is a reasonable life goal. It\u2019s this component, even more than the poorly realized sci-fi trappings, that finally make the movie a little insufferable.If you\u2019re in search of American independent film that displays genuine daring and very little lovesickness, a series this month at the streaming site Filmatique will fit the bill. The site, which generally features international films that have fared well at festivals but not found distribution in the United States, will feature films made in the United States for the first time. The series is called \u201cAmerican Independents\u201d and is organized in partnership with the small film company Factory 25.This frank and informative commentary was attached to the Criterion Collection laser disc of the movie. Once that edition went out of print, and the video licensing rights to the movie went back to Sony, which owns Columbia, the studio that produced the film, the commentary stayed with Criterion. (Subsequent video versions have been issued by Sony, with different supplements.) It\u2019s a great listen, in part because it was recorded only a decade after the movie was made.\u201cIt sprang from my head like an animal,\u201d Mr. Schrader recalls of the script, which he wrote in less than two weeks. Later, he notes of the collaboration between himself, Mr. Scorsese, and the lead actor Robert De Niro, that it was a case of \u201cthree people coming together at a certain point in their lives all needing to say the same thing.\u201d Mr. Scorsese talks about his influences and his desire to make the viewer perceive things as he himself perceives them, with a certain speed and intensity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trade Wars? Three Funds Made Solid Profits Anyway", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter \u2014 as well as over the last five years \u2014 by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.\u201cSemiconductors are China\u2019s largest import, even more than oil,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies.\u201dMs. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Curious Case of the $2,630.52 Used Paperback", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Many booksellers on Amazon strive to sell their wares as cheaply as possible. That, after all, is usually how you make a sale in a competitive marketplace.Other merchants favor a counterintuitive approach: Mark the price up to the moon.\u201cZowie,\u201d the romance author Deborah Macgillivray wrote on Twitter last month after she discovered copies of her 2009 novel, \u201cOne Snowy Knight,\u201d being offered for four figures. One was going for \u201c$2,630.52 & FREE Shipping,\u201d she noted. Since other copies of the paperback were being sold elsewhere on Amazon for as little as 99 cents, she was perplexed.\u201cHow many really sell at that price? Are they just hoping to snooker some poor soul?\u201d Ms. Macgillivray wrote in an email. She noted that her blog had gotten an explosion in traffic from Russia. \u201cMaybe Russian hackers do this in their spare time, making money on the side,\u201d she said.Amazon is by far the largest marketplace for both new and used books the world has ever seen, and is also one of the most inscrutable. The retailer directly sells some books, while others are sold by third parties. The wild pricing happens with the latter.\u201cAmazon is driving us insane with its willingness to allow third-party vendors to sell authors\u2019 books with zero oversight,\u201d said Vida Engstrand, director of communications for Kensington, which published \u201cOne Snowy Knight.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s maddening and just plain wrong.\u201dThe wild book prices were in the remote corners of the Amazon bookstore that the retailer does not pay much attention to, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, which develops artificial intelligence technology for retailers and brands.Third-party sellers, he said, come in all shapes and sizes \u2014 from well-respected national brands that are trying to maintain some independence from Amazon to entrepreneurial individuals who use Amazon\u2019s marketplace as an arbitrage opportunity. These sellers list products they have access to, adjusting price and inventory to drive profits.Then there are the wild pricing specialists, who sell both new and secondhand copies.\u201cBy making these books appear scarce, they are trying to justify the exorbitant price that they have set,\u201d said Mr. Hariharan, who led a team responsible for 15,000 online sellers when he worked at Amazon a decade ago.Amazon said in a statement that \u201cwe actively monitor and remove\u201d offers that violate its policies and that examples shown it by The Times \u2014 including the hardcover version of the scholarly study \u201cWilliam T. Vollmann: A Critical Companion,\u201d which was featured for $3,204, more than 32 times the going price \u2014 were \u201cin error, and have since been removed.\u201d It declined to detail what its policies were.\u201cI wish I had some of that money,\u201d Ms. Petry said.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d said Peter Andrews, a former Amazon brand specialist who is manager of international client services at One Click Retail, a consulting firm. \u201cIf I\u2019m selling a $10 book for $610, all I need to do is get one person to buy it and I\u2019ve made $600. It\u2019s just a matter of setting prices and wishful thinking.\u201dOne of the sellers of Ms. Macgillivray\u2019s book is named Red Rhino, which says it is based in North Carolina. The bookseller\u2019s storefront on Amazon is curiously consistent. One of the first books on the store\u2019s first page was Anthony Bourdain\u2019s \u201cKitchen Confidential.\u201d It was priced at $607, a hundred times what it cost elsewhere on Amazon.All the books on the first few pages of the storefront \u2014 including such popular standbys as \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d \u201cThe Very Hungry Caterpillar\u201d and \u201c1984\u201d \u2014 also go for $600.That appears to be a popular price point for booksellers taking the high road. Acme Books, which was selling the $691 Petry book, used that exact price for \u201c101 Blessings for the Best Mom in the World\u201d and quite a few other books.Red Rhino got nearly 1,400 customer-service reviews over the last year \u2014 an impressive number, considering many customers do not bother posting reviews. The reviews are 91 percent positive, although some of the reviewers appeared uncertain just what a book is. \u201cThe book is intact, and it is not broken,\u201d wrote one. Commented another: \u201cVery nice. Flexibility noted in many venues.\u201dNeither Acme nor Red Rhino returned emails for comment sent through their Amazon pages. As with many Amazon booksellers, it is hard to determine what, if any, existence they have outside the retailer.Even a casual browse through the virtual corridors of Amazon reveals an increasingly bizarre bazaar where the quaint policies of physical bookstores \u2014 the stuff no one wants is piled on a cart outside for a buck a volume \u2014 are upended. John Sladek, who wrote perceptive science fiction about robotics and artificial intelligence, predicted in a 1975 story that computers might start making compelling but false connections:If you\u2019re trying to reserve a seat on the plane to Seville, you\u2019d get a seat at the opera instead. While the person who wants the opera seat is really just making an appointment with a barber, whose customer is just then talking to the box-office of \u201cHair,\u201d or maybe making a hairline reservation \u2026That is a real bargain compared with what a bookseller with the improbable name Supersonic Truck is asking: $1,942. (Copies from other booksellers are as little as $30.) Supersonic Truck, which Amazon says has 100 percent positive ratings, did not respond to a message seeking comment.Ms. Macgillivray, who has published eight novels, said she had been poking around Amazon\u2019s bookstore and was more perplexed than ever by the pricing.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about someone listing an item for sale at whatever the market will bear, even if they don\u2019t have the book but plan to buy it when someone orders it,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, I would think Amazon wouldn\u2019t want their platform used for less than honorable practices.\u201dSince Ms. Macgillivray tweeted about \u201cOne Snowy Knight,\u201d the price on Amazon has not stood still. The most expensive copy just jumped again, to $2,800.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Approval Gets Justice Department Challenge", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal government on Thursday mounted a new effort to unravel AT&T\u2019s deal with Time Warner, a blockbuster merger that has already started to reshape the media industry.The deal was finalized a month ago, after a federal judge rejected the government\u2019s argument that the $85.4 billion agreement would harm competition and consumers.The judge\u2019s decision had almost immediately set off a round of intense deal talks among many of the biggest names in the industry, including Comcast and 21st Century Fox. Many media executives, including those at AT&T and Time Warner, say mergers among their companies are necessary to better compete against tech giants like Netflix and Amazon.The Department of Justice filed its notice of appeal on the same day that Netflix beat out HBO for the most Emmy nominations \u2014 ending the premium channel\u2019s 17-year run as the most-nominated outlet.The Justice Department declined to comment. But experts say the appeal sends a clear signal that the government, despite its court loss, will be aggressive on deals between companies with complementary businesses, known as vertical mergers. Immediately after the AT&T-Time Warner merger was approved last month, Comcast entered a bidding war with the Walt Disney Company for the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox.\u201cIf they had not appealed it, it would have been a green light for vertical mergers to proceed apace,\u201d said Andrew J. Schwartzman of the Georgetown University Law Center.AT&T\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee, expressed confidence about the company\u2019s chances in an appeal. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision could hardly have been more thorough, fact-based, and well-reasoned,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the losing party in litigation always has the right to appeal if it wishes, we are surprised that the D.O.J. has chosen to do so under these circumstances.\u201dThe plan to appeal was made public late in the afternoon; shares in AT&T fell 1.3 percent in after-hours trading.The Justice Department had considered filing an injunction to stop the deal from closing after the judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, approved it on June 12. But it did not go ahead with the motion because AT&T said the media arm would be operated as a separate group, making it easier to unwind the business should the Justice Department succeed in an appeal.The latest legal maneuvering will not immediately change the business. But if the Justice Department ultimately prevails in its appeal, AT&T would have to detach the Time Warner business, now renamed Warner Media.The government\u2019s approach to the AT&T-Time Warner merger contrasts sharply with its relatively quick approval of Disney\u2019s proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment properties. That agreement, in which Disney said it would pay $71.3 billion for Fox\u2019s television and movie business, was approved in June, about six months after it was announced. Transactions of such size typically take a year or longer.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to appeal could benefit Rupert Murdoch, the Fox chairman, who has supported Disney\u2019s offer over Comcast\u2019s, according to Craig Moffett, a longtime media analyst.Comcast appeared to already be backing away from its bid, but the government\u2019s appeal could make the giant cable company move away even faster by raising more doubts about whether the Justice Department would approve such a deal.\u201cLobbing in this hand grenade right now sort of seals Comcast\u2019s fate,\u201d Mr. Moffett said.Comcast is locked in a separate bidding war for control of the European satellite broadcaster Sky, which has more than 23 million customers across five countries. After Fox improved its offer to control Sky on Wednesday, Comcast quickly topped that bid with one of its own, valuing the company at $34 billion.The AT&T and Time Warner merger has generated such intense interest partly because of the political overtones. As a candidate, Donald J. Trump, who had frequently criticized the Time Warner property CNN as \u201cfake news,\u201d vowed to stop the AT&T-Time Warner merger if elected to the White House.The Justice Department, however, said politics had played no role in the decision to oppose the AT&T-Time Warner deal.The government sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal late last year, saying the combination of companies that distribute and produce content would lead to higher prices for all cable customers. After a six-week trial, Judge Leon concluded that the Justice Department did not provide enough evidence that it would harm consumers and competitors.The filing that announced the government\u2019s intention to appeal did not include any details about what arguments the government planned to make to a higher court, the United States Court of Appeals in Washington. If either side disagrees with the appeals court\u2019s decision, the case could then move to the Supreme Court.Mr. Schwartzman of the Georgetown University Law Center said the odds of winning are low for the side appealing its case. He and other legal experts said Judge Leon\u2019s decision was specifically tailored for AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner, limiting potential problems in an appeal.Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, was likewise skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s chances, but he said the government\u2019s intention may not ultimately be to win a court appeal.\u201cIt signals to the market the government isn\u2019t throwing in the towel but I think it\u2019s a long shot because the appellate court has to defer to the trial judge on facts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Considers New Pay Rules for Uber Drivers", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City regulators are moving toward significantly raising wages for drivers for Uber and other ride-hailing apps. The step would make New York the first major American city to establish pay rules to grapple with the upheaval caused by ride-hailingcompanies that has decimated the yellow cab industry and left many drivers in financial ruin.\u201cTheir low pay has persisted despite the rapid growth of the industry,\u201d the study said.If a driver\u2019s earnings fall below $17.22 per hour over the course of a week, the companies would be required to make up the difference. The study suggested the companies could absorb this cost partly by lowering their commissions, which range from about 10 to 25 percent of passenger fares on average. The median net hourly earnings in the industry were about $14.25, the study found.The taxi commission has the power to adopt the rules without the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio or the City Council, but the mayor said he prefers to address the driver pay problem through the City Council.The New York pay rules would apply to four major car service apps \u2014 Uber, Lyft, Via and Juno \u2014 all of which provide more than 10,000 trips each day in New York.\u201cThis is an important step in addressing one of the many pressing challenges that face the for-hire and taxi industries today,\u201d said the taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi.Uber said on Monday that it had major concerns over the proposal. Alix Anfang, a spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company worried that it would hurt \u201criders through substantially increased prices and reduced service.\u201dThe study is a rare glimpse inside New York City\u2019s booming ride-hail industry. It found that about 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps. Some drivers bought vehicles, enticed by claims that they could make as much as $5,000 during their first month of driving, and now feel trapped.New York City is considering a broader series of regulations for Uber, including a cap on vehicles, as debate has intensified not only over pay but about worsening traffic from the flood of for-hire cars.The city\u2019s taxi commission hired two independent economists to study its pay proposal, which has not yet been formally introduced. Ms. Joshi, who has said she wants wages to be raised, said the findings would inform the new policies being considered by her commission and the City Council. Though the commission can adopt the rules on its own, Ms. Joshi was appointed by Mr. de Blasio and is likely to defer to him.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office said the city wouldn\u2019t \u201cmove in any direction until we review the report and the mayor makes a decision\u201d but that the mayor supported a \u201ccomprehensive package\u201d to address the challenges facing the taxi and for-hire vehicle industry.A minimum wage of $17.22 an hour after expenses would increase driver earnings by about 22.5 percent on average, or $6,345 per year, for those who would get increases under the proposal, according to the study by the independent economists. The proposal aims to bring pay in line with the $15 minimum wage that the state is moving toward while considering the challenges the drivers face as independent contractors. The study\u2019s findings and recommendations did not focus on yellow cabdrivers.In New York, the taxi commission sets rules for taxis and private companies that offer for-hire rides. In the past, the commission has approved regulations to establish a lease cap on what taxi garages can charge drivers and to require companies like Uber to offer more wheelchair accessible vehicles.Some drivers would still make substantially less than $17.22 per hour because their expenses are much higher than the allowance.Behind the proposed hourly minimum wage is a sophisticated arrangement designed to make the entire app-based system more efficient. Its centerpiece is an incentive for the app companies to increase their so-called utilization rates \u2014 that is, the portion of each hour in which drivers are ferrying a passenger.The authors say this incentive would address a key inefficiency of the current system, which is that companies like Uber and Lyft lure too many drivers onto the road as a way to lower wait times for passengers. This oversupply depresses wages, since drivers can only earn money when they have a passenger in their car.The study, which relied primarily on data collected from the companies by the taxi commission, was written by Dr. James Parrott, of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School and Professor Michael Reich, of the University of California at Berkeley.Zubin Soleimany, a lawyer for the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that supports professional drivers, criticized the proposal for accepting the general pay structure of the app industry, which, he said, has created a race to the bottom that hurts both app drivers and taxi drivers. His group prefers requiring the apps to charge the regulated taxi fare at a minimum, and giving drivers a guaranteed percentage of that fare.The Independent Drivers Guild, another group that represents drivers, had a more positive reaction, saying that establishing a minimum pay rate was the most important step to help drivers.The proposal has at least two potentially significant flaws. Mr. Soleimany pointed out that app drivers could end up having to work harder over time for the same amount of money. As drivers work a greater portion of each hour, the amounts they earn per-mile and per-minute fall, leaving them potentially no better off financially.But in an interview, Mr. Reich said his calculations showed that the utilization rate \u2014 the measure of busyness \u2014 was only likely to increase by a few percentage points, meaning drivers would be working only somewhat harder (about 2.5 minutes per hour on average in a plausible scenario) for significantly more pay (about 22.5 percent more per hour on average).\u201cWe think they\u2019ll see this as a good deal,\u201d Mr. Reich said.A second problem is the potential for gaming the new system. Because drivers must be paid $17.22 per hour regardless of whether or not they earn that amount by transporting passengers, they could choose to simply decline rides and collect the minimum wage while remaining idle.Mr. Reich said the app companies are able to identify app drivers who decline too many rides. But the companies are loath to penalize drivers, whom they classify as contractors, for declining rides because that would imply an employment relationship.The findings in the taxi commission study are roughly in line with that figure after adjusting for the pay scale in New York City, where wages are about 25 percent higher than the national average.In New York City, Uber\u2019s annual revenue from passenger fares is about $2 billion, according to the study\u2019s estimate. The company keeps about $375 million in commissions and fees. Its operating costs are an estimated $50 million each year.That kind of markup, the authors concluded, was higher than almost any other similar marketplace \u2014 higher than Amazon, which must carry large inventories of goods and shoulder greater labor costs, and much higher than companies like eBay and Etsy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix, the Stock Market\u2019s Big Hope, Disappoints", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen rising interest rates and trade tensions weighed on the stock market in recent months, investors could always comfort themselves with four words: \u201cThere is always Netflix.\u201dNot on Monday.Netflix disappointed investors with news that it added substantially fewer subscribers in the second quarter than expected. The company\u2019s stock, which had more than doubled this year as the wider market stalled, plunged 14 percent after the close of regular trading.While Netflix\u2019s revenue and profits are still surging, the shortfall in subscriber growth is a reminder that companies priced for perfection can disappoint when optimism seems to be at a peak. And the slip-up will revive skepticism about Netflix\u2019s business model.Netflix had forecast that it would add 1.2 million new United States subscribers in the second quarter, but it signed up only 674,000. Internationally, the company gained 4.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, below Netflix\u2019s expectations for five million. Revenue rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $3.91 billion but was slightly below the total that Wall Street analysts had expected.Netflix is hardly in trouble. Paid subscriptions were still up 26 percent from a year earlier. And in recent quarters, subscriber numbers exceeded Netflix\u2019s projections, so Monday\u2019s disappointment may not amount to much in the scheme of things.Still, the company\u2019s stock shows that Netflix has a lot to live up to. The company\u2019s share price, after Monday\u2019s plunge, is equivalent to 107 times the per-share earnings that analysts expect Netflix to make this year. This price-to-earnings ratio is far higher than it is on the stocks of many other technology companies. Bullish investors may contend that such a ratio is justifiable, given that analysts expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to keep growing quickly. Profits are expected to rise 58 percent this year, and 66 percent next.But the subscriber growth fell short at what could turn out to be a challenging time for Netflix. It\u2019s facing competition from Amazon, Hulu, Google and, perhaps, Apple. The Walt Disney Company is buying much of Fox, in part, to bolster its planned streaming service. And, of course, AT&T has big ambitions for Time Warner, which it is acquiring for its video content. Big hit shows, like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d helped Netflix attract new subscribers. The more companies striving to produce blockbusters, the harder it may become for Netflix to maintain the pace of its subscriber growth.And in a drawn-out fight, in which everyone is spending large sums on programming, investors may find it harder to overlook Netflix\u2019s negative cash flows. The company made $674 million in the first half of this year. But its operations used up $755 million of cash during that period.Advertisement"}

Nellie Bowles, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.As our tech culture reporter, what is your most crucial tech tool for doing work?There\u2019s only one gadget I can\u2019t live without. It weighs in at 114 pounds. It is my desk treadmill.The treadmill goes under my desk. I walk usually 1.5 miles an hour, but drop to 1 mile an hour for writing something tricky. I\u2019ll kick up to 2 miles an hour if I\u2019m feeling wild or on a long call. If I\u2019m transcribing or doing something that doesn\u2019t require tons of decision making, I\u2019ll do 2.5 miles an hour, but that\u2019s the max. And I stay like that all day long. And that\u2019s how I work.How did you decide to get a treadmill desk? For me, the game of work is always how long each day I can keep my mind sharp and absorbed in the task at hand. I find walking to be very good for this. But logistically for my job, I need to be typing notes during calls and writing up stories, so I discovered the treadmill desk. My mind doesn\u2019t flit around as much when I\u2019m treading.It also just feels good. I think it\u2019s strange that from a very young age, we\u2019re all expected to cram our bodies around these squat little tables and then remain stock still for hours on end.How did your colleagues react to it?I moved the treadmill into the office on a Sunday evening so when everyone got in Monday, it would just be a fact of life. Were there jokes? Many jokes. But we\u2019re goldfish and get used to new items. And the trick is that bringing up the treadmill now is actually worse, because then I\u2019ll start rambling about some new treadmill desk health study and how I\u2019m going to live forever. So we\u2019ve reached a silent truce.I\u2019m in an open-plan office, and my desk neighbor Jack Nicas (who covers Apple) said he was a little concerned that I would be looming half a foot off the ground walking 10 miles a day straight at him.\u201cBut it\u2019s kind of soothing now,\u201d he said during a recent interview I conducted while treading directly at him and typing this. \u201cIt\u2019s also giving me this intense self-loathing sitting here while you\u2019re walking all day.\u201dGreat!Wool shoes.I will be honest: The e-commerce wool shoe market niche is a lot bigger than I had imagined. Pared-down e-commerce basics shops like Everlane and Allbirds are interesting to watch (though I think Amazon might eat them all). There will be good stories in what people do with storefronts instead of selling things.The biggest shift will be when we get self-driving cars. But that\u2019s kind of obvious.Outside work, what tech product do you love? What\u2019s so great about it, and what could be better?I love it. It gives me a sense of control over something I felt had too much power, and that is a small daily satisfaction.These phones are designed to look and work like slot machines \u2014 hit us with bright colors and little pings to activate and please \u2014 and I\u2019m glad to have scrubbed some of that. My computer screen is grayscale as well.To step back, as our screen worlds have gotten better and so deeply immersive, we all have to figure out little hooks to pull back into the physical world (assuming we want to be pulled back). For me, for now, a good hook is color \u2014 the world is colorful, and my screens are gray.Advertisement"}

The crimes, he added, created \u201cdeep scars in the trust of investors and entrepreneurs who, until recently, saw Brazil as a good investment option.\u201dFernando Martins, Mr. Batista\u2019s lawyer, said in a text message that he expected his client would remain free while the conviction was appealed. People convicted of white-collar crimes in Brazil are often allowed to remain free until their conviction and sentence have been reviewed by an appeals court.Mr. Batista got his start in business mining for gold in the Amazon when he was in his 20s. As his wealth multiplied, he became the rare, unabashedly ambitious and ostentatious billionaire in South America, where rich families tend to keep a lower profile.At the time, Mr. Batista, who ran EBX Corporation, told investors that Brazil had exponential growth potential and billed himself as the best vehicle for those who wanted to cash in.\u201cMy racehorse is Brazil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Brazil today has the wealth that America had at the turn of the century.\u201dDuring the peak of his influence, Mr. Batista portrayed himself as a philanthropic executive committed to improving his home city, Rio de Janeiro. He donated cars for the local police force, invested in the renovation of a famous hotel and set out to clean up a lake that was seen as a central site for the 2016 Olympic Games.He vowed publicly to overtake Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim as the world\u2019s richest man by 2015, but his empire began to crumble well before that.Mr. Batista\u2019s oil company filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after his oil fields were producing a fraction of what he had committed, prompting investors to withdraw from several of his ventures.His fortune declined as Brazil\u2019s economy entered into a recession in 2014 and federal investigators began exposing a vast web of kickback schemes that crippled several of the country\u2019s top companies.Mr. Batista was held in an ordinary prison for three months while awaiting trial, but the Supreme Court ruled that he could remain free while the case moved forward.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Dai Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco. It\u2019s my turn to write this newsletter, and, as luck would have it, my moment in the sun comes on a light summer news week.The great thing about the summer is that it\u2019s barbecue season. That means lots of casual conversations where I break free from my technology and news bubble and gauge whether the things we write about are reaching a broader audience.This year, more than I can remember in the recent past, it\u2019s clear how ingrained the tech industry has become in our lives and how people are constantly discussing the ripple effects of its influence and money. Tech was central to discussions I had about local and national politics, real estate prices and how to raise children. The company that most people wanted to talk about? Facebook.Last weekend, while I was in Seattle, Facebook was Topic A with a group of non-tech folks. One told me that she had deleted her Facebook account a month ago. I asked if it was because she was upset about the role Facebook played in the 2016 presidential election. It wasn\u2019t really that, she said. Facebook made her feel bad about herself. She found herself being a person she didn\u2019t like when she was scrolling the News Feed, and she decided that she could live without it. She remains on Instagram because she enjoys it.In my limited sample size, the complaints about Facebook were less about misinformation on the platform or the proliferation of ads. They seemed more basic than that: relatives writing distasteful posts about politics or acquaintances oversharing about their personal lives. For the first time, I noticed people were making excuses as to why they were even on Facebook anymore as though it was an embarrassing vice.I\u2019m heading out on vacation soon with the goal of detoxing a little from my tech use. But before I go, I have to order a few last-minute items on Amazon, download kid-friendly shows from Netflix for my iPad, arrange a few social outings with friends on Facebook Messenger and make sure my privacy settings are in order because my family is definitely going to tag me on Facebook in vacation photos.

{"Headline": "Who Gets Left Out of the Urban Tech Boom?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Perry writes about race, structural inequality and urban schools.In the mid-1980s, when I was on my high school\u2019s cross-country team, I used to run along Penn Avenue from my hometown, Wilkinsburg, into the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. I never knew exactly during those days where I entered or exited either city.Buttressed by the nearby Westinghouse Electric complex, Wilkinsburg\u2019s downtown flowed into East Liberty. Wilkinsburg was mixed, about 53 percent black, and the black residents of Wilkinsburg, including my adoptive parents, worked and went to school in both places. You could easily miss the changing color of the street signs from green (Wilkinsburg) to blue (Pittsburgh). The smell from the Nabisco factory, just across the border on the Pittsburgh side, was a better signal. The buttery smell of Ritz crackers welcomed me into the bigger city.The 1990s were especially hard on both Wilkinsburg and East Liberty. Westinghouse laid off thousands of workers. The Nabisco factory closed in 1998. With fewer jobs available, dozens of my classmates sold drugs, ending up addicted, in jail or dead from related violence. I was lucky; I left for college and made a career for myself in other cities.More important, Wilkinsburg is losing people, mostly white. From 1990 to 2010, its population fell to 15,930, from 21,080, and the population changed to more than two-thirds black. Those who remain are more likely to be poor: The poverty rate among Wilkinsburg families rose to 20.9 percent in 2016, from 14.3 percent in 1990. In Wilkinsburg, the largest employer, as it has been for years, is New LifeCare Hospitals, with 260 employees.What makes these two places so different? In Pittsburgh, as in any other city, economic growth is a direct result of strategic investments in leadership, talent and infrastructure. These resources have helped places like East Liberty attract new companies and new jobs. What\u2019s missing in Wilkinsburg is investments in people with real links to black-owned businesses, entrepreneurs and historically black institutions, which cultivate conditions for economic and social growth. Many of the academic institutions and businesses that regularly receive investments in the metro area have no deep ties to black communities. Consequently, those dollars don\u2019t go beyond those social networks.Whether it\u2019s Amazon, Google or their future competitors, as the tech industry pours money into Pittsburgh, it needs to look more closely at where exactly that money is going.It could be going to Wilkinsburg. The town has great infrastructure. It has its own exit off Interstate 376 and great access to public transportation. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Carlow University are a bus ride away. But it has gotten little investment other than a small nonprofit business incubator and a project by the Wilkinsburg Community Development Corporation to raise $6 million for a train station restoration project.Real estate developers have shown some interest in Wilkinsburg, and many residents welcome that interest if it will bring people \u2014 black or white \u2014 back to the town. But if that investment is narrowly focused, there is a danger: It may bring only gentrification and displacement, rather than aiding local businesses.Derrick Tillman, a local developer, is trying to build affordable housing and market-rate housing, but he says he has not been able to break into the funding networks that are helping parts of Pittsburgh. \u201cWe\u2019ve struggled to attract the funds that could catalyze Wilkinsburg because we\u2019re not part of investment capital circles for large-scale projects,\u201d he told me.Wilkinsburg is a proud black city. And I believe it has real potential. For the first time, the mayor is black, the police chief is black and the head of the school district is black. And small businesses are returning to Penn Avenue. This could be the time for Wilkinsburg\u2019s great comeback.Investors and technology companies looking to expand in Pittsburgh and other cities have to do more to make sure that the benefits of their growth are not limited to their own social networks. And legislators must do more to hold tech companies accountable to a social contract built to enhance the quality of life for all of a city\u2019s residents \u2014 not just a tech company\u2019s well-paid employees.Ten years ago, Pittsburgh was no different from the many other industrial cities badly in need of a new identity. At some point, someone made a strong case to investors that certain people and institutions in Pittsburgh should be trusted \u2014 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and other anchors of the revival. Those individuals and organizations were able to convert that trust into growth. Investors, civic leaders and philanthropists need to extend that trust to everyone.Andre Perry is a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wages Are Rising in Europe. But Economists Are Puzzled.", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie \u2014 at least in Europe. Just don\u2019t ask why, or whether it will last.In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track.Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged.The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe.\u201cThis is one of the big economic questions of our time,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London.Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens\u2019 paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth.When official data last month showed that hourly wages in the eurozone rose 2 percent in the first three months of 2018 \u2014 finally \u2014 the central bank got the signal it was looking for. It announced it would end its main stimulus measure at the end of the year. At a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council on Thursday, that plan was reaffirmed.And because officials don\u2019t know for sure why wage growth recovered in the region, they can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s sustainable. Japan has seen surges in wage growth that quickly sputtered.Back in simpler days, falling unemployment usually led to higher wages. Employers had to compete harder for workers, and paychecks rose across the board. Inflation also went up, at least temporarily, as businesses passed on the higher cost of labor to customers.But in recent years the relationship between growth, wages and inflation has become much harder to understand. Economists have devoted enormous energy trying to explain why inflation and wages remained stuck in neutral even as unemployment in countries like Germany fell to record lows.Economists there offered numerous theories to explain the phenomenon. The decline of unions has taken away employees\u2019 bargaining power, some said. Globalization, outsourcing, and the easy flow of money and information across borders have also forced workers in wealthy countries to compete with those in poorer ones.Another suggestion is that the rise of companies like Apple, Google and Amazon has concentrated power in fewer companies and squelched competition. And the so-called sharing economy, exemplified by Uber or Airbnb, has made many people into freelancers with few benefits.Flat wage growth in Germany during the last two decades coincided with reforms that allowed companies to opt out of collective bargaining agreements, weakening union power. In France, where union agreements applied to whole industries and were binding for companies, wages continued to climb and inequality was less pronounced.But France paid a price. While unemployment fell below 4 percent in Germany, it remains above 9 percent in France. The implication is that companies may not hire as much if they are locked into union wage contracts.Professor Sch\u00f6nberg pointed out that pay in Germany has begun rising again, suggesting that the effect of reforms was temporary. At a certain point, low unemployment does still seem to lead to higher wages. It just may take longer than it used to.That is no doubt what the European Central Bank is counting on. Wages are a key issue for the bank because, by law, its job is to keep inflation at or close to 2 percent. It would be hard to believe that inflation is on an upward trend without an accompanying rise in pay.Even after five years of steady economic growth, until recently inflation in the 19-nation euro area remained stubbornly below the official target. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in May and 2 percent in June, but the numbers were not very convincing. The increases were due almost exclusively to a steep rise in energy prices, which fluctuate often.Wage growth \u201cwas the key variable we would look at for convergence of inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in June after a meeting of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council.Still, economists are far away from any consensus on why wages have taken so long to rise even when companies gripe they can\u2019t find the people they need.Mr. Talavera of Oxford Economics argues that unemployment data does not measure large numbers of workers who have given up looking for jobs. When demand for labor recovers, these people join the work force again, acting as a buffer and preventing labor shortages.This hidden reserve of workers is bigger than economists thought, Mr. Talavera said. But in Europe it appears to have finally been exhausted. \u201cThat is one of the reasons you haven\u2019t seen wage growth picking up substantially,\u201d he said.If he\u2019s right, that should mean that wages will continue to rise.The fact that low wage growth has afflicted virtually every wealthy country, though, suggests that there are deeper forces at work that are not yet fully understood.Aviv Nevo, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, summed up the mood of uncertainty about the dynamics of wages and prices by referring to the idea of the streetlight effect, where researchers look for information only where it is easiest to find, rather than probing further.During a discussion in Sintra, Professor Nevo said, \u201cWe\u2019re all drunks looking under the lamppost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry.The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions?Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences.This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices.One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights \u2014 not unlike splitting AT&T into eight \u201cBaby Bells\u201d nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission\u2019s verdict on Microsoft\u2019s dominant market position in the 2000s.But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants.In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies \u2014 such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence \u2014 to upend existing industries.\u201cOld economy\u201d companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants.Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "With big ambitions in India, the retail giant has recruited hundreds of small businesses to get packages to the most remote customers \u2014 including those 11,562 feet up in the Himalayas.Supported byLEH, India \u2014 Perched high in the Himalayas, near India\u2019s border with China, the tiny town of Leh sometimes seems as if it has been left behind by modern technology. Internet and cellphone service is spotty, the two roads to the outside world are snowed in every winter, and Buddhist monasteries compete with military outposts for prime mountaintop locations.But early each morning, the convenience of the digital age arrives, by way of a plane carrying 15 to 20 bags of packages from Amazon. At an elevation of 11,562 feet, Leh is the highest spot in the world where the company offers speedy delivery.When the plane arrives from New Delhi, it is met by employees from Amazon\u2019s local delivery partner, Incredible Himalaya, who then shuttle the packages by van to a modest warehouse nearby. Eshay Rangdol, 26, the nephew of the owner, helps oversee the sorting of the packages and delivers many of them himself. Amazon began offering doorstep delivery in this region last fall, as part of an effort to better serve the remotest corners of India. Sales volume in Leh is up twelvefold since Incredible Himalaya took over deliveries from the postal service, which was much slower and required customers to pick up packages at the post office.Skalzing Dolma, a frequent Amazon customer, was Mr. Rangdol\u2019s first stop on a recent day, receiving a delivery of bedsheets and eye shadow. Ms. Dolma has bought everything from clothing to kitchen appliances on Amazon and estimated that she has spent a total of 100,000 rupees, or around $1,500, on the site. With few choices in Leh stores, cosmetics and clothing are popular categories for Amazon here.Orders typically arrive in five to seven days, slower than the two-day delivery that Amazon\u2019s big-city customers receive but quicker than the monthlong journey they often took with the post office.Fortunately for Amazon, the local soldiers and monks are big customers. Thinley Odzer, a monk at the tiny Kartse Monastery, received a backpack. In the past, he has bought mobile phone cases and parts for his motorbike.Leh hardly seems like the kind of market that would appeal to a global e-commerce giant like Amazon. Internet service \u2014 essential to placing an order \u2014 cuts out frequently during the best of times and goes down entirely for weeks or months during winter, when the trunk line to Srinagar, the state capital, is damaged under the snow. Amazon may never make money shipping products by air to customers in Leh. But the idea is that profits from dense urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi will subsidize service to more remote ones.\u201cWe want to make delivery convenient to where our customers are,\u201d said Tim Collins, Amazon\u2019s vice president of global logistics. \u201cOver time, the economics will work themselves out.\u201dThe strategy rankles Leh merchants like Nawang Shispa, owner of Tsering Electronics, who said his sales of phones and accessories had dropped 10 percent since Amazon started quicker delivery to the community. Still, his salesmen compensate. One of them sold a new Oppo smartphone to Jigmat Amo, 16, by slightly undercutting Amazon\u2019s price. Ms. Amo said she was a bit leery of Amazon after buying a handbag and a pair of ballet shoes from the site that did not look like the pictures.Liyaqat Ali, owner of the Singay General Store in the main town square, figured that there is room enough for both him and Amazon. He does a brisk business selling groceries and sundries like diapers, which people typically need right away. \u201cAmazon is new to Leh, and the internet is not so good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you order something like diapers, you have to wait a week to 10 days.\u201dMr. Rangdol said that in addition to delivering packages and managing the delivery warehouse, he taught people how to order on Amazon.

{"Headline": "Already at Movie Theaters Near You: Ticket Subscriptions", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe really like the subscription model,\u201d said Tim League, chief executive of Alamo Drafthouse, which operates in 10 states. \u201cBut we want to get it right. It\u2019s important to us to build a model that is sustainable for the long term.\u201dHere is a look at prominent movie ticket subscription offers:Still the dominant service, despite mounting questions about whether it can survive. It had more than three million paying members as of June 13. MoviePass executives aggressively insist that the company is viable and say membership could swell to roughly 5 million by January. On Monday, Helios and Matheson said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it hoped to raise $1.2 billion over three years to fund growth.Under the MoviePass model theaters are paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that works like a debit card. When members want to see a movie (no more than one a day), they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry.And it all works independently of theaters.The MoviePass system functions in 91 percent of theaters, including the more than 8,200 movie screens operated by AMC in the United States. But it\u2019s clunky. While the new AMC subscription service may have an unwieldy name, it works without a special debit card and, unlike MoviePass, also allows all subscribers to reserve seats online.The AMC version also includes access to Imax and other large-format theaters for no extra fee and allows members to see more than one movie a day.Mark Zoradi, Cinemark\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call in May that Movie Club had 230,000 members. He said initial results indicated that subscriptions appealed \u201cto the masses rather than just the most frequent value-seeking consumers.\u201d (MoviePass has described Movie Club as \u201cvapid.\u201d)\u201cWe won\u2019t really know until the actual testing begins, but we\u2019re ready to get rolling,\u201d Mr. League, the chief executive of Alamo Drafthouse, said, adding that he sees subscription plans as one way for smaller films to thrive. \u201cFor films that people may not know a lot about, subscription lowers the barrier of entry \u2014 sure, why not check this out.\u201dStarted in 2015 in Turkey, this under-the-radar service bears the most similarity to MoviePass.Unlike MoviePass, however, Sinemia offers tiered pricing. For $16 a month, \u201celite\u201d subscribers receive three tickets a month. \u201cClassic\u201d subscribers receive one ticket a month for $5. (Sinemia subscriptions are sold annually, so that elite package will be billed at about $192.) Sinemia on Friday began offering various family plans, including one that allows a family of five to go to the movies three times a month for $75.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Streaming Niche Sports Dawns", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new generation of niche sports is looking to streaming instead of big networks to find more exposure and new fans. Karate Combat, a full-contact karate league, held its first event in Miami in April.Only a few hundred fans were in attendance, which was intentional for this niche sports organization that launched this year and is far more focused on making money from media deals than putting people in seats. Michael DePietro, Karate Combat\u2019s chief executive, expects 65 to 70 percent of the venture\u2019s revenue to come from media, including streams of events on the Karate Combat website. Sponsorships, dojo franchising and merchandise will produce much of the rest. Attendance revenue contributes a paltry sum, even though it was once the lifeblood of all sports.DePietro said he has traditional television offers in hand, but he is using a new playbook for small sports that no longer see an upside in scraping to get on networks large and small. Instead they are focused on digital streaming, a delivery system that does not require fans to pay for an expensive television subscription at a time when those accounts are becoming increasingly unpopular, especially among younger consumers.\u201cWe want to do something that is engaging to younger audiences over time. Right now it is the video game, flash back to the 80s feel,\u201d DePietro said.Karate Combat fights don\u2019t take place in a ring or a cage, but a sunken pit that allows cameras an unobstructed shot of the karatekas. The goal is to stage fights in exotic locations around the world. The next event will be in the courtyard of the Zappeion in Athens, near the Parthenon and Arch of Hadrian.The events are presented to look almost like a real life version of the video game Street Fighter. The streams of the fights are accompanied by live biometric data and a chat window. Those innovations directly target younger viewers.There are also more than a dozen distribution partners around the world who split ad revenue with Karate Combat. A spokesman said more than one million people viewed at least some part of the Miami event, though the figure could not be independently verified.A decade ago, DePietro would have been forced to rely on attendance, which would have made staging fights in a sunken pit and exotic locations difficult. He would have begged CBS, NBC and ESPN to pay a pittance for the rights to show a few hours of his league in the middle of the night, or paid for airtime himself. Onscreen biometric data and real-time fan interaction would have been nearly impossible.Today, his options, and those of a host of other new niche sports offerings, are almost limitless. Besides the incumbent television companies, tech powerhouses like Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are experimenting with sports rights. Pure streaming plays abound, with television companies like ESPN, with ESPN+, and Turner, with B/R Live, attempting to disrupt themselves.Others, like Stadium, Eleven and FloSports, project bright futures for their well-funded start-ups as they hope to become even fractionally as profitable as ESPN. Leagues can also opt to stream directly on social media platforms like Twitch and Twitter.\u201cIt is the greatest time to be a sports fan in the history of the world,\u201d said Burke Magnus, the ESPN executive in charge of programming. No matter how small or unpopular a league or team is, their games are probably streaming to fans somewhere, he said.To be sure, even with an energetic promotional campaign, streaming services and the niche sports they show face plenty of significant challenges before they become a viable alternative to broadcast or cable television.Most important, they need more exposure and more eyeballs. A relatively small amount of people know these sports and services exist. The number of subscribers to the services is a fraction of the 607,000 daily viewers ESPN averaged last quarter or the 87 million homes who receive the network. Far more people would stumble across Karate Combat on ESPN than stream it on karate.com.Streaming services also have yet to figure out a way to take advantage of the economics of bundling. Pay television distributors pay nearly $8 each month for each subscriber who receives ESPN \u2014 and more than a dollar each for the NFL Network and FS1, as well as other regional sports networks, even though a small percentage of their customers watch these channels. Streaming services only receive revenue from customers who actively choose to subscribe or watch.No sports streaming service has nearly the portfolio of rights of even a second-tier cable sports channel \u2014 acquiring those rights would take billions of dollars they do not have. With the recent proliferation of digital sports streaming services, it is possible that many, perhaps even the majority, of the services and the sports they show will fail.And yet, optimists abound. Consider arm wrestling. Steve Kaplan earnestly believes arm wrestling is the sport of the future. It is also a sport of the past. Arm wrestling\u2019s World\u2019s Strongest Man competition was a pillar of the so-called \u201ctrash sports\u201d craze in the 1970s that included shows like \u201cThe Superstars\u201d and \u201cSurvival of the Fittest.\u201dKaplan, president of the World Armwrestling League, insisted arm wrestling was ready for a reboot.\u201cIt\u2019s ordinary people doing extraordinary things,\u201d he said. To succeed, the sport has to migrate from the raucous bars that host its competitions to the television or the phone.Enter B/R Live, the new streaming service from Turner Sports, which signed a multiyear agreement with the World Armwrestling League. Kaplan declined to disclose details of the deal but the league and the streaming service will share revenue. That will give both parties incentive to promote the World Armwrestling League as much as possible.The World Armwrestling League previously had an agreement with ESPN to televise eight hours of competition. Kaplan praised ESPN, but he said the sport needed more exposure, and B/R Live offered heavy promotion.In Austin, Tex., FloSports encompasses all of the possibilities and pitfalls of this business. Launched more than a decade ago with the goal of becoming the ESPN of the digital age, it followed ESPN\u2019s early playbook: Begin by buying rights to niche sports, and slowly work toward more mainstream ones.FloSports is mostly known for its running and wrestling coverage, but it is rapidly expanding. Mark Floreani, the chief executive, said FloSports has signed more than 100 rights agreements this year already, though none is with a major sports organization. He argued that streaming allows FloSports to show niche sports better than a traditional television channel would.He gave the example of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship, held in May. In the early rounds there were as many as 20 near-simultaneous matches on different mats. A traditional broadcaster would have had to designate one the most popular and important to show, and then cut to other mats as warranted, similar to how tennis tournaments are usually broadcast.Instead, FloSports had a sparse setup of camera, graphics, and a play-by-play commentator on each mat, allowing fans to pick which they wanted to watch, as well as the FloZone, a whip-around option showing parts of the most interesting matches, similar to NFL RedZone channel. As competitors were eliminated and the number of mats reduced, additional cameras and personnel were assigned to those remaining.FloSports aims its coverage at the core fan, and hopes to grow the sport\u2019s fan base. The result is far less money than an established league gets for being on ESPN, but the inventory still pulls in viewers.That does not mean FloSports will topple the legacy networks tomorrow, but the company is already serving as an alternative in a market that craves them.\u201cTo be able to get all of that in one place,\u201d he said, \u201cis really the proposition that we are selling to at this point in our evolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Giants Take Their Talent Hunt to Cambridge", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "A boom in artificial intelligence research has drawn the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies and their checkbooks to the storied English city.Supported byCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 When you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station, you will not see the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel or the turrets atop the Trinity Great Court. The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}

Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment further.Leonard Riggio, who bought Barnes & Noble in 1971 and expanded it into a national chain, acted as chief executive between Mr. Boire\u2019s tenure and that of Mr. Parneros. Mr. Riggio remains the executive chairman of the company.Barnes & Noble has been battered by digital competition, most notably from Amazon.com, and has struggled with declining foot traffic, shrinking sales and store closures. Amazon is aggressively expanding into physical retail, with more than a dozen bookstores around the country and a growing number of pop-up stores, as well as an expanded physical footprint through its acquisition of Whole Foods.At the same time, there has been a surprising resurgence among independent booksellers, whose numbers have risen substantially in recent years after decades of decline. And sales of print books have rebounded, a trend that should have benefited Barnes & Noble.After becoming chief executive last year, Mr. Parneros brought in new executives and introduced several new initiatives intended to increase store traffic and sales, including a Barnes & Noble book club.During a recent call to discuss earnings, Mr. Parneros said the store would be experimenting with new store prototypes this year, with smaller and \u201cmore flexible\u201d designs for stores. Still, the company\u2019s sales have continued to decline and its stock price has dropped more than 30 percent since Mr. Parneros became chief executive.The company\u2019s most recent earnings report, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, showed that sales fell by more than 6 percent in the year through April. Sales for the company\u2019s digital Nook business fell 23.9 percent.The vagueness of Barnes & Noble\u2019s announcement left industry experts to speculate about the reasons for Mr. Parneros\u2019s departure and scrutinize the timing of the announcement, which came late in the day just before the Independence Day holiday.\u201cThis either means that they want to bury it, because this is a week when nobody\u2019s around,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, a publishing expert and the founder of the Idea Logical Company, \u201cor that something came to light, some inexorable, unresolvable conflict surfaced and called for an immediate change that was not negotiable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Georgia Governor Candidate Caught Saying He\u2019s in Race to Be the \u2018Craziest\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 It has become the \u201cdeplorables\u201d moment of the Georgia governor\u2019s race.In a private conversation secretly recorded in May and made public on Monday, Casey Cagle, the Republican lieutenant governor, was captured criticizing the over-the-top tone of his party\u2019s primary. He said that it had become focused on \u201cwho had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck, and who could be the craziest.\u201dNow Mr. Cagle\u2019s opponent in the July 24 Republican runoff for governor, Brian Kemp, is accusing Mr. Cagle of turning up his nose at the salt-of-the-earth Republican base \u2014 much as President Trump did when, as a candidate, he criticized Hillary Clinton for using the phrase \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d to describe many of his supporters.Mr. Cagle\u2019s campaign has insisted that he was referring to the candidates, not the voters. But the recording of Mr. Cagle underscored the dilemma for a Republican Party in which some leaders are privately put off by the rough and raucous style perfected by Mr. Trump \u2014 but fear that any criticism of that style might be interpreted as contempt for voters who are energized by it.Setting the tone of the race, perhaps more than anyone, is Mr. Kemp, Georgia\u2019s longtime secretary of state, who has run TV ads that feature him brandishing various guns, revving up a chain saw to \u201crip up some regulations\u201d and declaring, in his drawly baritone, that he would use his \u201cbig truck\u201d to \u201cround up\u201d criminal undocumented immigrants.The drift to the right is being closely watched in Atlanta, the Southeast\u2019s great commercial powerhouse, where business and civic leaders are loath to see expressions of prejudice that might exacerbate Southern stereotypes and affect bottom lines. Amplifying that concern: The city, like many others nationwide, is hoping to woo Amazon, which is looking for a place to build its second headquarters.Democrats, meanwhile, hope the rough Republican primary will help their candidate, Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader, attract more moderate voters in the fall, even though Ms. Abrams, the first African-American to secure a nomination for governor in Georgia, supports abortion rights and stricter gun control.On Thursday, the state Democratic Party said in a statement that either Republican candidate, if elected, would \u201cundo and destroy the advances that Georgia has made under the Deal administration, particularly on Georgia\u2019s business climate.\u201dBoth Republican candidates have pledged that, if elected, they would sign \u201creligious liberty\u201d legislation that gay-rights advocates call discriminatory. Governor Deal vetoed a version of the legislation in 2016 after pushback from business and L.G.B.T. leaders.But Mr. Cagle and Mr. Kemp also say they would make Georgia more business-friendly, not less, with low taxes and less regulation. Indeed, there appears to be little difference between the two Republican candidates\u2019 governing philosophies, which may explain why Mr. Kemp and Mr. Cagle have taken to accusing each other of a litany of misdeeds and untruths, all while more secret recordings of Mr. Cagle emerge \u2014 and while Mr. Kemp doubles down on the folksy, transgressive front-porch image that he markets as \u201cpolitically incorrect conservative.\u201dThe secret recording of Mr. Cagle released on Monday was made by Clay Tippins, one of four Republicans candidates who failed to make the runoff in the first round of voting in May. In one previously released snippet, which Mr. Tippins released to local media, Mr. Cagle can be heard saying he supported a bill that he considered to be bad policy because he thought it would stymie another rival candidate\u2019s fund-raising chances.In the recording, Mr. Cagle acknowledges that Mr. Kemp\u2019s ads are \u201ccreative\u201d and helped propel him into a second-place finish \u2014 and a spot in the runoff \u2014 in the May election, earning 25.6 percent of the vote to Mr. Cagle\u2019s 38.9 percent.The ads also sparked a firestorm of free publicity for Mr. Kemp as national news outlets rushed to report on and criticize them. Much was made of the fact that Mr. Kemp, in one ad, points a shotgun toward a young male character who is trying to date Mr. Kemp\u2019s daughter.\u201cYep,\u201d Mr. Kemp says, speaking into the camera, a smile at play on his lips. \u201cI just said that.\u201dIn Athens, Mr. Kemp\u2019s hometown, there is some eye rolling at his onscreen persona. Though no one has doubted his fondness for hunting and the Second Amendment, others note that Mr. Kemp, 54, is a wealthy businessman who grew up in the heart of a sophisticated college town and was perhaps laying it on a bit thick.Even so, Mr. Kemp displayed an easy way with the voters who came to see him in South Georgia on Wednesday as his bus tour took him to the cities of Moultrie, Adel and Valdosta. The crowds chuckled when he passed around a diesel can for gas money. Mr. Kemp made multiple references to the regulation-cutting chain saw in his ads.\u201cYou know what, people are ready for an unapologetic conservative that will say what you\u2019re thinking, that will put you first, ahead of those special interests, ahead of the status quo, ahead of those that are here illegally,\u201d Mr. Kemp said on the steps of the Lowdnes County courthouse.Some voters at the events recognized that some of Mr. Kemp\u2019s presentation was exaggerated shtick, while others felt that liberal America should lighten up. Charlie Hoes, 54, a Moultrie businessman, referred to the ad in which Mr. Kemp points a shotgun at one of his daughter\u2019s suitors, and said he took Mr. Kemp seriously, but not always literally. \u201cHe\u2019s not saying if you mess with her, I\u2019ll come kill you,\u201d he said.\u201cI think we are in a society where we are offended way too easily,\u201d said Angie Crawford, 52, an insurance seller from Hahira, Ga.\u201cI give him credit,\u201d said James C. Cobb, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Georgia who called Mr. Kemp\u2019s style a form of identity politics that appeal to white Georgians. \u201cHe\u2019s a shrewder politician than I realized.\u201dAs he mingled with supporters at a soda fountain in Moultrie, Mr. Kemp, in jeans in a pair of wine-dark cowboy boots, made the \u201cdeplorables\u201d comparison explicit. \u201cIt sounds like Casey Cagle\u2019s gotten like Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI would ask all those crazies to vote Brian Kemp for governor in the Republican runoff.\u201dThe Cagle campaign has had little choice but to own what its candidate said on the recordings. Soon after the first snippet was released, Mr. Cagle\u2019s campaign manager, Scott Binkley, released a statement that doubled down on the contention that Mr. Kemp\u2019s ads were \u201ccrazy.\u201d\u201cWhile Brian Kemp\u2019s ad campaign was admitting that he apparently had no qualifications beyond owning a truck, Casey Cagle was talking about creating 600,000 jobs with Gov. Deal, college and career academies, and helping struggling parents who need options beyond foster care.\u201dSince Mr. Kemp became Georgia\u2019s secretary of state in 2010, liberals have focused on what they see as his efforts to curtail the minority vote. He supports a state voter ID requirement, and his office has questioned the validity of thousands of voter registrations gathered by a group founded by Ms. Abrams.But Mr. Cagle has emphasized what he considers Mr. Kemp\u2019s incompetence on the job. In a contentious Thursday night debate, Mr. Cage mentioned, among other things, a 2015 gaffe in which Mr. Kemp\u2019s office released the Social Security numbers and other personal information of more than six million voters.Mr. Kemp landed his own blows in the debate, including references to the recordings. \u201cYou should be explaining the lies that you\u2019re telling, and you\u2019re doing this to deflect your own words on the Clay Tippins tape, putting politics and campaign contributions ahead of good public policy,\u201d he said.Earlier that day, Mr. Cagle, 52, had taken his case to a local Jaycees meeting at a pizza parlor in his hometown, Gainesville, Ga., a poultry-processing center about an hour north of Atlanta. Mr. Cagle, an avid triathlete, is a trim man who favors rounded glasses that give him an air of a 1920s bookkeeper. He spoke at length about ways to alleviate regional traffic problems and vowed to continue the positive business climate that he would inherit if elected.Afterward, Bill Rhoads, 39, a local lawyer, declared himself \u201cundecided,\u201d but said he could not vote for Mr. Kemp. He said that in past years, the secretary of state\u2019s office had been exceedingly slow in issuing business licenses. He also agreed with Mr. Cagle\u2019s assertion that ads like Mr. Kemp\u2019s were crazy.Mr. Cagle enjoys a large money advantage over Mr. Kemp going into the final stretch of the primary campaign, but whether he can outgun Mr. Kemp remains to be seen. Earlier this year, Mr. Cagle supported a move that killed a tax break sought by Delta Air Lines after the airline ended a promotional discount for members of the National Rifle Association.The N.R.A. rewarded Mr. Cagle with its endorsement, and on Saturday, it planned to send its president-elect, Oliver North, to three Cagle events in Georgia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs big supermarkets struggle, a new crop of local groceries are innovating to serve niche audiences and advance social causes.Once the city calmed down, he pondered his next move. After three days of prayer and fasting, Mr. Hogg had an answer.\u201cGod said I needed to open a grocery store,\u201d he said.\u201cBy and large, supermarkets are kind of behind the eight ball\u201d in responding to changes in how people shop, said Diana Smith, the associate director of retail and apparel for the market research company Mintel.Customers, especially younger ones, want stores that offer what some industry analysts have come to call \u201cfood experiences,\u201d with craft beer on tap, meals to go and vegetable butchers. They tend to shop only when they cook, visiting more than one store to collect ingredients, rather than making a weekly trip to stock the pantry with toilet paper, chuck roast and gallons of milk.But some of the most radical reinvention is happening at the local level, in both cities and small towns, where a new breed of small community stores use the grocery aisles to fill cultural niches and address social needs.At Nada, everything, including toothpaste and chocolate, is sold package-free. Shoppers can buy scoops of frozen berries, a handful of crackers and just one egg, if that\u2019s all they need. There\u2019s no plastic wrap or paper at the deli counter. Customers bring their own containers, buy reusable ones at the store or take some from a stack that have been cleaned and sanitized, using a digital scale to weigh and tag them before they start shopping.The store won\u2019t be equipped to sell fresh meat, but will soon add cured meats and more frozen seafood (caught in a sustainable way, of course). Suppliers, too, have to be willing to reduce waste: A local coffee roaster, for example, delivers beans in refillable bulk containers.Ms. Miller, a marine-mammal biologist who has a big vegetable garden and likes to bake, opened Nada after she saw how much plastic waste was choking the oceans. \u201cIt was a leap of faith,\u201d she said.About 300 people showed up \u2014 more than she expected \u2014 to shop in the 2,332-square-foot store on its first day. Business continues to beat projections, and Ms. Miller has fielded more than 100 calls from people all over the world who want to know if she plans to franchise or who hope to open their own version.\u201cIt just shows how much people want to buy their food this way,\u201d she said.Two thousand miles away in New Prague, Minn., population around 7,600, Kendra and Paul Rasmusson have been inundated with inquiries from people equally enamored with their grocery concept: a store that is largely unstaffed.Then, inspired by a nearby 24-hour fitness center, they had an idea: Why not create a store that didn\u2019t need staff, for shoppers who wanted organic ketchup, gluten-free crackers and vegetables from local farmers?Members can use a space upstairs for community meetings, or hold classes on making kombucha or Spanish for children. And the store is not completely unmanned. It is open to the public nine hours a week, with an actual cashier.The Rasmussons don\u2019t worry too much about theft. They can monitor the store, which is only 650 square feet, with remote cameras. Inventory is tracked digitally, and they have a one-theft-and-you\u2019re-banned-forever policy.\u201cThese rural communities are losing grocery stores, and it isn\u2019t making sense to keep them open,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need new models.\u201dMore than 80 people from around the world who are interested in opening a version of her unstaffed store have contacted her since Farmhouse Market opened. \u201cI tell people we just pieced it together and dug in and figured it out,\u201d she said.Many eat at a nearby McDonald\u2019s or a KFC, or walk a quarter-mile to the Giant Food. People around here tend to shop for groceries a day at a time, Mr. Hogg said. Budgets don\u2019t allow for big, weekly shopping trips to stock up, and many residents lack a car.The cheery store, whose name is an abbreviation of the organization\u2019s motto, Doing the Most Good, feels a little bit like what Amazon would ship if you typed \u201cgrocery store\u201d into the search bar. And in a way, that\u2019s what Mr. Hogg did.The grocery cost $2.2 million to set up, and his operating costs are low because the Salvation Army handles human resources and some other business operations. The power company takes a quarter off the energy bill. Donations and grants pay for education and training. People from the neighborhood who stopped in one day in July said they didn\u2019t expect the store to be so nice or so inexpensive. \u201cAt first, we were like, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d said Jamie Rogers, 31, who was shopping with her sister, Stephanie Rogers, 29.Carol Parker, the cashier, scanned their groceries. As she bagged the food, she reminded the sisters always to check for weekly specials.She did a little cheerleading, too. \u201cWhat has Giant ever done for you? What has Safeway ever done for you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe\u2019re your store.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the couple who operate Farmhouse Market. They are Kendra and Paul Rasmusson, not Rasmussen.An earlier version of this article misidentified a grocery store in Baltimore. It is Giant Food, not Food Giant.An earlier version of this article misidentified a device used for checkout at Farmhouse Market. It is a tablet, not an iPad.

{"Headline": "Inside the Mating Rituals of Brands and Online Stars", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Recently at the Anaheim Convention Center, about 50 people entered a room decorated as a stylish lounge for a speed dating event. They moved from table to table every 20 minutes, exchanging small talk and getting to know each other.But the participants were not looking for love. They were YouTube stars and marketing executives from companies like Uber and Amazon seeking an advertising union.As the attention and money paid to stars on sites like YouTube and Instagram balloon, the stakes for both them and the brands to find the right match are rising. The speed dating event, held during VidCon, the online video industry\u2019s annual convention, was one way the two sides are testing each other out.Many popular online personalities built a huge audience by pushing the envelope, providing an edgy contrast to carefully managed mainstream celebrities. They want deals that allow them to keep their style. But when those creators go too far, companies that work with them risk being guilty by association.Most advertising deals with YouTube or Instagram stars now include a \u201cmorality clause.\u201d One such agreement, shown to The New York Times, stated that a creator would agree to take down any content within 12 hours if the brand determined that the talent had promoted a competing product, posted \u201cracy content\u201d on social media or performed \u201can act of moral turpitude.\u201dAdam Wescott, a partner and co-founder of Select Management Group, an agency that manages numerous top YouTube performers, said one advertiser had stipulated the amount of cleavage that one of his clients could show. When that creator posted an Instagram photo \u2014 unrelated to the advertiser\u2019s campaign \u2014 with more than the permissible cleavage, Mr. Wescott had to tell her to take down the photo.Increasingly, he wants the same right for his clients because they have just as much to lose if a company becomes embroiled in scandal, such as the right to take down a video sponsored by a company if that brand\u2019s executives are caught sexually harassing staff.\u201cWe just want to make sure it\u2019s mutual,\u201d Mr. Wescott said.The video creators also cannot do anything that betrays what their fans have come to expect.\u201cSome creators have viewership that rivals TV networks and a direct connection with viewers that is unlike anything the advertising or entertainment world has ever seen,\u201d said Zach Blume, partner at Portal A, a San Francisco firm making videos for creators and advertisers.\u201cSometimes, to be honest, a brand will come to me and I\u2019m almost like, \u2018Have you even watched my videos?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEvery creator has their balance to what makes them feel like a sellout or not.\u201dOne challenge, both creators and brands say, is that sponsored videos can\u2019t appear to be what they are: advertisements. The YouTube generation has learned to tune out ads \u2014 when they don\u2019t skip them altogether \u2014 so anything that carries the whiff of a traditional commercial often falls flat.The Federal Trade Commission requires that creators disclose when a piece of content is paid for. For YouTube videos, many creators overlay text with \u201csponsored by\u201d at the beginning of the video and then use \u201c#ad\u201d in the description to eliminate ambiguity.\u201cThe days of \u2018go buy this\u2019 are gone. It doesn\u2019t work so well right now,\u201d said Victor Lee, senior vice president of digital marketing at Hasbro, the toy and board game maker with brands such as Nerf, Monopoly and My Little Pony.Mr. Lee said a creator could talk to consumers as one of them, gaining a credibility that brands struggle to garner on their own.Mr. Lee said he avoided the speed dating events because he didn\u2019t want to put his brand in the hands of \u201csomeone who you met for a minute.\u201d With Mr. King, he felt the partnership would feel authentic because he heard Mr. King speak unprompted at a conference three years ago about how he was a huge Nerf fan.Last year, Nestl\u00e9 decided it wanted to reach \u201cGeneration Z\u201d consumers \u2014 basically any person who was born and raised with the internet \u2014 for Hot Pockets, the microwaveable snack. It reached deals with some of the biggest names on Twitch, a live video streaming site focused primarily on video games.The people Nestl\u00e9 selected produced more than 270 videos and posts for Hot Pockets, reaching a wide audience that it would struggle to match with traditional media without an enormous expense.\u201cThis has opened our minds,\u201d said Mohini Joshi, a marketing director at Nestl\u00e9. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t necessarily think that creating a TV spot is the only way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Down and Out in San Francisco, on $117,000 a Year", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s beyond laughable that a one-bedroom apartment can sell for $1.5 million in San Francisco \u2014 and get multiple offers within a day. Or that dumpsters sport satirical \u201cfor rent\u201d signs. Or that the asking price for a side order of brussels sprouts at many restaurants is $16.Beyond laughable because such stories pass like a Bay Area breeze in the city named for a pauper from medieval Assisi. But the latest assessment of the out-of-reach quality of one of the world\u2019s great places to live came as a real jolt:Once upon a time in the American West, the most exclusive places \u2014 Sun Valley, Aspen, Lake Tahoe, the San Juan Islands in Washington State \u2014 were known as \u201cgolden ghettos,\u201d an imperfect term used by trendy demographers.But now the entire West Coast, from San Diego to Vancouver, British Columbia, is a string of gilded megalopolises. These are the tomorrow cities, the tech cities, the cities of the young and educated. And each of them is struggling with a prosperity crisis that threatens the very nature of living there.A New Yorker would say, \u201cSo what, get used to paying through the nose to live in a tiny space on limited land.\u201d Manhattan, Brooklyn and now Queens have seen it all. But people on the West Coast, perhaps na\u00efvely, are not ready to say, \u201cFuhgeddaboudit.\u201d Not yet. With varying degrees of success, they are fighting for the soul of their cities.Residents of San Francisco are troubled by the same things that we are in my hometown, Seattle \u2014 the homeless and the high cost of living. The issues are linked, but not entirely.Raised in poverty, and the first African-American woman chosen to lead the city, Breed has vowed to remove homeless encampments within a year. There is nothing compassionate or financially sound in spending $250 million a year on homeless services that still leave thousands sleeping on the street.In order to do the other thing that Breed wants to do, build more housing of all kinds, she has to secure the social contract. That is: Can people accept more crowded neighborhoods, in a city that is already the second most densely populated among big cities in the nation, if they feel that elected leaders do not have a decent plan \u2014 or a clue?As Breed notes, San Francisco has created only one home for every eight new jobs between 2010 and 2015. She may not be ready to utter a hard truth that some residents already have: that not everyone who wants to live there can.In Seattle, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing city for this decade, the social contract is nearly broken. The city used to be run by creative problem solvers. Now, an ideologically driven City Council dreams up new things to anger residents while seeming to let the homeless have the run of the place.The latest backward move was a tax on jobs \u2014 quickly repealed after a citizens\u2019 revolt. While the council was trying to target Amazon, the city\u2019s biggest private employer, the tax would have also hurt grocery stores and family-run businesses, as if they had caused the homeless crisis and spike in real estate.Vancouver has taxed speculation, hitting foreign buyers and those who own homes that sit empty. Prices have stabilized somewhat. But the globalization of the housing market is a problem more particular to British Columbia.We need a new urbanism. For all the grumping about how great the cities facing the Pacific used to be, they can be greater still if the bright minds now trying to \u201cdisrupt\u201d a grilled cheese sandwich can focus on the biggest challenge of this generation. We know what doesn\u2019t work. The task is to find a creative mix of solutions that do.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to London Breed, the mayor-elect of San Francisco.

A BBC anchor told him Monday that he had \u201ccorrupted discourse for the entire world.\u201d Fox News was gentler, asking his mother what it was like to raise \u201cthis amazing child.\u201d (\u201cOh come on,\u201d she replied, with a laugh.)\u201cSome interviews are obviously more enjoyable than others,\u201d Mr. Spicer told The New York Times in a phone interview on Wednesday.Ms. Maitlis called the news conference the start of a \u201ccorrosive culture\u201d in the United States and beyond and said Mr. Spicer had corrupted the political conversation \u201cby going along with these lies.\u201dHe readily admitted wanting a \u201cdo-over\u201d of that first day. \u201cWe all make mistakes,\u201d he said, growing flustered as Ms. Maitlis continued to press him on the crowd size issue. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here saying I\u2019m not without fault.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere were days that were extremely lonely in that job because I screwed up.\u201d\u201cI love the demand we\u2019ve had to talk about the book,\u201d Mr. Spicer said.A spokesman\u2019s job, Mr. Spicer responded, is to say what the president \u201cthinks and believes.\u201dIt was the BBC clips on social media that caused the most buzz. Mr. Spicer said Wednesday that he viewed Ms. Maitlis\u2019s characterizations in the interview as \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201coutlandish.\u201dBut a reporter has the right to ask any question she wants, he added.And ask she did. In another notable exchange, Ms. Maitlis mentioned the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which President Trump made vulgar comments about assaulting women.Mr. Spicer replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve all said things in private, which that was, that are inappropriate and regrettable.\u201dHad he ever said such things? She asked. \u201cI\u2019ve probably said some things that I regret, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve used those exact terms.\u201dMs. Maitlis said Wednesday that she was just doing her job. \u201cThat is what we do: We hold people accountable in robust interviews,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not about me versus Sean Spicer at all.\u201dOn Wednesday, Mr. Spicer called her impersonation \u201cfunny and frankly well-deserved.\u201dHe also said that he had cut down his gum intake. \u201cI can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t chewed gum since then, but definitely not as vociferously as in the past.\u201dMr. Spicer has made another big lifestyle change. \u201cI don\u2019t spend my days glued to media coverage and events the way I used to,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Ye Olde Go-Go\u2019s Songs Hit the Renaissance in \u2018Head Over Heels\u2019", "Date": "2019-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParadox is at the heart of this production, which was conceived and originally written by Jeff Whitty (\u201cAvenue Q\u201d), then adapted by James Magruder (best known for his stage versions of literary classics). It was Mr. Whitty who had the idea of reimagining Philip Sidney\u2019s \u201cThe Arcadia,\u201d a 16th-century fantasy of trouble in paradise, as a picturesque frame for the pop hits of the Go-Go\u2019s.That all-female band, as you may know (and if you don\u2019t, you are not this production\u2019s target audience), rode its rough-edged combination of punk riotousness and surfer-girl sunniness to the top of the pop charts in the early 1980s. Though many of their hits ponder the vagaries of love, they otherwise have little in common with an arcane literary universe that is usually the province of graduate students.In addition to straddling the gaps between historical eras \u2014 and high and low, and stately iambic pentameter and swift-kick rock rhymes \u2014 \u201cHead Over Heels\u201d also suggests that the divide between the sexes is the healthiest place for human beings to live. Its most catalytic character is Musidorus (an ingratiatingly incompetent Andrew Durand), a lowly shepherd whose love for the Princess Philoclea (Alexandra Socha) leads him to don the disguise of an Amazon (and if you think I mean the e-tailer, you are really not the target audience).In his womanly warrior guise, Musidorus becomes the lust object of Philoclea\u2019s parents, Basilius (Jeremy Kushnier), the king of Arcadia, and his queen, Gynecia (Rachel York), a restless castle wife with feminist stirrings. In the meantime, the pair\u2019s elder daughter, Pamela, a provocatively cast Bonnie Milligan, trampling with throwaway casualness on pretty princess stereotypes, finally figures out why she isn\u2019t remotely interested in the many princely suitors who seek her hand.Why? Well, as she discovers while composing a poem to her ideal, unknown mate, her love would need to have a part of the anatomy that rhymes with \u201cChina.\u201d (The script abounds in elbow-to-ribs dialogue, with lines like \u201cMy secret cave you penetrate.\u201d) Pamela finally realizes that her true love is her own loyal, boyishly dressed handmaiden, Mopsa (Taylor Iman Jones), whose performance of \u201cVacation\u201d with a chorus of mermaids and leaping fish is by default the show\u2019s musical high point.Characters clash, split and recombine in the time-honored tradition of Shakespeare\u2019s great cross-dressing comedies \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d and \u201cAs You Like It.\u201d The background for such melting identities is a picturesque, willfully artificial Arcadian vale by Julian Crouch (which makes deft use of pornographic silhouettes), with costumes to match by Arianne Phillips.And where, you may ask, does the music of the Go-Go\u2019s fit into ye olde Renaissance Faire and Camp Grounds? Songs like \u201cOur Lips Are Sealed,\u201d \u201cMad About You\u201d (actually, a later solo hit for the group\u2019s former lead, Belinda Carlisle), and the title number could slide into almost any story about the follies of love.What\u2019s lacking in the musical performances here is the go-for-broke exuberance that made the Go-Go\u2019s so irresistible. While Ms. Milligan\u2019s Pamela cuts loose and loud for a scenery-flinging \u201cHow Much More,\u201d the songs are mostly delivered with diffidence, as if the cast were saving its energy for some undetermined Big Event.Only Ms. York, a Broadway veteran, pounces on her role with the precise attack that\u2019s demanded. Peppermint, as might be expected, strikes a pose with aplomb and alacrity.Those shows were considerably more ragged than \u201cHead Over Heels\u201d \u2014 as I might add, were the Go-Go\u2019s in performance. But such works owned their raggedness, with a rip-roaring brazenness and glee that exploded gender and good taste into smithereens.Mining the same territory, \u201cHead Over Heels\u201d is more carefully and consciously instructive. In the first act, Musidorus stumbles upon a set of skeletons, which are accompanied by the written warning that \u201cThese sad remains are of our theater troupe, starved for lack of serious message.\u201dNo such criticism could be applied to \u201cHead Over Heels.\u201d But its audience might leave the theater less hungry if this oddly earnest show could really kick up its heels and let the message take care of itself.Advertisement"}

Only if you really want to! Pay Pal preferred.Tip Jar Expenses: $1,825 annuallyRemember how surprised you were when you first saw the tip jar on a bakery counter and the tip options on the credit card charge? Maybe you even thought: \u201cI\u2019m supposed to tip her for putting a loaf of bread in a bag? What\u2019s it going to be next, a tip jar at NYU Langone? This is the reason people are shopping at Amazon. No jar.\u201d That thought was quickly replaced by: \u201cIf I don\u2019t give her at least 15 percent, she\u2019s going to sneer at me like I\u2019m dirt and everybody in line will see. The extortionate counter thug. She\u2019s not intimidating me; I better make it 20 percent.\u201dHelp me stuff the jar. Those counterpeople know where I live.I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cHey, you\u2019re an adult, you should be able to afford your own junk food.\u201d But these prices are rising faster than New York real estate. I went to a Dwayne Johnson art film at the Regal Union Square Stadium and a bottle of water, small Diet Coke, M&M\u2019s and Popcorn was $24. This may be nothing to young people with $80,000 college loans who are accustomed to debt, but to those of us who are no longer in the work force, it\u2019s a massive, unanticipated expense.

And ownership has become prohibitive.I just had my teeth cleaned at my Greenwich Village dentist\u2019s office and it was $360. And it was done by the dental hygienist. Next week the dentist herself will be doing a deep clean and I\u2019m thinking I will have to sell my apartment.And it will get worse. A friend told me that as you age, your teeth separate and food gets stuck in them more so you need more frequent cleaning. Also, they get mossy. The clinical term for this is Disgusting Greenish Yellowish Tooth Moss, you see it in YouTubes interviews with English actors back in the 1970s. It\u2019s why in this city, old people who cannot afford dental care are abandoned by their families and left in their rent-controlled apartments to die, even though if they play their cards right their kids can inherit those apartments. The cost \u2014 \u201cCome kiss Grandpa\u201d \u2014 is too high.A Three-Bed, Two-Bath House in Woodstock, N.Y.: $549,000O.K., so maybe I said I could afford a country house if it was no more than $275,000. But I was getting extremely depressed visiting properties in my price range, wading through black mold in hip boots, catching a glimpse of a to do list that included \u201cTake garbage out of rabbit hutch.\u201d It brought up so many troubling questions: Why was the garbage in the hutch? Where had the rabbits been living? (The master shower, from the look of it.) Do I want a hutch that has doubled as a garbage dump? I\u2019m not that old, I might want to have rabbits of my own one day.So, here\u2019s the link to the house I deserve, with a two-story fireplace, bluestone patio and mountain views. Recent renovations include a safe room in which to keep a contractor so you know he\u2019s going to show up when you call him. And if he doesn\u2019t appear, you give him a good yank by the chain attached to his ankle.Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t contribute the full $549,000. Consider gifting the Master Bedroom ($40,000). First year\u2019s taxes ($12,000). Legal fees after contractor chews off his leg and escapes ($1,800,000). Honestly, no contribution is too small.

{"Headline": "Have the Tech Giants Grown Too Powerful? That\u2019s an Easy One", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe easy question is a common start-up origin story: One day, the founder asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d before going on to figure out, though hard work, that he or she actually can. According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results? Facebook: Why aren\u2019t social networks connecting people with real names? Uber: Why can\u2019t I use an app to summon a taxi? Twitter: Why isn\u2019t there a dead-simple way to just publish whatever you want for a gathered audience? In real life, each of these companies had more sinuous origins, with dead ends and discarded ideas. But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.In 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways. Most recently, however, the case for \u201cjust asking questions\u201d \u2014 for finding a problem intolerable and believing there must be some way to fix it \u2014 has proved remarkably well suited for a fresh purpose: challenging the tech companies themselves.There are companies that are mostly immune to the easy-question-hard-answer dynamic. Easy questions about Netflix, for one, tend to have easy answers: You pay; they stream. Most obvious questions about Apple can be answered by pointing out that it would like to sell you expensive items on a fairly regular basis. What these more straightforward companies have in common is that their founding questions doubled as consumer rallying cries \u2014 they asked, and continued to ask, about things that their customers need, or at least want, and tend to understand.But for the rest of the tech giants, the easy questions have much harder answers. As these companies grew, they did more than just vanquish their competition. Their growth and free-service benevolence succeeded at making the very idea of competitors\u2019 challenging their efforts \u2014 the industry\u2019s traditional way to solve the problems they\u2019ve created \u2014 seem unnecessary or even counterproductive. They\u2019ve ducked the easy questions for so long that it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that they doubt we will like the answers.Advertisement"}
