{"Headline": "Brexit and Trade Wars Are Quietly Undermining the Markets", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking at the stock markets of the developed world, it is not immediately apparent that populists are busily hacking away at the postwar international economic order.But the headline stock market numbers do not tell the whole story. A closer look suggests that the threats to the global trading system are dampening investors\u2019 enthusiasm, and the mood could darken quickly if the fights drag on and start to hurt companies\u2019 profits.Britain\u2019s two main stock market indexes, the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, are both up over 20 percent since the June 2016 referendum in which voters chose to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. For comparison, Germany\u2019s stock market is up by only slightly more since then.But stocks don\u2019t tell the whole story. Since the Brexit vote, the British pound has plunged 13 percent against the euro, and 11 percent against the dollar. The pound may continue to decline if negotiations between Britain and the European Union go badly in the coming months.The falling pound helps British exporters, because a lower pound makes their goods and services cheaper to foreign buyers, spurring higher sales, at least for a while. But it can also stoke inflation in Britain, by making imports more expensive to British buyers.Things could get worse if the pound goes into a panicky free fall, because that could stir up fear in other markets and in the wider economy. And that is a possibility, because there is much that could still go wrong in the Brexit negotiations.Britain and the European Union, at least, have clear objectives that they are both attempting to reconcile. The same cannot be said of the trade conflicts set off by the United States.President Trump has imposed or proposed tariffs on imports from the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners, including China and the European Union, but it is not engaged in full-fledged negotiations to resolve grievances. Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy may be to wait until the economic pain of the American tariffs is felt by other countries, at which point they may be willing to make concessions. But such an approach could prolong the uncertainty in the markets for months.But there is reason to believe that stocks would be a lot higher if it were not for the uncertainty surrounding trade tensions.This week, companies start to release their earnings for the latest quarter. The warnings related to tariffs may occur in unexpected places.\u201cThis is no longer a skirmish, but a global trade war with uncertain consequences,\u201d David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, wrote in a research note on Wednesday, \u201cbut none that are bullish for growth or the investment landscape.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiaomi\u2019s Weak I.P.O. Raises Doubts About China\u2019s Tech Boom", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Xiaomi\u2019s public debut was supposed to value the Chinese gadget maker at $100 billion and set the stage for a global coming-out party for some of China\u2019s most successful technology companies.When Xiaomi finished its first day of trading on Monday, the company was worth only $48 billion, weakness that could hang over the rest of the Chinese tech players waiting to go public.Some companies say money from Chinese lenders has become harder to come by. China\u2019s leaders are bracing for a bruising fight with the United States over trade.Xiaomi\u2019s founder and chairman, Lei Jun, cited worries about the trade war just before the company\u2019s shares began trading.\u201cAt this critical moment in Sino-U.S. trade relations, the global capital markets are in a constant flux,\u201d Mr. Lei said to a group that included Xiaomi employees at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange early Monday.The expectations for Xiaomi have been falling in recent weeks. Investors started to re-evaluate the prospects for the company, which sells affordable smartphones and a slew of other gadgets. Although it was the biggest Chinese initial public offering since 2014, Xiaomi raised considerably less than it had originally hoped on Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. Shares then fell slightly.Xiaomi is widely expected to be the first of several big Chinese tech names to seek initial public offerings in coming months. They include Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s version of Uber; Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of the Alibaba Group; and Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and products.All three companies have benefited from the prevalence of smartphone use in China and the country\u2019s wild online growth, which has made it by far the world\u2019s largest internet market in terms of users. They could choose to go public in Hong Kong, which would give global investors a chance to bet on them.Xiaomi\u2019s shares on Monday ended at 16.80 Hong Kong dollars, or roughly $2.15 \u2014 just below the 17 Hong Kong dollars at which they began the day, and far below the company\u2019s earlier hopes.Though Mr. Lei cited trade, investor concerns about the company\u2019s plan played a big role in its disappointing debut.In recent months, as Xiaomi bankers and executives traveled around the world to meet with prospective investors, they pitched Xiaomi as an internet company and China\u2019s answer to Apple. It was a formula \u2014 China plus internet \u2014 that in the past guaranteed strong support from overseas investors like hedge fund managers in the United States.But many investors view Xiaomi as still largely a hardware maker, not an internet company. It has promised fatter margins from selling internet services to its smartphone users, but those services accounted for less than 9 percent of last year\u2019s revenue.\u201cXiaomi has been billing itself as a Chinese internet company, but they really are not quite yet a pure internet company,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.\u201cInvestors haven\u2019t really bought into that story,\u201d Mr. Wang added.Some investors were also concerned about Xiaomi\u2019s focus on international growth, as its home market has become increasingly competitive. More than half of its sales are outside China, primarily in India, where it has a loyal following for its low-cost smartphones.While that could be attractive to some investors in the long run, some saw more immediate risks. For example, Xiaomi was forced to backtrack in Brazil after it failed to establish a relationship with local carriers.Xiaomi received wide news coverage this year when it announced its plans to list in Hong Kong, picking Hong Kong over New York, the listing venue of choice for some of China\u2019s blockbuster offerings, like Alibaba.Even with the tepid market response on Monday, Xiaomi persuaded a number of high-profile investors to buy shares. These included China Mobile, Qualcomm and China Merchants Bank Group, according to a term sheet seen by The New York Times.And with its public market listing, Mr. Lei is a new billionaire. Wearing a tie in the same orange as his company\u2019s logo, he told reporters at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, \u201cI am excited beyond words!\u201dMr. Lei then hit the gong to signal the start of trading, and everyone watched as the company\u2019s shares fell. And they continued to fall; by midmorning the stock had dropped 5 percent against a rising Hong Kong Stock Exchange.By the end of the day, it had recovered some of the losses, after support from bargain hunters and Xiaomi\u2019s bankers helped to push the share price back up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened When Fracking Came to Town", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At Page 51 of \u201cAmity and Prosperity,\u201d Eliza Griswold\u2019s saga of fracking\u2019s impact on the town of Amity in southwest Pennsylvania, I made a note in the margin: \u201cWhy People Hate Government.\u201d By then her protagonist\u2019s son, Harley Haney, had suffered mouth ulcers, severe abdominal pain, nausea, swollen lymph nodes and dizziness. Wilting in a recliner, he had missed a year and a half of middle school. His dog had died. The neighbors\u2019 dogs had died. The tap water was running black and smelled foul. The air reeked. A quarter-mile up the hill, workers in Hazmat suits had applied 819 pounds of a carcinogen to contain a bacterial outbreak at a waste pond for the gas wells near his home.Harley\u2019s mother, Stacey Haney, suffered headaches, rashes and fatigue. His younger sister, Paige, had stomachaches and nosebleeds. The neighbors were sick, too, and one, Beth Voyles, kept a dead puppy in her freezer as potential evidence. She had been complaining to the state Department of Environmental Protection for months. An agent there said that the hydrogen sulfide in the local air was naturally occurring. A representative of the company that owned the gas wells, Range Resources, told Stacey to boil her water before drinking it. Harley\u2019s condition was finally diagnosed: arsenic poisoning. Staying home sick from school had only made him worse. Toxins accrue.It\u2019s at this point that Griswold writes: \u201cGov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, sliced the D.E.P.\u2019s budget of $217,515,000 by 27 percent, one of the biggest cuts in its history. The governor also shaved 19 percent from the $113,369,000 budget of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources\u201d and \u201cstarted leasing oil and gas rights on public land. In three separate sales, the state made $413 million by leasing 138,866 acres. This marked the beginning of one of the largest public sell-offs in Pennsylvania\u2019s recent history.\u201dLike the governor, like their neighbors sitting atop Appalachia\u2019s gas-rich Marcellus Shale, like the federal government and many thousands of other people across rural America, Stacey and Beth had leased gas rights on their land. Something so ordinary must be safe, the two women figured. And the money the drillers offered was tantalizing. That\u2019s part of the tragedy. However grand their dreams (farmers\u2019 hopes that gas royalties would make them millionaires), or modest (Stacey\u2019s wish for $8,000 to build a barn), or abstract (consumers\u2019 faith in clean, cheap natural gas), almost everyone wanted to believe in the fantastic deal. Griswold aims to count the costs.Hydraulic fracturing, as she demonstrates, entails as much violence as the name implies. Putting aside the burden on roads, tranquillity and social relations, to frack a gas well means taking roughly four million gallons of water, poisoning it with chemicals, some of them proprietary secrets, and forcing this brew, together with some three million pounds of clay pellets or silica sand, into a well that extends horizontally a mile or two through shale. The shale cracks. The results: gas, fractured bedrock, depleted freshwater supplies and toxic waste. Now fortified with bacteria, heavy metals and additional toxins, the fracking fluid that returns to the surface presents a problem with no good solution. Some of it stays underground, where it combines with methane and can migrate into aquifers, streams and private wells. Imagine this process multiplied. Stacey\u2019s eight acres lay amid five wells; her county, Washington, has 1,146. The state of Pennsylvania has 7,788. The United States has more than 300,000.Politicians still call it clean. In the early 2000s, Congress exempted fracking from provisions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Amid the wreckage of the financial crisis, President Obama touted it as a win for the economy and the environment. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton pushed it on the world. After leaving office, in 2011, Governor Rendell became a paid consultant to a private-equity firm with investments in fracking. His former deputy chief of staff, another deputy, his D.E.P. chief and other erstwhile regulators enlisted in the corporate ranks of oil and gas.The fracking boom muted more imaginative approaches to the common welfare, and suppressed honest appraisals of costs. In 2012, Obama\u2019s E.P.A. announced that the brown, putrid water issuing from people\u2019s taps in Dimock, Pa., posed no danger. In 2016, a Centers for Disease Control agency, using the same samples, declared Dimock\u2019s water a health hazard. Every E.P.A. agent who knocked on Stacey Haney\u2019s door promising aid disappeared into the mist; one eventually became environmental director of Chesapeake Energy. Lately, as landowners\u2019 royalties have shrunk and the financial press warns that the boom looks like a bubble, systemic dials seem locked on \u201cdrill.\u201d The current governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, recently requested more D.E.P. inspectors, not to address thousands of frack-related citizen complaints but to speed up permits for new drilling. D.E.P., some people say, stands for \u201cDepartment of Energy Production\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t Expect Protection.\u201dGriswold reports so much government neglect, deception and collusion \u2014 here augmented with data from the Public Accountability Initiative, NPR\u2019s StateImpact project and the nonprofit investigative site Public Herald \u2014 that as I read I abbreviated my marginal notes to \u201cWPHG.\u201d By the time her story reaches 2016, it\u2019s plain that people who have lost their water, their home\u2019s value, their farm animals and pets, their health and hope for relief would not be making conventional electoral choices. Beth Voyles voted for Donald Trump; Stacey Haney, for Jill Stein.The broad political costs of fracking are not expressly Griswold\u2019s subject, however. Her impressive research notwithstanding, \u201cAmity and Prosperity\u201d is at heart a David and Goliath story fit for the movies. It has everything but a happy ending: a bucolic setting concealing fortune and danger; poor but proud locals who\u2019ve endured sequential boom-bust cycles of resource extraction (Prosperity is a neighboring town ravaged by long-wall mining); tough, reluctant victim-heroes; grisly scenes of animal die-off; and courtroom drama, as a tenacious husband-wife legal team takes on the industry and the state, wins one important case but can\u2019t outlast its adversaries\u2019 moneyed obstructionism. Stacey and Beth settle out of court and submit to a gag order. Harley gets healthier once the family abandons its home, but, with no illusions left, he finishes high school on the internet and takes a job laying gas pipeline. Advantage, Goliath.It gets worse anyway. Range Resources inexorably appropriates Amity\u2019s allegiances and civic life. The county fair devolves into occupied territory, an echo of Griswold\u2019s previous experience reporting in Asia and Africa. From so vital a perspective, one longs for at least a snapshot of national scale \u2014 the West pocked with frackpads, the almost daily earthquakes in Oklahoma from waste injection, the tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve had no say in drilling near their homes, the workers risking damage, the question everywhere: Who will defend the water?Griswold ascribes ideas to Stacey about \u201cthe American dream\u201d and the need to \u201ctough it out,\u201d about the \u201cprice one paid for progress\u201d and failing \u201cthrough no fault of her own.\u201d Maybe Stacey used those phrases (she is not directly quoted doing so), but she should have been spared banality. She fell for a con. Her own night terrors best convey her sense of responsibility and fracture: images of driving in reverse, of her children trapped or falling, of her inability to control anything \u2014 dreams from which she awoke \u201ccaught between gasping for breath and fearing the air.\u201dUntil land is laid waste nearby, people don\u2019t think much about sacrificed populations or the historic function of government rooted in colonization and corporatism. Thieving, or regulating theft, is a simple term for it. People who\u2019ve lost their water to fracking, like those who live in impoverished, toxified communities everywhere, like the people of Flint, are on a continuum that began with the indigenous peoples, the enslaved Africans and the \u201cwaste people\u201d (\u201crefuse,\u201d as Benjamin Franklin called poor Pennsylvanians), who were forced off the land, into bondage or penury at America\u2019s dawn. The nature of oppression changes, but the levers of power that have helped some to prosper while allowing many to sink are hardened in place, and the persistent question, implicit in this valuable, discomforting book, is Who will unstick them?JoAnn Wypijewski is working on a book about encounters with America in a time of crackup.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if Trump\u2019s Nativism Actually Hurts Him?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lavine and Ms. Rahn are political scientists at the University of Minnesota.President Trump\u2019s short-lived family separation policy extended the hard line on immigration he promoted during his presidential campaign. Many analysts believe that this strategy helped him win the election by politicizing latent nativist sentiment among white Americans. At his rallies, Mr. Trump consistently propounded a view of immigrants as criminals and miscreants, not to mention a cause of unemployment and wage stagnation among native-born citizens. As president, he has continued to use dehumanizing language in reference to immigrants, words like \u201cvermin,\u201d \u201cinfest\u201d and \u201canimals.\u201d On Sunday, he dared Democrats to push for the abolition of the Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency, claiming that if they pursued the idea, they would \u201cnever win another election.\u201dBut is it true that immigration is always a losing issue for Democrats? There is a consensus among scholars and commentators that an individual\u2019s view on immigration had a bigger impact on how he or she voted in 2016, compared with recent elections. Given that white Americans tend to be substantially more anti-immigration than pro-immigration, one might expect that highlighting a hard-line stand on the issue would have benefited Mr. Trump in the election.Contrary to received wisdom, however, the immigration issue did not play to Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage nearly as much as commonly believed. According to our analysis of national survey data from the American National Election Studies (a large, representative sample of the population of the United States), Hillary Clinton did better in the election than she would have if immigration had not been so prominent an issue. In fact, a liberal backlash seems to have contributed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in the popular vote count.To determine how immigration shaped electoral fortunes, we examined the link between voters\u2019 views on immigration and whether they voted Democratic or Republican in 2016. We then compared the strength of that link with recent elections in which immigration was less visible as a national campaign issue. We estimated whether voters supported the Democratic or Republican candidate on the basis of their preferred level of immigration \u2014 \u201cincrease,\u201d \u201ckeep the same,\u201d \u201cdecrease\u201d \u2014 taking into account the voter\u2019s party identification, ideology, gender, age and level of education.We found that Mr. Trump did only slightly better than his Republican predecessors among anti-immigration whites. Among pro-immigration whites, however, Mrs. Clinton far outpaced John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. For example, Mr. Obama received the votes of 50 percent of pro-immigration whites in 2012, whereas Mrs. Clinton won the votes of 72 percent of that group in 2016 \u2014 a 22-point difference.Among anti-immigration whites, by contrast, Mr. Trump improved only marginally on Mitt Romney\u2019s showing, 79 percent to 71 percent. Perhaps most important \u2014 given the popularity of the \u201ckeep the same\u201d position \u2014 is that immigration moderates swung 7 percentage points in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favor (Mr. Obama received 38 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 45). The 2016 comparisons with 2008 and 2004 are highly similar.We can\u2019t know whether this asymmetry across elections is a function of Mr. Trump\u2019s nativism, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inclusive pronouncements about immigration or both. What we can say is that after Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton repeatedly clashed over the issue during the course of the campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral gain \u2014 relative to the percentages Mr. Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush received on the issue \u2014 paled against Mrs. Clinton\u2019s gains over Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama.What about turnout, though? Did the salience of immigration in 2016 drive more Trump supporters than Clinton supporters to the polls? In short, no. We found no evidence that pro-immigration whites were less \u2014 or more \u2014 likely than anti-immigration whites to cast ballots in 2016.What does our analysis say more generally about the efficacy of politicizing xenophobia and racism in American elections? First, by instigating a liberal counterreaction, it seems possible that highlighting immigration may no longer be an effective political strategy for the Republican Party. This may be the case for two related reasons.First, xenophobic whites have long been reliable Republican voters, whereas less intolerant whites have tended to waver in their presidential voting. Democrats may therefore have more to gain than Republicans by continued political conflict over immigration.Second, 2016 marked a key change in rhetorical strategy among Republican presidential candidates. From 1968, when Richard Nixon first exploited his \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d to attract resentful whites through code words like \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d to 2012, when Mr. Romney ran ads claiming that Mr. Obama wanted to allow welfare recipients to collect paychecks without having to look for work, messages like this were conveyed implicitly, in what have come to be called \u201cdog whistles,\u201d with plausible deniability that they had anything to do with race.In 2016 (and 2017 and 2018), Mr. Trump dispensed with dog whistles in favor of a more explicit strategy of cultural confrontation, which prompted \u2014 and may continue to prompt \u2014 a more powerful liberal counterreaction.For these reasons, we think that Mr. Trump\u2019s explicit appeals to intolerance are likely to help Democrats more than Republicans. If we\u2019re right, there will be less incentive for future Republicans to contest elections by instigating group division. Perhaps then partisan competition may return to one of its core concerns: how much the government should intervene in the economy and what the proper size of the safety net is. As polls consistently show, voters care more about these economic questions than they do about cultural politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As May\u2019s Government Teeters Over Brexit, Trump Gives It a Shove", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 President Trump put his brand of confrontational and disruptive diplomacy on full display Thursday, unsettling NATO allies with a blustering performance in Brussels and then, in a remarkable breach of protocol, publicly undercutting Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain in an interview published hours after landing in her country.The interview was published as Mr. Trump and Mrs. May were wrapping up what appeared to be a chummy dinner at Blenheim Palace \u2014 earlier, they had walked inside holding hands \u2014 and a day ahead of the president\u2019s scheduled meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. There was no immediate response from the British government.\u201cWell, I think the deal that she is striking is not what the people voted on,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, speaking of the approach Mrs. May is taking to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, under which the British economy would effectively continue to be subject to many European regulations.Speaking of Mr. Johnson, who resigned this week as foreign secretary in protest over Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit strategy and who has long been seen as likely to challenge her for her job, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWell, I am not pitting one against the other. I\u2019m just saying I think he would be a great prime minister. I think he\u2019s got what it takes and I think he\u2019s got the right attitude to be a great prime minister.\u201dComing after his combative performance in Brussels with leaders of the 28 other NATO nations, the day amounted to a global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president.In Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he supported NATO but seemed to suggest that the United States could leave if the allies didn\u2019t increase defense spending. He claimed credit for pressing members to pledge increases in their military budgets, though some denied any such promises were made.Mr. Trump did sign on to a NATO plan to improve military readiness across the Continent, and the allies agreed to take a tough stance against Russia, particularly regarding its annexation of Crimea.But the NATO meeting created a picture of discord days before Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.The Sun\u2019s interview with Mr. Trump, conducted Wednesday in Brussels, signaled a new twist on the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States. The White House went into damage control mode after it was published on Thursday night.\u201cThe President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cAs he said in his interview with The Sun she \u2018is a very good person\u2019 and he \u2018never said anything bad about her.\u2019\u201dThe statement said Mr. Trump \u201cis thankful for the wonderful welcome from the prime minister here in the U.K.\u201dBut in the interview with The Sun, Mr. Trump said he had been made to feel unwelcome in London by the large protests planned against him and the hostility of London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has been an outspoken critic of the president.\u201cI think your mayor has done a terrible job, but when they make you feel unwelcome, why would I stay there?\u201d Mr. Trump said, alluding to his decision to spend little time in London on this trip.The president\u2019s comments were likely to stoke acute tension within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, following the publication on Thursday of the government\u2019s plan for exiting the European Union, which would keep Britain tied to European Union rules on goods and agricultural products.Mrs. May has been making the case for a free trade deal with the United States and argued that Brexit was an \u201copportunity\u201d to strengthen trans-Atlantic ties and spur economic growth both in Britain and in the United States. British officials hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s visit would help that process.The British newspaper The Sun posted an eight-minute-long excerpt of an interview with President Trump in which he criticized Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plans for Brexit. The interview was published as President Trump visited Britain.Mr. Trump appeared to dash those hopes. Mrs. May\u2019s plan is intended to minimize the economic impact of Brexit, which could be severe because the European Union is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner. But Mr. Trump appeared to side with pro-Brexit critics who argue that by keeping many of the European Union\u2019s economic rules, it would inevitably reduce the scope for a separate trade deal with the United States.Even before it was released as a white paper on Thursday, Mrs. May\u2019s proposal had prompted the resignation of three government ministers, including Mr. Johnson, the foreign secretary who had argued for a cleaner break with the European Union.\u201cI would have done it much differently,\u201d Mr. Trump was quoted as saying. \u201cI actually told Theresa May how to do it, but she didn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d Instead she went \u201cthe opposite way,\u201d he said, and the results have been \u201cvery unfortunate.\u201dIf Britain sticks to Mrs. May\u2019s approach toward Europe, Mr. Trump said, \u201cthat would probably end a major trade relationship with the United States.\u201dBefore arriving in Britain, Mr. Trump had described Mr. Johnson as a friend and said he might be in contact with him during his visit to Britain, which is scheduled to end on Sunday after the president visits one of his golf resorts in Scotland.When he resigned on Monday as foreign secretary, Mr. Johnson made a fierce attack on Mrs. May\u2019s strategy for Brexit saying the \u201cdream is dying, suffocated by needless self doubt.\u201dIn his interview, Mr. Trump struck a highly negative tone about the European Union itself, arguing that the United States had \u201cenough difficulty\u201d with the bloc.\u201cWe are cracking down right now on the European Union because they have not treated the United States fairly on trading,\u201d he said.In recent weeks British business has been increasingly vocal about the risks of a clean break with the European Union, with warnings from Jaguar Land Rover and Airbus among others that they could leave the country, putting thousands out of work.But hard-line Brexit supporters have been fiercely critical of Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit plan and fear that, after negotiations with the European Union, it could be watered down further.Mr. Trump\u2019s favorable comments about Mr. Johnson are therefore likely to be seen as an implicit criticism of Mrs. May. In his letter of resignation on Monday, Mr. Johnson said that, under Mrs. May\u2019s proposals, Britain was \u201ctruly headed for the status of colony.\u201dMr. Johnson once described one government Brexit customs plan as \u201ccrazy\u201d and, in leaked comments, also accused Mrs. May\u2019s government of lacking \u201cguts.\u201d He compared her negotiating style unfavorably with that of Mr. Trump, and he compared her new Brexit plan to excrement.In the Sun interview, Mr. Trump also renewed his criticism of Mr. Khan, the mayor of London, with whom he has clashed on several occasions, and who gave protesters permission to launch a giant orange balloon of the president depicted as a baby in a diaper carrying a cellphone in one of its hands.\u201cTake a look at the terrorism that is taking place,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLook at what is going on in London. I think he has done a very bad job on terrorism.\u201dThe Sun\u2019s article was published just as a lavish black-tie dinner that Mrs. May was hosting for Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, at Blenheim Palace was breaking up, and guests in formal gowns and tuxedos were leaving the estate.Chris Ruddy, the chairman of Newsmax and a confidant of Mr. Trump who attended the dinner, said there was no hint of tension between the president and Mrs. May during the event itself, which he called \u201ca love fest between Britain and the United States.\u201d\u201cThe president has always been for Brexit full speed, but I\u2019d really like to see the full interview in context,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments may not have been as direct a broadside against Mrs. May as they were portrayed to be in The Sun. \u201cI went over and chatted directly with the president and the prime minister, and he indicated to me that the special relationship between the United States and Britain was better than ever.\u201dThe Sun posted audio recordings of large portions of the interview.Mr. Ruddy said he learned of the interview as he was driving away from Blenheim, and British friends began texting him expressing shock and surprise about what Mr. Trump had said.Advertisement"}

The men had come for a different kind of spectacle \u2014 a biographical film epic, whose initial episodes (out of 57 total) would be shown for the first time that evening. At the center of a makeshift stage, surrounded by smiling politicians and cabinet members, was the person whose life was being celebrated: a slender figure in saffron robes with a long, dark beard, his chest-length hair tied in a bun. He needed no introduction. This was Baba Ramdev, one of the most famous men in India.One by one, the dignitaries rose to recount Ramdev\u2019s extraordinary career: how he brought physical fitness to the Indian middle class with his mass yoga camps and television empire; how he built his medicine-and-consumer-goods company, Patanjali Ayurved, into a multibillion-dollar colossus. \u201cSwamiji has changed the direction of the world, the thinking of the world,\u201d one speaker shouted, referring to Ramdev with an affectionate honorific. \u201cThat is how great he is. Swamiji has changed India, which was going toward the West \u2014 its dress and food and culture \u2014 and has changed its direction to yoga!\u201dAt last silence fell, and the 50-foot screen flickered to life. For the next hour, India\u2019s political elite watched in humble silence as Ramdev\u2019s life unfolded, from his birth in a remote rural village to his early days as a lissome yogi (the remaining episodes had been condensed into trailer form). As a film, it was a shambolic melodrama that seemed to treat Ramdev almost as a divine messenger. But as an expression of the Indian public\u2019s feelings, it wasn\u2019t far off the mark.Ramdev has been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised several American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. He appeared alongside Modi on several occasions, singing the leader\u2019s praises and urging Indians to turn out for him. Ramdev has called Modi \u201ca close friend,\u201d and the prime minister publicly lauds Patanjali\u2019s array of ayurvedic products \u2014 medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Although Modi campaigned heavily on promises to reform India\u2019s economy and fight corruption, there were frequent dog whistles to the Hindu nationalist base, some of them coordinated with Ramdev. A month before Modi\u2019s landslide victory, a trust controlled by Ramdev released a video in which senior leaders of Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.), including the current ministers of foreign affairs, internal security, finance and transportation, appeared alongside him with a signed document setting out nine pledges. These included the protection of cows \u2014 animals held sacred in Hinduism \u2014 and a broad call for Hindu nationalist reforms of the government, the courts, cultural institutions and education. After Modi won, Ramdev claimed to have \u201cprepared the ground for the big political changes that occurred.\u201dOn the surface, Ramdev\u2019s blissful demeanor is worlds away from Trump\u2019s growls and sneers. But his namastes provide cover for a reactionary campaign to transform the country. When challenged on his evasions and slurs, Ramdev \u2014 like the White House\u2019s current occupant \u2014 tends to respond by pointing a finger at \u201ccorrupt\u201d figures in the secular elite. It seems to work. Last year an Indian judge banned a critical biography of Ramdev before it was released and then put a gag order on its author, barring her from even mentioning the book on social media. In a sense, Ramdev is more powerful than any prime minister. He may be a wholly new breed: a populist tycoon, protected from critics (and even, to some extent, from the law) by a vast following and a claim to holy purpose.I was baffled for a moment, and then found myself marveling at his legerdemain. As a Hindu monk, Ramdev has repeatedly declared his disapproval of homosexuality, calling it \u201cimmoral and unnatural.\u201d He says it can be cured by yoga. But he has the politician\u2019s gift for charming his audience. In a single, East-meets-West moment, he had both deferred to tradition and hinted to me that he was a closet liberal. (He was also kidding about the offer to sleep on his floor, as it turned out.)Ramdev\u2019s informality and practical bent set him apart from most other gurus. Indian religious celebrities are known popularly as godmen, a word that suggests stardom but also adds a hint of derision. They are heirs to an ancient tradition of humble, loincloth-clad wisdom seekers, but opportunism seems to come with the territory as well. Some godmen have become immensely rich and built cults of personality that stretched around the globe. They tend to surround themselves with fawning followers, and many claim to perform miracles, like Sathya Sai Baba, who became notorious in the 1960s for conjuring Omega watches out of thin air. Ramdev is not the first one to gain influence in politics; in the 1970s Indira Gandhi often sought advice from her own yoga teacher, who became known as the \u201cRasputin of Delhi.\u201d But Ramdev rarely clouds the air with talk about enlightenment and religion. \u201cMy yoga is very simple,\u201d he told me. \u201cNo critical postures. No philosophy or ideology. All yoga practices are based on benefit. Instant benefit.\u201dRamdev is also the first godman to earn his millions as a businessman instead of just siphoning donations from wealthy followers. Patanjali has vaulted in just over a decade from a tiny operation into an economic powerhouse, with $1.6 billion in sales in the current fiscal year. Turn on a TV or glance at a billboard almost anywhere in India, and you are likely to see Ramdev advertising one of its products. During our talk, Ramdev boasted of Patanjali\u2019s success, detailing his plans for expansion and saying he aimed to reach about $15 billion in annual sales by 2025, a figure that would make Patanjali one of India\u2019s biggest companies. But he also insisted that Patanjali is not a business at all; it is \u201ca service for humanity, for the nation.\u201d He maintains that neither he nor the company\u2019s C.E.O., Acharya Balkrishna, takes a salary. Ramdev says he doesn\u2019t even have a bank account (he abides by the monk\u2019s vow of austerity and chastity, though the company seems to more than take care of his needs). All profits, he said, are plowed back into research and charity, and the company\u2019s low costs allow it to undersell competitors. Most of Patanjali\u2019s employees are paid much less than they would receive elsewhere; asking for a raise is taboo. (A company spokesman denies this.) They are forbidden to drink alcohol or eat nonvegetarian food. \u201cPenance in individual life, prosperity for others,\u201d Ramdev told me with a smile. This blend of fierce capitalism and monkish renunciation is aimed at making India a \u201cworld economic power and world spiritual power by 2050.\u201dRamdev told me his nationalist vision embraces all religions and castes, but he added a revealing caveat. \u201cCountry first,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a must. Not, \u2018I\u2019m great, my caste is great,\u2019 but my country is great. Unlike Muslim leaders \u2014 they say Islam is great. I say, No: The nation is great, the citizen is great.\u201d And the nation, in Ramdev\u2019s telling, is subtly twinned with a history and culture that is distinctly Hindu: yoga, ayurvedic medicine and the ancient Vedic scriptures from which they are said to have emerged. Sometimes the hints are not so subtle. Two years ago, when a Muslim politician refused to chant a nationalist slogan, Ramdev laid into him at a right-wing rally, saying that were it not for his respect for the law, \u201cwe would behead hundreds of thousands\u201d of such people. A court later issued a warrant for Ramdev\u2019s arrest, though the matter appears to have been dropped.In an effort to overcome these internal fissures, the early Hindu nationalists built a regimented anticolonial social movement in the 1920s, which later formed links with Italian and German fascism; the main branch was known as the RSS, from the Hindi words for \u201cnational organization of volunteers.\u201d In place of black shirts and armbands, they wore khaki shorts and carried bamboo sticks. This association tainted them in the decades that followed, especially after so many British and Indian soldiers died fighting the Axis powers in World War II. Another serious blow came in 1948, when a Hindu nationalist zealot assassinated Mohandas Gandhi, modern India\u2019s saintly father figure. Afterward, Nehru, Gandhi\u2019s political heir, suppressed Hindu nationalist organizations and fostered his own countervailing conception of India as a pluralist, secular state. Although he was a Brahmin, Nehru was a passionate cosmopolitan who saw Hindu identity as narrow and tribal. He wanted India to be defined by its diversity, not by any one faith. It was an idea shaped in part by his British education at Harrow, Cambridge and the Inns of Court in London, and one shared by many of his peers. For decades after independence, India\u2019s ruling class was mostly a \u201cthin layer of brown Englishmen,\u201d in the phrase of an Indian friend of mine who heard it from his grandfather, a friend of Nehru\u2019s. They were patrician figures who rebelled successfully against the British but absorbed many of their ideas about how the country should be governed.By the 1990s, Nehru's Congress party had become almost synonymous with the Indian state, but his tolerant, worldly vision was starting to fray. The Hindu nationalist movement anointed the B.J.P. as its political vehicle, and the party slowly gained strength, fueled by perceptions of corruption and entitlement in the secular political elite. In 1998, the B.J.P. was able to sustain a majority coalition in India\u2019s Parliament for the first time. But in early 2002, bloody communal riots broke out in the western state of Gujarat, reviving the party\u2019s old demons. It started when a train carrying some Hindu pilgrims caught fire. Revenge mobs quickly formed. In the ensuing violence, more than a thousand people were killed, most of them Muslims, and there was widespread looting. Ramdev\u2019s future friend Narendra Modi was Gujarat\u2019s chief minister at the time, and evidence soon emerged suggesting that he and other top B.J.P. officials had stoked the violence, or at least given a green light. (A court-appointed investigation cleared Modi of wrongdoing in 2012, but many scholars and analysts who have examined the evidence disagree.) Many Indian Muslims still consider the riots a state-sanctioned pogrom, and see Modi \u2014 who has never apologized for his role \u2014 as a criminal. But even among Hindus, the B.J.P. suffered from its reputation as a party led by Brahmins and other upper-caste Hindus. It had trouble winning votes from Dalits (untouchables) and others at the lower end of India\u2019s caste hierarchy.Ramdev was just the kind of unifying figure the B.J.P. needed. At the time of the Gujarat riots, he was emerging as a celebrity, crisscrossing India to preside over mass yoga camps and pitch his home remedies. He tapped into a hunger for spirituality and health among India\u2019s growing middle class and quickly became a symbol of Hinduism at its most benign, a ready-made package of rituals and foods that were fun, affordable and good for you. As his fame spread, a stream of politicians and celebrities made their way to Haridwar, eager to donate to his cause and seek his endorsement; he was becoming what Indians call a \u201cvote bank.\u201d In 2011, he embraced the nationwide anti-corruption movement, led by the independent social activist Anna Hazare, which swept India that year. In June, he started a hunger strike against corruption, and 40,000 of his followers rallied in his support in Delhi. The police showed up with tear gas, and in the ensuing melee, Ramdev shed his saffron robes under a stage and tried to escape disguised as an injured woman, only to be detained and exposed on video, bushy beard and all. The Indian press mocked him for days.But nothing seems to taint Ramdev for long. Three years later, his reputation as a crusader against corruption \u2014 a frequent B.J.P. talking point \u2014 made him even more valuable in the elections that swept the Hindu nationalists to power. He turned his yoga-camp meetings, which often had tens of thousands of people in attendance, into unofficial rallies. Two weeks before the elections started, he welcomed Modi onstage at a huge outdoor gathering in New Delhi. \u201cYou\u2019ll make other people understand, won\u2019t you?\u201d Ramdev said to the microphone, as Modi sat next to him, grinning. \u201cYou won\u2019t sit at home, will you?\u201d The audience roared back: \u201cNo!\u201dRamdev founded a short-lived political party in 2010, and has since been rumored to be weighing a political career himself. When I brought up the question, he smilingly batted it away, saying that he\u2019d become a \u201cnonpolitical person\u201d and that the triumph of the B.J.P. had obviated any need for him to run for office. \u201cModi is an honest prime minister,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe is a visionary and a missionary. He will win the next term (in the 2019 elections). He will build a strong foundation for India.\u201dMany Indian Muslims say they have begun to feel like strangers in their own land. The B.J.P. has proposed a number of laws with a troublingly sectarian cast. One of them would allow immigrants from nearby countries who are Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Christian to apply for citizenship but would explicitly exclude Muslims. Even worse, some Muslims say, is the government\u2019s winking attitude toward communal violence. In 2015, a Hindu mob in a village near Delhi beat a Muslim to death on suspicion of having eaten beef. When one of the accused killers later died of an unrelated illness, a B.J.P. politician attended his funeral; the coffin was draped in the Indian flag. Episodes like this have multiplied since Modi\u2019s victory in 2014.This narrative about yoga\u2019s ancient roots has become a sacrament for Hindu nationalists, and it is echoed in the West. But it is mostly myth, an idealized origin story of the kind so many would-be nation-builders, from ancient Rome to the Zionists, have fostered about themselves. The oldest Hindu scriptures contain almost no mention of physical postures. Even the Yoga Sutras, the so-called bible of yoga, include only a few short verses suggesting comfortable postures for sitting. Many of the postures practiced in yoga today appear to have emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Dozens of modern ashtanga yoga postures are similar or identical to those found in a gymnastic routine introduced to India by the British in the first decades of the 20th century and originally developed by a Danish fitness instructor named Niels Bukh, who later became notorious for his pro-Nazi sympathies. Bukh, needless to say, has been conveniently forgotten by both Indians and the yoga-loving celebrities of Hollywood.Yoga is only half of Ramdev\u2019s work. He and Balkrishna also use their television empire to tout the healing virtues of Patanjali\u2019s ayurvedic medicines and health foods, rooted in the supposedly curative powers of herbal and mineral compounds. Western scientists view ayurveda (the \u201cscience of life\u201d) with skepticism, and studies have found that some ayurvedic products contain toxic levels of heavy metals, usually from soil or ash, in the mix. But in India they have become a booming business, thanks in part to Ramdev's marketing efforts. Balkrishna gave me a tour of Patanjali\u2019s medical research institute, in a gleaming new building that was inaugurated last year by Modi himself (\u201cSwami Ramdev\u2019s herbs help you overcome all problems,\u201d the prime minister told the crowds gathered for the event).If Ramdev is Patanjali\u2019s flamboyant mascot, Balkrishna is his foil, a number-crunching introvert with buckteeth and a high, soft voice. He led me upstairs to a laboratory where white-coated technicians were drying masses of swampy green spirulina, a form of algae, to be packed into pills. \u201cIt is high in protein and vitamins,\u201d one of the men told me. In his spare time, Balkrishna said, he wanders the forests of the Himalayas looking for medicinal herbs. Some can be found growing in a garden behind the research center, adjoining a Disney-style religious theme park, with life-size sculpted figures enacting scenes from the Vedas inside man-made caves.It looked like Hindu kitsch to me. But for Ramdev and Balkrishna, all this herbal wisdom is serious business. When it comes to marketing against foreign competitors, they wield their holiness like a club. One Patanjali ad runs: \u201cAs East India Company plundered our country for 200 years likewise these multinationals are exploiting our country by selling their harmful and dangerous chemical products. Beware!\u201d Ramdev\u2019s competitors have sued Patanjali repeatedly, but the slurs persist.Over the years, this way of fending off criticism has become a pattern; nonetheless, Patanjali has faced at least half a dozen legal actions over its products. In October 2016, the food and drug administration of Haryana State found Patanjali\u2019s cow ghee (clarified butter) to be \u201csubstandard and unsafe.\u201d Last April, the Indian military stopped selling a popular Patanjali juice to soldiers after a government agency tested samples and found them \u201cunfit for consumption.\u201d (Patanjali countered that the juice was medicine and thus the wrong test had been performed.) In the banned biography of Ramdev published last year, the journalist Priyanka Pathak-Narain wrote that Patanjali\u2019s cow ghee \u2014 advertised as the purest on the market \u2014 was made from white butter sourced from hundreds of thousands of small producers, blending cow, buffalo and goat milk. In India, where pure ghee is required for religious purposes, such things matter.Some former employees say Ramdev is guilty of more than safety violations. One former high-level executive at Patanjali, who worked at the company for several years, spoke to me on condition of anonymity, saying he feared retaliation. When I asked him why he left, he said of Ramdev: \u201cBecause he\u2019s a crook. Because he\u2019s a hypocrite.\u201d He rattled off a sheaf of shocking claims about fraud and employee abuse. (These have been written about in the Indian press, but none appear to have been substantiated in court.) One story involved Ramdev\u2019s brother, Ram Bharat, who was arrested in 2013 and accused of kidnapping and imprisoning a worker suspected of theft (the charges were later dropped). Another former Patanjali executive told me similar stories and added that he began receiving threatening phone calls after he refused to facilitate what he saw as kickback schemes. He complained to Balkrishna, he said, but the calls continued and \u2014 feeling his life might be in danger \u2014 he resigned. A Patanjali spokesman categorically denied that any of these events took place.For Ramdev\u2019s critics, the skeletons in his closet are tied to a broader concern that his political value to the B.J.P. may have placed him above the law. I heard wealthy businesspeople in Delhi speak of him with audible fear in their voices, as if he could damage them at will. One thing is certain: Ramdev has received extraordinary favors from the Indian government since Modi was elected. Soon after the 2014 election, B.J.P.-led state governments across India began facilitating steep discounts on land purchases for Patanjali. There is some precedent for nonprofits or religious organizations to receive such favors, but the deals Patanjali got were very unusual. In the largest of these deals, Patanjali was given a 1,200-acre parcel of land in the eastern state of Assam at no cost. According to state legislature documents I was shown by a local academic, the deal was made by an agency controlled by the Bodoland People\u2019s Front, a party aligned with the B.J.P. Last year a Reuters investigation documented several discounted land sales and leases in three other Indian states that saved the company a total of $46 million. Critics say these deals were partly payback for the boost Ramdev provided to the B.J.P. in the elections. But by spreading Patanjali\u2019s presence into outlying areas where it needed support, the party was also sowing the seeds of future electoral victories.Not long after the party\u2019s 2014 victory, Patanjali secured two large tracts in Assam and began work on a vast production facility. I reached the plant after a bumpy eight-hour journey through endless tea plantations and was greeted by the site manager, an ebullient man with bushy eyebrows named S.B. Singh. His newly built office was empty apart from a large picture of Ramdev on the wall. Through the windows we could see earth-moving machines and construction crews and big piles of muddy, ocher-hued soil.\u201cThere was jungle where we\u2019re sitting,\u201d Singh told me. \u201cElephants.\u201d Patanjali got the factory up and running in only 132 days, he told me, razing the jungle and clearing out a total of 88 elephants before building a complex of warehouses on the 155-acre site. (The elephants were guided gently to a patch of forest nearby, Singh told me.) He unleashed a blizzard of statistics \u2014 4,000 workers, 1.2 million bags of cement, a 20-person management team \u2014 his eyes sparkling with pride at the achievement. The plant remained unfinished and was still running at partial capacity. But already hundreds of workers were busy making cookies and cosmetics. Thousands more were being trained, and not just in job skills.\u201cWe are mentally conditioning them,\u201d Singh said. Patanjali ran more than 380 workshops for prospective employees, where it taught a \u201cvalue system.\u201d Assam\u2019s people, he explained, had \u201cbad habits,\u201d including eating nonvegetarian food and a lack of proper respect for the nation. \u201cThey\u2019ve been listening to corrupt politics from corrupt people for too long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take what our sages said thousands of years ago and put it to use. We didn\u2019t invent it. We took what\u2019s available in our scriptures and put it in a modern format.\u201d In other words, they inculcate Hindutva.Singh took me on a tour of the production complex in an electric golf cart. After admiring the cookie plant and its 300-foot oven, we drove across a deliciously smooth, median-free stretch of pavement that resembled a runway. In fact, it is a runway, built in consultation with the Indian Air Force so that jet fighters can take off and land on it, Singh told me. \u201cWe will dedicate this to the nation in case there is need for an extra airstrip,\u201d he said, and then added with a knowing look, \u201cWe are near China.\u201d Patanjali seems almost to view itself as an extension of the state \u2014 or rather, an illustration of what has become a \u201cstate-temple-corporate complex,\u201d in the apt phrase of the Indian author Meera Nanda.Patanjali\u2019s work in Assam has benefited from longer-term efforts by the RSS. Founded in 1925, the group was briefly banned several times in the wake of communal riots, most recently in 1992. It periodically went underground, doing grass-roots organizing and forming dozens of affiliate organizations that often hide their links with the RSS. Most of the B.J.P.\u2019s top leaders, including Modi, emerged from the RSS and profess loyalty to it. Yet for all its vast influence, there is something curiously slippery about the RSS. Its ideologues insist that it is larger than Hinduism or any single religion, and they speak of a mystical connection with the Indian subcontinent and the saffron flag, the group\u2019s symbol. They aspire to change India at both the collective and the individual level. \u201cIt is a man-making mission,\u201d I was told by Shiv Shakti Bakshi, an RSS veteran who now runs the B.J.P.\u2019s English-language publications. \u201cTo make a man who can work for the society, a selfless worker for the society.\u201d This focus on personal change meshes perfectly with Ramdev\u2019s promotion of physical fitness and health, and Bakshi spoke about the guru in glowing terms. \u201cHis messages are taken seriously by people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn elections, opinion building is important.\u201dThe RSS has become more visible since Modi\u2019s 2014 victory. The group and its affiliates have built hundreds of schools and job-training centers in Assam and other northeastern states in recent years. I visited several and saw unmistakable signs of the RSS ideological program. At one school, young children \u2014 some of whom had been raised Christian \u2014 recited Hindu prayers and sang songs to Lord Ram before starting their lessons, which include Sanskrit instruction.All this hard indoctrination work has paid off. In 2016, the B.J.P. won control of Assam\u2019s state government in legislative elections. And in March of this year, the party won stunning electoral upsets in two adjacent northeastern states, where leftist parties had dominated for decades. There was talk of a \u201csaffron wave\u201d that might spread to the south Indian regions, including Communist-dominated Kerala, that have long resisted the advance of Hindu nationalism. Many Indian political analysts said the RSS\u2019s grass-roots work was essential to the recent electoral victories. But one RSS volunteer in Assam, a construction contractor, told me Ramdev\u2019s presence and his yoga promotion had been very influential, too. The contractor said he'd helped to arrange the purchase of cement and other supplies for the new Assam factory site I toured. But eventually he soured on Patanjali, which he saw as too focused on the bottom line. \u201cEven we are not happy with the way the government helps Ramdev so much,\u201d the contractor told me.The latest wave of B.J.P. victories has been attended by angry criticism of the way the party feeds communal resentments, and Ramdev has not been spared. Assam\u2019s B.J.P.-led state government is compiling a citizenship registry that could cause millions of residents, mostly Muslims, to be declared stateless and expelled, in an eerie echo of the disfranchisement that preceded the mass murder of Rohingya people in nearby Myanmar. One Assamese university professor, who asked not to be named because he feared for his safety, told me that Ramdev had abetted the RSS\u2019s efforts to \u201cquestion all other religions here, anything non-Hindu.\u201d He also said Patanjali \u2014 emboldened by its ties to the Modi government \u2014 had run roughshod over laws regulating the harvest of medicinal plants.Retention has been a persistent problem for Ramdev. Applicants flock to the company, despite the fact that Patanjali reportedly pays 25 to 50 percent less than its competitors. Many leave after a year or less, I was told by executives at Patanjali and other companies. \u201cAutonomy is very low,\u201d said one executive at a competing company who asked not to be named, saying (like many other people I spoke to) that he feared retaliation. \u201cRamdev is very hands-on. There\u2019s no doubt who\u2019s in charge. He\u2019s a micromanager.\u201d Behind his laughing public persona, Ramdev is said by some to be an autocratic boss, capable of lashing out furiously when he\u2019s thwarted.I got a glimpse of Ramdev\u2019s ashram-style management at Haridwar, where he allowed me to observe him one afternoon. On the second floor of the company\u2019s main corporate office, the hallway was clogged with followers who had come for a glimpse of the guru. One group told me they had come all the way from Tamil Nadu, in the far south. Eventually one of Ramdev\u2019s handlers escorted me past the guards and into a wood-paneled office, and there was Ramdev, a splash of saffron color among button-down oxford shirts and gray flannel pants. He was sitting languidly on a couch, a wooden sandal dangling from his toe, interviewing candidates for jobs in sales and marketing. The applicants seemed as much in awe of Ramdev as the followers outside: as they entered, each of them touched Ramdev\u2019s feet reverently, then sat down. He asked them to say what they could contribute to Patanjali. A senior executive sat nearby taking notes, but Ramdev presided over the interview like a king on a throne. He is involved in even the smallest details: decisions about hiring, ads and product development. If anything were to puncture his aura \u2014 some scandal worse than those he has weathered in the past \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine that Patanjali would last a day.Ramdev would not be the first godman to crash and burn. At least a half-dozen other powerful gurus have been arrested and charged with serious crimes in the past 20 years. The most recent and perhaps the most flamboyant was Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, a potbellied and chubby-cheeked figure who cast himself as a superhero in several bizarre self-made action movies with titles like \u201cMSG: Messenger of God.\u201d Singh, who claimed 60 million followers around the world, was convicted of rape last August and sentenced to 20 years in prison. (He has also been formally accused of castrating about 400 of his disciples, a charge he denies.) After the verdict was issued, his followers rioted, smashing cars, setting fire to buildings and attacking police officers; at least 38 people were killed and more than 250 injured.But Ramdev is bigger and better protected than his predecessors. Patanjali has vastly expanded the market for ayurvedic products, and in late 2014 Modi created an entire new government ministry to promote yoga and ayurveda, elevating what had been an obscure government office. Ramdev has made himself a symbol of Indian economic independence, and no one wants to question that, not even his enemies. One Indian C.E.O. who has accused Patanjali of false advertising told me he was grateful to Ramdev \u2014 despite his many sins \u2014 for attracting a new customer base in ways that benefited everyone. \u201cThe worst thing for us would be if he implodes \u2014 with godmen you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would impact the whole ayurvedic market.\u201dRamdev appears to have a second layer of insurance: The clouds that hang over him also hang over his political patrons. Modi is regarded by much of the secular elite as a criminal because of his supposed role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. His close ally Amit Shah, the leader of the B.J.P. and by most accounts the second-most-powerful man in India, was arrested in 2010 and charged with arranging the murder of an underworld couple in police custody and making it look as if they were killed during a shootout. The case was ultimately dropped, but suspicions about Shah\u2019s role linger, fueled by a recent series of investigative stories in the Indian press. Modi and Shah respond to their accusers in exactly the same way Ramdev does, by lambasting the secular elite. Their shared feelings of unjust persecution appear to thicken their bond with Ramdev. And they see no need to change their stance; by all available measures, the Indian public is as supportive of Ramdev as ever. In early May, a widely watched business survey reported that Patanjali was the most trusted brand in the country, beating about 1,000 other companies in its sector, including multinationals.If the Modi government gets its way, Ramdev\u2019s star will rise even higher. At the Chhatrasal stadium event in February, Amit Shah told the crowd that the B.J.P. wanted Ramdev to join them in reforming the Indian educational system. One of the party\u2019s new priorities is an ambitious effort to rewrite Indian school textbooks to assert Hindu primacy. Mahesh Sharma, India\u2019s culture minister and an avowed follower of the RSS, has said he hopes to rewrite the conventional narrative about India as a multicultural tapestry, and to inculcate the belief that the ancient Hindu scriptures are historical facts, not legends.\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done in education,\u201d Shah said on the stadium floor, just after the premiere of Ramdev\u2019s biopic. \u201cBecause of our saints and our heroes \u2014 all this needs to be brought into our educational system.\u201dWhen his turn came to speak, Ramdev walked to the lectern, smiling graciously at the gaggle of B.J.P. luminaries onstage. He pledged his support to Modi and Shah, and their efforts to transform India. \u201cIf the first 50 years of my life were a struggle,\u201d he said, \u201cmy next 50 years I dedicate my time and energy to the cultural and spiritual education of the country, to bring our country the great knowledge of the Vedas.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe will see an Indian education policy in this country instead of the education policy given us by Lord Macaulay.\u201d Before stepping down, he pumped his fist once again in a chant of \u201cIndia my motherland is great.\u201d The crowd roared.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump and Mexico\u2019s New Leader, Both Headstrong, Begin With a \u2018Good Conversation\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump reached out to Mexico\u2019s new populist president-elect on Monday in an early, but potentially short-lived, show of d\u00e9tente, saying the two leaders engaged in a \u201cgood conversation\u201d about border security and the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has said Mexico will not be a \u201cpi\u00f1ata\u201d for foreign governments, has said he will stand up to Mr. Trump to protect his country\u2019s interests. And he may find himself under pressure by an electorate that, weary of Mr. Trump\u2019s hectoring and disparaging comments about Mexico, will demand that he cede no ground, leaving little room to manage the relationship.\u201cThere are going to be so many opportunities for this to go wrong,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute. \u201cIf there are too many provocations, if there are too many insults against Mexico, L\u00f3pez Obrador will not be able to just sit back and take it. His character shows that he will respond, and that could lead us down a dark path.\u201dRelations between Mexico and the United States are already tense, particularly over trade and the future of Nafta, which has enabled companies to create critical supply chains across North America. Talks to revise the trade pact among Mexico, the United States and Canada have stalled over dramatic changes proposed by the Trump administration, including altering protections for investors and rules for manufacturing automobiles in North America.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has been a longtime critic of the 1994 trade pact and has given no indiction he will be more willing to accommodate Mr. Trump\u2019s demands than the current Mexican government. Among other things, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has blamed Nafta for triggering an influx of grain from the United States that ultimately forced Mexican farmers off their land.But Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has pledged to continue to renegotiate Nafta \u2014 a promise that could ultimately put him in the position of defending the trade agreement against the frequent criticisms of Mr. Trump, who has called it the \u201cworst\u201d trade deal in history and blamed Mexico for siphoning off American jobs. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s advisers have said they will start working with the current Nafta negotiators soon to ensure a smooth transition when the new administration takes office on Dec. 1.The president-elect has also taken a far more critical view than his predecessor of corporations \u2014 which have among the most to win or lose with a revised Nafta. He has long criticized the role of multinational corporations in Mexico and once promised to turn the presidential palace into a public park. He has promised to review dozens of outstanding oil and gas exploration contracts for corruption, potentially delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment. His election has put the value of the peso and Mexican government bonds on a more volatile path.During the campaign, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his advisers worked to reassure voters and industry that he would provide continuity for the private sector.Any period of gracious talk may be short lived, however, with Mr. Trump almost certain to continue his tirade about the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador virtually guaranteed to fire back in ways that his predecessors did not.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador \u201chas committed to a louder, more combative posture with the U.S.,\u201d said Carlos M. Guti\u00e9rrez, the former secretary of commerce under President George W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s getting ready to take it up a notch.\u201dMr. Trump campaigned for the presidency by demanding a wall across the southern border and suggesting that people being \u201csent\u201d from Mexico into the United States are \u201cbringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201dEnrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the outgoing Mexican president, has objected to the construction of a wall \u2014 and insisted that Mexico would not pay for one if it was built \u2014 but repeatedly tried to avoid messy diplomatic confrontations with his American counterpart. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is sure to be less restrained. In a speech last year, he railed against Mr. Trump\u2019s government.\u201cWhen they want to build a wall to segregate populations, or when the word \u2018foreigner\u2019 is used to insult, denigrate and discriminate against our fellow human beings, it goes against humanity, it goes against intelligence and against history,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s initial reaction will be to try to find a way to work with Trump rather than attacking Trump,\u201d said Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican diplomat who served in the United States and China. \u201cIf there\u2019s a chill cast on the relationship, it will be on Trump. If he does, L\u00f3pez Obrador will easily run away from the United States.\u201dDiplomatic and financial relations between Mexico and the United States run deep, and the two have quietly continued to work closely together on a range of matters critical to their mutual well-being, including security, trade and migration. That is expected to continue despite the seismic shift in Mexican leadership.Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, was also optimistic about the ongoing negotiations on Nafta on Friday, saying that talks would \u201creally be moving into high gear\u201d now that the Mexican election was concluded.\u201cI could sign it tomorrow, but I\u2019m not happy with it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI want to make it more fair, O.K.?\u201dThe fate of the pact could be further complicated if Democrats gain congressional seats in November, given longstanding concerns by many in the party about the pact and its effect on American jobs and wages.The finer points of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s views on Nafta remain to be seen, but analysts say he is likely to toughen Mexico\u2019s defense of its agriculture \u2014 an issue that he sees as linked to migration from Mexico to the United States.Manuel P\u00e9rez-Rocha, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, said Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador believed that failed economic policies championed by the United States but also Mexican elites were one of the main causes of Mexicans being pushed off farms and on the path to immigration to the United States.\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t want to criticize Nafta too much, because that would put him at odds with the business community and investors,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez-Rocha said. \u201cBut what he\u2019s all about is strengthening the internal economy to focus on Mexico\u2019s jobs and the countryside.\u201dThe leaders may also find more room for compromise on the need to raise salaries in the Mexican auto industry, an area where the Trump administration has concurred with Democrats, but clashed with the current government of Mexico.Kirk Semple contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "So Now Trump Wants to Protect Farmers From Trump\u2019s Trade War?", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA $12 billion farm bailout will not undo the damage the administration\u2019s incoherent policies are doing to American industry and workers.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher.

{"Headline": "Ron Dellums, 82, Dies; Unrelenting in Congress, He Upheld Left\u2019s Ideals", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRon Dellums, the son of a longshoreman who became one of America\u2019s best-known black congressmen, a California Democrat with a left-wing agenda that put civil rights and programs for people ahead of weapons systems and warfare, died early Monday at his home in Washington. He was 82.His death was confirmed by Dan Lindheim, who was an aide to Mr. Dellums on Capitol Hill and was city manager of Oakland when Mr. Dellums was a one-term mayor there a decade ago. Mr. Dellums had cancer, he said.A former social worker representing Oakland and Berkeley, perhaps the nation\u2019s most liberal congressional district, Mr. Dellums went to Washington in 1971 as a fiercely liberal \u2014 some said radical \u2014 firebrand protesting the Vietnam War.He demanded a House investigation into American war crimes in Vietnam. When his pleas were ignored, he held his own informal hearings, which drew national attention. As antiwar protests raged outside the Capitol, a former Army sergeant told in unsworn testimony how he and his platoon had massacred 30 men, women and children in a Vietnamese village. It was a shocking beginning.But over the next 27 years, Mr. Dellums became a calmer voice, still defending principles as he saw them, but as a mellower graybeard spearheading the Congressional Black Caucus and conferring with the White House, the Pentagon and leaders of Congress as a member and finally chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee.By then, a lawmaker who had cut a striking figure on joining the House of Representatives \u2014 6 feet 4, with a modified Afro and a drooping mustache, mod ties, Edwardian jackets and bell-bottom trousers \u2014 was wearing three piece suits.Mr. Dellums introduced hundreds of bills and resolutions that went nowhere, and was rarely on the winning side of fights. But he was an outspoken critic of presidents, Republican and Democratic, and for many Americans beyond his tiny Congressional district, he championed a progressive mantra: Stop war. Cut military spending. Help people. Address the nation\u2019s social problems.He won a dozen re-election campaigns and the sometimes grudging respect of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. His voting record also won virtually straight A\u2019s from labor, consumer, women\u2019s and environmental groups. Human rights organizations hailed his fights to restrict aid to African nations, like Zaire, Burundi, Liberia and Sudan, whose regimes were openly repressive.After a 14-year campaign against apartheid in South Africa, he wrote the 1986 legislation that mandated trade embargoes and divestment by American companies and citizens of holdings in South Africa. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s veto was overridden by Congress, a 20th-century first in foreign policy. The sanctions were lifted in 1991, when South Africa repealed its apartheid laws.Mr. Dellums opposed every major American military intervention of his tenure, except for emergency relief in Somalia in 1992. He sued President George H. W. Bush unsuccessfully to stop the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91, saying the invasion did not have congressional authorization. And he voted against the new weapons programs and military budgets of all six presidents in his era.His \u201calternative\u201d budgets, written for the Congressional Black Caucus (he was a founding member in 1971 and chairman from 1989 to 1991) proposed spending instead for education, jobs, housing, health care, assistance for the poor and programs to fight drug abuse.Right-wing critics repeatedly labeled him a Communist, citing his 1970 talk to a world peace conference in Stockholm and his meeting with President Fidel Castro of Cuba in Havana in 1977.He was unperturbed.\u201cIf being an advocate of peace, justice and humanity toward all human beings is radical, then I\u2019m glad to be called radical,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd if it is radical to oppose the use of 70 percent of federal monies for destruction and war, then I am a radical.\u201dOver time, congressional colleagues came to respect Mr. Dellums\u2019s legislative and military expertise. In 1993, the House Democratic Caucus voted 198-10 to name him chairman of the Armed Services Committee, with oversight for defense appropriations and global military operations.He was the first African-American and the first antiwar activist to hold that post. A fox-in-the-henhouse cartoon portrayed a general and an admiral at the committee door under a banner proclaiming, \u201cUnder New Management.\u201d Inside, Mr. Dellums brandishes a meat ax. \u201cCall security,\u201d one military man says to the other.\u201cI disagree with him utterly and completely,\u201d Baker Spring, a military analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, told USA Today. \u201cBut he\u2019s upfront, open and honest, not in the least vindictive about the way he pursues his legislative agenda.\u201dDuring his two years as the committee chairman, Mr. Dellums conferred with President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary Les Aspin on military policies. With the Cold War over, he achieved cutbacks in some weapons programs, notably the B-2 Spirit (Stealth) bomber. But he failed to make substantial progress in redirecting budget priorities from defense to domestic programs.His decision to retire in 1998, halfway through his term, made headlines, and brought many encomiums.\u201cRon Dellums was an agitator for justice when it wasn\u2019t popular to be one,\u201d said Representative Cynthia McKinney, a black Georgia Democrat. \u201cHe was a trailblazer, a maverick and in many ways my mentor. He taught me that despite our urge to sprint, we have to become long distance runners in this game.\u201dBut after graduating from Oakland Technical High School in 1953, he could not find work and joined the Marine Corps. Discharged in 1956, he attended Laney College in Oakland on the G.I. Bill and took an associate degree in 1958 from the renamed Oakland City College. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from San Francisco State College in 1960 and a master\u2019s in social work from the University of California at Berkeley in 1962.In addition to her, his survivors include two sons, R. Brandon and Erik; two daughters, Piper Dellums and Rachel Chapman; a stepson, Kai Lewis; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.In the 1960s, Mr. Dellums worked for state and private social-work agencies in the Bay Area, aiding poor and troubled clients. It was an era of anarchic struggle against racism and police brutality in Oakland. Shootouts cost dozens of lives. Mr. Dellums disowned violence and never joined the Black Panthers, the paramilitary black power group that had a large presence in Oakland, but he defended their struggle against racism.His first foray into politics was a successful run for a seat on the City Council in 1967. He became an advocate for minorities and liaison to student groups at Berkeley.In 1970, backed by a coalition of minorities, students and labor, he upset Representative Jeffery Cohelan, a more conventional liberal, in the Democratic primary for the Oakland-Berkeley seat in Congress, and easily defeated a Republican in the general election. The district was redrawn twice, but his margins of victory reached up to 77 percent of the vote.\u201cSo here comes this black guy from the Bay Area,\u201d he told The Progressive magazine when he left Congress, \u201ctalking about peace, feminism, challenging racism, challenging the priorities of the country, and talking about preserving the fragile nature of our ecological system. People looked at me as if I was a freak. And looking back, I think that the only crime we committed was that we were 20 years ahead of our time.\u201dMr. Dellums remained in Washington until, in a last hurrah, he returned to California in 2006 to run for mayor of Oakland, winning in a three-way race.Serving one term, from 2007 to 2011, he hired more police officers to fight rising crime, and added teachers and new programs to cut truancy and dropout rates in troubled public schools. He also used his Washington contacts to win millions in grants to expand police resources and stimulate the Oakland economy. Critics said his administration lacked transparency.In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service cited Mr. Dellums and his wife for failure to pay $239,000 in income taxes over several years and placed a lien on their property. Mr. Dellums denied any willful evasion of taxes, but did not run for re-election in 2010.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Business of Becoming Bhad Bhabie", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "FeatureHow a troubled Florida teenager went from the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d show to signing a major-label record deal as a rapper.Supported byHe peddled the concept to record executives, presenting his plan as a source of easy money. They turned him away, citing artistic integrity. He got in touch with Interscope\u2019s vice chairman, Steve Berman, a name he knew from skits between songs on Eminem records. Berman wasn\u2019t into brand dropping, but he did need a novel revenue stream to cover the costs of video production. He gave Kluger a list of the label\u2019s new artists; perhaps he could make some suitable arrangements.Kluger focused his efforts on younger artists, making the case that taking the cash was not creatively bankrupt but could in fact further their vision. By the end of that summer, he had his first win \u2014 a deal between a clothing brand called Vixen\u2019s Visions and a new pop act named Lady Gaga. Over the course of the next several years, Kluger became a kind of sponsored-content hustler, making arrangements between artists and brands: Christina Aguilera and the Oranum psychic hotline, Flo Rida and the porn site Live Jasmin, Jason Derulo and the singles site Plenty of Fish. As Kluger saw it, he was just a middleman, taking a cut of the pay in exchange for providing a matchmaking service. By the fall of 2016, he was working on one of his biggest deals yet, between Britney Spears and the dating app Bumble.\u201cIt was almost a million dollars,\u201d Kluger recalls. \u201cI was on a flight to L.A. in November, for the video shoot, and the brand Bumble tried to go around me and go directly through Britney\u2019s lawyers, which doesn\u2019t happen. They tried to beat the middleman.\u201d Spears saw things differently. TMZ reported that Spears\u2019s camp believed that Kluger had been fraudulently acting as her representative and that he pocketed more than 40 percent of the $800,000 sponsorship fee. Her lawyers sent a letter threatening to sue. (Bumble declined to comment on the record.)\u201cI was so pissed off at the way that I was treated publicly from it that I decided to quit the music business,\u201d Kluger says. He took a vacation to blow off some steam \u2014 New York, Costa Rica. By the time he got back, it was 2017, and he was still pissed off \u2014 especially at Bumble. \u201cI was like, \u2018I built this company. I helped make this [expletive] popular.\u2019 Then I was like, \u2018I can make anything popular.\u2019\u2009\u201d Kluger hatched another plan, this time to save his own reputation. \u201cI\u2019m going to find something that\u2019s just so obscure, and I\u2019m going to make it popular,\u201d he decided. \u201cI\u2019m going to pull every trick I\u2019ve ever pulled with brands and make someone into a walking, talking brand to prove my worth.\u201dAs Kluger\u2019s deal was hitting the fan, the web was caught up in a drama of its own over an absurd clip from daytime TV featuring a Florida teenager. Danielle Bregoli, of Boynton Beach, was a guest on a September 2016 episode of \u201cDr. Phil\u201d titled \u201cI Want to Give Up My Car-Stealing, Knife-Wielding, Twerking 13-Year-Old Daughter Who Tried to Frame Me for a Crime!\u201d Bregoli had done all that and more, leading her desperate mother, Barbara Ann, to contact the television shrink for assistance. In the segment, mother and daughter sit facing a live studio audience. Barbara Ann begs Dr. Phil for his help, while Bregoli seems to revel in the spectacle of conflict. When the audience laughs at Bregoli\u2019s affectation \u2014 part Florida, part Brooklyn, part misconceived Black Vernacular English \u2014 she calls them all \u201choes,\u201d then invites them to fight: \u201cCash me outside, howbowdah?\u201d\u201cCatch you outside?\u201d Dr. Phil asks. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cCatch her outside,\u201d Barbara Ann explains. \u201cMeans she\u2019ll go outside and do what she has to do.\u201dFollowing the show, Dr. Phil sent Bregoli for an extended stay at Turn-About Ranch, a residential program in rural Utah for youths with emotional and behavioral problems. As she fed and groomed horses, without internet access, clips from the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d segment went viral, first on YouTube, then on Instagram, then on nearly every streaming site. Soon, her provocation had become a catchphrase \u2014 a brash multipurpose declaration of hardness. Walmart sold a T-shirt with the transliterated phrase on the front: CASH ME OUTSIDE HOW BOUT DAH. By the time Bregoli returned to Boynton Beach in January 2017, the internet knew her as the Cash Me Outside Girl \u2014 yet another disposable star, or yet another victim of a stage mother, or yet another white girl getting famous off black culture. Nobody seemed to agree on the subtext or on the best way to spell her slogan, but everyone agreed that she wasn\u2019t meant to last.Everyone but Kluger, who by then was living in Miami. He first heard the words \u201ccash me outside\u201d as a vocal sample in a song on a local radio station. Back at his office, he looked up the track, which led him to the clip from her \u201cDr. Phil\u201d appearance. At that point, Bregoli had been home from Turn-About for only two days. Kluger found her phone number by searching online. Bregoli answered the phone but told him she couldn\u2019t talk until Barbara Ann got back from the store. Barbara Ann invited him over. The next day, he made the hour drive through the South Florida sprawl, parking his Mercedes on their plain suburban street.As Kluger recalls, \u201cI said: \u2018I want to manage you. Give me some time, I\u2019ll make you a star. I\u2019ll make you guys rich. We want to make this thing happen.\u2019 With no hesitation, they were like, \u2018O.K., done.\u2019 They had no clue what that meant.\u201d\u201cThe initial idea was to brand her,\u201d he says. \u201cTo take this villain \u2014 relentless, crazy-attitude kid \u2014 and just brand her as this supervillain. She\u2019s going to be the one that the kids have to hide from their parents.\u201dKluger was fluent in branding-speak, but he knew he needed help turning followers into money. He placed a call to his colleague Dan Roof, the founder of FLUE, a digital firm best known for its consulting on the \u201cI Am T Pain\u201d app. Kluger and Roof had collaborated before on a paid content deal for the YouTube singer Austin Mahone. Roof had never seen Bregoli on \u201cDr. Phil\u201d and to this day still hasn\u2019t watched the full episode; after some negotiation, he agreed to come on board as her digital manager, helping her set up sponsorship deals.In February 2017, Bregoli and her mother flew to Los Angeles for a second \u201cDr. Phil\u201d appearance, in which she told the TV therapist, \u201cI made you just like how Oprah made you.\u201d That same week, she appeared in a video for the rapper Kodak Black, a fellow Florida native and one of Bregoli\u2019s favorite artists. In the video, Bregoli wore a shirt that said CASH ME OUSSIDE on the front and HOW BOW DAH on the back; she fanned stacks of cash in the back seat of a Rolls-Royce.A few days later, on a Spirit Airlines flight, Bregoli clocked another passenger in the head during a dispute about overhead-bin space. She was bounced from the flight and landed back in the headlines on gossip sites. By the time she eventually returned to Florida, Twitter was losing its mind \u2014 partly in shock over her flagrant misconduct, partly in awe of her persistence in the news.But in our current cultural economy, such attention does not always convert easily to cash. She now had two managers and the interest of the public but was still left facing an industrywide predicament: Today\u2019s internet produces many figures of interest, but few possess the kinds of talent that our entertainment pipelines were designed to monetize. Influencers are famous for things that can\u2019t be sold \u2014 bodies, personas, lifestyles and conflict. Some make money by doing sponsored posts on Instagram. Others have been more creative; top users from the defunct vlogging site Vine planned a meet-and-greet convention tour known as MAGCON, charging fans for real-life access. If these hustles can be profitable, then they tend to work best as one of several revenue streams; online stars are still best served by finding their way toward traditional talent.Roof set up a paid sponsorship deal for Bregoli to post about FitTea Detox Tea on Instagram. The money was good, but it wouldn\u2019t last forever; Kluger set out to find something more stable. A meet-and-greet tour was booked and then canceled \u2014 it was deemed too shortsighted as her following continued to grow. A reality show about fame fell through on account of the tautological problem that it would not succeed unless she kept getting famous. Bregoli had expressed some interest in acting, but a film career would take too long to build. Viral minutes tick faster than real ones. If she wanted to keep the interest of the public, she needed a talent, and she needed one soon.Throughout this process of trial and error, Bregoli and her mother were still splitting their time between Boynton Beach and Los Angeles. Bregoli was still getting in trouble. At the end of February, a security camera seemingly caught her on tape with a friend, who threw an ice cream cone at a stranger outside a bar in downtown Lake Worth, Fla. In April, she was cited for possession of marijuana in Boynton Beach. Kluger remembers one phone call from his mother, in which she warned that Bregoli would ruin his career. He hung up on her; they didn\u2019t speak again for three weeks.\u201cEverybody got weird,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even mad that they were bashing Danielle, because everyone was bashing Danielle at the time. I was like: \u2018You really don\u2019t [expletive] believe that I know what I\u2019m doing? Don\u2019t bet the horse, bet the jockey.\u2019\u2009\u201dDuring those first chaotic months, Kluger and Roof spent a lot of time in the car, shuttling Bregoli between various appointments. She killed the time in traffic on Instagram Live or by singing along to songs she liked. Like many kids her age, she listened to rap. She loved to rap along with Kodak Black mixtapes as Roof made videos on his phone, just for fun. Reviewing the clips, he thought to himself, It kind of sounds like she can rap a little bit.A shift toward rap would not be unprecedented. The year 2017 had already experienced a spate of enthusiastic, if terrible, rap songs by social-media figures, including \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro,\u201d by the YouTuber Jake Paul, which, thanks to his millions of subscribers, managed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. That summer, the stripper-turned-Instagram-influencer-turned-reality-star-turned-rapper Cardi B made the most successful crossover yet, with her smash-hit radio single \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201dRap is a biographical form. Back when most songs were still part of an album, records were used to tell origin stories, advance inside jokes and escalate beefs. But as streaming continues to disaggregate the album, the digital single leaves less room for plot, pushing that burden out into the real world. Instagram and Twitter bridge the gap. Social media and rap share a similar mode \u2014 personal, direct, aspirational. A rapper can post to flesh out his world; an internet star can turn toward music as a way to commodify the world she has already created. A single is cheap and easy to produce, and just a few can serve to ground a whole career, providing a more concrete reason for touring and a more stable base for a merchandise line. In a music industry that increasingly makes its money off things other than music, this reversal does not seem so convoluted.Kluger was initially against the idea of getting back into the music business, but he consented to some studio time to see how Bregoli sounded outside the car. At that first trial session, she felt painfully self-conscious. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to put these headphones on. I don\u2019t want to get in this booth,\u2019\u2009\u201d she says. When she finally got in front of the mic, it took a few moments to work up the courage. She got into the zone. \u201cI was like, literally, \u2018I\u2019m prettier than all of these people in here.\u2019 I looked at the people in the room, and I was like: \u2018I\u2019m better than you. I can do this. I\u2019ll be fine. I won\u2019t look stupid.\u2019\u2009\u201dThat first trial session landed her a second one with Aton Ben-Horin, the global head of artists and repertoire at Warner Music Group. He was impressed by Bregoli\u2019s online following \u2014 by then, well over a million on Instagram \u2014 but told Roof and Kluger that she had a future only if she could actually rap. He brought along a songwriter\u2019s sketch of an unfinished track called \u201cHi Bich,\u201d a trap-pop banger with a mean-girl hook. When Bregoli got in the booth, he knew he had something. \u201cI was convinced that even without Dr. Phil, without anything, this girl would have done music,\u201d Ben-Horin says. \u201cThere\u2019s something really special about her phrasing, and I think that\u2019s actually part of why the \u2018cash me outside\u2019 phrase went viral. It wasn\u2019t just that she said \u2018cash me outside\u2019 \u2014 it was the way she said it.\u201d Over the course of the next two weeks, they recorded 14 songs together. On Sept. 15, a news release from Atlantic announced that it had signed Bregoli to a record deal. (\u201cWith her burgeoning rap career, Bhad Bhabie is set to prove that she is more than just a meme.\u201d) A lone tipster told TMZ the deal was worth millions; Atlantic declined to comment.Bregoli had in the meantime changed her Instagram handle to @BhadBhabie \u2014 officially pronounced Bad Baby, but sometimes mispronounced Bad Barbie or Baahd Bobby. (Bregoli has since suggested that \u201cBhad\u201d stands for \u201cbeen hated and doubted.\u201d) Kluger disliked the misspelling but accepted the name as a good first step away from her past: She was no longer the Cash Me Outside Girl. \u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to say \u2018cash me outside,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kluger says. \u201cNo one on my team is allowed to use those words ever.\u201dBregoli took a seat at the corporate coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she said, shrinking even smaller in her oversize hoodie. Bregoli is a boggling study of proportions \u2014 small feet, small frame, superlong acrylic nails and a horsy ponytail that her mangers say they make her wear as a strained prophylactic against sexualization. (\u201cAnything a real 15-year-old girl could wear, dial that down to a 9-year-old,\u201d Bregoli says.) Her scale takes on an even greater sense of whimsy in relation to her all-male entourage, which that day included Kluger, Roof and her full-time bodyguard, Frank Dellatto. Dellatto was hired to protect Bregoli (mostly from herself) after the Spirit Airlines altercation. He now lives in Hollywood with her and her mother \u2014 part driver, part brother, part bodyguard, part friend. On this trip to New York, Bregoli was staying with her grandmother in Mill Basin, in the very same house where her mother grew up and caught the Brooklyn accent that Bregoli now exhibits in some reconstituted form. The day before, she visited a walk-in nail salon to have her nails redone in blue and white \u2014 for Hanukkah, she joked. (Bregoli is half Jewish, on her estranged father\u2019s side.) Bregoli gets her nails done twice a week; Dellatto, who manages her schedule, tends to spend a lot of time in the salon.\u201cI don\u2019t really get too, too, too involved with everything,\u201d she explained, flipping her hair like a kind of punctuation. \u201cThe reason why I\u2019m in New York is because I have to, like, sign papers, or something to that effect.\u201dBregoli is an only child, born in 2003. Her father, Ira Peskowitz, is a deputy sheriff in South Florida. He and Barbara Ann never married. At a court hearing last June for Bregoli\u2019s marijuana charges, Peskowitz told the local ABC affiliate, WPBF, that he worried that Bregoli was being groomed for porn. Barbara Ann says that he took an interest in parenting duties only after his daughter\u2019s reappearance on \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d And, according to an anonymously sourced story on TMZ, he accepted a payoff from Barbara Ann in exchange for terminating his parental rights. (Peskowitz strongly denies each of these claims.)Barbara Ann remembers her daughter as a spoiled but loving child, who slept in her bed throughout her breast-cancer treatment and continues to do so even today. Their relationship changed when Bregoli was 12 and started having issues with authority. She transferred to an alternative school, where she made friends with a heavily tattooed 15-year-old girl. Bregoli and her new friend stopped going to class. They would walk to the beach, or the Palm Beach Outlets, or nearby Lake Worth to visit their boyfriends. They dressed alike. Around that time, Bregoli says, the friend started sleeping with adult men for money. Bregoli, meanwhile, was getting high and fighting with her mother \u2014 normal teenager stuff, on a supersonic scale. In a one-year period, the police were called to the family home in Boynton Beach dozens of times. Barbara Ann knew that she needed to get help. She thought Bregoli needed residential treatment, but she couldn\u2019t afford it. She considered the \u201cDr. Phil\u201d appearance a nonideal solution to what seemed like an otherwise intractable problem.When Bregoli looks back on this time in her life, she tends to talk around \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d leaving an impression that her fame came from nowhere. Like those of sober addicts and survivors of cults, her life is arranged into a clear before and after. Still, the transition did not come all at once. During those first months home from Turn-About Ranch, she was still going out, making trouble with her friend. When she came home one night with an illegal tattoo \u2014 a rose on her shoulder that says \u201cFamily First\u201d \u2014 Kluger and Roof made a hasty decision: She needed to move to Los Angeles for good. Bregoli remembers Dellatto saying, \u201cI\u2019m taking you to L.A. You can either get up and get in the car, or I\u2019m going to pick you up and put you in the car.\u201d She got in the car; on the way to the airport, she bit off her acrylics.Looking back, Bregoli believes this was the right decision even if she didn\u2019t exactly make it for herself; looking forward makes her too anxious. Around the time of the visit to Atlantic, she was on the cusp of a 26-date tour, for which she was enrolled in performance training lessons with Deja Riley, a movement coach who was brought on board to help develop her stage presence. If the Bhanned in the U.S.A. Tour went well, it would go a long way toward persuading the public that Bregoli wasn\u2019t just that viral brat from \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d According to Kluger, Bregoli counts herself among the skeptics. She once told him, \u201cOh, people just know me as that white girl that was on TV yelling at my mom.\u201dKluger feels certain this isn\u2019t the case. \u201cWhen we started with her, period, it was 99.5 percent hate, .5 percent like,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen \u2018These Heaux\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 her first single \u2014 \u201ccame out in July/August, it was 70 percent hate, 30 percent like. We\u2019re at a solid 60-40; 40 percent of the world hates her, 60 percent actually like her. Which is [expletive] insane.\u201dFor the debut tour date on April 14, Kluger deliberately booked an undersize venue \u2014 the Observatory in Orange County, Calif. He had faith that Bregoli would do a good job but wanted to ensure a packed house, for her ego. It worked. That night, the crowd was diverse \u2014 almost too diverse to characterize. Black girls with nose rings and multicolor yarn braids pushed against white goth girls with baby bangs; 10-year-old boys and lesbian couples mixed with Kylie Jenner types of every race and creed. A man over 40 with male-pattern baldness carried a drawstring backpack that said BHAD. If the guests had anything significant in common, it was that none of them seemed sure if their presence was sincere.A D.J. named Suga Shay hyped up the crowd, spinning Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d Lyrics gave way to a bass-heavy vamp, and Bregoli made her way to the stage, wearing white jeans and a matching Thrasher hoodie. A man in the front row yelled to his friend, \u201cOh, my God \u2014 she looks like a little girl!\u201d She walked back and forth with slow, wide strides, eating up all the space on her stage.The first song was \u201cGucci Flip Flops,\u201d a Lil Yachty collaboration with a singsong, knick-knack-paddy-whack flow. Bregoli rapped about a big-faced watch dripping in diamonds \u2014 a luxury commodity that she neither had nor especially wanted. On a literal level, nearly everything she rapped that night was untrue. At 15, she could not drive the Bentley truck mentioned in \u201cBoth of \u2019Em,\u201d nor the Porsche on \u201cHi Bich.\u201d The audience knew this wasn\u2019t the point. Now they understood that if their interest was partly in jest, it was not the sneering mockery of hipsters at Olive Garden, but the camp infatuation of gay men who root for Disney villains. Bregoli\u2019s claims were demonstrably false, but at least they spoke truth to our universal urge to prove haters wrong, especially when they might actually be right.Bregoli crouched down to get level with her crowd: \u201cWhat\u2019s up, all my Santa Ana sluts?\u201d The crowd declared its allegiance, but not for long enough; her discography was still only 20 minutes end to end. She made some efforts to extend her presence visually. A screen played a reel of nonmusical hits: clips of recent TMZ coverage, footage from the infamous Spirit Airlines fight. She performed covers (of Lil Pump, of Kodak Black) and chose a fan to bring onstage (the brace-faced \u201cJulie from East L.A.\u201d). She played a game of call and response: \u201cHow many of you hate these fake-ass bitches?\u201d The audience reached an expedient consensus. She flipped her ponytail and paused for a breath. In the moment of quiet, one man tried his luck: \u201cCASH ME OUTSIDE HOWBOUDAH?\u201dThe room fell silent. The man had transgressed an unspoken taboo. He should have known better than to shout at a girl whose only proven talent was firing back.\u201cI can\u2019t see no one\u2019s mouth moving,\u201d Bregoli said. \u201cGet the [expletive] out.\u201dThe crowd booed the man to hell on her behalf. The room was so full it was hard to see if he fled. Bregoli picked up where she left off.On the drive back to the house, Bregoli shared a bag of gummy bears with Dellatto and chattered away about the fakeness of Los Angeles. A housefly landed on her white Playboy sweats, and Dellatto caught the bug in his hand in midair. Pulling the S.U.V. into the garage, he put it in park and looked at his phone. The day before, Bregoli\u2019s old friend from Boynton Beach \u2014 the one with whom she used to ditch school \u2014 had been arrested. Dellatto read a text from Kluger out loud: \u201cWhile you are performing and living a life people dream of, she is rotting in jail. Could have been you.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a [expletive] wreck,\u201d Bregoli said.\u201cThat,\u201d Dellatto said, \u201cis a tale of two stories.\u201dBack at the house in Dellatto\u2019s wing, Bregoli half-watched \u201cThe Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\u201d and played through a bunch of viral videos on her phone. \u201cI want some [expletive] chocolate-covered strawberries from Godiva,\u201d she announced. \u201cDoes Postmates do that?\u201d She opened the delivery app, scrolled for a moment and decided she would rather just get them at the mall.Later that night outside the Glendale Galleria, about 500 feet from Godiva Chocolatier, Bregoli was filmed in a physical altercation with two less-famous social-media stars. The first, @imwoahvicky, was the 18-year-old daughter of a Georgia real estate developer who first gained attention on Instagram posting videos of her lavish life, using her own interpretation of a Southern black accent. (Vicky appears to be white but has claimed that an online DNA test proved she was part black.) The second, @liltay, was a suspiciously unsupervised grade-school girl, reportedly from Canada, who role-plays a rapper\u2019s lifestyle online. Watching the tussle between the three girls felt, on some level, like watching Bregoli fight with two bad facsimiles of herself. If her old friend\u2019s arrest seemed to hark toward the past and the turbulence of the life she successfully escaped, then the fight portended its own disorienting future \u2014 one rife with messy microcelebs, constantly competing for public attention by further offending the sensibilities of an increasingly numb audience.The incident spurred conflicting statements from all sides, starting a miniature cycle of news that threatened the coverage of Bregoli\u2019s first performance. If nobody knew why the fight had occurred, then neither could anyone seem to look away.\u201cI\u2019m not happy that Danielle got violent, but I understand why,\u201d Kluger said the next morning. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m upset really is because this aligns her with someone who is just a complete nobody. Just a mockery. It\u2019s bad for my brand.\u201d Chaos is only profitable to the extent that you can control it; after the Spirit Airlines fight, Kluger learned to keep a piece of good news in his back pocket. \u201cI know who I\u2019m working with, and I\u2019m prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to drown it out with positivity.\u201dTwo days after the fight, and 580 days after her initial appearance on \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d a headline ran on TMZ: \u201cDanielle Bregoli Reality Show in the Works.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Inflation Rises, It\u2019s Even Harder to Get a Raise", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy is not yet there for many Americans.The jobs report on Friday showed that the United States added an impressive 213,000 jobs in June. The recovery has brought unemployment down to historically low levels.But the report, as is often the case, pointed to a crucial way in which the economy is still not firing on all cylinders: The strong demand for labor has not prompted employers to substantially increase how much they pay their employees.Hourly earnings in June grew 2.7 percent from a year earlier. That\u2019s more or less in line with the pace of the past two years. But now those modest wage gains are worth less in the real world. The reason: The prices of goods and services are picking up. In May, inflation hit 2.8 percent and grew faster than wages, which increased 2.75 percent. Inflation numbers for June come out on Thursday.Underwhelming wage growth has been a characteristic of the economy since the financial crisis of 2008. But if inflation continues to erode wage gains, consumers can afford less, dragging the growth of the overall economy. The Trump administration might then find it harder to promote its economic achievements. At the end of 2016, the last full month of the Obama administration, wages grew at an annual rate of 0.6 percent, adjusted for inflation. In May, inflation-adjusted earnings fell 0.05 percent.So far, that virtuous cycle does not seem to be taking hold. And some economists are skeptical that it will. Companies have had the ability to invest cheap capital for years, and wages have not risen strongly.\u201cA lower cost of capital may lead to more investment that may lead to more productivity growth, but to assume that will trickle down to middle-class wages flies in the face of everything we\u2019ve seen for the last 20 years,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and an official in the first Obama administration.The recently introduced personal tax cuts, of course, will bolster take-home wages. It\u2019s hard to assess how much impact they\u2019ve had, because Friday\u2019s employment report does not factor personal taxes into its earnings figures. But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the effective personal tax rate had not changed much in the past year, edging down to 12.21 percent in May, from 12.25 percent a year earlier.\u201cThe tax cuts have yet to have a significant impact on individual tax bills, at least across all individuals and all sources of income,\u201d Mr. Zandi said in an email. He noted that inflation-adjusted wages had in recent years grown more or less in line with productivity, which has itself been lackluster.But wages could soon outpace productivity, Mr. Zandi predicted, because companies will have to pay higher wages to attract and retain workers. He sees signs of this already happening in numbers that track the wages of people who\u2019ve been newly hired. The wages of new entrants rose 5 percent from the earnings of those hired a year ago, according to data from ADP, the human resources company.\u201cThis is a sharp acceleration over the past year, and likely presages a broader acceleration in wage growth,\u201d Mr. Zandi said, \u201cas businesses will have no choice but to raise wages more quickly for their existing workers to maintain parity with new entrants.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s changing, as employers are increasingly turning to Uber-like services to find nannies, housecleaners and other care workers. These new gig economy companies, while making it easier for some people to find short-term work, have created hardships for others, and may leave many experienced care workers behind.Care.com and similar companies like CareLinx or UrbanSitter are \u201cmarketplace\u201d platforms, which promise employers their choice of workers ranked according to the metrics set by platforms. Uber, by contrast, simply dispatches ride requests to drivers automatically. Marketplaces require a lot more effort from workers and families, who have to send multiple messages to test the waters, like online dating. Job seekers need to be constantly online and responsive to secure work.This presents new problems. Nannies, elder care workers, and housecleaners might have years of experience, but that isn\u2019t enough to thrive on a marketplace platform. They also need access to a smartphone and reliable internet access, as well as skills in personal branding and internet communications.One of the people we interviewed, a young woman with her own active profile on Care.com in Washington, D.C., took over as a proxy for her mother on the platform after her mother uploaded a \u201cbad\u201d profile picture. \u201cI mean, my mom is like sixty-something,\u201d she said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t grow up in this technology age, so she\u2019s not that familiar with it. So I do most of it for her.\u201d She handles the initial contact with prospective clients, until it gets to the stage of a phone interview.Another person we interviewed, a woman in her 50s from Atlanta, went online at her local library to try to find work on Care.com. Without a smartphone or internet access at home, she wasn\u2019t able to respond to clients quickly enough to secure a position.Care work previously had very few barriers to entry, making it accessible to poor, undocumented and other vulnerable populations of workers. The Economic Policy Institute found that 90 percent of in-home workers are women, they are disproportionately immigrants and nearly one-quarter of them are poor.But while the platforms create barriers for some, they lower barriers for others, making it more convenient for workers who are already comfortable with the gig economy. This was a common complaint among care workers we interviewed: that their industry is being flooded with people who are new to care work, who see it as supplementary income rather than as a profession and undercut their wages.Another woman in Atlanta told us that her years of experience were devalued by parents who had access to a huge number of potential nannies. \u201cIt\u2019s like, this is my bread and butter!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not working for no nine, 10 dollars an hour. Those kind of people want to undermine your faith in your ability.\u201dCompanies can do more to design platforms to support qualified care workers.To be sure, care work jobs have historically been stratified along racial, ethnic and class lines: White, \u201cprofessionalized\u201d nannies are hired with better pay and working conditions, while lower-status work goes to immigrants and women of color. Gig economy platforms are adding another dimension to these divides and may worsen them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Ease Pain of Trump\u2019s Trade War: $12 Billion in Aid for Farmers", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would provide up to $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers hurt by the president\u2019s trade war, moving to blunt the financial damage to American agriculture and the political fallout for Republicans as the consequences of President Trump\u2019s protectionist policies roll through the economy.Unveiled two days before the president is scheduled to visit Iowa, a politically important state that is the nation\u2019s top soybean producer, the farm aid appeared calculated to show that Mr. Trump cares about farmers and is working to protect them from the worst consequences of his trade war.But the relief money, announced by the Department of Agriculture, was also an indication that Mr. Trump \u2014 ignoring the concerns of farmers, their representatives in Congress and even some of his own aides \u2014 plans to extend his tit-for-tat tariff wars.\u201cThe actions today are a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agricultural producers to force the United States to cave in,\u201d Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, said during a call with reporters to unveil the program.\u201cYou have a terrible policy that sends farmers to the poorhouse, and then you put them on welfare, and we borrow the money from other countries,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there isn\u2019t an outright revolt right now in Congress.\u201dSenator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, asked how the president could single out farmers for help when the manufacturing and energy industries also stand to lose in the trade war.\u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d Ms. Murkowski asked reporters.Mr. Trump could be forced to prop up other domestic industries as retaliatory taxes imposed by trading partners begin to sting automobile manufacturers, distillers and other impacted sectors. Republicans who cherish their party\u2019s reputation as the bastion of free markets and fiscal responsibility wondered aloud on Tuesday about the president picking winners and losers in a trade war he is bent on waging.Farmers have borne the brunt of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs, which is already costing American producers billions of dollars and threatens to inflict political pain on Republicans in farm states in the midterm elections in November.The European Union, Canada, Mexico, China and other countries have responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel, aluminum and $34 billion worth of Chinese products by imposing taxes of their own. They have often targeted farm country, the source of some of America\u2019s biggest exports and an important political base for the president. American soybeans, pork, sugar, orange juice, cherries and other products now face tariffs in foreign markets that make their products less desirable.At a speech in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Americans should \u201cjust be a little patient\u201d with the pain they may be feeling from the trade war, arguing that his actions were forcing other countries to the negotiating table to cut deals that would be better for them in the long run.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to have those tariffs put on them \u2014 they\u2019re all coming to see us \u2014 and the farmers will be the biggest beneficiary,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up markets. You watch what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dSome farm groups praised the move, albeit as a short-term solution.\u201cWe are grateful for the administration\u2019s recognition that farmers and ranchers needed positive news now, and this will buy us some time,\u201d said Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. \u201cThis announcement is substantial, but we cannot overstate the dire consequences that farmers and ranchers are facing.\u201dThe battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.But lawmakers in both parties and many agricultural trade groups criticized the assistance program as a taxpayer-funded bailout for farmers imperiled by the president\u2019s own policies, and even Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican allies made clear that they did not regard it as a genuine solution to the problems his tariffs had created.\u201cThe president\u2019s announcement of billions of dollars in aid that will be made available to struggling farmers later this year is encouraging for the short term,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said in a statement. \u201cWhat farmers in Iowa and throughout rural America need in the long term are markets and opportunity, not government handouts.\u201dAgriculture Department officials said farmers could begin signing up to receive the federal money in September, just weeks before voters go to the polls.The package includes direct payments to the producers of soybeans, sorghum, corn, wheat, cotton, dairy and hogs, who would be compensated according to the size of their harvests this year. It will also include government purchases of surplus products \u2014 including fruit, nuts, rice, legumes, beef, pork and dairy \u2014 that would be sent to food banks or other nutrition programs. Some of the funding would go to a program in which the Agriculture Department works with private companies to develop new export markets for American farm products.Mr. Trump and his advisers have argued that while American producers may feel short-term pain, ultimately they will benefit as other countries are forced to lower their barriers to American products.Meantime, the administration has sought ways to help farmers survive the pain of retaliation. The program announced on Tuesday will be funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation, which helps shore up American farmers by buying their crops.It marked the first time that funding from the program \u2014 created after the Great Depression \u2014 has been used to compensate farmers for losses sustained because of trade, according to an Agriculture Department spokesman.The initiative, which does not authorize any new money and thus does not need approval from Congress, was an unmistakable signal that the president has no plans to lift his tariffs anytime soon, as Farm Belt senators have pleaded with him to do.\u201cThis trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers, and the White House\u2019s \u2018plan\u2019 is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cThis administration\u2019s tariffs and bailouts aren\u2019t going to make America great again, they\u2019re just going to make it 1929 again.\u201dSenator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said farmers in his state \u201cwant trade, not aid.\u201d\u201cI support President Trump\u2019s call for reciprocal trade and his effort to stop China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property, but we should stop self-inflicting permanent damage to America\u2019s economy through tariffs and a trade war,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.One trade group leader said farmers need contracts, not government assistance, for stability.Administration officials argued on Tuesday that the assistance for farmers would help them absorb the pain while persuading other countries that they must offer concessions to forge trade agreements with the United States.\u201cWhat this will do is provide some hope to farmers and ranchers that the president and the secretary do have their back,\u201d Greg Ibach, the under secretary of agriculture for marketing and regulatory programs, said of the aid package. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that other countries will see that we\u2019re serious now about negotiations.\u201dBut many farmers criticized the decision and said it would only compound the maze of federal subsidies and regulations they already must wade through to make a living.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be dependent on another government program,\u201d Casey Guernsey, a Missouri farmer and spokesman for Americans for Farmers & Families, an anti-tariff group, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cWe already are very much in a situation in farming, in agriculture across the board, where we are held hostage to decisions made in Washington.\u201dAnd some lawmakers argued that if he wanted to help American farmers, Mr. Trump must simply call off his trade war.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Shakes the International Order. Could It Break?", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterLONDON \u2014 The world\u2019s first-ever theory of war, concerning two Greek cities, might appeal to President Trump.Athens and Sparta, old allies, went to war 2,500 years ago, according to the historian Thucydides, when plucky Athens grew powerful enough to rival Sparta, then the pre-eminent Greek power. The natural order could not abide two peers side by side, making conflict inevitable.But that was the old world of ruthless self-interest and zero-sum competition. Today, nations have some idea of how to rise above those instincts.Consider the half-century alliance between the United States and Europe. A unified Europe is America\u2019s closest peer in economic and military strength. Under Thucydides\u2019s theory, which held for millenniums, conflict between them should be inevitable \u2014 and yet it is unthinkable.The scaffolding with which nations have lifted themselves above the old ways is sometimes called the liberal international order: alliances, free trade and organizations like the United Nations. It remains a work in progress, but one at least intended to hold all nations in peaceful coexistence.Mr. Trump, in his instinct for the old ways, is pushing and pulling at that scaffolding, and has taken several opportunities to shake its foundations during his weeklong tour of Europe.Distrustful of all agreements except those he forged himself, Mr. Trump treats even allies as competitors. His is the world of Athens and Sparta. And while that hardly means a descent into war, Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts have brought conflict in other forms. He has begun sweeping trade wars and seems in perpetual diplomatic fights, particularly with allies.There are potential gains. Though Mr. Trump has yet to show significant concessions from the Europeans, they may deliver some out of fear of losing American support, something only this president could credibly threaten.Barack Obama spent years trying to coax the Europeans into doing more for their collective defense. Mr. Trump, by presenting Europe with a powerful external threat \u2014 him \u2014 could force them to finally follow through.The potential downsides are abstract but significant. No one is sure how many times Mr. Trump can shake the foundations of the international order before it collapses, either in part or in whole. And no one can say what will happen if it does.But we do know, at least, what the current order supports. And Americans know this particularly well because it was the United States that built this system, in large part to serve its own interests.NATO may be the clearest case. Though Mr. Trump has characterized it as a kind of American protection service for freeloading Europeans, it was intended to keep the Europeans unified and yoked to American leadership. Not only would they never again threaten the United States, their reliance on American power enlists them on its behalf.But NATO, like other aspects of the American-led order, consists of more than its collective hardware. It is held together by trust: that its members will come together in mutual support, and not only when faced with a common threat like Russia. That trust, going against the self-interested instincts of the individual countries, is radically new in the world. Its resilience is unknown.Every time Mr. Trump threatens or berates an ally or calls NATO obsolete, even if he does so to secure greater European commitments to upholding that order, he chips away at the trust holding it together.Maybe all this is just another aspect of the cost-benefit tactics that can be seen in Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to other issues, particularly the one that appears to most captivate him: trade.The system of global free trade has downsides \u2014 when an industry shifts from one country to another, masses of workers can pay the price \u2014 but it was set up as a kind of permanent win for the United States. Openness exploits the sheer size and development of the American economy so that its goods and services can dominate internationally. And it lowers the price of goods, raising the American quality of life.Longer term, might this erode American dominance of the international trade system? China, hit heavily by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, is trying to position itself as the new responsible steward of global trade \u2014 a difficult sell, but with Chinese economic links in Europe and elsewhere growing, not unimaginable.The stakes, largely hypothetical, are uncertain. But every disruption makes the United States a less attractive partner, source of investment or place to do business. International economic isolation can be self-perpetuating as businesses and currency reserves flee abroad. Even if there is no single moment of breakdown, self-imposed isolation, should it continue too long, could exceed the benefits of rejiggered trade relationships.Could things ever really get that far? It is difficult to say for sure, in part because Mr. Trump\u2019s own motivations can be hard to nail down. It is unclear how far he will go.Others suspect Mr. Trump is driven less by lofty ideology than by moment-to-moment impulse. Maybe, rather than strategically bent on deconstructing the international order, he is temperamentally inclined toward actions that have that effect.European officials often talk of appeasing his ego or containing what they see as his inclinations toward disruption for its own sake. They point out that Mr. Trump has consistently mischaracterized European defense spending as payments to the United States.Perhaps Mr. Trump is simply importing the brinkmanship and bluffing he espoused, in his real estate days, as negotiating tactics. Hints that he might give up on NATO, in this view, are not sincere assaults on the alliance but mere cage rattling meant to spook the Europeans into complying with decades-old demands to spend more on defense.Still, if that is the strategy, its gains can be obscure. In his telling, Mr. Trump provoked an emergency meeting at this week\u2019s NATO gathering to pressure European members to \u201csubstantially up their commitment\u201d to defense spending. It worked, he said: \u201cThey\u2019re going to up it at levels that they\u2019ve never thought of before.\u201dMinutes later, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said that the Europeans had merely reaffirmed previously agreed-upon spending plans.It was not lost on participants that Mr. Trump had claimed to resolve a crisis he himself had provoked. Nor that his impromptu news conference, where he spoke of extracting concessions, coincided with morning news programs back in the United States.The global order does bring downsides for the United States, which is constrained by its role as the reliable keystone at the center of it all. It\u2019s thankless and often frustrating work.Other countries are free to act as spoilers, threatening the greater system to force some concessions, knowing the Americans will keep that system together. This role, at least traditionally, has not been considered available to the United States; you cannot be both leader and spoiler.But Mr. Trump is testing that assumption in ways no president has before. If he is on to something, the gains will come. If he\u2019s not, some fear that the costs could be permanent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Lose a Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistTrump\u2019s declaration that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d is an instant classic, right up there with Herbert Hoover\u2019s \u201cprosperity is just around the corner.\u201dBut here\u2019s the thing: Trump\u2019s tariffs are badly designed even from the point of view of someone who shares his crude mercantilist view of trade. In fact, the structure of his tariffs so far is designed to inflict maximum damage on the U.S. economy, for minimal gain. Foreign retaliation, by contrast, is far more sophisticated: unlike Trump, the Chinese and other targets of his trade wrath seem to have a clear idea of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish.The key point is that the Navarro/Trump view, aside from its fixation on trade balances, also seems to imagine that the world still looks the way it did in the 1960s, when trade was overwhelmingly in final goods like wheat and cars. In that world, putting a tariff on imported cars would cause consumers to switch to domestic cars, adding auto industry jobs, end of story (except for the foreign retaliation.)In the modern world economy, however, a large part of trade is in intermediate goods \u2013 not cars but car parts. Put a tariff on car parts, and even the first-round effect on jobs is uncertain: maybe domestic parts producers will add workers, but you\u2019ve raised costs and reduced competitiveness for downstream producers, who will shrink their operations.So in today\u2019s world, smart trade warriors \u2013 if such people exist \u2013 would focus their tariffs on final goods, so as to avoid raising costs for downstream producers of domestic goods. True, this would amount to a more or less direct tax on consumers; but if you\u2019re afraid to impose any burden on consumers, you really shouldn\u2019t be getting into a trade war in the first place.Is there a strategy here? It\u2019s hard to see one. There\u2019s certainly no hint that the tariffs were designed to pressure China into accepting U.S. demands, since nobody can even figure out what, exactly, Trump wants from China in the first place.Except for steel and aluminum, Canada\u2019s retaliation seemingly attempts to avoid messing up its engagement in North American supply chains. In broad terms, Canada is not targeting imports of American capital equipment or intermediate inputs, focusing instead on final goods.And like China, Canada is clearly trying to inflict maximum political damage.Trade wars aren\u2019t good or easy to win even if you know what you\u2019re trying to accomplish and have a clear strategy for getting there. What\u2019s notable about the Trump tariffs, however, is that they\u2019re so self-destructive.[M]any District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy. Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity.So Trump and company don\u2019t actually have a plan to win this trade war. They may, however, have stumbled onto a strategy that will lose it even more decisively than one might have expected.Advertisement"}

The United States economy keeps adding jobs at a healthy clip. What could surprise investors about the monthly jobs report to be issued on Friday?There\u2019s always President Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.The remark, posted about an hour before the report on May hiring was released, did not indicate what the data would show, but Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to draw attention to the report was noticed by the community of traders who obsess over that data.

{"Headline": "\u2018No Poach\u2019 Deals for Fast-Food Workers Face Scrutiny by States", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAttorneys general in 10 states are moving to investigate whether a clause in fast-food franchise agreements is preventing workers from switching jobs, locking them into low-paying positions and, some economists say, contributing to widespread wage stagnation in the United States.The restrictions, often referred to as no-poach clauses, do not stop workers from switching from, say, an Arby\u2019s store to a Wendy\u2019s, but can keep an employee of one Arby\u2019s location from taking a job at another.Although many types of franchise businesses impose such clauses, they may be most common in the restaurant industry, one of the largest employers in the United States. The fast-food sector, in particular, relies overwhelmingly on independently owned and operated franchise stores.\u201cBy limiting potential job opportunities, these agreements may restrict employees\u2019 ability to improve their earning potential and the economic security of their families,\u201d the attorneys general wrote in their letter. They added that the agreements also hurt franchisees by restricting whom they could hire.Unlike noncompete clauses, which a person may sign as part of an employment contract, no-poach clauses are buried in contracts between the chains and franchisees, which are not obligated to tell workers about the provisions. Workers may not know they are subject to the restrictions until they try to take another job.\u201cWhat we worry is that workers aren\u2019t even told,\u201d said Cynthia Mark, the chief of the fair labor division of the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office, which is leading the inquiry. Ms. Mark recalled speaking with a McDonald\u2019s worker who told of being blocked from accepting a higher-paying job at a different McDonald\u2019s franchise because of a no-poach provision.McDonald\u2019s, the country\u2019s largest fast-food chain by revenue, removed the provisions from its agreements with franchisees last year.Proponents of the restrictions argue that they protect restaurants\u2019 investments in training in an industry where employee turnover is high.Fast-food restaurants have generated more jobs than nearly any other sector since the recession. About 4.5 million people work at so-called limited service restaurants, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.No-poach clauses came under particular scrutiny last year after two prominent economists at Princeton University published a paper in which they argued that the restrictions appeared to exist chiefly to limit competition and turnover, potentially affecting pay in the process.The other restaurants targeted in the inquiry are Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Little Caesars, Panera Bread, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.In separate statements, representatives of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Wendy\u2019s said the companies did not restrict hiring among franchisees.According to financial disclosure filings, both companies do, however, impose some restrictions on hiring between franchisees and the corporate entity. The restrictions probably affect far fewer workers.The other restaurant companies targeted by the attorneys general did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The other states involved in the action are Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scott Pruitt, Fallen E.P.A. Chief, May Rise Again in Oklahoma", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBROKEN ARROW, Okla. \u2014 Scott Pruitt\u2019s brief, tumultuous tenure as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency has left him disgraced in the eyes of many in Washington and across the country. But it may not have done him much harm in his home state.Though a comeback for Mr. Pruitt is far from assured, some liberals and conservatives in Oklahoma agree he could engineer one in this oil- and gas-dependent state where he used to be attorney general. His hard-line anti-regulatory message remains popular here, and many of his supporters consider the spreading plume of scandal from his time at the E.P.A. the product of unfair liberal persecution.\u201cI don\u2019t judge him,\u201d said Ron Bracken, 59, a salesman and a supporter of President Trump, while sitting Sunday morning in the cafe of the megachurch that Mr. Pruitt has attended for decades.Mr. Bracken conceded that perhaps there had been some wrongdoing on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s watch while in Washington. But he was not ready to condemn Mr. Pruitt based on news media reports, which he said had become partisan and untrustworthy: \u201cIt\u2019s probably not as bad as they say. If you\u2019re a Republican, you\u2019ve got a mark on your back.\u201dIt is not clear whether Mr. Pruitt, 50, and his family will return to Tulsa, where he attended law school, practiced law and owns a home in a neighborhood south of downtown that has large residences and wide green lawns. A lawyer for Mr. Pruitt did not respond to questions on Sunday.If he does return, he would probably need to find a job. He would also likely find many people who have cheered the leading role he took in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to drastically roll back environmental rules that affect the oil and gas industry.\u201cWhatever Scott Pruitt\u2019s problems, whether they were self-inflicted or not, it really doesn\u2019t matter, in my view, because his approach was correct, and that needs to continue,\u201d said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., an oil executive and former mayor of Tulsa. \u201cNow, how Scott will be welcomed back in Tulsa, back in Oklahoma, that will be O.K.\u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u2019 necessarily. But I think he\u2019s been seen as a person who tried hard, was pretty successful, and got beat up pretty bad.\u201dMr. Pruitt celebrated that kind of frontier capitalism when he ran for attorney general in 2010. \u201cI love the pioneering spirit of our state,\u201d he said in a campaign video.And in a signal of his antipathy for environmental regulations, he said that government \u201cis not our master, it\u2019s our servant.\u201dSoon after winning election, he disbanded an environmental protection unit in the attorney general\u2019s office, according to Johnson Grimm-Bridgwater, director of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club. Mr. Pruitt also established a \u201cfederalism unit,\u201d to which he said he would assign state lawyers \u201cto wake up each day and to go to bed each night thinking about ways they could push back against Washington.\u201dMr. Pruitt became a hero to conservatives of both modest and ample means. Lawrence Zezima, 25, a conservative gun shop owner in Broken Arrow, a Tulsa suburb, said on Saturday that many Oklahomans would consider Mr. Pruitt\u2019s problems with the Washington establishment a well-earned badge of honor \u2014 not a blot on his reputation.\u201cI don\u2019t see how he doesn\u2019t have a chance\u201d to win a future statewide office, Mr. Zezima said.Noel Runyan, 31, a liberal-leaning high school social studies teacher, agreed. Mr. Pruitt has portrayed himself as a victim of liberal enemies, he said, and \u201ca lot of the political culture in this state depends on that sense of martyrdom.\u201dBut in the meantime, some important Republican leaders in Oklahoma have rallied to his side. \u201cI think Oklahomans still love him, support him and trust him,\u201d Pam Pollard, the state party chairwoman, told The Associated Press after his resignation. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him the opportunity to tell his side of the story.\u201dCarl Curtis, 59, a retired teacher who was walking in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s neighborhood on Saturday morning, said Mr. Pruitt would probably have a chance for political rebirth, if only because Republicans now seem to rally around their politicians regardless of ethical failings. \u201cLook at Trump, what he\u2019s gotten away with, and they\u2019re sticking with him,\u201d said Mr. Curtis, a Democrat.There is some talk in Oklahoma that if Mr. Inhofe retires \u2014 he is 83, and his term runs through 2020 \u2014 Mr. Pruitt could run to fill his seat.The challenge for him in such a race would be the many other ambitious anti-regulation Republicans who would not be burdened, as he has been, with months of negative headlines and late-night TV ridicule.\u201cIf he decides to run for something again, he\u2019s going to confront a relatively young opponent, or group of opponents, who just won\u2019t have his baggage,\u201d said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma.Still, Mr. Gaddie said, Mr. Pruitt has proved to be a skilled and adaptable politician. Even after his ignominious retreat from Washington, he holds a certain sway with Oklahoma voters like Kelly Coday.Mr. Coday, 52, considers himself a conservative Democrat. He voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and for Mr. Trump four years later. The latter vote came, he said, in a moment of fear: The company he was working for, which supplies nuts, bolts and fasteners to the oil and gas industry, was laying off workers, and Mr. Trump was saying he would help.Now, Mr. Coday said, he has soured on Mr. Trump and faulted Mr. Pruitt for his ethical lapses, saying \u201che got caught and he shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201dBut the economy is good, he said, and it seems as though everyone in Washington is up to some kind of nonsense.Would Mr. Coday vote for Mr. Pruitt if he ran for office?\u201cI\u2019d give him a look,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "OpinionIn the 1990s, kid-centered politics was successful, if not transformational. It can offer the beginnings of an agenda for progressive renewal. Supported byMr. Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.For years, I\u2019ve held onto a memo that a professional mentor gave me around 1990, a typewritten document by the pollster Stanley Greenberg with the title \u201cKids as Politics.\u201d Mr. Greenberg, who has shown the sharpest understanding of traditionally Democratic voters drawn to the appeal of Ronald Reagan then or Donald Trump today, argued that a political agenda centered on children could not only improve kids\u2019 lives but also open the door to a broader liberalism and to Democrats more generally; kid-centered politics would help Americans \u201crediscover government.\u201dPolitics centered on children went beyond a few federal programs. \u201cWhen candidates talk about kids,\u201d Mr. Greenberg wrote, \u201cthey are talking about the fundamental economic and social terrain on which Democrats must run.\u201dWhether Democrats choose the path or not, children are likely to be at the center of political fights in 2018 and beyond.A focus on children could even be, and was, compatible with the sort of business-friendly and Wall Street-friendly politics that Democrats adopted in the Clinton era \u2014 the very brand of politics many young Democrats are eager to relegate to the past. Democrats of the current era, including most of the prospective 2020 presidential candidates, are unlikely to be satisfied with a political language that focuses mainly on children. They\u2019re on to bigger ideas that get to the core of the economy and fairness, like a job guarantee or universal basic income. Even universal child care seems to have slipped from the agenda.There\u2019s also a dangerous strain of kids-first politics, one that focuses on the relative benefits of programs for the elderly and disabled, Social Security and Medicare, compared with those for kids. That makes sense if the only resources to increase benefits for kids could come from those programs rather than, for example, closing the tax loopholes for private equity.The role of women in the current Democratic revival is related to the new opportunity to put kids at the center of the agenda. Yet kids\u2019 politics is not limited to women. As men play a larger role in caregiving, kids are, as Mr. Greenberg promised, a universal value.The success of \u201ckids as politics\u201d in the 1990s and the power of children as a political theme today can still offer the beginnings of an agenda for progressive renewal. The lesson to take from the previous round is that children don\u2019t automatically open the doors to a rediscovery of active government or a robust social safety net. The challenge today is to take the next step, to show how protecting kids and giving them a sound start in life requires more than just government spending programs but a real reassessment of old assumptions about the economy and how all families can share in its benefits.

But the country\u2019s huge demand for oil and animal feed makes it tough to stop importing overnight.Supported byXIAOWUSILI, China \u2014 For all its economic might, China hasn\u2019t been able to solve a crucial problem.Soybeans. It just can\u2019t grow enough of them.That could blunt the impact of one of the biggest weapons the country wields in a trade fight with the United States.Still, soy-producing states like Iowa and Illinois might not feel the tariffs\u2019 impact right away. China buys so much soy from the United States \u2014 $14 billion last year \u2014 that it can hardly switch to new suppliers overnight. Foreign-grown soybeans are a key source both of low-cost protein for feeding livestock and of cooking oil for Chinese kitchens.China is pressing its own farmers to grow more. But the math is daunting, and the obstacles are formidable.Just ask Cao Xiumin. For the past 16 years, she has been growing corn and soybeans on a couple of acres near Xiaowusili, a village of about 600 people on China\u2019s northeastern rim.Over all, she is not producing much more today than she was a decade ago. Her fields are small and not irrigated. The new, supposedly higher-yielding seeds promoted by the government are not much better than the older varieties, she says.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any difference at all,\u201d Ms. Cao said on a sweltering afternoon last week.Farm goods could be a big weakness for China should the trade conflict with the United States turn into an all-out brawl.China\u2019s increasingly wealthy people want more and better food on their plates. But the country\u2019s farms are generally too small and underdeveloped to keep up.This spring, after the Chinese government first proposed retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans, it got busy trying to dampen the potential blow to 1.4 billion stomachs.Word of the new subsidies spread quickly on the social media app WeChat. And soon, many farmers were returning corn seeds and fertilizer they had already bought and planting soy instead.With all the government support, Guo Qiang, a 35-year-old farmer in the village of Dawusili, said that he would love to grow only soybeans, and no corn, on his family\u2019s 50 acres. But his farm cooperative requires that members rotate their crops to keep the soil healthy.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for these policies, I would obviously grow more soybeans,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cEspecially with these big things happening between China and America \u2014 this trade war and whatever \u2014 I think the prospects are much better for soy than for corn.\u201dEven so, China would need to dedicate a huge fraction of the entire nation\u2019s farmland \u2014 between a quarter and a third, by various estimates \u2014 to soy if it wanted to be self-sufficient.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t grow them even if the government allowed it,\u201d said Gai Yongfeng, the head of the Jiaxing farm cooperative in Dawusili. \u201cThey\u2019re bad for the soil. After you\u2019ve grown them somewhere, nothing else will grow there. That\u2019s what everyone says.\u201dAround Heihe, some growers are trying to modernize in other ways.Hou Wenlin started the Linfeng Modern Agricultural Specialty Cooperative in 2014. He does not believe that China will be able to replace soy imports entirely.\u201cThere\u2019s no point,\u201d Mr. Hou said. \u201cIt just can\u2019t be done.\u201dHe does, however, believe that China can grow soybeans more scientifically. In one of his cooperative\u2019s fields, the soy grows in neat rows that are spaced farther apart to keep the plants at the right temperature and moisture. Each season, he plants a number of different types of seeds to understand how each performs. He has two drones for spraying pesticide.Modern farming is expensive, however. And in Mr. Hou\u2019s case, it involves a secret weapon: American technology.In front of the cooperative\u2019s office is a yard full of bright-green John Deere farm machines, which Mr. Hou buys with the help of government subsidies. Chinese machinery is cheaper but more prone to breakdowns, he says.Even some of the fertilizer Mr. Hou uses comes from the United States.The Chinese equivalents are better now than they used to be. Earlier, though, there was something that was commonly said, according to Mr. Hou, among farmers around here who knew the chemical name of one of the most widely used plant foods:\u201cWe rely first on the heavens,\u201d the saying went. \u201cWe rely second on American diammonium phosphate.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.

{"Headline": "Why NATO Matters", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe allies are looking with dread to this week\u2019s summit as President Trump continues his campaign to undermine a decades-old partnership.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Born after World War II, NATO linked America and Europe not just in a mutual defense pledge but in advancing democratic governance, the rule of law, civil and human rights, and an increasingly open international economy. The alliance was the core of an American-led liberal world order that extended to Asia and relied on a web of international institutions, including the United Nations and the World Bank. American military protection gave the allies space to develop their economies and pluralistic societies. Despite compromises and occasional failures, the experiment was broadly successful. Yet NATO is being weakened from within \u2014 by members\u2019 failure to spend enough on defense; by the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; and perhaps most of all, by President Trump, who seems to prefer President Vladimir Putin of Russia to America\u2019s European allies.NATO has always depended on leadership from the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy and most lethal military power. Mr. Trump not only doesn\u2019t want to lead the West, he has denigrated the alliance, bullied its leaders and accused NATO and the European Union of exploiting American largess. \u201cWe\u2019re the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019ll see NATO and I\u2019ll tell NATO, \u2018You\u2019ve got to start paying your bills.\u2019\u201dBut NATO is not a golf club, and money, the only thing Mr. Trump prizes, is just one, narrow measure of the costs and benefits of belonging. This president has shown no understanding of the power of partnership, and the reciprocal nature of its bonds, in an alliance that stands for something far bigger than paying your dues on time. Mr. Trump is burning up all the credit the United States has accrued with our allies across decades by attacking the basis of this alliance, if not the very idea of any alliance \u2014 thus, deliberately or not, doing the bidding of Mr. Putin in his quest to divide the West. \u201cNATO can withstand four years under Trump,\u201d one former NATO ambassador said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll withstand eight.\u201d Given the legacy of Republican support for national security and democratic allies, one might expect that Republican congressional leaders would speak up. But, cowering before Mr. Trump, they have been virtually silent as he has undermined America\u2019s alliances.Sooner rather than later, NATO is also going to have to decide what to do with Turkey and the other countries that are eroding the fabric of the alliance by repudiating democratic principles.At this week\u2019s gathering, the result that matters most is a firm and convincing commitment to a strong NATO, ready to contribute to stability today, and to adapt to future challenges. With no coherent vision of his own to make Americans, and democracy generally, more secure in a world without NATO, Mr. Trump would do well to make that commitment, and honor the friends we have.

{"Headline": "Can You Guess These Three Surprising Energy Trends?", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "Advertisement\nPeople often notice big, sudden price changes \u2014 like, say, when an avocado shortage sends the cost spiraling up at their local grocery. It can be harder to keep track of what happens to the cost of an essential product or service over the course of years.There has been an intense public debate about energy prices, in particular, and whether efforts to cut emissions of greenhouse gases would send the cost of electricity soaring. It\u2019s time to check in on what has happened \u2014 whether those costs have changed in the way critics and advocates for clean energy had predicted.Conservative politicians, energy executives and others regularly play down the risks posed by climate change and argue that emission reductions would lead to job losses and slower economic growth.But those who support renewable energy said those sources would become cheaper over time as more wind farms and solar panels came on line. So, what really happened?Unsurprisingly, health care, cable TV and many other services Americans use regularly have become more expensive over the last 10 years. But that is not true of electricity \u2014 an essential service.Change in prices since 2007, adjusted for inflation40%Tuition20Rent0ApparelElectricity-17%\u201320Wirelessservice\u2013402007200820092010201120122013201420152016201740%Tuition20Rent0ApparelElectricity\u201320Wirelessservice\u2013402007\u201809\u201811\u201813\u201815\u201817In addition to warnings about the perils to the economy of aggressive climate policy from conservatives, we have also heard claims that wind and solar energy were expensive baubles that could not compete with fossil fuels without subsidies. Recent experience shows that people can, in fact, reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases without damaging the economy.Texas is an oil-rich state that nobody would consider in thrall to idealistic environmentalists. So how has the relative contribution of various energy sources to the state\u2019s electricity market changed over the past decade? Take a guess.Parts of Texas have lots of wind, which is why developers have put up so many turbines. The state also gets lots of sun, which is why many experts think that solar panels will, over time, become another major source of energy there. Last year, solar panels contributed less than 1 percent of the electricity generated in Texas.Texas net electricity generation, thousand megawatt-hoursNaturalGas200k150kCoal100kWind50kNuclearOther020072008200920102011201220132014201520162017200kNaturalGas150kCoal100kWind50kNuclearOther02007\u201809\u201811\u201813\u201815\u201817Some conservatives and industry executives have argued that the policies of President Obama amounted to a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Utilities are indeed using much less coal, but their decisions have primarily been driven by a drop in the price of natural gas, not Obama-era policies. How much has the use of gas changed over the last decade? Take a guess.There are many reasons why electricity prices have been so stable. Among the most important ones is the boom in shale gas production, which led to a dramatic drop in the price of gas. As a result, many electric utilities converted to natural gas, which generates about half the emissions of coal, over the last two decades. While some environmentalists oppose hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the practice, when paired with regulations to limit its impact on ground water and air, can be an important part of a transition to cleaner fuels.Natural gas price, dollars per million B.T.U.$105$2.800200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018$105$2.800200720092011201320152017The fact that the United States has been able to reduce emissions from the power sector while keeping prices low shows that the world can address climate change by ushering in an era of abundant, affordable and clean energy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $20 Billion Question for Guyana", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "This largely underdeveloped country on South America\u2019s northern Atlantic coast is the unlikely setting for the world\u2019s next big oil boom. But is it ready to handle the riches?Supported byGEORGETOWN, Guyana \u2014 Guyana is a vast, watery wilderness with only three paved highways. There are a few dirt roads between villages that sit on stilts along rivers snaking through the rain forest. Children in remote areas go to school in dugout canoes, and play naked in the muggy heat. Hugging the coast are musty clapboard towns like Georgetown, the capital, which seems forgotten by time, honeycombed with canals first built by Dutch settlers and African slaves. The power grid is so unreliable that blackouts are a regular plague in the cities, while in much of the countryside there is no electricity at all.If all goes well, one of the poorest countries in South America could become one of the wealthiest. Suddenly the talk of Georgetown is a proposed sovereign wealth fund to manage all the money, as if this were a Persian Gulf sheikhdom.But there are obstacles. If history is any guide, countries that discover oil often waste their opportunity, as the resource blends seamlessly with corruption. Countries with weak political institutions like Guyana are especially vulnerable.\u201cYou have an alignment of money and power in the hands of the state, so the party in power controls the resources,\u201d said Floyd Haynes, a Guyanese-born finance professor who is a consultant to Business Ministry. \u201cAnd the money is usually squandered, misapplied or downright stolen.\u2019\u2019Senior government officials here have little experience regulating a big oil industry or negotiating with international companies. The civil service is corrupt, and the private sector is slow to innovate, businessmen and aides to senior officials acknowledge.Still, there is cautious optimism. \u201cWe see this oil discovery as almost like providence,\u201d said Raphael Trotman, the natural resources minister. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given a second chance to get things right.\u201dThe first chance was independence from Britain in 1966, and that chance was blown. A plague of ethnic tribal politics has produced a fragile state with an economy propelled by drug trafficking, money-laundering, and gold and diamond smuggling. A vast majority of college-educated youths emigrate to the United States or Canada, while those who stay behind experience high rates of H.I.V. infection, crime and suicide.\u201cThe challenges are enormous and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d said Lars Mangal, president of Totaltec Oilfield Services, a Guyanese company seeking to train local workers in safety and basic oil operations. \u201cWe have to overcome nepotism, entitlements, corruption, cynicism and skepticism.\u201d\u201cWhen we have big projects, we hire foreign companies who bring their own workers,\u201d said Khemraj Dhaneshrie, a young chemist at the Leonora estate sugar mill. Mr. Dhaneshrie is typically skeptical about his government\u2019s ability to oversee foreign operations after Guyana\u2019s long experience of opportunistic Chinese investment. He noted that the Chinese financed and built an enormous factory in 2009 to rescue the sugar industry, but it turned out to be a $181 million boondoggle. Colorful Hindu monuments tower over Guyana\u2019s rice fields, a reminder of the cultural distance between the country and its Latin American neighbors. It is English speaking because of the legacy of British rule, and its two biggest ethnic groups are Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese \u2014 the descendants of slaves from Africa and of indentured servants brought from the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.Over the last 37 years working for ExxonMobil, Mr. McGehee has taken his black cowboy boots, silver belt buckle and Texas A&M class ring into the oil fields of Angola, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea. In all those places, oil wealth has risen to the top, only to leave the poor behind. Last year, for example, a Paris criminal court convicted the vice president of Equatorial Guinea of money-laundering and embezzling more than $100 million.But as Mr. McGehee monitored operations aboard the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship on a recent day, he insisted that Guyana could be different. \u201cIf the government manages the resource right, every Guyanese should benefit with better schools, better health facilities, better roads,\u201d Mr. McGehee said.That is no small \u201cif.\u201d Guyanese need look no further than neighboring Venezuela to see a failed state where the world\u2019s largest oil reserves have not prevented hunger, shortages of medicine and hyperinflation from producing widespread misery. Nearby Trinidad and Tobago offers another example of how countries dependent on oil can neglect traditional industries and then suffer severe economic shocks when crude and natural gas prices fall. Others warn of the \u201cDutch disease,\u201d a phenomenon so labeled in the 1970s after a natural gas boom sapped the strength of manufacturing in the Netherlands. Nations that contract the disease from a sudden influx of mineral money typically suffer a surge of inflation, while labor from farming and other traditional professions is drawn to the higher-paying oil sector. Thus, wealth becomes more concentrated.But dispiriting examples of wasted opportunity abound. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about the negatives,\u201d Prime Minister Moses V. Nagamootoo said.But she also sees risks in these new ventures. More affluent Guyanese may turn away from the sports uniforms she already makes to buy name brands like Nike and Adidas, she said, and she is concerned that food prices will rise.\u201cCheck out the Trinidad economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought oil was the best thing since sliced bread, and they spent Sunday to Sunday. They stopped producing and imported everything with oil money. It could happen here.\u201dBefore the recent breakthrough, various oil companies had drilled more than 40 wells off Guyana and neighboring Suriname since the 1960s. All were dry holes or otherwise not economically promising. But as oil prices rose a few years ago, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell decided to take another look. (Shell eventually dropped out of the partnership.)Exxon\u2019s top geoscientist on the scene was Kerry Moreland, an Oklahoman whose family has been in oil for three generations. Ms. Moreland toyed with becoming a professional bowler and had interned as a tornado chaser for a Tulsa television station before going to work for Exxon and traveling the world in search of new fields. She pinpointed on the map where the first deepwater well, named Liza-1, should be drilled.Recalling the day three years ago when she decided to duck out of some business meetings in Georgetown to visit the drilling platform, she said there was no more than a 20 percent chance that a meaningful amount of oil would burst out from three miles below the ocean bottom. As luck would have it, just as her helicopter landed on the platform, the drill bit penetrated the oil reservoir. She went to the control room as the first data from the wells showed promising signs of hydrocarbons. When rock fragments came to the surface a few hours later, they were dripping with oil.There\u2019s a lot at stake for Exxon in Guyana.Darren Woods, the company\u2019s chief executive, has a plan to reverse company fortunes, and Guyana is a big part of it.Leading a consortium that includes Hess and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Exxon is making an effort here that is nothing if not ambitious. Within three years of its big first discovery, it has begun drilling the first of 17 wells that will start yielding oil in 2020, with a floating production, storage and offloading vessel able to handle 120,000 barrels a day. And that is just the first phase.Another floating vessel, with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day, is planned, and a third vessel is being considered. In all, 500,000 barrels a day could be produced by sometime in the next decade \u2014 the equivalent of Ecuador\u2019s national output. (Repsol of Spain, Tullow Oil of Britain and other companies are exploring, too.)That produces nothing but excitement for the 60 Guyanese workers on the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship, who have typically seen their incomes soar.Gorshum Inniss, a 25-year-old roustabout with an easy smile and flashing dark eyes, is working on a crane crew lifting casing pipe for new wells, doubling what he earned working on a tugboat. He said he now had enough money to visit his parents and younger brother in New York and planned to build a house for him and his daughter.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of the pioneers in this big moment for Guyana,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Guyana as the new Middle East.\u201dNot far from the turbulent Venezuelan border, there is a quiet stretch of coastline, pounded by surf, known as Shell Beach because its sand is made of tiny crushed seashells that make it feel like sawdust. Several endangered species of turtles come to nest at night. Once hunted for food, they are jealously guarded from poachers by residents who make a living fishing and selling coconuts.Audley James, a former turtle hunter who makes necklaces out of beads and coconut shells, remembers when Trinidadian environmental consultants representing Repsol came six years ago to give two days of spill-response training.The Trinidadians taught the residents how to lay temporary floating barriers to protect the beach from an oil spill, and gave them training certificates that look like diplomas. But there has been no further training that might prepare them for what is now a much less theoretical hazard. \u201cPlenty of us don\u2019t understand what is going on,\u201d Mr. James said.Environmentalists are worried that oil will forestall development of renewable energy and that the government and oil companies are not fully prepared to prevent a possible spill.\u201cIt\u2019s two years before first oil, and we don\u2019t have a national oil spill contingency plan,\u201d said Annette Arjoon-Martins, president of the Guyana Marine Conservation Society. \u201cWe have our hands in the mouth of a jaguar.\u201dMs. Arjoon-Martins said the government\u2019s agreement with Exxon did not specify in enough detail the company\u2019s responsibilities in case of a spill. Government officials disagreed, saying the country\u2019s laws would hold the company fully liable.Exxon executives say the company is doing everything possible to minimize the dangers of a spill disaster. The company has skimmers and oil booms on hand to collect errant oil, and it has applied to the government to use chemical dispersants in an emergency to break up any spilled oil. They say Guyana is close enough to the Gulf of Mexico to bring in plenty of help in an emergency.Local oil executives say one obstacle to overcome is a lackadaisical attitude toward safety among Guyanese workers, who frequently arrive at their construction and wharf jobs in flip-flops and sometimes use their hard hats as soup bowls. That is something Exxon and other companies are working to change with courses and other training that teach workers to be careful, not only for their own safety but also to safeguard the fragile marine environment. \u201cUse your heads before you use your hands,\u201d he told the room full of Guyanese and American workers. He got an ovation and smiled proudly.To visit the most senior oil regulator in Georgetown, one needs to climb an exterior staircase of warped wood that could sorely use a fresh coat of paint.Mr. Dennison has a computer by his desk, from which he could consult data gathered by Exxon drill ships, though he said he had yet to do so. \u201cWe\u2019re in transition,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.\u2019\u2019There are a few signs of progress. \u201cI see a lot of red flags,\u201d said Mr. Mangal, who shuttles between Guyana and his home in Houston. \u201cWe cannot allow the Guyanese industry to be built around this shabby foundation of corruption.\u201dThere are other signs of trouble.Foreign development bank advisers have told the government that legislation to create a sovereign wealth fund to invest the royalties and taxes coming to the government lacks sufficient regulatory controls to avert corruption. The legislation is now in limbo. Mr. Granger\u2019s energy department has not gotten off the ground, and a bill to set up the petroleum commission is stuck in the National Assembly.That leaves Mr. Dennison and his commission in charge of regulation. He said he and everyone in the government felt pressure to get things right. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Consumers Can Resist Companies\u2019 Market Power", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewA basic rule of economics is that the price depends on how willing consumers are to buy something else.The less consumers pay attention when they buy \u2014 and the more they just follow a set shopping pattern \u2014 the greater the market power possessed by the seller, and the more that seller can charge.Modern companies know this very well, and they do what they can to improve their advantages over unwary consumers.I\u2019ve unwittingly been caught in consumer traps myself.About 15 years ago, for example, my wife and I decided to send out holiday cards using an online photo service rather than writing them out and sending them by hand. We picked Shutterfly, which did a good job. And we\u2019re still using it, largely because after we had typed 100 addresses into the Shutterfly site, it would have taken a heck of a deal to persuaded us to type them in again somewhere else.So the truth is we haven\u2019t bothered to shop around much. We\u2019ve just stuck with Shutterfly, and that is undoubtedly costing us money.Economists have thought a lot about markets like the one exemplified by Shutterfly \u2014 those with significant \u201cswitching costs\u201d and \u201clock-in effects.\u201dIn such markets, companies should be extremely generous up front trying to earn your business, knowing you will be stuck with them. And, in theory, you will think about their future market power carefully when you first decide whether to sign up. That\u2019s what a rational, forward-looking consumer should do.But that theory might not describe the actual marketplace that well. When my wife and I chose Shutterfly, we didn\u2019t really think about what competitors might exist 14 years later or how the prices might change once they got us signed up in 2004.We probably should have thought about all of that, realizing that, down the road, cloud storage prices would become immensely cheaper and we could get better deals if we maintained our flexibility. Instead, we bumbled our way into giving a company the power to monopolize us.That kind of thing happens a lot these days. People make quick shopping decisions that have long-term consequences.Big companies know that the more convenient they make their product or service, the less you will shop around and the more market power they will have. Plus they\u2019ve gotten good at tailoring products to certain consumers to get them to give up comparison shopping altogether.The researchers (who are, incidentally, my friends and colleagues) found that while companies sell many more products than before, as individuals we are increasingly buying only our one favored product in a given category. In other words, we are not comparison shopping or forcing companies to compete for business.Take the case of tortilla chips. Fifteen years ago, Tostitos dominated all other chip makers, but sometimes consumers would buy Mission chips or a local brand if they were cheaper or the mood struck them.Today, Tostitos is still the dominant brand but has expanded into 13 specialized varieties like Tostitos Hint of Lime, Tostitos Bite Size and Tostitos Multigrain. It also has five party sizes, four Simply Tostitos organic or sea-salted varieties and three different Tostitos Cantina styles.Today, the same consumer tends to go into the store looking just to buy one of the specialized varieties of Tostitos: She really loves Hint of Lime or is intent on buying Tostitos Scoops (chips in the shape of tiny taco bowls). People don\u2019t try alternatives the way they used to. They act as if they are locked in.But this innovation comes with a downside. The more specific consumer tastes get, the more the companies can exploit their ability to cater to those tastes without competition. The Neiman and Vavra study shows exactly what you would expect: The more specialized the demand, the higher the prices people pay and the greater the market power possessed by a company.Creating specialized demand is an intriguing way of locking customers into a product. Another method is selling a discount subscription \u2014 cable, magazines, pest control \u2014 that automatically renews at a higher price. Consumers have to remember and make the effort to cancel if they want to shop around. Companies offer convenience, but they make the consumers pay for it.But even as we debate these larger notions, let us not forget the ways in which we, consumers at the very base of the economy, increase corporate market power with the ways we shop.That isn\u2019t meant to deny the importance of conventional macroeconomic factors in the rise of market power. And it certainly isn\u2019t meant to play down the role that could be played by government policy like more aggressive antitrust enforcement, consumer protection or regulation.But beyond the effects of government or technology or globalization, individual choices matter. Companies don\u2019t want you to comparison shop, which could force them to compete for your business. They want you to develop regular shopping habits. The more people do that, the higher the prices everyone will pay.I try to remember that when I shop now. I remind myself not to just buy the first thing listed on a website or displayed on the rack at the checkout aisle. When I take a ride-hailing service, I will check both Uber and Lyft before choosing. Sometimes I check the price of things online without logging in or shift my browser to private mode to see if a company is offering better deals to new customers.For an individual shopper, these actions are a bit of a pain, and they may not do much to improve matters over all. But if enough people behave this way \u2014 keeping companies guessing and making them work for our business \u2014 these small acts of consumer resistance can help keep corporate market power in check.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.

{"Headline": "If Ronaldo Can\u2019t Beat Uruguay, the Least He Can Do Is Pay Taxes", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Portuguese soccer star\u2019s financial maneuvers can tell us a lot about the world\u2019s failure to adapt to globalization. Mr. Zucman is an economist.In both cases, the Spanish authorities found the players guilty of dodging taxes on the income derived from their image rights. These rights \u2014 which they, like many other professional athletes, had transferred to shell companies in exotic tax havens \u2014 account for a large part of their income. For the top players on the planet, such rights can amount to many millions of dollars a year. That some of the world\u2019s most famous athletes could defraud tax authorities seems at first incomprehensible: They should know that their tax returns will be closely scrutinized, and being labeled tax evaders certainly does not enhance the value of their image or their popularity with fans. Why should we care about Ronaldo\u2019s income and tax affairs? Because they illustrate our collective failure to adapt to globalization, and the lessons we can draw from this example extend beyond soccer to the rest of society.But we can fix this. We\u2019re often told that taxing the most successful among us is impossible or counterproductive. But in fact, professional sports often shows how misguided this argument is.Once tax evasion was curbed, governments could tax top incomes at higher rates, for the greater good. And don\u2019t believe anyone who says this would harm the economy \u2014 these claims usually don\u2019t make much sense. Look no further than Ronaldo: His image would still be as valuable to Nike if he had to pay more in taxes, and it does not cost him much to provide it \u2014 so nothing bad would happen if he had to pay more. With a lower after-tax income, he would still score as many goals. You don\u2019t hurt anyone when you tax the Ronaldos of the world \u2014 you just make it possible for everyone to gain when they do.The United States isn\u2019t typically known for its redistributive tax policies nowadays, but even Americans still understand this basic truth: Sky-high incomes for star athletes are socially useless. That\u2019s why American sport leagues have either salary caps (as in the N.F.L.) or luxury taxes (as in the N.B.A.) that severely limit how much teams can spend on players. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Plan Collides With Farm Tradition in Pacific Northwest", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byELLENSBURG, Wash. \u2014 When a company from Seattle came calling, wanting to lease some land on Jeff and Jackie Brunson\u2019s 1,000-acre hay and oat farm for a solar energy project, they jumped at the idea, and the prospect of receiving regular rent checks.They did not anticipate the blowback \u2014 snarky texts, phone calls from neighbors, and county meetings where support for solar was scant.Critics said the project would remove too much land from agricultural production in central Washington. If approved by regulators, it would be one of the biggest solar generators ever built in the state, with five large arrays spread around the county, covering around 250 acres with sun-sucking panels.Ms. Brunson said the critics should mind their own business and respect property rights.\u201cThey want the romance of watching you farm,\u201d Ms. Brunson, 59, said. \u201cThey move into their little piece of heaven, their little three acres, or their little 20 acres, and they don\u2019t want any other changes around them.\u201d\u201cIt really makes me angry,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to pay the bills.\u201dA collision is underway in Kittitas County, a rural area on the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range southeast of Seattle, between a treasured past and a fast-arriving but uncertain future.Old divisions of geography are part of it. The political power in Washington State, and the agenda for renewable energy and much else, comes from the liberal urban expanse around Seattle, and many people in conservative rural places east of the Cascades, like Kittitas County, chafe at the imbalance. A highly competitive congressional race for an open House seat is sharpening and heightening those tensions, as candidates of both parties vie for voters in a district that defines the state\u2019s east-west divide.Solar energy is now laying bare those tensions. So is population growth. Kittitas grew faster last year in percentage terms than any other county in the state, including the booming area around Seattle. The county seat of Ellensburg, population 20,000, has been one of the 10 fastest growing small cities in the nation for the past two years, census figures show, fueled by retirees and long-distance commuters priced out of the Seattle area.But business growth in Kittitas County has not kept up, and the local unemployment rate, 4.8 percent, is higher than it was a year ago. On top of that, there is a housing squeeze. Central Washington University in Ellensburg broke enrollment records last fall with more than 12,000 students, many of whom flooded the community in search of apartments because of a shortage of rooms on campus. Home prices and rents have spiraled, bringing about a small but painful rise in homelessness and new pressure on families like that of Ayanna and Ben Nelson, who are struggling.\u201cFor us, a lot of options have turned into not many options,\u201d said Ms. Nelson, 39, who has been looking for a bigger home for her family of six. With prices rising faster than Mr. Nelson\u2019s salary as an engineering tech worker, the Nelsons say they may have to leave the state for cost reasons. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go, but just not sure if we can stay,\u201d Ms. Nelson said.Tensions over the growing population and shifting economy were already high two years ago when the solar project first came along. Fault lines quickly emerged. The area\u2019s chamber of commerce, for example, endorsed the project, while the county board of commissioners supported a moratorium on commercial solar projects on prime farmland.Opponents of the solar project have a shorthand line of attack: Seattle is pushing this.\u201cThe wind farms aren\u2019t located in the greater Seattle area, the wolves aren\u2019t located in the greater Seattle area, the grizzly bear expansion isn\u2019t slated for the Greater Seattle area, and the solar farms aren\u2019t there either,\u201d said Paul Jewell, a former county commissioner, ticking off highly debated initiatives that government officials have considered in recent years.\u201cThey\u2019re all in the rural areas,\u201d said Mr. Jewell, who opposes the solar project. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s really a disconnect there \u2014 they say \u2018yes,\u2019 and we bear the burden. They say \u2018yes,\u2019 and we pay the price.\u201dGeography aside, conservatives and liberals have lined up on both sides of the solar question. Ronald Slater, a retired contractor and a supporter of President Trump, was so eager to get solar panels on his land that he handed out business cards at a recent county meeting. Carla Tacher, who manages a fruit and vegetable stand outside Ellensburg and said she leans toward Democrats, said that more renewable energy \u2014 far easier to produce in the sunnier weather east of the Cascades than in the western half of the state \u2014 is crucial for the global climate.\u201cI\u2019m all for it,\u201d Ms. Tacher said.Broader political questions are on the horizon in November, when voters in Kittitas County will pick a successor to Dave Reichert, a seven-term Republican who is retiring. The county is a conservative anchor of the Eighth Congressional District, which extends west to more liberal suburbs of Seattle. Mr. Reichert, a right-of-center moderate on most issues, won the district in 2016 with significant support in Kittitas. But Hillary Clinton carried the district in the presidential race, as Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012, so both parties see the House seat as winnable \u2014 and crucial to their control of the next Congress.A Republican named Dino Rossi, who ran twice for governor, is his party\u2019s likely nominee, with a big fund-raising lead and an endorsement from the Washington State Farm Bureau, a powerful group that lobbies at the state capital on agricultural issues.The Democrats have a more crowded field in their Aug. 7 primary. All are newcomers to elected office, including two doctors \u2014 Kim Schrier, a pediatrician, and Shannon Hader, a former executive at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A former prosecutor, Jason Rittereiser, has made growing up in Ellensburg part of his pitch to win a divided district, but Ms. Schrier has raised more money than Mr. Rittereiser and has gained the endorsement of Emily\u2019s List, the fund-raising group that focuses on advancing Democratic women in politics.In Washington State, the geography of energy \u2014 from the hydropower projects of the 1930s through the nuclear energy era a generation later \u2014 has always been tangled up with state politics.In Ellensburg, a state agency called the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, created in 1970, is considering the application for the solar project. The council has authority to override local opinion \u2014 crucial in the nuclear era, when few communities were eager to volunteer \u2014 and to send its recommendations about energy projects to Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, who has the final word. No federal approvals or congressional action is required, so the solar issue has not emerged as an issue so far among the candidates in the Eighth District race.With a decision on the solar project expected as early as August, Mr. Inslee could affect local attitudes heading toward November, even though the project itself won\u2019t be on the ballot.His predecessor as governor, Christine Gregoire, also a Democrat, approved a wind energy project in Kittitas that many locals opposed \u2014 a decision that some people here never forgot or forgave her for making. The spinning rotor blades that now line the foothills were a first skirmish line in the battle over who controls the county\u2019s future, opponents of the solar farm said.Ms. Gregoire\u2019s Republican opponent in both of her elections, whom she defeated narrowly each time, was none other than Mr. Rossi, the front-runner now for the nomination in the Eighth District.The Brunsons, the family whose farmland is being sought for the solar project, said they were fans of Mr. Rossi then and are already committed again.\u201cDino is our man,\u201d Ms. Brunson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside China\u2019s Dystopian Dreams: A.I., Shame and Lots of Cameras", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZHENGZHOU, China \u2014 In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, a police officer wearing facial recognition glasses spotted a heroin smuggler at a train station.In Qingdao, a city famous for its German colonial heritage, cameras powered by artificial intelligence helped the police snatch two dozen criminal suspects in the midst of a big annual beer festival.In Wuhu, a fugitive murder suspect was identified by a camera as he bought food from a street vendor.With millions of cameras and billions of lines of code, China is building a high-tech authoritarian future. Beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track 1.4 billion people. It wants to assemble a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system, with crucial help from its thriving technology industry.\u201cIn the past, it was all about instinct,\u201d said Shan Jun, the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in Zhengzhou, where the heroin smuggler was caught. \u201cIf you missed something, you missed it.\u201dChina is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as a great democratizer, bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world. In China, it has brought control.In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China\u2019s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who don\u2019t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes. Already, China has an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras \u2014 four times as many as the United States.Such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications, hotel stays, train and plane trips and even car travel in some places.Even so, China\u2019s ambitions outstrip its abilities. Technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city, or even the next block over. Bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of a nationwide network.For the Communist Party, that may not matter. Far from hiding their efforts, Chinese authorities regularly state, and overstate, their capabilities. In China, even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line.Some places are further along than others. Invasive mass-surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the Uighur Muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family, according to software viewed by The New York Times.\u201cThis is potentially a totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cThe goal is algorithmic governance,\u201d he added.The intersection south of Changhong Bridge in the city of Xiangyang used to be a nightmare. Cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street.Then last summer, the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and a big, outdoor screen. Photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government I.D. numbers. People were initially excited to see their faces on the board, said Guan Yue, a spokeswoman, until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment.\u201cIf you are captured by the system and you don\u2019t see it, your neighbors or colleagues will, and they will gossip about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s too embarrassing for people to take.\u201dHis successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule. They formed a new understanding with the Chinese people. In exchange for political impotence, they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich.It worked. Censorship and police powers remained strong, but China\u2019s people still found more freedom. That new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth.Today, that unwritten agreement is breaking down.China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t growing at the same pace. It suffers from a severe wealth gap. After four decades of fatter paychecks and better living, its people have higher expectations.Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, has moved to solidify his power. Changes to Chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since Mao. And he has undertaken a broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies.For support, he has turned to the Mao-era beliefs in the importance of a cult of personality and the role of the Communist Party in everyday life. Technology gives him the power to make it happen.\u201cReform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,\u201d said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China\u2019s four-decade post-Mao policy. \u201cThe current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers\u2019 money to monitor the taxpayers.\u201dGovernment contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces, clothing and even a person\u2019s gait. Experimental gadgets, like facial-recognition glasses, have begun to appear.Judging public Chinese reaction can be difficult in a country where the news media is controlled by the government. Still, so far the average Chinese citizen appears to show little concern. Erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of China\u2019s authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life. As a result, many cheer on new attempts at law and order.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest intersections in the city,\u201d said Wang Fukang, a college student who volunteered as a guard at the crosswalk in Xiangyang. \u201cIt\u2019s important that it stays safe and orderly.\u201dStart-ups often make a point of insisting their employees use their technology. In Shanghai, a company called Yitu has taken that to the extreme.The halls of its offices are dotted with cameras, looking for faces. From desk to break room to exit, employees\u2019 paths are traced on a television screen with blue dotted lines. The monitor shows their comings and goings, all day, everyday.In China, snooping is becoming big business. As the country spends heavily on surveillance, a new generation of start-ups have risen to meet the demand.Chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition. Yitu took first place in a 2017 open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the United States government\u2019s Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A number of other Chinese companies also scored well.A technology boom in China is helping the government\u2019s surveillance ambitions. In sheer scale and investment, China already rivals Silicon Valley. Between the government and eager investors, surveillance start-ups have access to plenty of money and other resources.In May, the upstart A.I. company SenseTime raised $620 million, giving it a valuation of about $4.5 billion. Yitu raised $200 million last month. Another rival, Megvii, raised $460 million from investors that included a state-backed fund created by China\u2019s top leadership.At a conference in May at an upscale hotel in Beijing, China\u2019s security-industrial complex offered its vision of the future. Companies big and small showed off facial-recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials, tech executives and investors.Private companies see big potential in China\u2019s surveillance build-out. China\u2019s public security market was valued at more than $80 billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities, said Shen Xinyang, a former Google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of Eyecool, a start-up.\u201cArtificial intelligence for public security is actually still a very insignificant portion of the whole market,\u201d he said, pointing out that most equipment currently in use was \u201cnonintelligent.\u201dMany of these businesses are already providing data to the government.Mr. Shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than 20 airports and train stations, which had helped catch 1,000 criminals. Eyecool, he said, is also handing over two million facial images each day to a burgeoning big-data police system called Skynet.At a building complex in Xiangyang, a facial-recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police\u2019s collection of photos of local residents, according to local Chinese Communist Party officials.Wen Yangli, an executive at Number 1 Community, which makes the product, said the company is at work on other applications. One would detect when crowds of people are clashing. Another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where.China\u2019s surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high-tech surveillance abroad. Yitu says it has been expanding overseas, with plans to increase business in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.At home, China is preparing its people for next-level surveillance technology. A recent state-media propaganda film called \u201cAmazing China\u201d showed off a similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use, saying it could be used for predictive policing.\u201cIf there are anomalies, the system sends an alert,\u201d a narrator says, as Chinese police officers pay a visit to an apartment with a record of erratic utility use. The film then quotes one of the officers: \u201cNo matter which corner you escape to, we\u2019ll bring you to justice.\u201dFor technology to be effective, it doesn\u2019t always have to work. Take China\u2019s facial-recognition glasses.Police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at a high-speed rail station for state media and others. They snapped photos of a policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses.But the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds. They have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications.China\u2019s national database of individuals it has flagged for watching \u2014 including suspected terrorists, criminals, drug traffickers, political activists and others \u2014 includes 20 million to 30 million people, said one technology executive who works closely with the government. That is too many people for today\u2019s facial recognition technology to parse, said the executive, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn\u2019t public.The system remains more of a digital patchwork than an all-seeing technological network. Many files still aren\u2019t digitized, and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can\u2019t be easily reconciled. Systems that police hope will someday be powered by A.I. are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old-fashioned way.Take, for example, the crosswalk in Xiangyang. The images don\u2019t appear instantaneously. The billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago, though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days. Officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people\u2019s identities.Still, Chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on a campaign to persuade the country\u2019s people that the high-tech security state is already in place.In many places, it works. At the intersection in Xiangyang, jaywalking has decreased. At the building complex where Number 1 Community\u2019s facial-recognition gate system has been installed, a problem with bike theft ceased entirely, according to building management.\u201cThe whole point is that people don\u2019t know if they\u2019re being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient,\u201d said Mr. Chorzempa, the Peterson Institute fellow.He described the approach as a panopticon, the idea that people will follow the rules precisely because they don\u2019t know whether they are being watched.In Zhengzhou, police were happy to explain how just the thought of the facial recognition glasses could get criminals to confess.Mr. Shan, the Zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief, cited the time his department grabbed a heroin smuggler. While questioning the suspect, Mr. Shan said, police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn\u2019t matter. The glasses could give them all the information they needed.\u201cBecause he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology, he confessed,\u201d said Mr. Shan, adding that the suspect had swallowed 60 small packs of heroin.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even use any interrogation techniques,\u201d Mr. Shan said. \u201cHe simply gave it all up.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Zhengzhou.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018What Does a Trucker Look Like?\u2019 It\u2019s Changing, Amid a Big Shortage", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 America\u2019s booming economy has a problem: a shortage of truck drivers.The industry \u2014 historically reliant on older, white male drivers \u2014 is facing a record shortage with an estimated 50,000 more drivers needed to meet demand, according to the American Trucking Associations. The lack of available drivers is rippling through the supply chain, causing a bottleneck of goods that is delaying deliveries and prompting some companies to increase prices.The Trump administration and the industry are trying to alleviate the problem by loosening federal rules and enticing nontraditional drivers like women, teenagers and minorities to operate big rigs.And, in a bid to recruit more drivers, many trucking companies have added perks, including signing bonuses and increased pay.While autonomous trucks may someday negate the need for drivers, trucking executives say that day is still too far-off to solve today\u2019s problem.As the global economy has strengthened, demand for trucks to move goods has outpaced the supply of drivers, resulting in freight carriers setting higher rates and companies raising prices on products, in some cases by as much as 20 percent.Darren Hawkins, the chief executive of YRC Trucking, one of the nation\u2019s largest freight carriers, said the severity of the shortage means that successfully tapping underrepresented pools of candidates is crucial.\u201cThere\u2019s an industry problem, and that is, we have to do a better job of attracting new people into the driving occupation, previous audiences we haven\u2019t reached,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cRight now the American Trucking Associations says we\u2019re 50,000 drivers short, and those numbers will continue to grow. So we\u2019ve got to open up other pieces.\u201dTrucking is already more onerous to enter than some of the industry\u2019s competitors, including retail, construction and fast food. In addition to weeks in trucking school, which can cost several thousand dollars, it often requires drivers to spend long, solitary stretches of time away from home.Facing record driver shortages, trucking companies \u201care making the adjustments because they have to,\u201d said Kevin Reid, the founder of the National Minority Trucking Association.\u201cThe industry has not focused on recruiting and retaining the next generation,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cTrucking is an industry that needs to be rebranded. There was a cool factor to trucking in the 1970s and 1980s. We don\u2019t have that now, so the question is, how are we going to reach the next generation of truckers?\u201dKristina Jackson, a 22-year-old African-American truck driver based in Raleigh, N.C., is exactly the type of person the trucking industry wants to attract. After graduating from college, she wanted a job that would allow her to travel and be financially independent. She never considered trucking until her boyfriend\u2019s father, a trucker himself, encouraged her to give it a try.A year into driving, she is constantly reminded that she\u2019s an outlier in the industry.\u201cWhen people found out I was in trucking, they were shocked because of my gender and age,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing you think of is an old white male. People say to me, \u2018You don\u2019t look like a trucker.\u2019 I say, \u2018What does a trucker look like?\u2019\u201dMs. Jackson thinks that more young people could easily be persuaded to join the industry, adding that she has personally recruited 10 of her friends in their 20s. But she thinks recruiters so far have done a poor job of showcasing the young truckers in the industry.\u201cWhen people think of truckers, they don\u2019t see our faces,\u201d Ms. Jackson said of young drivers.The measure backed by the Trump administration seeks to change that and targets high school graduates, a demographic long considered by trucking companies that has remained largely out of recruiters\u2019 reach.\u201cIf you are graduating from high school and you are not going into the military, you are not going to college, for all practical purposes, you can\u2019t go into trucking because you have to be at least 21 to drive interstate freight,\u201d said Bob Costello, the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to sit around and twiddle your thumbs.\u201d\u201cThe pilot program can benefit the public and military community in so many ways. It will benefit the public and the economy by providing well-trained, safe truck drivers,\u201d Ms. Chao said this month at an event promoting the program in Omaha, accompanied by Senator Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who is chairwoman of the Surface Transportation Committee.DeAndre Lewis, a 20-year-old college student in Austin, Tex., said he would have benefited from a program that allowed him to receive certification when he was 18. He is hopeful he can soon swap his summer jobs for driving a big rig, which would pay more.Mr. Hawkins said that lowering the driving age was just \u201cone tool in a very large toolbox,\u201d and that trucking companies would also have to reach out to women and minorities.One of the biggest marketing hurdles the industry has to overcome is tamping down the prevailing notion that the road is not an appropriate \u2014 or safe \u2014 place for women.\u201cThere\u2019s still men out there who think women shouldn\u2019t be driving trucks. They\u2019re few and far between, but they\u2019re vocal,\u201d Ms. Voie said. \u201cBut the experience has changed a lot over the past five years because carriers are trying hard to make sure women have a good experience.\u201dJahd Khalil contributed reporting from Omaha.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York and New Jersey File Suit Against Trump Tax Plan", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Four states including New York and New Jersey sued the federal government on Tuesday over a sharp reduction in the deductibility of state and local income taxes, a central part of President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, saying that the change was an \u201cunconstitutional assault\u201d on their sovereignty.On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo reiterated that criticism and rhetoric in a news conference, saying that the Republican-backed plan is an \u201cattempt to hurt Democratic states.\u201d\u201cIt is totally repugnant and hypocritical of the fundamental conservative ideology which they preach \u2014 the limited federal government, respect state rights,\u201d said the governor, a second-term Democrat seeking re-election in the fall. \u201cThis tramples on their own theory. And it is politically motivated.\u201dIt also argues that the limits on the deduction, and the potential economic damage as a result of its implementation, \u201cdeliberately seeks to compel certain states to reduce their public spending.\u201dThe suit is the most substantive salvo in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s monthslong campaign against any change in the so-called \u201cSALT deduction\u201d on state and local income taxes, as well as property taxes. Such deductions had typically been revered in states with high property taxes \u2014 like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all plaintiffs in the suit, along with Maryland \u2014 because of the tax relief it provided as well the incentive for homeownership.Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, signed in December, places a limit of $10,000 on combined income, sales or property taxes.Whether the suit will find a receptive audience in the federal courts \u2014 or on a conservative-leaning Supreme Court \u2014 is an open question. Brian Galle, a professor of law at Georgetown University, said that the suit was \u201can original work of scholarship,\u201d basically arguing that when the federal government imposed taxes, it had to reduce the collateral impact on a state\u2019s ability to raise its own funds.\u201cThe complaint is not frivolous, it is not crazy,\u201d Mr. Galle said. \u201cIt is also probably not a winner.\u201d\u201cI think the policy is poorly designed for a number of reasons, and I think Congress should revisit it,\u201d he said of the tax law. \u201cBut it seems a situation in which the courts are unlikely, and probably shouldn\u2019t, intervene.\u201dThe governor\u2019s remarks were met with a sharp retort from the Republicans who lead the State Senate and are fighting to maintain their single-seat majority in the face of a wave of retirements and Democratic optimism. In a lengthy statement, state Senator John J. Flanagan, the Republican leader, mocked the governor\u2019s timing in filing the suit \u2014 long after he threatened one \u2014 and a series of recent revenue ideas which the G.O.P. opposed during the most recent budget negotiations in March.\u201cAfter this long of a delay, we were all beginning to wonder if he had only said it for the headline,\u201d said Mr. Flanagan, who represents Long Island. \u201cTalk is cheap, but the governor\u2019s taxes are not.\u201dThe Treasury Department, which along with the Internal Revenue Service, are defendants in the suit, had little comment beyond saying that they were reviewing it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Trump\u2019s Fed Comments, Mnuchin Offers a Clarification", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 At a gathering of finance ministers from the world\u2019s largest economies on Saturday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sought to clarify remarks by President Trump this week, insisting that the administration would not interfere with the decisions of the Federal Reserve or move to manipulate the value of the dollar.Mr. Mnuchin was preparing to address currency concerns with his counterparts at the meeting, which is expected to be tense because of an escalating trade war. But he first sought to defuse any tension between the Fed and the president, who a day earlier had criticized the central bank for raising interest rates.Mr. Mnuchin asserted that the president had no intention of upsetting the established norms, saying, \u201cI fully support the Fed\u2019s independence, as does the president.\u201d Referring to the chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, Mr. Mnuchin continued, \u201cThe president was very clear in saying that he supports Chairman Powell, that he supports Chairman Powell\u2019s determination of interest rates.\u201dThe Treasury secretary, who said that it would be inappropriate for him to discuss interest rate policy, said it was not a mistake for Mr. Trump to do so. He said that he spoke to Mr. Trump about his comments and that the president was voicing a personal perspective, not trying to pressure the central bank.\u201cBeing a real estate person, real estate people obviously follow interest rates,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of Mr. Trump.The president also suggested this week that a \u201cstronger and stronger\u201d United States dollar was \u201ctaking away our big competitive edge.\u201d But the United States will not intervene in the currency markets, Mr. Mnuchin said.\u201cThe president is prepared to deal with different issues where he has opinions, but let me be clear, this is not in any way the president trying to intervene in the currency markets whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, adding that a strong dollar over the long term was in the interests of the United States.Brushing off cries of protectionism, Mr. Mnuchin was preparing to press for a new trade deal between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate all tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade. The idea, which Mr. Trump has broached before, has emerged as America\u2019s latest strategy to repel accusations that it has abandoned free trade.\u201cI think the G-7 and the E.U. constantly talk about a rules-based system, eliminating tariffs and trade barriers and how good free trade is for the global economy,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview before his meetings. \u201cIf they\u2019re sincere, we\u2019re willing to sit down and negotiate those discussions.\u201dThe proposal is largely conceptual at this stage, and it is not entirely clear how it would work. Mr. Mnuchin suggests that the pact would substantially reduce America\u2019s trade deficit with the European Union as a percentage of gross domestic product. However, both sides are likely to seek exceptions and loopholes to protect vulnerable industries such as steel and automobiles in the United States.Next week, European Union officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, are to hold additional trade talks with Mr. Trump in Washington. The officials\u2019 visit is an attempt to stave off new tariffs on European car imports.The United States will have about a dozen bilateral meetings this weekend and will participate in a broader meeting of the Group of 7 countries, which is intended to focus on China\u2019s trade practices. Mr. Mnuchin has no one-on-one meetings scheduled with Chinese officials, but he said that he expected informal talks to take place. (Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier and the country\u2019s top economic official, is not in attendance.)Thus far, the trade dispute with Beijing shows no signs of abating. Mr. Trump said in an interview with CNBC that aired on Friday that he was prepared to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese imports \u2014 approximately all the goods China sends to the United States each year \u2014 if necessary.Sarah Bloom Raskin, a deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, said that the erratic nature of the trade moves by Mr. Trump was most likely straining relations between the United States and its allies.\u201cPerhaps the staffs of Treasury and the staffs within finance ministries in other countries will continue against all odds to maintain good will,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cBut this wears thin \u2014 at our peril \u2014 when leadership is so aimless and chaotic.\u201dMr. Mnuchin was perhaps most optimistic about Nafta, which could still remain a trilateral deal with Canada and Mexico or be restructured as two separate trade pacts. Despite the recent tension, Mr. Mnuchin said that meetings with Mexico\u2019s incoming administration this month left him hopeful that the pace of negotiations would improve now that elections there are over.And while frustrations flared last month between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Mnuchin maintains a warm relationship with his Canadian counterpart, Bill Morneau, dining with him at an upscale Argentine steakhouse on Friday night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Feinstein Has Advantages in California Race. De Le\u00f3n Now Has Party Leaders.", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The first rebuke to Senator Dianne Feinstein came in February, when the California Democratic Party delivered 54 percent of its convention vote to her opponent, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a state senator \u2014 just short of the 60 percent he needed for the party\u2019s endorsement.Then, in the California Senate primary last month, Ms. Feinstein crushed Mr. de Le\u00f3n in her bid for a sixth term, drawing 2.9 million votes compared to 804,000 votes for him.But on Saturday night, the executive committee of the Democratic Party struck again at Ms. Feinstein, embarrassing her by voting to endorse Mr. de Le\u00f3n in spite of the primary result. He received 217 votes from the committee of party leaders and elected delegates, or 65 percent of the 333 votes cast.The result is the latest sign of impatience by liberal Democratic activists across the nation with the kind of moderation Ms. Feinstein represents in Washington, D.C. \u2014 and in the state that has become viewed as the vanguard of Democratic resistance to President Trump. The jolt to Ms. Feinstein is also a reminder of what has long been a current of discontent in some quarters with her, particularly among younger Democrats, some of whom suggest it is time for her to retire. She is 85.\u201cKevin de Le\u00f3n represents the future of the Democratic Party \u2014 a solidly progressive legislator who can see that things like Medicare for all and moving forward on climate justice are the things that really energize our base in the long run,\u201d said Daraka Larimore-Hall, 44, a Santa Barbara community college professor and a member of the executive committee who voted for Mr. de Le\u00f3n.The vote means that Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s name will appear on millions of pamphlets that the Democratic Party will mail to its voters this fall. He will also appear in the state\u2019s official voting guide as the Democratic Party candidate for Senate, which could make a difference for so-called low-information voters not following the race as they seek to decide whom to support.However, in a year when Democrats are battling to capture as many as seven Republican-held congressional seats in California \u2014 a key part of the party\u2019s national strategy to win the House \u2014 officials said it was highly unlikely the party would spend any money on Mr. de Le\u00f3n\u2019s behalf, since both candidates in the November contest are Democrats. No Republican candidate is on the Senate ballot because Ms. Feinstein and Mr. de Le\u00f3n prevailed in the state\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d open primary last month.And Ms. Feinstein goes into the general election with huge advantages over Mr. de Le\u00f3n.She is a California institution, who has consistently raised more funds than Mr. de Le\u00f3n, and by big margins. She has the support of some of the most influential national Democrats in the nation: former President Barack Obama, Gov. Jerry Brown and Senator Kamala Harris among them.By many indications, the executive committee of the California Democratic Party is also not reflective of the electorate at large. Mr. de Le\u00f3n, the former leader of the State Senate, lost to Ms. Feinstein in every county in the state in the June primary; he even lost his home Senate district in Los Angeles. A U.S.C. Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll in June showed Ms. Feinstein leading Mr. de Le\u00f3n by 36 percent to 18 percent among registered voters, though nearly 50 percent said they were undecided.Robert Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said the vote means \u201cclose to nothing\u201d as a measure of support for Ms. Feinstein or of the changing politics of the Democratic Party.\u201cThis is not a grass-roots uprising \u2014 but a testimony to de Le\u00f3n\u2019s political skills,\u201d he said in an email.Still, the vote represented a needed boost for Mr. de Le\u00f3n, who had been struggling to gain attention since his poor showing in the primary.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. de Le\u00f3n said the validation that comes with being the party\u2019s official nominee would upend the trajectory of a race that many Democrats considered all but settled after the June vote. He noted that the June primary involved 32 candidates, and that he was barely known among voters \u2014 a weakness he said the Democratic Party\u2019s endorsement will change as he heads into a head-to-head contest with Ms. Feinstein.\u201cOur goal was always to get into the top two,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said. \u201cAnd now we are there and have an opportunity to contrast our accomplishments, our values and our vision.\u201dMs. Feinstein declined a request for an interview.Bill Carrick, a senior campaign adviser to Ms. Feinstein, dismissed the significance of the vote, describing the executive committee as dominated by Sacramento insiders with close ties to Mr. de Le\u00f3n from his years as the former Democratic leader of the State Senate.\u201cShe beat him by over 30 points in the primary,\u201d Mr. Carrick said. \u201cShe won every congressional districts. She won his State Senate district.\u201dThe contest is taking place as a new generation of leadership is slowly taking over in California. Mr. Brown is retiring at the end of the year, and Mr. de Le\u00f3n had been hoping to ride a wave of generational change.But he is running in an election year where many voters \u2014 at least statewide \u2014 appear largely satisfied with the way things are going, based on voter surveys, making it more difficult to unseat an incumbent. California\u2019s economy is now the fifth largest in the world, and it\u2019s humming; the state has added nearly three million jobs since the housing collapse, accounting for more than 15 percent of the country\u2019s total job growth in that period. California\u2019s unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in May, is the lowest on record.The tech boom has brought prosperity to the Bay Area, but it has also contributed to soaring housing costs that have made the region unaffordable for many residents. Meanwhile, the recovery has been far less robust outside of California\u2019s big cities. In some more rural parts of the state, the unemployment rate still tops 10 percent, and some liberal activists are eager to see the government do more to assist Californians with lower incomes.Many Democrats say that Mr. de Le\u00f3n had done little to capitalize on his strong showing at the party convention in February \u2014 hence his poor showing in the June primary.Mr. de Le\u00f3n, speaking by telephone as he headed for an interview on CNN, said he planned to make the most out of this moment, using it to raise his profile and draw support and financial contributions. He emphasized positions that drew a contrast with the more restrained Ms. Feinstein, including his support for single-payer health care and his call for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment.\u201cLast night was a cleareyed call for a new generation of bold leadership in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will fight to advance an agenda driven by values and not by power and politics.\u201dBen Casselman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From a Space Station in Argentina, China Expands Its Reach in Latin America", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "Our correspondent went to the deserts of Patagonia to examine how China secured its new base, a symbol of its growing clout in the region.Supported byQUINTUCO, Argentina \u2014 The giant antenna rises from the desert floor like an apparition, a gleaming metal tower jutting 16 stories above an endless wind-whipped stretch of Patagonia.The 450-ton device, with its hulking dish embracing the open skies, is the centerpiece of a $50 million satellite and space mission control station built by the Chinese military.The isolated base is one of the most striking symbols of Beijing\u2019s long push to transform Latin America and shape its future for generations to come \u2014 often in ways that directly undermine the United States\u2019 political, economic and strategic power in the region.But the way the base was negotiated \u2014 in secret, at a time when Argentina desperately needed investment \u2014 and concerns that it could enhance China\u2019s intelligence-gathering capabilities in the Western Hemisphere have set off a debate in Argentina about the risks and benefits of being pulled into China\u2019s orbit.All the while, China has been discreetly carrying out a far-reaching plan of its own across Latin America. It has vastly expanded trade, bailed out governments, built enormous infrastructure projects, strengthened military ties and locked up tremendous amounts of resources, hitching the fate of several countries in the region to its own.Leaders in the region were more than receptive. The primacy over Latin America that Washington had largely taken for granted since the end of the Cold War was being challenged by a cadre of leftist presidents who governed much of the region \u2014 including Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay and Bolivia \u2014 and wanted a more autonomous region.Beijing\u2019s invitation came at a fortuitous time: during the height of the financial crisis. Latching onto China\u2019s voracious appetite for the region\u2019s oil, iron, soybeans and copper ended up shielding Latin America from the worst of the global economic damage.Then, as the price of oil and other commodities tanked in 2011, several countries in the region suddenly found themselves on shaky ground. Once again, China came to their aid, striking deals that further cemented its role as a central player in Latin America for decades.Even with parts of Latin America shifting to the right politically in recent years, its leaders have tailored their policies to fulfill China\u2019s demand. Now Beijing\u2019s dominance in much of the region \u2014 and what it means for America\u2019s waning stature \u2014 is starting to come into sharp focus.\u201cIt\u2019s a fait accompli,\u201d said Diego Guelar, Argentina\u2019s ambassador to China.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer silent,\u201d Mr. Guelar said of China\u2019s incursion in the region.Trade between China and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean reached $244 billion last year, more than twice what it was a decade earlier, according to Boston University\u2019s Global Development Policy Center. Since 2015, China has been South America\u2019s top trading partner, eclipsing the United States.Perhaps more significantly, China has issued tens of billions of dollars in commodities-backed loans across the Americas, giving it claim over a large share of the region\u2019s oil \u2014 including nearly 90 percent of Ecuador\u2019s reserves \u2014 for years.China has also made itself indispensable by rescuing embattled governments and vital state-controlled companies in countries like Venezuela and Brazil, willing to make big bets to secure its place in the region.Here in Argentina, a nation that had been shut out of international credit markets for defaulting on about $100 billion in bonds, China became a godsend for then-President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.And while it was extending a helping hand, China began the secret negotiations that led to the satellite and space control station here in Patagonia.Argentine officials say the Chinese have agreed not to use the base for military purposes. But experts contend that the technology on it has many strategic uses.\u201cThey are deploying these capabilities to blunt American military advantages, which are in many ways derived from space,\u201d Mr. Rose said.Antennas and other equipment that support space missions, like the kind China now has here in Patagonia, can increase China\u2019s intelligence-gathering capabilities, experts say.\u201cA giant antenna is like a giant vacuum cleaner,\u201d said Dean Cheng, a former congressional investigator who studies China\u2019s national security policy. \u201cWhat you are sucking up is signals, data, all sorts of things.\u201dLt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said American military officials were assessing the implications of the Chinese monitoring station. Chinese officials declined requests for interviews about the base and their space program.Beyond any strategic contest with the United States, some leaders in Latin America are now having doubts and regrets about their ties to China, worried that past governments have saddled their nations with enormous debt and effectively sold out their futures.But Mr. Guelar argued that hitting the brakes on engagement with China would be shortsighted, particularly at a time when Washington has given up its longstanding role as the region\u2019s political and economic anchor.\u201cThere has been an abdication\u201d of leadership by the United States, he said. \u201cIt surrendered that role not because it lost it, but because it doesn\u2019t wish to take it on.\u201dIn the middle of all this, China also dispatched a team to Argentina to discuss something that had nothing to do with currency fluctuations: Beijing\u2019s ambitions in space.Flanked by mountains and far from population centers, the site offered an ideal vantage point for Beijing to monitor satellites and space missions around the clock.F\u00e9lix Clementino Menicocci, the secretary general of Argentina\u2019s National Space Activities Commission, a government agency, said the Chinese had pitched officials with promises of economic development and the prospect of enabling a history-making endeavor.\u201cThey\u2019ve become major players in space in the span of a few years,\u201d Mr. Menicocci said of China\u2019s space program.After months of secret negotiations, Neuqu\u00e9n Province and the Chinese government signed a deal in November 2012, giving China the right to the land \u2014 rent free \u2014 for 50 years.When provincial lawmakers caught wind of the project after construction was already underway, some were aghast. Betty Kreitman, a lawmaker in Neuqu\u00e9n at the time, said she was outraged that the Chinese military was being allowed to set up a base on Argentine soil.\u201cSurrendering sovereignty in your own country is shameful,\u201d Ms. Kreitman said.When she visited the construction site, she said, she pressed Chinese officials for answers but walked away feeling even more concerned.\u201cThis is a window to the world,\u201d she recalled the Chinese supervisor at the site saying. \u201cIt gave me chills. What do you do with a window to the world? Spy on reality.\u201dThe pitch was certainly not subtle, but then, it was never meant to be.China\u2019s policy document on Latin America in 2008 promised governments in the region to \u201ctreat each other as equals,\u201d a clear reference to the asymmetric relationship between the United States and its neighbors in the hemisphere.The new alliance paid off, helping propel Latin America to the kind of growth rates that Europe and the United States envied.Yet, Mr. Gallagher said, the bounty came with significant peril. Industries like agriculture and mining are subject to the boom-and-bust cycles of commodity prices, which made relying on them too heavily a big gamble over the long term.Sure enough, global commodity prices eventually tumbled. In July 2014, as several leftist leaders were presiding over distressed economies, China signaled even more ambitious plans for the region. At a summit meeting in Brazil, President Xi Jinping announced that Beijing aspired to raise annual trade with the region to $500 billion within a decade.For emphasis, he quoted the Cuban national hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, and recited a line from the epic Argentine poem \u201cMart\u00edn Fierro\u201d by Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez: \u201cBrothers be united because that is the first law.\u201dSoon, China took a step that startled the Pentagon. In October 2015, China\u2019s Defense Ministry hosted officials from 11 countries in Latin America for a 10-day forum on military logistics titled \u201cStrengthening Mutual Understanding for Win-Win Cooperation.\u201dThe meeting built on the ties China had been making with militaries in Latin America, including donating equipment to the Colombian military, Washington\u2019s closest partner in the region.The contacts have paved the way for China to start selling military equipment in Latin America, which had long regarded the United States defense industry as the gold standard, said Mr. Ellis, the War College scholar.Venezuela has spent hundreds of millions on Chinese arms and mat\u00e9riel in recent years. Bolivia has bought tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese aircraft. Argentina and Peru have signed smaller deals.Mr. Ellis said the Chinese had also probably pursued cooperation relationships with Latin American nations, with an eye toward any possible confrontation with the United States.\u201cChina is positioning itself in a world that is safe for the rise of China,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the 2049 world, from the perspective of Latin America, China will have unquestionably surpassed the United States on absolute power and size. Frankly, if it was a matter of sustained conflict, you reach a point where you can\u2019t deny the possibility of Chinese forces operating from bases in the region.\u201dJust weeks after the space station began operating in Patagonia, the United States made an announcement that raised eyebrows here in Argentina.American officials said that the project was unrelated to the space station, and that the center would be staffed only by Argentines.Latin America experts in the Obama White House watched China\u2019s rise in the region warily. But the administration raised little fuss publicly, sharing its concerns with leaders mostly in private.Besides, former officials say, Washington did not have much of a counteroffer.\u201cI wished the whole time I was working in Latin America that any administration had as well thought-out, resourced and planned a policy as the pivot to Asia for Latin America,\u201d said John Feeley, who recently resigned as the American ambassador to Panama after a nearly three-decade career. \u201cSince the end of the 1980s, there really has never been a comprehensive hemispheric long-term strategy.\u201dWhile the Trump administration has yet to articulate a clear policy for the hemisphere, it has warned its neighbors not to get too cozy with China. Former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson publicly cautioned that Latin America did not need new \u201cimperial powers,\u201d adding that China \u201cis using its economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit; the question, is at what price?\u201dThat question is being vigorously debated in some corners. Former President Rafael Correa of Ecuador was interrogated by prosecutors in February as part of an investigation into whether the decision to promise the country\u2019s crude reserves to China through 2024 harmed national interests.In Bolivia, which has also seen a surge of Chinese investment, several industries have withered as Chinese products have become cheaper and easier to buy, said Samuel Doria Medina, a Bolivian businessman and politician who has run unsuccessfully against President Evo Morales three times.\u201cOur financial, commercial and, ultimately, political dependency keeps growing,\u201d Mr. Doria said. Bolivia and several other leftist leaders who have tied their lot to China, he warned, have \u201cmortgaged the future\u201d of their nations.Yet China\u2019s influence has not diminished, even as Latin America shifts to the right politically. In recent months, Beijing persuaded Panama and the Dominican Republic to sever ties with Taiwan, notable victories in one of China\u2019s foreign policy priorities.China\u2019s clout, analyst say, is also a sign of how much the Trump administration has alienated governments in the region by adopting harsh immigration policies and pursuing hardball tactics on trade in a part of the world where Washington already has an ample surplus.Jorge Arbache, the secretary for international affairs at Brazil\u2019s Planning Ministry, said Washington\u2019s \u201clack of predictability\u201d had prevented a more ambitious partnership from taking root, while China had been far clearer about its vision.\u201cEveryone expects China to become even more influential,\u201d Mr. Arbache said.Soon after being nominated as Argentina\u2019s ambassador to China in late 2015, Mr. Guelar said, he steeled himself for an arduous task: pushing to renegotiate the space station agreement.The former government, he said, had given away too much, recklessly failing to specify that the base could be used only for peaceful purposes.\u201cIt was very serious,\u201d he said. \u201cAt any moment it could become a military base.\u201dTo his surprise, he said, the Chinese agreed to the use base solely for civilian purposes. But that did not assuage concerns in Bajada del Agrio, the closest town to the station, where residents speak of the Chinese presence with a mix of bewilderment and fear.\u201cPeople see it as a military base,\u201d said Jara Mar\u00eda Albertina, the manager at the local radio station. \u201cPeople are afraid.\u201dThe mayor, Ricardo Fabi\u00e1n Esparza, said the Chinese had been friendly and even invited him to look at the images the antenna produces. But he is more apprehensive than hopeful.\u201cFrom that telescope, they probably can even see what underwear you\u2019re wearing,\u201d he said.The United States is the one that should be most concerned, he said. The base, he said, is an \u201ceye looking toward that country.\u201dDaniel Politi contributed reporting from Buenos Aires, and Lis Moriconi and Manuela Andreoni from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Our \u2018Winner-Take-Most\u2019 Economy, the Wealth Is Not Spreading", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLabor\u2019s share of the pie is still crumbs. Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. They go on:Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor \u2014 known among economists as \u201clabor share\u201d \u2014 coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to \u201ctemporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.\u201dThe outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the \u201cfissuring of the workplace\u201d that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account \u201cfor a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.\u201dThe steady erosion of workers\u2019 bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors.\u201cThe Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,\u201d Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court\u2019s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June\u2019s Janus decision, and the Court\u2019s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses.The authors document increasing market concentration:From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues.Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile \u201cgrew 160 percent\u201d while firms \u201cin 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.\u201dWhat economists\u2019 technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people.The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: \u201cConcentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent \u2014 monopsony \u2014 that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.\u201d Firms dominating concentrated labor markets \u201cface relatively inelastic labor supply\u201d (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to \u201creduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.\u201dReduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor\u2019s share of income has fallen.Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart.Labor\u2019s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted.115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:97.17INDEXED TO 2009 = 100\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:INDEXED TO 2009 = 10097.17\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector.In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share.Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: \u201cResults show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.\u201dWhat does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back:Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening:1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it).2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits.3. A general increase in profits.Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately becausewithout any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits.Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profitsaffects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households \u2014 which live on wage/salary income \u2014 and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments.This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate.The growing importance of digital innovation \u2014 new products and processes based on software code and data \u2014 has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter\u2019s vision, digital innovation gives rise to \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, \u201caccrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.\u201dHow much money are we talking about?The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity \u2014 from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies.In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent.While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years.$22.80Tax bill enactedJUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80Tax bill enacted$22.80JUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars.Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we\u2019ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover.That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations \u2014 amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections \u2014 is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates\u2019 probability of victory.These improvements, in turn, \u201clower uncertainty about an election\u2019s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.\u201dThe effect, then, is thatwhen one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most.Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others \u2014 a majority of them men \u2014 have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them.How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The last time President Trump claimed that \u201cboth sides\u201d were responsible for bad behavior, it didn\u2019t go well. That was nearly a year ago, after a march of neo-Nazis descended into violence and a white supremacist drove his car into a crowd of peaceful protesters, killing a woman.On Monday, Mr. Trump again engaged in immoral equivalence, this time during a gobsmacking news conference after his meeting in Helsinki, Finland, with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. A reporter referred to last week\u2019s indictments of 12 Russian military officials for a coordinated cyberattack on the 2016 election and asked Mr. Trump if he held Russia responsible. \u201cI hold both countries responsible,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Even in a presidency replete with self-defeating moments for the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Monday, which were broadcast live around the world, stand out. The spectacle was hard to fathom: Mr. Trump, standing just inches from an autocratic thug who steals territory and has his adversaries murdered, undermined the unanimous conclusion of his own intelligence and law enforcement agencies that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 election with the goal of helping Mr. Trump win. Mr. Trump called the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation \u201ca disaster for our country\u201d and then performed a selection of his greatest solo hits: \u201cZero Collusion,\u201d \u201cWhere Is the D.N.C.\u2019s Server?\u201d and finally the old chestnut, \u201cI Won the Electoral College by a Lot.\u201d Even top Republicans felt moved to speak up. \u201cThe president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,\u201d Paul Ryan, the House speaker, said. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals.\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said, \u201cThe Russians are not our friends, and I entirely believe the assessment of our intelligence community.\u201dNot to worry, Mr. Trump assured us: Mr. Putin \u201cwas extremely strong and powerful in his denial.\u201d So he must have been telling the truth. Mr. Putin, for his part, was happy to admit that he wanted Mr. Trump to win the election: \u201cYes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\u201d He mocked the idea that he had compromising material on President Trump \u2014 though without denying it \u2014 perhaps because Mr. Trump\u2019s own words were compromising enough. Mr. Putin offered to have Russian intelligence work with its American counterpart to get to the bottom of the meddling case, on the condition that Russian authorities were allowed to question American intelligence officials as well \u2014 which Mr. Trump called \u201can incredible offer.\u201d Yes, incredible.Mr. Trump has said he wants to revive a relationship with Russia that badly deteriorated under President Barack Obama. His opening statement to journalists proclaimed the goal of continuing \u201cthe proud tradition of bold American diplomacy\u201d and emphasized that \u201cdiplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility.\u201dIn theory, such objectives make sense. But Mr. Trump seems to be singularly na\u00efve, or deliberately ignorant, about why his own senior national security advisers have identified Russia as one of America\u2019s chief geostrategic adversaries, along with China.Other than according Mr. Putin the honor of a meeting that begins to erase the ostracism he suffered for invading Ukraine, it is hard to see what Mr. Trump accomplished. The two men talked about forging a new treaty to replace the New Start Treaty, which constrains nuclear weapons and is to expire in 2021, and also discussed cooperating on Syria, though they seem to have passed up a chance for concrete action.There has been no sign that the United States has derived any benefit from Mr. Trump\u2019s obsequiousness toward Mr. Putin, though Mr. Trump himself has now at least gotten a shiny new soccer ball.It remains a mystery why the president, unlike any of his Republican or Democratic predecessors, is unwilling to call out Russian perfidy. He has no trouble throwing his weight around when he is in the company of America\u2019s European allies, attacking them as deadbeats and the European Union as a \u201cfoe,\u201d or when he excoriates the news media as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Put him next to Mr. Putin and other dictators, and he turns to putty. All that\u2019s clear is that a president who is way out of his depth is getting America into deep trouble. An earlier version of this editorial misstated the action taken to charge a Russian woman as a foreign agent. She was charged through a criminal complaint, not an indictment.Advertisement"}

Its deadline for exiting the European Union is less than nine months away. And there is no workable plan in sight.This week, in a sign of mounting anxiety, the British government announced plans to issue regular warnings to citizens and businesses \u2014 likely to range from how to prevent medicine shortages to what documents would be needed to drive in France \u2014 so that everyone can prepare for the chance that a deal will not be struck. A no-deal divorce would be so dire that many politicians quietly believe it will be avoided and common sense will prevail.The question is how. Parliament is paralyzed. Prime Minister Theresa May is besieged. Her Conservatives are bitterly divided, consumed by infighting, while the opposition Labour Party keeps its head down, hoping to exploit the chaos.There are factions pushing to hold a second Brexit referendum that might reverse the first \u2014 except doing that would provoke a backlash among supporters of withdrawal. There is speculation about a general election to produce a new government with a clear majority \u2014 but that didn\u2019t work last June.There is also talk, ceaselessly, of a leadership challenge to Mrs. May \u2014 yet her critics seemingly lack the numbers to be sure of deposing her. This week there was even talk of a national unity government.\u201cBasically nobody has the faintest idea what will happen,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute. \u201cThe risk is real of political deadlock in Britain with Britain drifting toward the cliff edge.\u201dIn the worst case, that would mean suddenly reimposing the types of checks that exist at many borders. That could include customs inspections usually meant to decide if tariffs need to be paid and other checks to decide if food and medicine meet the safety standards of the country where the goods are going.For months, the consuming political narrative has been the fight within the Conservative Party. The Tories are divided between those who want a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d a clean break from European rules, and those who want to protect the economy and soften the impact of departure. But within these competing camps are factions, which are making it harder to reach any kind of solution.Given the prospect of economic chaos on both sides of the English Channel, Simon Fraser, a former top career official in Britain\u2019s Foreign Office who is now managing partner at a consultancy, Flint Global, said that \u201cthe calculation has to be that it is in the interests of both sides to reach a deal.\u201d\u201cBut sitting here today,\u201d he added, \u201cone can\u2019t yet see how the deal will be done.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s Chequers plan is now steadily being attacked from different sides. On Monday, she caved in to hard-line Brexit enthusiasts and accepted amendments that were designed to make the deal unpalatable to the European side. This, in turn, led to the resignation of one Conservative minister, Guto Bebb.Kenneth Clarke, a pro-European Conservative lawmaker and former cabinet minister, told the BBC that Parliament \u201calways goes mad in July\u201d \u2014 the season of summer drinks receptions, when plotting traditionally reaches its zenith. But, he added, \u201cI have never seen it go so mad before.\u201dIn theory Mrs. May does not need to negotiate a full trade plan to avoid the cliff edge and enter a transition period in which things would stay the same between the Brexit deadline in March 2019 and the end of December 2020. Britain could use that extra time to sort out the rest.The Ireland problem, in turn, leads to a broader question about what kind of access a post-Brexit Britain could, or could not, have to Europe\u2019s single market.This is at the heart of Mrs. May\u2019s Chequers plan, which envisages avoiding a Northern Ireland border and ensuring smooth trade by creating a complex new customs system. But even some of Mrs. May\u2019s admirers concede that this customs plan will probably not fly with the Europeans.Mr. Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, thinks that, as the deadlock continues, the European Union may become more flexible. If Mrs. May gets something close to her Chequers plan, she can perhaps persuade hard-liners that they have to accept it or risk the future of the Brexit project with another general election.Others think that Mrs. May might fail to strike a deal with the European Union but that if no resolution is in sight by January, her Parliament would rise up and force an election to avoid the cliff edge. Perhaps for that, the clock could be stopped in Brexit negotiations.Mr. Fraser, the former Foreign Office official, thinks it will go to the wire. \u201cMy experience of politics and diplomacy is that a deal will only be done when it really has to be done, at which point people often slightly reinvent the parameters,\u201d he said.But the alternative, according to Mr. Fraser, is that Brexit collapses under the weight of its own contradictions, leaving Britain in ferment.\u201cWhat the white paper has shown is evidence in black and white that there is no Brexit that is good for the U.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew already that hard Brexit is economically very damaging. Now we also know that pragmatic Brexit is probably not negotiable, is hugely complex and leaves the country in no man\u2019s land.\u201dAdvertisement"}

AMLO, as he is known, has been labeled populist, leftist, authoritarian and nationalist. Yet he\u2019s also been called a pragmatist and a fiscal conservative. Who is AMLO and what kind of president is he apt to be? All of the above is the correct answer.He is a complex politician who has made seemingly contradictory statements throughout his political career and during the current political campaign.So which Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will govern Mexico?All of them. There are not multiple AMLOs, but one.Having promised no tax increases and no significant deficits, how will he work the balance sheet?Many worry that he\u2019ll practice Ch\u00e1vez-like economics, spending what he does not have. But Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s statements and his tenure as Mexico City\u2019s mayor suggest otherwise. It seems likely that he\u2019ll initiate his promised programs, but at a pace dictated by the availability of funds. He seems to appreciate that doing otherwise could ignite inflation, which hurts the poor most.The authoritarian AMLO may rail against their obstructionism, but he can do little in the short term to mitigate the obstacles they pose to his policy preferences.None of this means that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will fail to change Mexico. He will. It doesn\u2019t mean that his pragmatism will prevent him from making some bad policy choices. It won\u2019t. And his rhetorical excesses will most likely reinforce fears that he\u2019s a radical in a pragmatist\u2019s clothing.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador appears dedicated to setting in motion a great transformation that creates a strong national economy with much more government intervention, less poverty and inequality, and increased national sovereignty and autonomy. That idealism will surely get the better of him at times. Mistakes will be made. But then his innate pragmatism and real-world constraints ought to kick in.

{"Headline": "The Calming Art of Terrarium Building", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField TripsAt Twig, a plant studio in Brooklyn, one can learn about moss and its expansive possibilities.The varieties they source are soft and springy and come in vibrant shades of green that can\u2019t be found at most home improvement stores. High-quality moss, they say, can be the difference between a sad desk terrarium (we\u2019ve all seen \u2019em) and a lush, lively little world.Twig occupies an unassuming space in the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, on a block with a restaurant supply store, an auto-body shop and a Russian bathhouse. Inside, the shelves are lined with assembled terrariums, potted plants and empty glass orbs waiting to become miniature ecosystems. No one really needs to be taught how to make a terrarium. Technically, all it requires is some rocks, dirt, moss and a container, preferably one made of glass. But the women behind Twig \u2014 avid crafters whose first business venture involved \u201csubversive greeting cards\u201d \u2014 elevate the hobby to a meditative art.Each Twig workshop offers a brief crash course in the life of the humble moss. You\u2019ll learn that these organisms come in more than 12,500 varieties, and that none of them have roots. Unlike (most) humans, moss thrives atop its own decaying matter and is largely self-sustaining. It prefers a warm, humid environment, which a covered terrarium can maintain with a spritz of water every now and then. Plant care doesn\u2019t get much more hands-off. But the assembly of a terrarium is an intimate exercise in plant cultivation and aesthetics.We prepared our jars, filling them about a fifth of the way with rocks, then packed a handful of hay into a dense layer atop them. Over that we sprinkled a cupful of potting soil. Then it was time for three types of moss (mood, sheet and palm) to be carried out of the fridge as if on a palanquin \u2014 and for the real landscaping to begin. In her memoir \u201cLife in the Garden,\u201d Penelope Lively distinguishes the \u201creal garden writer\u201d from the \u201cgarden commentator.\u201d The writer, she said, is unafraid of dirtying her hands in service of beauty. I grabbed a fistful of moss and ran my fingers over its furry surface, felt the cool of its soil in the center of my palm. Making a terrarium isn\u2019t as involved as, say, mulching a rose bush, but it satisfies the gardener\u2019s urge to cultivate.Ms. Inciarrano demonstrated one of her favorite styles, manipulating her moss into a mountainous structure with a small beach (comprising sand and sea glass and a small animal figurine) at its base. Many of us in the class followed her lead (creativity can be scary in novel media), though some went their own way, sculpting steep valleys filled with shallow rivers, or flat oceanside scenes. It felt good to exert some control over the environment, to shape it into something that looked habitable. Tactile activities have found a place in the broad category we now call self-care: behaviors, classes and treatments that reduce anxiety and depression, and are meant to serve as counterprogramming to the endless cycle of devastating information in the world. For an hour on a weekend afternoon, I didn\u2019t think of anything except the microcosmic forest in front of me and whether its climate would suit a tiny rubber giraffe.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Pim, 37, said the smell is like opening a bag of moldy bread.\u201cTo just watch it in the water and kind of just lap up and down with the water is a pretty eerie sight,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mesmerizing.\u201dAn unusually large algae bloom has filled the lake with a pea soup-like mixture that has built up because of rain, hot weather and a heavy concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizer, Richard P. Stumpf, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said.Mr. Stumpf warned that if people come in contact with the algae, they should wash it off to avoid irritation to their skin.The algae in Lake Okeechobee, while it has no effect on fish, can be toxic if consumed, he said. It can also be fatal for dogs that swim in or drink the scum, the foamlike substance that forms near the surface, he said.The scene at Lake Okeechobee, which is used mainly for commercial and sport fishing, is one of several across the United States that scientists are monitoring.There\u2019s a perception that algae blooms are becoming more frequent and severe but federal agencies, including NOAA and the United States Geological Survey, are doing research to determine whether that is the case, Mr. Stumpf said.Sharon Anderson, environmental team leader at the Cornell Cooperative Extension office in Ithaca, N.Y., said there was significant concern over harmful algae blooms in the Finger Lakes last year.One of them, Owasco Lake, was plagued by algae blooms last year, and this year \u201csuspicious\u201d blooms have been spotted in Cayuga Lake, she said. Residents and business owners are worried about how the algae could affect tourism, she said.Mr. Stumpf said Lake Okeechobee, which is about 95 miles northwest of Miami and draws about six million visitors a year, experiences algae blooms annually. The degree to which the bloom has spread this year was unusual.In a satellite image take on June 12, only 1 percent of the lake was covered in algae. By July 2, 90 percent of the lake was covered.Florida lawmakers have asked Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in Lee County, which the Caloosahatchee River runs through. The governor was scheduled to tour the Caloosahatchee River by boat on Monday morning, his office said.John Cassani, the head of the nonprofit Calusa Waterkeeper, who has worked on the river for about 40 years, said the bloom was \u201chistoric.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Cassani said. He has avoided spending too much time near the river because of the increased possibility of respiratory irritation.Mr. Pim, who volunteers for the Calusa Waterkeeper, said he\u2019s avoided exposing his two daughters, who are 10 and 7, to the water. He pays a friend to take video by drone of the algae and posts the footage on social media to alert his neighbors of the health risks.He\u2019s grown angrier over the expanding algae and what it could mean for the future of Cape Coral, where he\u2019s spent most of his life.He said posting videos and photos online could harm the real estate market in the city but he wants to raise awareness about the water quality and persuade residents to contact their elected officials to take action.\u201cI\u2019ve watched the water quality devolve in my lifetime and I don\u2019t want to stand here and watch it continue in my children\u2019s lifetime,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Labor Decision Wasn\u2019t Just a Loss for Unions", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of these groups work for immigrants and civil rights; others produce economic research; still others turn out voters or run ads in Democratic campaigns. Together, they have benefited from tens of millions of dollars a year from public-sector unions \u2014 funding now in jeopardy because of the prospective decline in union revenue.Liberal activists argue that closing that pipeline was a crucial goal of the conservative groups that helped bring the case, known as Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\u201cIf the progressive movement is a navy, they\u2019re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,\u201d said Ben Wikler, Washington director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org.Even President Trump took notice of the justices\u2019 ruling, declaring on Twitter that it was a \u201cbig loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\u201dIn the 5-to-4 decision on Wednesday, the court\u2019s majority ruled that requiring nonmembers to make union payments violated their First Amendment rights, since much of what unions do could be considered political activity at odds with their beliefs.The unions\u2019 ability to spend on progressive causes and candidates was already diminishing.Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, said that her union had cut its budget by about 30 percent in anticipation of the decision, and that the service employees had been talking with leaders of liberal groups for two years about how to offset the loss. She said the union, with about two million members, would provide a range of nonmonetary support, from in-kind staff assistance to help with fund-raising.The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank producing research on worker rights, wages and employment, has relied on the four biggest public-sector unions for about 10 to 15 percent of its roughly $6 million in annual revenue in recent years.\u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing it as an existential threat,\u201d said Thea Lee, the institute\u2019s president, \u201cbut we have been trying to be conservative in what projects we pursue.\u201dA group called Mi Familia Vota, which advocates on behalf of Latino voters and immigrants, had received about $1 million a year directly from the Service Employees International Union since 2012 \u2014 a significant portion of its annual revenue, which has ranged from about $1.5 million to $5 million during that time.Last year, the union gave just $25,000.\u201cWe\u2019ve been adjusting,\u201d said Ben Monterroso, director of Mi Familia Vota, which focuses on issues including education, health care, workers\u2019 rights and voting rights. \u201cSome of the programs we\u2019ve needed to scale back. Demonstrations, activities, actions, we\u2019ve scaled back.\u201dMr. Monterroso said the group was now focused primarily on elections and elected officials. \u201cWe do that by growing the electorate \u2014 helping people become citizens when eligible, and helping those eligible be registered,\u201d he said.Other groups that register and mobilize voters may be vulnerable, too. America Votes, a group with a permanent staff in more than 20 states that turns out voters on Election Day and rallies them around causes like reproductive rights and the environment, received more than one-fifth of its nearly $10 million budget from the four biggest public-sector unions in 2016.(Some unions said it was too early to know what spending they would cut. The American Federation of Teachers was adamant that it would continue funding certain groups, like America Votes.)In some arenas, the loss of union money will almost certainly be offset by other liberal donors \u2014 both the wealthy and ordinary citizens. Few party operatives worry, for example, that the Democrats will lack resources for their next presidential nominee, or candidates in high-profile Senate and House races.In other cases, the loss of union money may be offset by grass-roots activism.In 2016, the four major public-sector unions gave nearly 15 percent of the $17 million raised by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which funds state legislative races nationwide. But the group is optimistic that any loss of union revenue can be offset by what it calls the \u201cpeople power\u201d of union members and other voters.Activists and party operatives said union cash would be more difficult to replace in other areas. Mr. Wikler said MoveOn\u2019s monthly donor base had quadrupled since Mr. Trump was elected, allowing it to increase support for groups working on immigrants\u2019 rights, workers\u2019 rights and racial-justice causes.\u201cBut the scale of what we can kick in to efforts like that are dwarfed by what the public-sector unions can muster,\u201d he said.Mr. Woodhouse said labor money could be especially critical to groups that must form quickly for a specific policy fight. He cited the example of Americans United, founded in 2005 to block President George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to partly privatize Social Security.\u201cIt was a lot easier to go to labor to do that than it is to kind of try to do this through other means \u2014 low-dollar or individual donors,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeed was essential, and we were caught a little flat-footed.\u201d (Labor has funded some of these efforts through super PACs in recent years.)In the end, the loss of union money may be less detrimental to Democrats and progressive causes than the loss of union members.In the 2000 presidential election, noted Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., 43 percent of the votes cast in Michigan came from union households, which tend to vote Democratic by a large margin. In the 2016 presidential election, the first after the state passed a \u201cright to work\u201d law ending mandatory union fees, only 28 percent of votes came from union households. That drop-off accounts for Hillary Clinton\u2019s margin of defeat in the state many times over.The key to unions\u2019 importance, said John D. Podesta, who was chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and is a founder of liberal advocacy and research groups, is \u201ctheir ability to change outcomes through educational efforts of their own members.\u201d\u201cThey do a very good job of communicating with their own members and getting them out to vote,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Georgia Governor\u2019s Race, a Defining Moment for a Southern State", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Georgia\u2019s political middle, long the dominant force behind the state\u2019s thriving commerce and pragmatic leadership, suddenly finds itself all but abandoned.More starkly than in most midterm campaigns, the contest between Mr. Kemp, the two-term Republican secretary of state, and Ms. Abrams, a former Democratic leader in the State Legislature, has come to mirror the disorienting polarization of the Trump era and expose the consequences of a primary system that increasingly rewards those who appeal to the fringes.But to date, neither Ms. Abrams nor Mr. Kemp has rushed to occupy that political space. With both candidates bolstered by huge wins in their primaries, there is no clear indication that either plans to abandon their base-driven strategies for a wholesale pivot toward the center. The race has come to be seen, in the words of Mr. Kemp at a Republican unity rally near Atlanta on Thursday night, as a battle for \u201cliterally the soul of our state.\u201dMs. Abrams, 44, a brainy Yale Law graduate from Atlanta, has leveraged the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first female African-American governor to nationalize her campaign and its fund-raising. By contrast, Mr. Kemp, 54, is a drawling agri-businessman from Athens who has revived a populist style that has lain dormant in Georgia since the late 1960s. Both campaigns say they are committed to maximizing turnout by their most rabid supporters rather than moderating in order to broaden their appeal to centrists and independents.\u201cThis is a conversation about what direction we move Georgia in,\u201d Ms. Abrams said at a campaign stop in Atlanta on Friday.In an interview a day earlier, David Ralston, a Republican who is the Georgia House speaker, said, \u201cGeorgians are going to have the clearest choice that they\u2019ve probably ever had in a general election for the office of governor.\u201dTo those in between, the chasm between Mr. Kemp, who has adopted President Trump\u2019s language on guns and immigration, and Ms. Abrams, who supports an assault rifle ban and says her \u201csoul rests with those seeking asylum,\u201d feels as vast as Tallulah Gorge.\u201cIt would be nice if we had a more moderate option,\u201d said Kathrine DeLash, who works at a pet store in suburban Cobb County and doesn\u2019t identify with either political party. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that with the candidates we have right now. The people who shout the most to their own people get the most attention, and it doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re saying as long as they shout the loudest.\u201dLynn Westmoreland, a former Republican congressman from western Georgia, said he could not remember another Georgia campaign where candidates did not reflexively move to the center after securing their nominations. \u201cI think the Republicans are losing the middle, I think the Democrats are losing the middle, and the middle is kind of shrugging like, \u2018O.K., what am I supposed to be doing?\u2019\u201d he said.Former Gov. Roy E. Barnes, the last Democrat to hold the office, mourned what he depicted as the disenfranchisement of the state\u2019s political center.\u201cIn Georgia, we always enjoyed a broad middle and we had a broad consensus,\u201d said Mr. Barnes, who served one term but lost his re-election in 2002 and a comeback bid eight years later. \u201cWe were all very much in favor of public education. We kept really controversial issues down by an unwritten agreement. But the middle has gone, and it has gone to the extremes unfortunately. It is a microcosm of what is happening in the country.\u201dMr. Barnes asserted that neither he nor his two Democratic predecessors, Zell Miller and Joe Frank Harris, could have won their party\u2019s nomination today. Nor, he speculated, could the state\u2019s center-right senior United States senator, Johnny Isakson, win in a Republican primary if he were running without the benefit of incumbency.\u201cI would never write myself off,\u201d said Mr. Isakson, who is serving his third term, \u201cbut he\u2019s got a point. It is a totally different situation.\u201dThe narrow appeals by both candidates have been made possible, to some extent, by the strength of Georgia\u2019s economy. With fewer financial concerns, voters have been freer to side with candidates on the basis of cultural affinity. Mr. Kemp stepped into the spotlight as the homebred embodiment of blunt-talking Trumpism, while Ms. Abrams lent forlorn Georgia Democrats star power and the draw of history.Ms. Abrams streaked into the general election after taking 76 percent of the vote in a two-person primary in May. The results seemed to validate her strategy of registering thousands of young and minority voters and exciting them with an unapologetic appeal to the left. Turnout in the Democratic primary was two-thirds higher than in 2014, nearly equaling that in the Republican primary for the first time in a dozen years.The state\u2019s demographics are shifting rapidly in Ms. Abrams\u2019 favor. Over the last 20 years, when the state\u2019s population ballooned nearly 30 percent to 10.4 million, the share of registered voters who are not white increased to 46 percent from 27 percent, state election data shows. Two of the suburban Atlanta counties that fueled the Republican rise \u2014 Cobb and Gwinnett \u2014 are now so populated by immigrants and African-Americans that they voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump.As in the last several campaign cycles, the question for Ms. Abrams will be whether the electorate has changed enough that a well-funded ground operation can transform a trend into victory.After finishing second in a crowded Republican primary in May, Mr. Kemp stunned his party\u2019s establishment with the magnitude of his victory in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. He took 69 percent against his better-funded rival, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, winning 157 of 159 counties, and finished 12 points ahead in Mr. Cagle\u2019s home county. Mr. Cagle had been the choice of many elected officials and donors, and had won a late endorsement from Governor Deal.Mr. Kemp tied himself inseparably to Mr. Trump. And with shotguns, chain saws and a Ford F-350 as props, his ruthlessly effective ads transformed a man largely unknown into a swaggering defender of restricted borders and the Second Amendment.It is an image, once cemented, that may be tough to soften for female suburban swing voters, a potential opportunity for Ms. Abrams. She said on Friday that she would not be \u201cengaging in divisive culture arguments about who\u2019s angrier or who\u2019s meaner.\u201dAt Thursday\u2019s Republican unity event, where Mr. Cagle and Mr. Deal endorsed Mr. Kemp, there were no boasts of political incorrectness, almost no mentions of Mr. Trump and more focus on continuing the legacy of job growth than deporting undocumented immigrants. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me and my big truck,\u201d Mr. Kemp even said.Instead, Mr. Kemp and his surrogates turned their attention to labeling Ms. Abrams, who has had two unobstructed months to establish herself. Ms. Abrams, Mr. Kemp said, was \u201cbacked by billionaires and socialists who want to make Georgia into California.\u201dBut Mr. Kemp\u2019s strategists said that the more muted tone did not signify a lasting change, and that they planned to hew closely to stimulating the base that gave Mr. Trump a 51 percent to 46 percent victory in Georgia in 2016. Speaking after the rally, for instance, Mr. Kemp reiterated his support for state legislation that would replicate a federal law providing legal protection to individuals and businesses who tailor business practices to their religious beliefs. Opponents of the laws, which exist in several neighboring states, argue that they allow discrimination against serving or employing homosexuals and transgender people.That pledge, and the countrified image Mr. Kemp created for himself in his ads, has prompted nervousness among some business leaders, particularly in Atlanta. The city\u2019s cottage industry is corporate recruitment, often of global firms with diverse workforces, and it remains among the 20 locations in the running for Amazon\u2019s coveted second headquarters. The film industry is now a major presence, thanks to generous tax incentives, and the Super Bowl comes to Atlanta in February.Concerned about condemnation and boycotts, business leaders convinced Mr. Deal to veto so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation in 2016, but some wonder whether they would have the same success with Mr. Kemp. A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown business group, said industries that normally support Republicans were waiting to learn more.\u201cThe main thing is, let\u2019s not do anything to mess up our historic business environment, particularly discriminatory practices of any kind,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cPeople have seen what it\u2019s done in other states.\u201dState Representative Brenda Lopez, a Democrat from Gwinnett County, said voters needed to consider the long-term consequences of the campaign and November\u2019s vote.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about one election cycle of the next governor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what the image of Georgia is going to continue to be nationally and internationally.\u201dFollow Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder on Twitter: @ksacknyt and @alanblinder.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are the Trade War Losers? Just Look at the Earnings Rolling In", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorporate earnings are the strongest they have been in years. Headline numbers suggest the economy is doing pretty well under President Trump.The stock market, however, is starting to signal that the good times might not last for many.On the surface, stocks look to be performing well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up more than 6 percent this year, and it is close to getting back to the historic high it hit earlier this year.A deeper look, however, suggests there is increasing concern among stock investors. A small group of the largest technology companies has driven much of the recent rally. The stocks of other types of companies have not performed nearly as well, in part because of worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs will harm corporate profits.The stock market is not a perfect predictor of the future, but the lackluster performance of a large part of it may portend a difficult period for many companies in which they pull back on their businesses and perhaps shed jobs in the process.The trade talks announced on Wednesday between the United States and the European Union could prevent an escalation of the fight between the two trading partners. Some investors have been betting that Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose stance was a bargaining tactic. Stocks jumped after news of the talks was reported.And investors and executives are finding plenty of reasons to remain nervous as companies report their second-quarter earnings. The trade war\u2019s impact on some companies is causing their stocks to crater. So far, the hit is largely coming from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have pushed up the prices many firms pay for the metals.It\u2019s possible that the economy is strong enough to make up for the drag caused by the trade confrontations. United Technologies, an industrial conglomerate, on Tuesday raised its profits forecast even as it reported higher costs because of the tariffs.But executives on earnings calls are saying their companies have only just begun to feel the effect of the tariffs. Their second-quarter results, for instance, reflected steel and aluminum bought at lower prices than exist in the market today. And few of the other tariffs that Mr. Trump has proposed have gone into effect yet. That could change by the end of the year, including an additional $200 billion of tariffs on imports from China. Mr. Trump is also pushing for tariffs on autos, though these may not be imposed on European imports if progress is made in the talks announced on Wednesday.General Motors, which reported earnings on Wednesday, showed the many ways in which President Trump\u2019s trade actions could damage the company\u2019s business. Higher steel costs were one of the reasons General Motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018, a move that helped send its stock down 4.6 percent on Wednesday.The company\u2019s costs didn\u2019t rise because it is purchasing a large amount of foreign steel that is subject to tariffs. Over 90 percent of the steel used in General Motors\u2019 production comes from the United States, said Tom E. Henderson, a company spokesman. But the tariffs have pushed up prices for all steel, including American, and put a burden on even companies that rely on domestic suppliers. Higher prices for steel and aluminum could add as much as $700 million to General Motors\u2019 costs this year, Chuck Stevens, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday.General Motors sells a large number of vehicles in China, where it has significant operations. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions against China could end up provoking Chinese consumers to boycott G.M.\u2019s cars \u2014 a real possibility, given that those same buyers recently shunned South Korean autos and other products. But Mr. Stevens said Wednesday that the company had not seen any sign of a boycott.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Portugal Dared to Cast Aside Austerity. It\u2019s Having a Major Revival.", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "At a time of mounting uncertainty in Europe, the country has defied critics who insisted on austerity as the answer to the Continent\u2019s economic and financial crisis.Supported byLISBON \u2014 Ram\u00f3n Rivera had barely gotten his olive oil business started in the sun-swept Alentejo region of Portugal when Europe\u2019s debt crisis struck. The economy crumbled, wages were cut, and unemployment doubled. The government in Lisbon had to accept a humiliating international bailout.But as the misery deepened, Portugal took a daring stand: In 2015, it cast aside the harshest austerity measures its European creditors had imposed, igniting a virtuous cycle that put its economy back on a path to growth. The country reversed cuts to wages, pensions and social security, and offered incentives to businesses.The government\u2019s U-turn, and willingness to spend, had a powerful effect. Creditors railed against the move, but the gloom that had gripped the nation through years of belt-tightening began to lift. Business confidence rebounded. Production and exports began to take off \u2014 including at Mr. Rivera\u2019s olive groves.\u201cWe had faith that Portugal would come out of the crisis,\u201d said Mr. Rivera, the general manager of Elaia. The company focused on state-of-the-art harvesting technology, and it is now one of Portugal\u2019s biggest olive oil producers. \u201cWe saw that this was the best place in the world to invest.\u201d\u201cWhat happened in Portugal shows that too much austerity deepens a recession, and creates a vicious circle,\u201d Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said in an interview. \u201cWe devised an alternative to austerity, focusing on higher growth, and more and better jobs.\u201dThe government raised public sector salaries, the minimum wage and pensions and even restored the amount of vacation days to prebailout levels over objections from creditors like Germany and the International Monetary Fund. Incentives to stimulate business included development subsidies, tax credits and funding for small and midsize companies.The economic about-face had a remarkable impact on Portugal\u2019s collective psyche. While discouragement lingers in Greece after a decade of spending cuts, Portugal\u2019s recovery has pivoted around restoring confidence to get people and businesses motivated again.\u201cThe actual stimulus spending was very small,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Borges de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, a professor at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Business and Economics. \u201cBut the country\u2019s mind-set became completely different, and from an economic perspective, that\u2019s more impactful than the actual change in policy.\u201dThe brighter outlook has lifted companies like Elaia, the olive oil producer. Its parent company, Sovena, opened Elaia as a start-up on a vast agricultural plain in southern Portugal in 2007, just before the downturn. Its timing could hardly have been worse, but managers persisted, paving the way for a surge in production when the crisis ebbed.Elaia says it generates 14 percent of Portugal\u2019s olive oil today, contributing to a renaissance in Portuguese exports, which now constitute 40 percent of economic activity. Drones buzz over vast olive groves, precision-planted with 2,000 trees per hectare, or roughly 2.5 acres, compared with around 150 trees for a traditional farm, monitoring crops for insect infestations, water levels and optimum harvesting time. Olives are picked by machine. Instead of field hands, the company hires technicians to operate the robots, and it has teamed up with universities for research.\u201cPortugal has benefited a lot after the tough years we had,\u201d said Jorge de Melo, Sovena\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe mood is much better than it was before, and that\u2019s important for the economy.\u201dYet Portugal\u2019s success is still vulnerable.Portugal\u2019s unions are now threatening strikes to press the government to more fully reverse austerity, increase wages and unlock more public spending to reduce inequality.\u201cWe didn\u2019t go from the dark side to the bright side of the moon,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d\u201cBut when we started this process, a lot of people said that what we wanted to achieve was impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cWe showed that there is an alternative.\u201dTo cement the growth cycle, the government is putting what little investment it makes into targeted initiatives like tax breaks for foreign companies and training for the unemployed.An hour and a half east of Lisbon, in \u00c9vora, a five-acre factory built by the French airplane-parts maker Mecachrome rises from rolling plains fringed with cork trees. Lured in 2016 by government incentives and European Union loans, it invested \u20ac30 million in a vast aerospace park where bulldozers are plowing fields to make way for roads and businesses.Robots forge precision parts for Airbus, Boeing and other industry giants. Most of the 150 technicians were recruited nearby by an unemployment agency that started an intensive retraining program with the government.Luis Salgueiro, 29, an apprentice with Mecachrome, was jobless during the crisis. He eventually got work as a waiter, and then in a tomato factory, before landing again at the unemployment office. At the Mecachrome plant, however, he was helping to code a complex machine to fashion a titanium airplane part. Completing the apprenticeship is expected to lead to a full-time job.\u201cThe future looks really bright for me now,\u201d he said, beaming as he gestured around the factory.Christian Santos, Mecachrome\u2019s director in Portugal, said he plans to hire 150 more workers and to make millions in additional investments in the next three years.\u201cThings are happening in Portugal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an enthusiastic mojo here.\u201dCamilo Soldado contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Ram\u00f3n Rivera's olive-oil business.

{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deporting the American Dream", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Isaacs is a political scientist who specializes in Central and Latin America. Ms. Preston is an economist.Mexico City \u2014 To hear the Trump administration talk about the immigrants it has deported back to Mexico, you would think they were all criminals and potential drains on the nation\u2019s economy and welfare system, with no interest in participating in what used to be called the American dream.In fact, none of that is true. We know, because the two of us talked to hundreds of them.Over the last few weeks we were in Mexico, beginning an oral history project documenting the migrant experience. Over the course of three weeks our team surveyed and interviewed more than 200 returning Mexican migrants, the vast majority of them deportees. Some were caught in roadblocks. Others were pulled over for running a stop light or for speeding. They were detained in American county jails and immigration detention centers before being sent to Mexico. Many had lived in the United States almost their entire lives.And yet, despite that experience, when we asked them what they missed about the United States, their responses were automatic: \u201ceverything.\u201d \u201cI feel American,\u201d they told us over and over again. And why wouldn\u2019t they? They grew up as the kids next door. They went to our children\u2019s schools and birthday parties. They attended our churches, played on our sports teams. As high schoolers they flipped hamburgers at McDonald\u2019s.But they also always had it a little rougher. Occasionally they faced discrimination. Their parents worked multiple jobs, often seven days a week. They left home before their children woke up and returned long after they were asleep. Children as young as 8 shouldered the burdens of caring for younger siblings. They began working as soon as they reached high school. But their unauthorized status limited their job opportunities; they couldn\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license and college was a remote possibility. Some got into the same kind of trouble native-born children do, but most worked hard to keep their families afloat.Still, the American dream meant everything to them. In optimistic terms rarely heard from native-born Americans, they described the United States as a place where success was possible. Whether they lived in a big city or small town, in a red state or a blue state, they overwhelmingly recall an American society that was genuine, open, diverse and accepting.One man teared up remembering his childhood friend, Matthew, with whom he played baseball, swam in the neighborhood pool and shared tacos and mac and cheese. Another missed ice fishing on frozen Minnesota lakes, using snowmobiles fashioned with special drills that he helped assemble through his work at a fiberglass factory. He shared another memory: After introducing his friends to guacamole, they insisted on eating at his place. \u201cWe had an arrangement: They\u2019d bring the avocados,\u201d he\u2019d make the dip.A young woman recalled being terrified of having her friends discover her unauthorized status. When she finally found the courage to tell them, they reassured her that they couldn\u2019t care less, and laughingly nicknamed her the \u201calien.\u201dEach deportee stressed the kindness of ordinary Americans who lent a helping hand. Bosses who gave them a chance, appreciated their hard work, mentored their success. Teachers whose names are etched in their memories: Mr. McDonald, Mrs. Wilson, Miss Annie \u2014 all went the extra mile to help them succeed in school. Coaches made it possible for them to play on club soccer or mighty mites football teams by paying their dues and buying them the uniforms their parents couldn\u2019t afford. A young man cried, remembering the marine who helped him find his way as a troubled adolescent.Back in Mexico, these returning migrants are desperately struggling to find their place in a foreign country. One young woman returning from Fort Myers, Fla., said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what Mexican earth was like and whether the sun shone.\u201dThe returnees stand out. They dress differently, they think differently, they speak broken Spanish and they dream in English. They miss everyday American life and its special occasions. They long for American food, rattling off every conceivable American chain restaurant. Several insist that Mexican tacos couldn\u2019t begin to compete with Taco Bell. They are American football fans rather than soccer aficionados. A handful confess they aren\u2019t following the World Cup because the United States didn\u2019t qualify.They can still proudly recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sing the United States national anthem. They loved observing United States holidays and several still do even back in Mexico. On Thanksgiving they expressed gratitude for opportunities the United States provided them. On July 4, they celebrated a country where \u201ceveryone praises each other\u2019s successes.\u201dThey reminisce about living in a country governed by the rule of law. Our survey asks them whether they were fearful of United States authorities. Except for the newest deportees who experienced the recent crackdowns, respondents react with a quizzical look, followed by an almost universal \u201cno.\u201d They surprise themselves with their answers, because as undocumented migrants they had every reason to be fearful. Yet the vast majority contrast the crime, corruption and lawlessness that pervades Mexico with the safety they felt in the United States, a place they describe as one \u201cwhere police can\u2019t be bribed,\u201d \u201cwhere people obey rules\u201d and \u201cwhere kids can play safely outside.\u201dWe watched these volunteer workers reach out to the scores of returning Mexican migrants who pass through their doors every day. They are always welcoming and upbeat. They encourage those who feel isolated to join their team. They link those who suffer depression with counseling centers. They provide clothing to the destitute, accompany battered women to shelters and help returning migrants find job training and work opportunities.These memories of migrant life in the United States stand in stark contrast to the inhumane crackdown simultaneously unfolding at the border. The returning migrants we met are products of an American society that is forgetting its identity. In a cruel irony, organizations like New Comienzos are importing to Mexico the American values of mutual respect, open-mindedness and generosity their volunteers were raised with. Meanwhile, American children are growing up in a society where aggression, prejudice and turning a blind eye to human suffering are increasingly condoned.Anita Isaacs is a professor of political science at Haverford College and a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center.

{"Headline": "A Dramatic Play About Finance? Yes, if It\u2019s Lehman Brothers", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s smart about director Sam Mendes\u2019s and designer Es Devlin\u2019s setting is that the past is always staged in the present: The action remains in a chrome and glass office, file boxes \u2014 which we saw so many photos of shellshocked Lehman Brothers employees clutching desperately as they left in 2008 \u2014 becoming whatever set or prop is needed. You can\u2019t view this story of a hard-grafting immigrant family, this apparent tale of the American dream, without awareness of where it all wound up.Basically, the Lehmans are present for all things great and horrible about U.S. economic shifts, trends and fads since, roughly, the 1840s. But it\u2019s also a family story, too. And this leaves the thorny question of what we are to think of these people. Are they merely opportunists? Are they amoral? Are they geniuses? Are they a net positive for the country? The answers change because the plot follows three generations of very different characters. But the question persists, in my mind, after the curtain falls. What did you make of this remarkable little clan, Holly?While there\u2019s a strong argument that the best way to stop history repeating is to really understand it, and a human look at the people behind mega institutions can help that, the play was still three and half hours of white men talking about how much money they want to make. I found it completely compelling, I should add, but it\u2019s always worth thinking about whose stories get told on our major stages.Anyway, David, what I want to know is how does it feel to see this very American story told by Brits? Did we do a reasonable job at catching something of the national psyche? So far, British critics seem unanimous in their praise \u2014 do you think it would play so well on Broadway? Famously, Lucy Prebble\u2019s \u201cEnron\u201d was a smash in London and a flop over there.I also think that American audiences will like the kinetic staging. For stretches of the show, you are transported via a video backdrop that is inventively deployed \u2014 to convey fire, war, the crash, nightmares, and most winningly, the \u201cdance\u201d of an economy at full throttle. Also, the U.S. is filled with fans of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and one of the brothers is played by Adam Godley, who was Elliott Schwartz in that show. Mr. Godley demonstrates range that he never got to in the show. Like his co-stars, he plays women, children and an assortment of men, all while wearing the same dark overcoat and suit.That said, I felt it was less effective with the female roles. All the female parts were played for laughs, really. Given these three actors exhibit such mastery at inhabiting different roles, this didn\u2019t need to be the case.This was an evening that could have felt very pedantic \u2014 an Italian playwright and an English production on Britain\u2019s national stage, at a moment when the world is pontificating and theorizing about what ails America. Mr. Massini rarely puts his thumb on the dramatic scales, and only toward the end, when he makes it clear that avaricious people are to blame for a catastrophe. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t feel lectured to, or pointed toward a particular conclusion, any other time.The revelation is what comes before that. The men who rise from nothing and a nation that makes that rise possible. It is a yarn with plenty of ugliness, sometimes acknowledged by the main players, more often not. But what a yarn.Advertisement"}

Others coordinated during lunchtime phone conferences. Most of them haven\u2019t even graduated from high school.For the last year, a tight-knit group spanning both coasts has been organizing on social media. The teenagers kicked off their campaign with a protest on Saturday at the National Mall in Washington, along with sister marches across the country.\u201cThe march is a launch. It isn\u2019t, \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Margolin, the founder of Zero Hour. \u201cIt means it doesn\u2019t give them an excuse to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what the kids want.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, you do.\u2019\u201dThey are trying to prove the adults wrong, to show that people their age are taking heed of what they see as the greatest crisis threatening their generation.\u201cIn our generation when we talk about climate change, they\u2019re like: \u2018Ha ha, that\u2019s so funny. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ll have to deal with,\u2019\u201d said Nadia Nazar, Zero Hour\u2019s art director. \u201c\u2018Oh, yeah, the polar bears will just die, the seas will just rise.\u2019 They don\u2019t understand the actual caliber of the destruction.\u201d\u201cNo one gives you an organizing guide of how to raise thousands of dollars, how to get people on board, how to mobilize,\u201d Ms. Margolin said. \u201cThere was no help. It was just me floundering around with Dory-like determination, like, \u2018Just keep swimming,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to the Disney movie \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201dAt the Sierra Club\u2019s Washington headquarters on Wednesday, as Zero Hour members continued to make preparations, six of the coalition\u2019s leaders and founding members discussed how they became involved with the group, and why they think it\u2019s one of young people\u2019s best shots at creating a healthy, sustainable environment.Jamie Margolin, 16, Seattle\u201cI\u2019ve always planned my future in ifs,\u201d Ms. Margolin said. If climate change hasn\u2019t destroyed this, if the environment hasn\u2019t become that.So for the last few years, Ms. Margolin has worked to raise awareness about climate justice issues. A passionate writer, she went through an \u201cop-ed phase,\u201d submitting essays to publications, like one titled \u201cAn Open Letter to Climate Change Deniers\u201d published in the monthly magazine Teen Ink.Still, Ms. Margolin thought that she and other young people could \u2014 and should \u2014 be doing more.\u201cI had had this idea building up since January, since the Women\u2019s March\u201d last year, Ms. Margolin said. \u201cThe kind of idea that was nagging me and you try to ignore, but it\u2019s an idea poking you.\u201dAt a Princeton University summer program last year, she met other teenagers interested in taking action on climate change and created Zero Hour. They began to plan a huge protest in the nation\u2019s capital. On social media, Ms. Margolin espoused factoids and reached out to other young activists.Since starting Zero Hour, Ms. Margolin said she had been overwhelmed by the response from people of all ages. Dozens of environmental advocacy groups and nonprofits have approached the coalition, looking to donate to or sponsor it.\u201cWe flipped the scenario as the underdog. We\u2019ve proven ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on the verge of something amazing. We\u2019re going to change history.\u201dKallan Benson, 14, Crownsville, Md.\u201cThe original idea was, \u2018We got to get them on the National Mall,\u2019 but then we thought that, \u2018Well that shouldn\u2019t be our first exhibit; it\u2019s a little ambitious,\u2019\u201d Ms. Benson said.\u201cThen we talked to Zero Hour and they were like, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you bring them out?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI never imagined it would get this far.\u201dMadelaine Tew, 15, Teaneck, N.J.As Zero Hour\u2019s director of finance, Ms. Tew has had to get creative about securing funds and grants.On the day of a deadline for a major grant \u2014 $16,000 from the Common Sense Fund \u2014 Ms. Tew\u2019s school was hosting an event where seniors gave presentations about their internships. But she knew the grant would be a huge boost for Zero Hour.\u201cSo I went to the nurse and was like: \u2018Oh, I have cramps. Can I lie down with my computer?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen I just went in and wrote the whole grant.\u201dHer stunt paid off. Zero Hour secured the grant, and now Ms. Tew\u2019s finance team, made up of students just like her, has raised about $70,000 for the coalition.Ms. Tew, who attends a magnet high school where she takes classes in business and finance, has been involved in clubs to get the school and local businesses to adopt more renewable practices. But before meeting Ms. Margolin at the Princeton summer program last year, she thought those local efforts were \u201cas far as you can go\u201d for someone her age.\u201cIt shifted from youth being a limitation to \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tew said.Though the practices of big corporations can sometimes anger environmentalists, for Ms. Tew, combining \u201cmy love for business and my care, my concern for climate\u201d just makes sense.\u201cIn many cases you can see how the environmental movement can be rooted in the way we do business,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about building more cooperative farms,\u201d Ms. Tew said, but also figuring out how to integrate ethical and sustainable environmental policies into business so \u201cwe can continue the American economy\u2019s future.\u201dIris Fen Gillingham, 18, Livingston Manor, N.Y.When three floods in the mid- to late 2000s swept through the vegetable farm Iris Fen Gillingham\u2019s family owned in the Catskill Mountains, the topsoil was washed away and their equipment was submerged, eliminating their main source of income.The floods devastated Ms. Gillingham\u2019s family, which has always lived \u201cvery consciously with the land and with nature,\u201d she said. Even her name, Iris Fen, like the flower and marshy wetland behind her house, alludes to that attachment.\u201cI have a pair of mittens that are made out of one of our Icelandic sheep, Rosalie,\u201d Ms. Gillingham said. \u201cMy brother named her, I remember her being born and I\u2019ve seen her grow up and my mom sheering her and spinning the wool.\u201dSo when landsmen came to explore the possibility of hydraulic fracturing \u2014 a technique of oil and gas extraction also known as fracking \u2014 in their neighborhood when she was about 10, Ms. Gillingham joined her father, an environmental activist, in speaking out at local meetings, often as the youngest in the room.But part of it was also knowing firsthand how essential a sustainable lifestyle \u2014 growing food at home, conscious spending, building greener homes \u2014 will be for her generation.\u201cWe\u2019re setting aside our differences and we are building a family and a community using our skills and our creativity,\u201d Ms. Gillingham said of the movement. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re laughing with each other, but we\u2019re also talking about some pretty serious issues and injustices happening in this country.\u201dNadia Nazar, 16, Baltimore\u201cI had just gotten a cat,\u201d Ms. Nazar said. \u201cWhat if my cat was that cow?\u201dShe got her start as an activist by trying to persuade people in her neighborhood not to go to SeaWorld, which has been criticized over its treatment of animals. (\u201cI was slightly successful in that.\u201d)Then she dug deeper into the root causes of animal suffering and death.\u201cI found out how so many species are endangered by climate change, and how many are dying and going towards extinction that we caused ourselves,\u201d Ms. Nazar said.During a class, she stumbled upon Ms. Margolin\u2019s Teen Ink essay and followed her on Instagram. And a little over a year ago, when Ms. Nazar saw a post by Ms. Margolin calling for action, she knew it was her chance to put her artistic skills to use. As art director, she helped organize a smaller art festival on Friday, and created the majority of the graphic elements for the coalition.\u201cHer story said: \u2018I\u2019m going to do it. Who wants to join me?\u201d Ms. Nazar said. She immediately messaged Ms. Margolin. She was in.Zanagee Artis, 18, Clinton, Conn.Zanagee Artis\u2019s journey as an environmentalist began in the same place many other budding activists get their start \u2014 in a high school club.During his junior year, he had big ambitions for his school: the building facilities department would finally start recycling white paper, students would start composting their food waste and the lunchroom would be free of plastic foam trays.\u201cI\u2019m going to accomplish all these things and I\u2019m going to go to the administration and tell them, \u2018Stuff needs to change,\u2019\u201d Mr. Artis said.But, he said, \u201cnothing ever happened.\u201d Mr. Artis said the problem was clear: Without engaging other students who might be interested, change was unlikely to happen.\u201cSo we accomplished all these things because we worked together as a community, and that\u2019s how I feel about the climate movement,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Artis said he \u201creally didn\u2019t think I could do much\u201d beyond his local community until he met Ms. Margolin and Ms. Tew last summer at Princeton. Inspired by Ms. Margolin\u2019s enthusiasm to do \u201ca big, big thing,\u201d Mr. Artis became Zero Hour\u2019s logistics director, in charge of submitting permits for Saturday\u2019s march, estimating attendance numbers, checking for counterprotests and helping sister marches with logistical issues.\u201cI was like, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d he said with a satisfying clap. \u201c\u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Rough Rio de Janeiro Neighborhood, Ballet as \u2018Anesthetic\u2019 and Escape", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRio de Janeiro DispatchRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The young ballet students walked into the room with red paint \u2014 simulated blood stains \u2014 smeared all over their leotards.It was a macabre costume for girls as young as 7 and 8, performing before the mayor and governor.To understand why their beloved ballet teacher, Daiana Ferreira de Oliveira, put them in those outfits, it helps to go back to a formative day of her own childhood.Ms. Oliveira was 6 or 7 when her mother first brought her and her two sisters from their home in an impoverished neighborhood in northern Rio de Janeiro to the majestic Municipal Theater downtown for a production of \u201cSwan Lake.\u201dThe family stood out: a black single mother who made a living cleaning homes, guiding her gobsmacked daughters through crowds of mostly white theatergoers and across the gilded entrance of one of the city\u2019s architectural gems for their first ballet.Her mother, Rosali Ferreira dos Santos, had developed a fascination with art after tagging along with her bosses to art galleries and the theater. She came to see such outings \u2014 to a concert, an opera or a play \u2014 as essential for her daughters, whenever she could find free or discounted tickets.\u201cMy mother said we needed to have culture,\u201d Ms. Oliveira, 29, said. \u201cFor her it wasn\u2019t a matter of being rich or poor.\u201dMs. Oliveira said she could have lived without the opera, recalling being horrified at \u201call those people screaming at each other.\u201dBut dance dazzled her.\u201cAn anesthetic,\u201d she called it. \u201cFor people like us, there were no shrinks.\u201dSince moving to Rio de Janeiro, I\u2019ve been fascinated \u2014 and often startled \u2014 by the split-screen reality of this megacity.I grew up in Colombia, where, as in much of South America, stark inequality is so institutionalized it\u2019s easy to become inured to it. But the way splendor and poverty coexist here in Rio makes for a head-snapping contrast.In the city\u2019s dizzying spectrum between rapture and despair, Manguinhos, the neighborhood where Ms. Oliveira grew up, leans solidly toward the latter.It is among the patchwork of districts known as favelas, which were settled by squatters decades ago. Traffickers from the powerful drug gang Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, have held sway in the area for many years, wielding more authority than the police.It is the kind of place where residents don\u2019t expect homicides will be investigated, never mind solved. Drugs are sold in the open, laid out on tables. Garbage is disposed of by burning small piles at a time on sidewalks.When Ms. Oliveira earned her degree in physical education in 2012, the situation in Brazil was starting to look up.The country\u2019s economy had been growing at a healthy clip for a decade. Education opportunities for the poor were expanding. Grand plans were drawn up to establish a permanent police presence in, and deliver basic services to, the favelas, as the country prepared for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.One of the tangible signs of change was a state-financed library in Manguinhos, where Ms. Oliveira began offering free classical ballet lessons in 2014.She said she tried to be warm but firm toward her students, warning them about unplanned pregnancies and urging them not to date drug traffickers.\u201cThere is no set destiny,\u201d she would tell the girls and young women. \u201cJust because you were born in a favela does not mean your life needs to play out a certain way. You don\u2019t need to end up working as maids.\u201dThe message resonated with Danice Sales, one of her first students, who went on to study Italian literature.\u201cIt was an escape from reality,\u201d said Ms. Sales, 29. \u201cI went through very hard things in my life and the only thing that allowed me to avoid going on medication and sinking into a deep depression was ballet.\u201dBy 2014, optimism gave way to dread as Brazil\u2019s economy began contracting and a giant corruption investigation exposed a systemic pattern of kickbacks among the country\u2019s political and business leaders. State officials in Rio de Janeiro began shutting down government employment centers and initiatives that had been inaugurated during the boom years.Among those on the chopping block was the library in Manguinhos, which prompted Ms. Oliveira to take her students to protests in 2015.She and other community activists persuaded the mayor\u2019s office to help pay the bills by repeatedly raising an uncomfortable question: \u201cHow can a country hosting the Olympics shut down libraries?\u201dBut a few months after the Games wrapped up, the library and scores of government programs closed. Ms. Oliveira fumed for a few days. Then she came up with a plan.With the help of a locksmith who refused to charge her, Ms. Oliveira broke into the abandoned library, cleaned it up and installed her own padlock.Next, a bit of favela diplomacy was in order. Ms. Oliveira sought out a leader of the Red Command and asked him to spare the library from the ransacking that befell other shuttered government buildings. The trafficker, who respected what she was doing, agreed.Even as violence worsened, and unemployment grew, dozens of parents continued to bring their daughters, and a few sons, to Ms. Oliveira\u2019s classes.\u201cIt was a way for them to understand the outside world, a world that does not exist here,\u201d said Tatiane Ribeiro Barboza, 40, who has two daughters in the troupe. But the main draw was exposing them to Ms. Oliveira. \u201cThey see a woman who has no weaknesses,\u201d she said.Giovana Xavier, an education professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said role models in communities like Manguinhos can have a transformative effect on youth.\u201cA big challenge is building positive references about what it means to be black,\u201d Ms. Xavier said. \u201cThe prevailing notions you see in the media are generally limited to criminality, in the case of men, and hypersexualization, in the case of women.\u201dIsabelle Sande, 15, one of the dance students in Manguinhos, said ballet has made her disciplined and politically minded. She was eager, for instance, to participate in a performance about feminism.\u201cIt\u2019s a taboo subject in the favela,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is the beginning of a path to assert yourself, to gain consciousness.\u201dMs. Oliveira was less than elated by the news. The library had opened during an election year and now it would be reopening during another one. Politicians always seemed eager to use photos of her troupe during campaigns, she complained, but did nothing to support her after an election.So when Ms. Oliveira was asked to prepare a special choreography for the reopening ceremony, which would be attended by Rio de Janeiro Governor Luiz Fernando Pez\u00e3o and Mayor Marcelo Crivella, she decided to give them a photo opportunity to remember.\u201cI reflected on all that has been taken from us, the violations, the violence, not just physical but psychological,\u201d she said. \u201cEach day it feels like we die a little because each day something is taken from us, be it a book or a plate of food.\u201dShe did not tell officials about the choreography she had planned.So, flanked by a gaggle of photographers, the mayor and governor looked ashen when the young dancers streamed into the room, with the red splashes of paint on their costumes, and laid on the floor, playing dead.\u201cWe are not votes!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIf the library closes after the election, we will be back here and we will stay put.\u201dWhen she was done, she asked the dancers to rise.\u201cYou are not dead,\u201d she told them. \u201cThis was just a way of noting that every day here, we\u2019ve been bleeding.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Insecurity Shadows Mali\u2019s President. It May Also Help Him Get Re-Elected.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAMAKO, Mali \u2014 Reports of military abuses and extravagant spending have shadowed him. His term in office has been pockmarked by terrorist attacks on peacekeepers and even a luxury hotel. Critics of Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta, have taken to chanting, \u201cFather must quit.\u201dBut at a recent campaign rally as he runs for re-election in a vote on Sunday, Mr. Ke\u00efta, 73, stood in a crisp white flowing gown before a throng of supporters in Bamako and defiantly responded, \u201cFather won\u2019t quit.\u201dYet Mr. Ke\u00efta, with a flush campaign fund and a raft of challengers, is likely to be re-elected, analysts say, in part because the violence could keep many people from the polls. Speaking about security issues, the president recently told journalists that Mali suffered from only \u201cpockets of violence.\u201dMr. Ke\u00efta promotes his achievements on billboards lining the streets. One features a little girl doing homework under a lamp and brags about the spread of electricity. Others boast of new access to potable drinking water.\u201cTogether, let\u2019s march toward progress,\u201d reads one billboard.But the memory of Mali\u2019s near collapse six years ago is still raw.In 2012, low-ranking soldiers in Mali, a former French colony, overthrew the government, saying they were fed up with being underequipped to fight rebels who benefited from of a flood of weapons that poured in after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.In 2013, the same year Mr. Ke\u00efta was elected and replaced the transitional government that followed the coup, French troops swooped in and chased the group from the area.At the same time, clashes between ethnic groups have spiked. Fatouma Barry fled her village after rumors of violence between ethnic Fulani and Dogon people. She headed to a displaced persons camp on the outskirts of Bamako. Her home now is a large white tent next to dozens of other Fulani women and children.\u201cI\u2019m going to vote, but not for the current president,\u201d Ms. Barry said. \u201cLook at us here.\u201dIn 2014, the International Monetary Fund temporarily halted $70 million worth of aid money citing concerns about Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s purchase of a $40 million presidential jet. He also was criticized for a round of expensive trips abroad early in his presidency \u2014 when he had yet to visit the beleaguered northern region of his own country \u2014 as well as political appointments that went to members of his family, including his son.Under Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s leadership, Mali\u2019s economy has bounced back from losses suffered during the 2012 coup. Much of Mali\u2019s growth is tied to prices of commodities like gold and cotton. Recent rainfall has helped the cotton crop; gold prices, after dipping, are on the rise again.But the country is still among the world\u2019s 25 poorest and is heavily reliant on foreign aid. Most Malians eke out a living as farmers, herders or fishermen, relying on the fertile area near the Niger River to survive. More than half of the country is a punishing desert crisscrossed by members of Islamist groups and migrants making their way to Libya where they set sail on the Mediterranean in hopes of a better life in Europe.Like many nations in the region, Mali is undergoing a growth boom with its population, about 18 million, expected to double in the next 17 years. The median age here is just 15.8.Young voters between the ages of 23 and 33 make up a third of all registered voters, according to the consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. Many have mobilized to express their frustrations with Mr. Ke\u00efta.\u201cWe think his term in office has been a disaster,\u201d said Mohammed Yousuf Bathily, a youth activist and radio personality who coined the \u201cFather Must Quit\u201d slogan.Mr. Bathily recently pledged his support to Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9, a former finance minister and the most popular rival candidate of 24 on the ballot.\u201cThe problem of insecurity has deepened,\u201d Mr. Ciss\u00e9 said in an interview. \u201cThe people feel a big frustration and sense of betrayal.\u201dConcerns about voter fraud have also been raised in recent days. The campaign manager of Mr. Ciss\u00e9 and another candidate, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, have accused the government of irregularities in voter rolls.\u201cWe are heading toward a lot of questioning of the results for this election,\u201d said Mr. Diarra, an astrophysicist who is a citizen of both Mali and the United States.\u201cThe stakes for the election are high,\u201d said Kalilou Sidib\u00e9, a professor of international relations at the University of Law and Political Science in Bamako, \u201cand Mali\u2019s democracy and future peace depend on the transparency of the process.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta.

{"Headline": "E.U. to Offer Trade Proposals in Bid to Ease Tensions", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 European negotiators on Wednesday will present several ideas to the Trump administration for easing a trade clash with the United States, including forging a new deal among the world\u2019s biggest automobile exporters.But these offers may fall short of appeasing President Trump, who has expressed skepticism at past trade pacts and branded the European Union as a \u201cfoe.\u201dAs the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Wednesday, the two sides are pushing agendas that are increasingly at odds, threatening to turn allies into adversaries.Trade is just part of the friction, with Mr. Trump seemingly determined to undermine a global system that has defined the United States\u2019 relationship with Europe for decades. Europe and the United States now find themselves on opposite sides over the future of the international trading system, the Paris agreement on climate change and their historic military alliance through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.It may be hard to find common ground on trade.In direct aim at European exporters, the Trump administration is weighing whether to impose expansive tariffs on foreign automobiles and auto parts that could roil trans-Atlantic supply chains and reshape the business ties on which some of the world\u2019s largest countries depend. The administration has already hit Europe with penalties on its steel and aluminum shipments, while lodging deep criticism of the World Trade Organization.Europe has responded by imposing its own taxes on American goods and preparing retaliatory measures should the administration go after the auto industry. It is also pushing ahead on forging deeper trade ties with other nations like Japan and China.The businesses that depend on supply chains that cross the Atlantic have been caught in the middle of the trade conflict, with automakers on both sides sounding warnings. General Motors and Daimler, big employers in the United States, have said the tariffs could cause job losses.Emboldened by a strong economy and a resilient domestic stock market, Mr. Trump has shown no signs of backing down.\u201cTariffs are the greatest!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cEither a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. It\u2019s as simple as that - and everybody\u2019s talking! Remember, we are the \u2018piggy bank\u2019 that\u2019s being robbed. All will be Great!\u201d\u201cThe European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade,\u201d he wrote later in another tweet. \u201cI have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won\u2019t!\u201dIn a briefing on Tuesday, a senior European official denied that the tariffs had made the bloc more willing to negotiate. But the official said the Europeans were eager to find a course of action that could release both sides from a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d of tariffs and retaliation.But he added that the Europeans had not yet received a clear indication of the Americans\u2019 primary goal, whether it was slashing tariffs on automobiles or reducing the United States trade deficit with Europe. He said people were struggling to understand the administration\u2019s negotiation strategy, and whether it would change its approach from one day to the next.During his visit, Mr. Juncker is prepared to discuss two options for the trading relationship, the official said, both of which the Europeans have floated with the United States before. The first is an agreement that would have all major global auto exporters slash their tariffs on foreign cars. The second calls for a limited trade deal between Europe and the United States centered on industrial goods.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.The president\u2019s criticism of Europe has often focused on its trade surplus in goods with the United States, as well as the 10 percent tariff imposed on American cars, compared with the 2.5 percent levied by the United States. Europeans counter that the United States has a 25 percent tariff on trucks and higher tariffs on many other goods.If the European Union lowered its tariffs on cars from the United States, it would have to offer that same rate to other members of the World Trade Organization. So forging an agreement among the world\u2019s major auto producers would ensure that countries like Japan and South Korea made some concessions in return for expanded access to the European market, the official said.Alternatively, the European Union would be willing to discuss a more limited free-trade deal with the United States that focused on industrial goods, the official said. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross previously proposed an agreement of this kind in talks with the European trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom.The official said these offers were contingent on the United States\u2019 removing its tariffs on steel and aluminum and not moving forward with measures on automobiles.But some economists urged caution on the prospects of a deal. Mr. Trump has criticized past trade negotiations with multiple countries, saying he prefers bilateral talks. His administration has also shelved broader trade discussions that the Obama administration was carrying out with the European Union, which included a proposal to drop European car tariffs to zero.Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets suggested that he was not in the mood to make concessions, meaning there is unlikely to be a clear path to a negotiated settlement.\u201cTrump is still looking for capitulation from the E.U. on U.S. demands rather than a compromise,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump, Tariffs, Tofu and Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAccording to early indications, recent U.S. economic growth was full of beans.Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s trade war will benefit some unexpected parties. Was making Brazil great again part of his agenda?But mainly I offer the parable of the soybeans as a warning against what\u2019s going to happen later this month, when the advance estimate of second-quarter G.D.P. comes in. The headline number is probably going to look good, possibly over 4 percent growth. If so, Trump will trumpet the news as proof that his economic policies are working \u2014 and some gullible journalists may go along with his claim.So what you need to know is that (a) quarterly fluctuations in growth are mainly noise, telling you very little about long-term economic prospects, and (b) more fundamental indicators show that Trump\u2019s main policy achievement to date, last year\u2019s tax cut, is basically delivering none of what its backers promised.The moral is clear: Pay little or no attention to short-term growth wobbles, which can be driven by transitory stuff like the reshuffling of world soybean trade.But in that case, how can we evaluate Trump\u2019s economic policies? The answer is, by looking at how those policies were supposed to work, and comparing that with what\u2019s actually happening.Let me damn the 2017 tax cut with some faint praise: While the logic of the Trump trade war is completely muddled \u2014 never mind how it\u2019s supposed to work, it\u2019s not even clear what it\u2019s supposed to achieve \u2014 the drafters of the tax bill did have a theory of the case. The story went like this: Lower taxes on corporations would lead to a huge surge of investment, which would raise productivity, which would eventually be passed on to workers in higher wages.Against that background, how much should we care about whatever headlines are generated by the next set of growth numbers? Very little, if at all. (To be clear, this statement also applies if the quarterly numbers come in worse than expected.) Short-term growth is noise, signifying nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Combat China\u2019s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAt the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow?These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn\u2019t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout?Here\u2019s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you\u2019re used to, could plan a role in the future.Does this sound un-American? It shouldn\u2019t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries\u2019 advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries.But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of \u2014 and will own \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy.You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in?But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. \u201cLife science and software get a lot of money,\u201d he said.I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development.But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China\u2019s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry.One huge problem with today\u2019s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now \u2014 as we\u2019re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy \u2014 there\u2019s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise.Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today\u2019s miracles.It\u2019s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes.A federal plan to win this or that industry isn\u2019t guaranteed to work. But at least it will prompt us, as a country, to think about what\u2019s coming.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Around the World, Readers React to Shifting U.S. Alliances", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some of the reactions from our international readers as Mr. Trump\u2019s trip unfolded. These responses have been edited and condensed for clarity.I am really pessimistic about the future of NATO, let alone a \u201cunited West\u201d that shares values and interests. It\u2019s pretty obvious that Trump does everything he can to destabilize the European Union \u2014 from the outside and from within by supporting people like Viktor Orban. He offered Macron a trade deal if he leaves the E.U.? He praises the Brexiteers? He tries to blackmail us? The starts of a trade war based on false claims? Seriously? What else should we Europeans tolerate? What more evidence do we need that he is not an ally?One of the reasons Europe spends less on arms is their generous expenditure on national health. Copying that would really make America great.\u2013 Paul, AustraliaI think that Trump wants to demonstrate to every person on Earth that he can govern successfully by lying and trying to force other nations to do what he wants them to do. He wants to be different from his predecessors, but in doing this he has just created chaos all over the world, easing the rise of populism in Europe. He has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, from the Iran nuclear deal, and now is threatening to withdraw also from NATO. If we want to stop populism, we heavily need the United States to lead all the democratic world against this threat, because otherwise the game is already lost.\u2013 Marco Ghilotta, ItalyNo wonder The Sun got the interview with Trump, because it\u2019s owned by Rupert Murdoch. The tabloid is a fierce euroskeptic and urged its readers to vote for Brexit. That Trump heaped praise on Boris Johnson, saying he would make a \u201cgreat\u201d prime minister, sounded like a death knell for Theresa May. Now he makes himself even more unpopular in Britain. But Trump has once again scored points with Putin \u2014 to sow discord within the E.U. and create uncertainty in Britain.\u2013 J. Von Hettlingen, SwitzerlandIn the U.K., we tend to do things a bit differently from Uncle Sam. There will be leftist millennials deciding to wave banners around screaming \u201cDown with Trump\u201d and most of these will be in leftist London or university cities, but the real British people that actually support Trump will do as always and sit at home following Trump on the news programs, agreeing with him and then chatting at work on the Trump visit. The M.S.M. part of the British media will promote everything that the protesters say, but that\u2019s because they are left-leaning, and please remember America, this isn\u2019t the whole of U.K. portraying these views, a lot of the U.K. do support Trump entirely.I am an 84-year-old woman in England. I have not witnessed any belief or trust in the president\u2019s attitude, apart from those who might seek some advantage for themselves in proclaiming their solidarity. I haven\u2019t seen this hopeful self-deception since Neville Chamberlain\u2019s return from Germany with his \u201cpeace in our time\u201d document. That was a frightening time, as is this, but eventually we lived through it. Possibly we shall eventually muddle our way through this, too, somehow.It would be great if this necessary investigation on foreign interference in U.S. elections, whose freedom was \u201chard fought,\u201d was accompanied by a comparatively detailed historical investigation of the U.S. interference in elections of so many other countries \u2014 totally dismissing other countries\u2019 democratic freedom. I think this should be an integral part of this discourse.\u2013 George T., ViennaIt\u2019s not winter (yet), but could this be the proverbial snowball that becomes the so-desperately-needed avalanche?\u2013 Francis, SwitzerlandThis is a total shame. The president of the U.S.A. is showing how weak he is. Traditional allies are not allies any more. Empowering enemies is the new American strategy. Russia is strong and ready for becoming what the U.S.S.R. once was and Europe is divided and under threat. This is the result of electing a president who doesn\u2019t know about history, democracy, liberty, humanity and transparency. Wake up American people! Make America a respectful country again!\u2013 Luis, PortugalIs not the principle job of the American president to protect American citizens and American interests and to defend the Constitution? Is that anyone\u2019s interpretation of what just happened in Europe? Or maybe I just missed an amendment to the Constitution wherein the interest of Vladimir Putin and his merry band of oligarchs comes first.\u2013 Kevo, SwedenI agree with our president that there is absolutely no collusion. On the other hand, there was probably collusion.\u2013 David U\u2019Prichard, GreeceWhat I find astonishing is that the most powerful country in the world has allowed itself to be in the position where a real estate salesman and reality TV star, with absolutely no diplomatic negotiating skills or experience, who thinks he doesn\u2019t need to read briefing memos or listen to expert advice, is meeting a man who spent 20 years working as an intelligence agent and then another 18 as a successful and all-powerful leader. If that isn\u2019t a recipe for disaster then what is?\u2013 RHR, FranceDonald Trump may be A problem, but he is not THE problem. The real problem is that half of U.S. voters went along with Trump, knowing exactly what kind of clown they were voting for \u2014 and that the whole of the G.O.P. is still going along with Trump, in spite of every lie, perverse act, or treachery. You can remove Trump, but you cannot remove that half of U.S. voters who still back Trump nor the Republican Party, who are betraying their country along with Trump, by assuaging everything Trump does, whatever he says and permitting his actions.\u2013 Michel Couxijn, AmsterdamGiven that Trump is really just a logical consequence of many longstanding, deep-rooted problems in the U.S. centering around education, worldliness, racism, bigotry, unfettered predatory capitalism, gerrymandering and the Electoral College \u2014 all now enhanced by social media \u2014 there is no logical reason for assuming that the U.S. will in the future become a stable and reliable partner.\u2013 Robert Sanders, JapanNew partnerships are going to be formed all over the world. Those who imagine they can simply dial back the good old days after Trump the Destroyer has finished the job of making America hated again, may be sorely mistaken. We are moving on and may never want to come back.The next chapter of commerce on this planet will have a more modest and sustainable cast. Economies largely based on consumerism, as in America, or speculation, as in China, will find themselves struggling to find traction with those that function just fine with less.America cannot be made great again in the manner Trump and those who will not stand up to him imagine. We are giving notice we will not be bought, or bullied, or insulted into enabling their outdated agenda.History will record that the Trump presidency presaged the decline of the American Empire as we have come to know it. Whether or not America succeeds in joining the rest of us as a decent and less self-serving partner remains to be seen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Addresses Criticism of Appearance With Putin: Full Transcript", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump addressed reporters on Tuesday before a meeting with lawmakers in the Cabinet Room of the White House.The president responded to criticism of his performance during a news conference a day earlier in Helsinki, Finland, when he appeared to side with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over American intelligence services regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.The following is a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement from the White House, as transcribed by The New York Times.________PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, everybody.Yesterday I returned from a trip from Europe where I met with leaders from across the region to seek a more peaceful future for the United States. We\u2019re working very hard with our allies and all over the world we\u2019re working. We\u2019re going to have peace. That\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have. I say peace through strength.I have helped the NATO alliance greatly by increasing defense contributions from our NATO allies by over $44 billion, and Secretary Stoltenberg was fantastic. As you know, he reported that they\u2019ve never had an increase like this in their history, and NATO was actually going down as opposed to going up.And I increased it by my meeting last year, $44 billion and this year will be over \u2014 it\u2019ll be hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years. And I think there\u2019s great unity with NATO.There\u2019s a lot of very positive things happening. There\u2019s a great spirit that we didn\u2019t have before and there\u2019s a lot of money that they\u2019re putting up. They weren\u2019t paying their bills on time and now they\u2019re doing that, and I want to just say thank you very much to Secretary Stoltenberg. He really has been terrific. So we had a tremendous success.I also had meetings with Prime Minister May on the range of issues concerning our special relationship, and that\u2019s between the United Kingdom and ourselves. We met with the queen, who is absolutely a terrific person, where she reviewed her honor guard for the first time in 70 years, they tell me. We walked in front of the underguard, and that was very inspiring to see and be with her. And I think the relationship, I can truly say, is a good one.She was very, very inspiring, indeed.Most recently I returned from Helsinki, Finland, and I was going to give a news conference over the next couple of days about the tremendous success because as successful as NATO was, I think this was our most successful visit and that had to do, as you know, with Russia.I met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an attempt to tackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity.Reports of the president\u2019s comments prompted outcry from some lawmakers, but they were followed by notable silence from others.We have never been in a worse relationship with Russia than we are as of a few days ago, and I think that\u2019s gotten substantially better and I think it has the possibility of getting much better, and I used to talk about this during the campaign. Getting along with Russia would be a good thing. Getting along with China would be a good thing.Not a bad thing, a good thing. In fact, a very good thing.We\u2019re nuclear powers, great nuclear powers. Russia and us have 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. So I\u2019ve always felt getting along is a positive thing, and not just for that reason. I entered the meeting with the firm conviction that diplomacy and engagement is better than hostility and conflict, and I feel that with everybody. We have 29 members in NATO as an example, and I have great relationships or at least very good relationships with everybody.The press covered it quite inaccurately. They said I insulted people. Well, if asking for people to pay up money that they are supposed to pay is insulting, maybe I did. But I can tell you when I left, everybody was thrilled and that\u2019s the way this was, too. My meeting with President Putin was really interesting in so many different ways because we haven\u2019t had relationships with Russia for a long time. And we started.Let me begin by saying that, once again, full faith and support for America\u2019s intelligence agencies, I have a full faith in our intelligence agencies.Oops, they just turned off the light. That must be the intelligence agencies. There it goes, O.K. You guys O.K.? Good. That was strange. But that\u2019s O.K. So I\u2019ll begin by stating that I have full faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies, always have. And I have felt very strongly that while Russia\u2019s actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying that \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this many times \u2014 I accept our intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place. It could be other people also. There\u2019s a lot of people out there. There was no collusion at all, and people have seen that and they\u2019ve seen that strongly.The House has already come out very strongly on that.A lot of people have come out strongly on that. I thought that I made myself very clear by having just reviewed the transcript.Now, I have to say, I came back and I said: \u201cWhat is going on? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d So I got a transcript. I reviewed it. I actually went out and reviewed a clip of an answer that I gave, and I realized that there is a need for some clarification.It should have been obvious, I thought it would be obvious but I would like to clarify just in case it wasn\u2019t. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word \u201cwould\u201d instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t.\u201d The sentence should have been \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t\u201d or \u201cwhy it wouldn\u2019t be Russia.\u201d So just to repeat it, I said the word \u201cwould\u201d instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t,\u201d and the sentence should have been, and I thought I would be maybe a little bit unclear on the transcript or unclear on the actual video.The sentence should have been \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia,\u201d sort of a double negative. So you can put that in and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself. I have on numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts and repel, we will stop it, we will repel it, any efforts to interfere in our elections. We\u2019re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018. And we have a lot of power. As you know, President Obama was given information just prior to the election, last election, 2016, and they decided not to do anything about it. The reason they decided that was pretty obvious to all. They thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. And they didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.When I won the election, they thought it was a very big deal. And all of a sudden they went into action, but it was a little bit late. So he was given that in sharp contrast to the way it should be. And President Obama along with Brennan and Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now, probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks, they knew about Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the election in September and they totally buried it.And as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Turned out it didn\u2019t happen that way. By contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance. It\u2019s a very firm stance on a strong action. We\u2019re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.The heads of the national security agencies on Thursday said that Russia was still trying to influence United States elections, contradicting statements made by President Trump.Furthermore, as has been stated and we\u2019ve stated it previously and on many occasions: no collusion.Yesterday, we made significant progress toward addressing some of the worst conflicts on Earth. So when I met with President Putin for about two and a half hours, we talked about numerous things. And among those things are the problems that you see in the Middle East. They\u2019re very much involved. We\u2019re very much involved. I entered the negotiations with President Putin from a position of tremendous strength.Our economy is booming and our military is being funded $700 billion this year, $716 billion next year. It will be more powerful as a military than we\u2019ve ever had before. President Putin and I addressed the range of issues starting with the civil war in Syria and need for humanitarian aid and help for people in Syria.We also spoke of Iran and the need to halt the nuclear ambitions and the destabilizing activities taking place in Iran. As most of you know, we ended the Iran deal, which was one of the worst deals anyone could imagine, and that\u2019s had a major impact on Iran and it\u2019s substantially weakened Iran and we hope that at some point Iran will call us and we\u2019ll maybe make a new deal or we maybe won\u2019t.But Iran is not the same country that it was five months ago, that I can tell you. They\u2019re no longer looking so much to the Mediterranean and the entire Middle East. They\u2019ve got some big problems that they can solve probably much easier if they deal with us. So we\u2019ll see what happens, but we did discuss Iran. We discussed Israel and the security of Israel, and President Putin is very much involved now with us and the discussion with Bibi Netanyahu on working something out with surrounding Syria and Syria \u2014 and specifically with regards to the security and long-term security of Israel.A major topic of discussion was North Korea and the need for it to remove its nuclear weapons. Russia has assured us of its support, President Putin said he agrees with me 100 percent and they\u2019ll do whatever they have to do to try and make it happen.Discussions are ongoing and they\u2019re going very, very well. We have no rush for speed. The sanctions are remaining. The hostages are back. There have been no tests. There have been no rockets going up for a period of nine months. And I think the relationships are very good, so we\u2019ll see how that goes. We have no time limit. We have no speed limit. We have \u2014 we\u2019re just going through the process, but the relationships are very good. President Putin is going to be involved in the sense that he is, he is with us.He would like to see that happen. Perhaps the most important issue we discussed at our meeting prior to the press conference was the reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world. The United States and Russia have 90 percent, as I said, and we can have a big impact. But nuclear weapons is, I think, the greatest threat of our world today. And they\u2019re a great nuclear power. We\u2019re a great nuclear power. We have to do something about nuclear, and so that was a matter that we discussed actually in great detail, and President Putin agrees with me.The matters we discussed are profound in their importance and have the potential to save millions of lives. I understand there are many disagreements between our countries, but I also understand that dialogue and the \u2014 when you think about it, dialogue with Russia or dialogue with other countries, but dialogue with Russia in this case where we\u2019ve had such poor relationships for so many years, dialogue is a very important thing and it\u2019s a very good thing.So if we get along with them, great. If we don\u2019t get along with them, then we won\u2019t get along with them, but I think we have a very good chance of having some very positive things. I thought that the meeting that I had with President Putin was really strong. I think that they were willing to do things that, frankly, I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not they would be willing to do.And we\u2019ll be having future meetings and we\u2019ll see whether or not that comes to fruition, but we had a very, very good meeting. So I just wanted to clear up, I have the strongest respect for our intelligence agencies headed by my people. We have great people, whether it\u2019s Gina or Dan Coats or any of them, I mean, we have tremendous people, tremendous talent within the agencies.I think they\u2019re being guided properly, and we all want the same thing. We want success for our country.So with that, we\u2019re going to start a meeting now on tax reductions. We\u2019re going to be putting in a bill. Kevin Brady is with us and I might ask Kevin just to say a couple of words about that and then we\u2019ll get back on to a private meeting. But Kevin, could you maybe just give a brief discussion about what we\u2019ll be talking about?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Architect of Cuomo\u2019s Buffalo Billion Project Is Convicted in Bid-Rigging Scheme", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlain E. Kaloyeros, a principal architect of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s signature economic development initiative, was convicted on Thursday in a bid-rigging scheme that steered hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts to favored companies in Buffalo and Syracuse.Dr. Kaloyeros, 62, was found guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy in the fourth week of a federal trial in Manhattan that invited harsh scrutiny of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ambitious plan to revitalize upstate and western New York, known as the Buffalo Billion.Mr. Cuomo, who has not been accused by prosecutors of any wrongdoing, said after the verdict that he had \u201cno tolerance for those who seek to defraud the system to advance their own personal interests. Anyone who has committed such an egregious act should be punished to the full extent of the law.\u201dSoon, the money began to flow to Buffalo; waterfront parks, gleaming modern factories and a cluster of medical and technology facilities were built.But at the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Dr. Kaloyeros and Todd R. Howe, a former lobbyist with ties to Mr. Cuomo, conspired to defraud Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, a nonprofit real estate arm of SUNY Polytechnic, by steering lucrative contracts to two firms whose executives were significant donors to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign.As part of the scheme, Dr. Kaloyeros and Mr. Howe tailored requests for proposals, or RFPs, to fit the specific qualifications possessed by the two companies \u2014 LPCiminelli, a Buffalo construction management firm, and COR Development, a Syracuse-area firm \u2014 and ensure that they be chosen by Fort Schuyler for the projects.LPCiminelli, for example, received a contract to build what became a $750 million solar-panel plant on the banks of the Buffalo River, while COR received contracts worth more than $100 million for other projects. Both firms were clients of Mr. Howe\u2019s.\u201cWhen Kaloyeros was entrusted by the State of New York to spend upward of a billion dollars of taxpayer money to prop up the economy of upstate New York, he turned around and shared the key to the vault with his friend Todd Howe and his clients,\u201d a prosecutor, Matthew Podolsky, said in a closing argument on Monday.Three of the firms\u2019 executives \u2014 Louis Ciminelli of LPCiminelli, and Steven Aiello and Joseph Gerardi, of COR \u2014 also were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud, and Mr. Gerardi was also found guilty of making a false statement.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said after the verdict that his client would appeal.\u201cAlain Kaloyeros is innocent,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe did not rig bids. Not a penny was lost. Not a bribe was paid. He did the best job that he could for the State of New York and for Fort Schuyler, and we\u2019re just utterly disappointed with the outcome of this case.\u201dMr. Gerardi\u2019s lawyer, Milton L. Williams Jr., said his client would appeal, as did Mr. Ciminelli\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman. Mr. Aiello\u2019s lawyer, Stephen R. Coffey, declined to comment.Mr. Shechtman said that it was \u201ca difficult time\u201d to try a political corruption case, and also said that his client was innocent.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s opponents and critics pointed to the Kaloyeros case as another example of the governor\u2019s poor decision-making and Albany\u2019s corrupt culture.Cynthia Nixon, the actress who is running a Democratic primary campaign against Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to believe that the master architect of the governor\u2019s economic development plan doled out nearly a billion dollars without the governor\u2019s knowledge or guidance? I, for one, don\u2019t believe that.\u201dShe added, \u201cAndrew Cuomo is either corrupt or he is spectacularly incompetent.\u201dGovernment watchdog groups said that the verdict, like dozens of previous cases touching on corruption in the state capital, was the result of a lack of strong ethics laws and enforcement.Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, citing the Kaloyeros verdict and the recent corruption convictions of Mr. Percoco and Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic State Assembly speaker, said, \u201cTrue justice can only be achieved through independence from politics or influence, and that has never been more important than today.\u201dRepublicans, who have not won a statewide election in New York since 2002, also wasted no time to depict the Kaloyeros and Percoco cases as indicative of the governor\u2019s bad management. \u201cThe facts that have been revealed in the two trials indisputably prove that Cuomo is the most crooked, corrupt governor New Yorkers have seen in more than a century,\u201d said Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party.Much of the prosecution\u2019s case was based on testimony of Kevin Schuler, a former LPCiminelli vice president who had pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government. Mr. Schuler testified that Mr. Howe had worked closely with LPCiminelli to customize the RFP to the firm\u2019s qualifications.\u201cWe had been asked to give input,\u201d Mr. Schuler said, adding, \u201cWe were in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201dDefense lawyers, in their summations in the Kaloyeros trial, harped on Mr. Howe\u2019s absence and the government\u2019s decision not to call him to the witness stand.\u201cI\u2019m submitting to you that the government didn\u2019t call Todd Howe because they know he\u2019s a liar,\u201d Mr. Williams, the lawyer for Mr. Gerardi, argued. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t want to call him because he would probably undercut their case.\u201dWhen charges in the Kaloyeros case were first announced in September 2016, prosecutors said in a criminal complaint that Mr. Ciminelli, Mr. Gerardi and Mr. Aiello had all been \u201csignificant contributors\u201d to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s election campaigns, \u201cat least in part to develop a relationship\u201d with the governor\u2019s office that would help them obtain the state-funded contracts.Mr. Howe, the complaint said, encouraged Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi to contribute \u201cso that the governor\u2019s office would know and remember them.\u201dProsecutors told the judge before trial that the government did not allege that the contributions, which were legal, were part of any quid-pro-quo arrangement.Ultimately, prosecutors removed references to the donations from the indictment and from the evidence introduced at trial. One reason may have been that Mr. Howe was not being called to describe how they came about.The judge, Valerie E. Caproni, scheduled the men\u2019s sentencing dates for October.An earlier version of this article misstated the executive from COR Development who was found guilty of making a false statement. It was Joseph Gerardi, not Steven Aiello.Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Affordable Housing Crisis Grows, HUD Sits on the Sidelines", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The country is in the grips of an escalating housing affordability crisis. Millions of low-income Americans are paying 70 percent or more of their incomes for shelter, while rents continue to rise and construction of affordable rental apartments lags far behind the need.The Trump administration\u2019s main policy response, unveiled this spring by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development: a plan to triple rents for about 712,000 of the poorest tenants receiving federal housing aid and to loosen the cap on rents on 4.5 million households enrolled in federal voucher and public housing programs nationwide, with the goal of moving longtime tenants out of the system to make way for new ones.As city and state officials and members of both parties clamor for the federal government to help, Mr. Carson has privately told aides that he views the shortage of affordable housing as regrettable, but as essentially a local problem.A former presidential candidate who said last year that he did not want to give recipients of federal aid \u201ca comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say, \u2018I\u2019ll just stay here; they will take care of me,\u2019\u201d he has made it a priority to reduce, rather than expand, assistance to the poor, to break what he sees as a cycle of dependency.And when congressional Democrats and Republicans scrambled to save his department\u2019s budget and rescue an endangered tax credit that accounts for nine out of 10 affordable housing developments built in the country, Mr. Carson sat on the sidelines, according to legislators and congressional staff members.Local officials seem resigned to the fact that they will receive little or no help from the Trump administration.\u201cTo be brutally honest, I think that we aren\u2019t really getting any help right now out of Washington, and the situation has gotten really bad over the last two years,\u201d said Chad Williams, executive director of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, which oversees public housing developments and voucher programs that serve 16,000 people in the Las Vegas area.Nevada, ground zero in the housing crisis a decade ago, is now the epicenter of the affordability crunch, with low-income residents squeezed out of once-affordable apartments by working-class refugees fleeing from California\u2019s own rental crisis.\u201cI think Carson\u2019s ideas, that public housing shouldn\u2019t be multigenerational, are noble,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cBut right now these programs are a stable, Band-Aid fix, and we really need them.\u201dUnderlying the conflict between Mr. Carson and officials like Mr. Williams are fundamental disagreements over the role the federal government should play.Mr. Carson believes federal aid should be regarded only as a temporary crutch for families moving from dependency to work and sees the rent increases as a way to expand his agency\u2019s budget. Low-income renters and many local officials who run housing programs see the federal assistance as a semi-permanent hedge against evictions and homelessness that needs to be expanded in times of crisis.This year, the White House proposed to slash $8.8 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s most important housing programs. While aides say Mr. Carson privately pushed for a restoration in programs for seniors and disabled people, he publicly supported the gutting of his own department, reiterating to lawmakers last month that he felt as much responsibility toward taxpayers as tenants.\u201cI continue to advocate for fiscal responsibility as well as compassion,\u201d Mr. Carson told a House committee in June. He declined to comment for this article.Under Mr. Carson\u2019s most significant policy proposal as secretary, so-called minimum rents paid by the poorest households in public housing would rise to $150 a month from $50.His proposal has received little support from local housing operators. Over the past month, Mr. Carson has huddled with Representative Dennis A. Ross, Republican of Florida, who is drafting less stringent legislation that would allow, but not mandate, local housing authorities to raise rents and carry out reforms to streamline the process of verifying the poverty of applicants, aides said.Still, both proposals represent a paradigm shift in federal housing policy, ending the requirement that low-income tenants spend no more than 30 percent of their net income on rent.Tying rents to incomes has been a central part of the system since 1981, especially for the Section 8 housing voucher program, enabling 2.1 million low-income families to rent private apartments they could not otherwise afford. Mr. Carson\u2019s proposal would peg rents to 35 percent of gross income for all tenants. The Ross bill excludes voucher recipients, at the request of local housing authority officials.\u201cWe need sensible reforms to make the system more efficient for agencies and residents,\u201d said Adrianne Todman, chief executive of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. \u201cBut now is not the time for arbitrary federal rent hikes.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t about dependence,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president of the nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group that has released several recent reports documenting the affordability crunch. \u201cToday\u2019s housing crisis is squarely rooted in the widening gap between incomes and housing costs.\u201dAnd the crisis didn\u2019t begin under Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.Median national rents rose by 32 percent in constant dollars from 2001 to 2015, while wages remained flat, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The pace has picked up over the last few years, buoyed by an improving economy.The rent increases are hitting poor and elderly people, African-Americans and low-income wage earners the hardest. A survey by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a worker earning the state minimum wage could afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in only 22 of the country\u2019s 3,000 counties.The Obama administration initially proposed steep increases for Section 8 and other programs, but pulled back after the Republicans won control of the House in 2010.During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama promised to fund an affordable housing trust fund for the construction of new units. But the $200-million-a-year program, funded by the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was blocked by Republican lawmakers until 2014. In 2017, it was on track to finance the construction of about 1,000 units of affordable housing in 32 states, according to federal data.Its sister program, the Capital Magnet Fund, which has leveraged private investment to create 17,000 new units, is in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who tried to cut it by $141.7 million this year as part of his unsuccessful budget recession effort this summer.Under Mr. Trump, funding for public housing, vouchers and new construction has risen slightly \u2014 against the president\u2019s wishes.In March, Republican and Democratic negotiators rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, adding $1.25 billion to HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs and injecting an additional $425 million to the HOME program, which funds state, local, nonprofit and private partnerships to build affordable housing.Those moves, while significant, are likely to have a limited impact on the larger problem of the increasing number of families who cannot afford a place to live.While prices are cooling at the high end of the market in many big cities, the low- and middle-income housing markets in Nevada, Texas, California, Florida and Colorado are so hot, local officials say, that landlords routinely reject subsidized tenants because they can charge more to other renters.Rental construction has focused on attracting high-income tenants. From 2001 to 2013, the number of rental apartments for high-wage earners increased by 36 percent, while units for poor people shrank by nearly 10 percent, according to federal housing statistics.With affordable stock scarce, prices are spiking. An estimated 12 million Americans, most of them poor, now spend more than half of their earnings on housing, according to HUD statistics.One of them is Judith Toro Fortyz, 75, who receives $848 a month in Social Security and pays $594.88 of it to remain in the small two-bedroom apartment on Staten Island that she once shared with her mother.Mrs. Toro Fortyz has been turned down for federal vouchers, reflecting a shortage in assistance that has shut out three of every four eligible applicants for Section 8. Even with an additional housing stipend from the city, she is spending 70 percent of her income on rent.That has forced her to make wrenching decisions, like forgoing her favorite fruit, oranges, after a price spike at her local supermarket.\u201cI stay home a lot. I\u2019d rather not go out because going out means you have to spend money,\u201d said Mrs. Toro Fortyz, a retired data storage worker. \u201cI have a friend who gets Section 8 and, oh my God, they pay $200 a month. I can\u2019t even imagine having that much money to live on.\u201dMr. Carson\u2019s proposal alarmed many low-income tenants, especially older ones, who could face significant rent increases under the plan. \u201cWe basically wouldn\u2019t be able to get by,\u201d said Patrick Greene, 69, a retired truck driver who lives in a small HUD-subsidized apartment with his wife in Montgomery, Ala.A more immediate threat to affordable housing, critics say, is the huge tax bill passed by Congress last year, which imperils one of the most important sources of long-term funding, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.Novogradac & Company, a firm that provides analytics for the construction and finance industries, estimated that demand for the $9-billion-a-year credit could dry up as investors realize savings through the tax cuts. The firm estimates that nearly 235,000 fewer apartments could be built over the next decade as a result of the tax code rewrite.A bipartisan coalition, led by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, was able to expand the credit by an additional $400 million. But that is not likely to offset the damage done by the tax measure.The administration is observing these efforts from the sidelines. Mr. Trump, scion of a New York real estate family that made its fortune in the 1950s and 1960s building affordable housing for white working-class neighborhoods, has shown little interest in tackling the problem.He made only passing mention of the issue during the 2016 campaign and has pressed Mr. Carson to move more aggressively to impose work requirements on federal aid recipients.For his part, Mr. Carson publicly acknowledges the crisis in most of his speeches. \u201cAlarmingly high numbers of Americans continue to pay more than half of their incomes toward rent,\u201d he told a House panel in October. \u201cMany millions remain mired in poverty, rather than being guided on a path out of it.\u201dBut he is focused less on federal solutions than on prodding local governments to ease barriers to construction. He has ordered his policy staff to come up with proposals to push local governments to reduce zoning restrictions on new projects, especially low-cost manufactured housing. HUD will also begin working with landlords around the country to come up with ways to make housing vouchers more attractive and more inclusive, aides said.\u201cSubsidies are a piece of the puzzle,\u201d said Raffi Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Carson, \u201cbut we must also address the regulatory barriers relative to zoning and land use in higher-cost markets that are preventing the construction of new affordable housing. This is not just a federal problem \u2014 it\u2019s everybody\u2019s problem.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly a policy proposal by the housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson. It is the so-called minimum rents paid by the poorest households that would rise to $150, not the maximum rents.Advertisement"}

But this long, erudite jeremiad from a prestigious professor has carried more weight.Over recent months, China has been grappling with a growing trade dispute with the United States. Some Chinese foreign policy experts have suggested that the trade fights with the Trump administration could have been contained if Beijing had been more flexible and moved faster to douse triumphalist statements about its goals.On Tuesday, Mr. Xi convened a meeting of the Politburo \u2014 a 25-member party leadership council \u2014 that warned of economic tests while promising to keep growth steady.The undercurrent of discontent does not pose any immediate threat to Mr. Xi\u2019s hold on power. He and the Communist Party remain firmly in control. And many Chinese people endorse his tough campaign against corruption and his vows to build China into a great power that will not compromise over territorial disputes.But party insiders and foreign experts said misgivings about Mr. Xi\u2019s hard-line policies appeared to be building among intellectuals, liberal-minded former officials and middle-class people after the recent misfires. A former official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that many former colleagues had shared Professor Xu\u2019s essay.Over time, he and others said, such criticism could coalesce into deeper disaffection that erodes Mr. Xi\u2019s authority and gives other senior officials more courage to question his decisions.\u201cThe harder question then becomes what that actually means in practice,\u201d Mr. McGregor said in emailed answers to questions. \u201cIf it means heightened infighting in elite politics, it might result in policy paralysis and instability, rather than just a freer and more open debate.\u201d\u201cAs things continue in this direction, the question arises whether reform and opening up will come to a halt and totalitarian rule will return,\u201d Professor Xu said in the essay, written in a densely classical style speckled with recondite phrases and historical allusions. \u201cAt this time, no other anxiety weighs most heavily on most people.\u201dParty leaders still revere Deng, even though Mr. Xi has jettisoned some of his pragmatic policies. But more liberal-minded former officials have also embraced Deng as an icon, casting him as a more moderate leader to highlight the swaggering overreach that they say Mr. Xi has brought.\u201cToday Xi is clearly parting ways with elements of what Deng supported, such as more open intellectual debate, greater separation of party and state, and \u2018biding time\u2019 in international relations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for critics of Xi, Deng may be a useful symbolic weapon because of his stature as a particular type of reformer.\u201dOthers see signs that the Communist Party has been cooling its glorification of Mr. Xi. In his essay, Professor Xu said that the propaganda echoed the cult of personality that surrounded Mao Zedong, and he called for \u201cslamming on the brakes.\u201dBut speculation shared among some of Mr. Xi\u2019s critics in Beijing and on the internet that unhappy party officials and elders had forced a full-scale retreat from the adulation appears to be unfounded.Professor Xu\u2019s future may now become a test of whether Mr. Xi will display greater tolerance of criticism.\u201cI have said what I must and am in the hands of fate,\u201d he wrote at the end of his essay. \u201cHeaven will decide whether we rise or fall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Military Strides Into Politics, by the Ballot or by Force", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Members of Brazil\u2019s armed forces, who have largely stayed out of political life since the end of the military dictatorship 30 years ago, are making their biggest incursion into politics in decades, with some even warning of a military intervention.Retired generals and other former officers with strong ties to the military leadership are mounting a sweeping election campaign, backing about 90 military veterans running for an array of posts \u2014 including the presidency \u2014 in national elections this October. The effort is necessary, they argue, to rescue the nation from an entrenched leadership that has mismanaged the economy, failed to curb soaring violence and brazenly stolen billions of dollars through corruption.And if the ballot box does not bring change quickly enough, some prominent former generals warn that military leaders may feel compelled to step in and reboot the political system by force.The military\u2019s push into politics is a major shift \u2014 and for many Brazilians, a worrisome one. The country\u2019s military dictatorship lasted 21 years before ending in 1985. Since then, Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest country, has experienced its longest stretch of democratic rule. Many are fiercely protective of the separation between politics and the military, guarding against any potential slide toward authoritarian rule.But the former generals, officers and veterans organizing campaigns for October\u2019s national elections say that \u201cmilitary values\u201d like discipline, integrity and patriotism are vital to fixing Brazil, a nation they consider poorly governed, dangerously polarized and embarrassingly irrelevant on the world stage.Analysts and politicians say the chances of a military intervention are probably remote, but they are wary of the rising political profile of military figures, particularly because the country has not fully come to terms with its authoritarian past.\u201cThe eventual election of these military officials may lead to the adoption of authoritarian proposals, especially when it comes to public security,\u201d said Carlos Fico, a historian at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.The growing appeal of Brazil\u2019s armed forces in politics comes amid a rightward shift in South America and rising authoritarianism in democratic nations including Poland, Hungary, the Philippines and Turkey.\u201dIn each country, this movement has a different facet, but in the background it has to do with dissatisfaction and fear,\u201d said Mr. Fico.Mr. Mour\u00e3o, the former general, and other retired officers are avidly backing the presidential bid of a far-right congressman, Jair Bolsonaro, a tough-talking former army captain who has proposed contentious measures to restore order, including giving the police freer rein to kill criminals.The campaigns seize on broad frustrations across Brazil. Faith in the nation\u2019s democracy and government institutions has cratered in recent years, especially after the 2016 impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and the enormous kickback schemes that have tainted all major political parties.Since then, calls for a military intervention have grown louder, perhaps most strikingly during a nationwide truckers strike in May that paralyzed the country for more than a week.\u201cThis is a cry of desperation against all of this corruption,\u201d said Luciano Zucco, a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel who took a leave of absence from the army this month to run for a state legislature seat. Still Mr. Zucco said he was opposed to a coup. \u201cThe intervention has to happen through votes,\u201d he said.\u201cThe generals I have met would not be seduced by these types of adventures of a military intervention,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere are many people trying to create the conditions for that, but for my part, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201dMaur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University, said that while no one in Brazil was calling for a lasting dictatorship, many Brazilians, particularly those who did not live through military rule, found the idea of a short intervention appealing.\u201cFour years ago, I would have said never, but now I would say, It\u2019s not probable, but in some circumstances it could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have many people in Brazil who like the idea of the military throwing out the current political class and in six months calling for a new election.\u201dThe debate over such an intervention has grown as active duty and retired high-ranking generals have weighed in on political issues in ways not seen since the dictatorship years.General B\u00f4as, the commander of the army, took the highly unusual step in April of issuing a statement on Twitter that was widely interpreted as a warning to the Supreme Court.At the time, the justices were considering whether former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva should begin serving a 12-year sentence for corruption. It was a particularly big decision, because Mr. da Silva was running for president again and appeared to be the front-runner in the race.Eli\u00e9ser Gir\u00e3o Monteiro, a former army general who is running to be governor in Rio Grande do Norte, has called for the impeachment of members of the Supreme Court over decisions that have led to the release of politicians convicted of corruption.The political system created by the 1988 Constitution had become a \u201ccave that apparently has no emergency exit,\u201d Mr. Monteiro said in an interview. While he personally does not support a military takeover, he added, \u201cThe only emergency exit people are talking about is a military intervention.\u201dMr. Mour\u00e3o, the former general, said that none of his contemporaries relished the idea of rupturing the democratic order. But he said that unrest could force their hands if the judiciary\u2019s crackdown was stymied or if violence continued to surge.\u201cWe want to adhere to the rule of law as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Mour\u00e3o said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let the country stumble into chaos.\u201dWhen the military took power in 1964, leaders of the junta argued that Brazil was drifting toward Communism. Military leaders still do not refer to that era as a dictatorship, contending that the armed forces in fact preserved democracy by sparing Brazil from the rule of authoritarian socialists.Brazil\u2019s economy grew briskly during the early years of military rule, leading some historians to refer to the era as an \u201ceconomic miracle.\u201d But foreign debt ballooned during that period and inequality widened, setting the stage for a hyperinflation crisis that crippled the economy during the 1980s.The press was censored and the absence of an independent judiciary meant that abuses and corruption were seldom investigated. Before the military gave up power, the government passed an amnesty law that has shielded officials of that era.The amnesty law has prevented Brazil from undergoing the kind of post-dictatorship reckoning that has kept the militaries of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay at arms length from politics, analysts say.The lack of accountability could also enable a younger generation of Brazilians to romanticize what a new military intervention could bring, said Pedro Dallari, a jurist who oversaw the truth commission.\u201cThe fact that the memory of the dictatorship dimmed with time, because the problems weren\u2019t confronted, generates this risk,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain, Time to Let Go of the \u2018Anglosphere\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe other members of this outdated idea of family couldn\u2019t care less.Mr. Kenny is a professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge. Mr. Pearce is a professor of public policy at the University of Bath and a former head of the No.10 Downing Street Policy Unit.Is there a family of English-speaking nations, united by cultural values, liberal market economies, the common law and democracy, that is waiting to welcome Britain with open arms after it frees itself from the constraints of the European Union? Some optimists think so. President Trump arrived in Britain on Thursday for a visit meant to \u201ccelebrate the strong business links between our two countries,\u201d according to Downing Street. And maybe to renew kinship and ties between Britain and the United States? Unlikely. The problem is that in British politics, the Anglosphere has always been a paradox: a politically useful idea that has never lived up to the ambitions of its advocates. The idea of a family of English-speaking nations was useful in arguments about the rise of rival powers, like the United States, in the 19th century. It was useful when politicians were imagining, and telegraphing, the future of the British Empire between the world wars. And it was useful during the soul-searching about Britain\u2019s place in the world that accompanied decolonization and Britain\u2019s entry to the European Community.Then, in the early 1990s, after the Maastricht Treaty created the European Union, those who were skeptical of Britain\u2019s participation in the whole European project reinvented the Anglosphere, somewhat, as a way to imagine Britain\u2019s future as a global, deregulated and privatized economy outside the European Union. It\u2019s this idealized version of the Anglosphere that was an important part of why Britain, in June 2016, decided to leave the European Union.Now, as the British government grapples with the fraught policy questions that leaving the union raises, the Anglosphere is a balm for those same Euroskeptics, who argue that Britain should just strike out on its own and make its own trade deals with some of the world\u2019s leading economies, including the United States, Australia and New Zealand, as well as rising Asian powers like India.But has the idea of the Anglosphere ever actually existed outside of the imaginations of British politicians?The late-Victorian statesman Joseph Chamberlain tried to unite the settler dominions of the British Empire, like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in a tariff union, but he was defeated by fierce resistance from free-traders, the City of London and working-class voters who responded to concerns that the price of food would rise as a result.After World War II, the Conservative leader Winston Churchill famously sought to place Britain at the critical intersection of the \u201cthree majestic circles\u201d of the British Empire and Commonwealth, the English-speaking countries of North America and a \u201cUnited Europe.\u201d But at that point, British power was already on the wane. Instead, the Cold War world was dominated by the superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union. Churchill\u2019s vision did not survive the changing economic and political realities of the 1950s and \u201960s.In the 1960s, the iconoclastic Conservative Enoch Powell railed against allowing subjects of the former British Empire to immigrate to Britain \u2014 a legacy of imperial overreach that he believed was endangering the culture and heritage of England. Powell thought that the only kind of national community that could prosper was one where its members share the same racial background, culture and customs. But \u2014 though he had his supporters \u2014 his attempts to prevent Commonwealth immigrants from making Britain their home was defeated by the growing diversity of multicultural Britain and the unwillingness of the Conservative Party to adopt his agenda.Whenever anyone has tried to actually apply the idea of an Anglosphere, in its various guises, it has always collided with reality. Economic interest or politics or national security has never been enough to persuade the peoples of these different countries to enter into an Anglosphere alliance. And the current Brexit-loving advocates of a global Britain, leading the world in free trade, will meet the same fate.President Trump may agree to a new trade deal with Britain, but it\u2019s unlikely that Britain would decide the terms, a prospect that is fraught with political risks for the British government. Such a deal raises the specter of British voters eating chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef while watching the revered National Health Service being opened up to American multinationals.For Australia and New Zealand, trade links with China and Asia are much more important than those with Britain. And Canada, as a member of Nafta, has long been oriented toward the massive American market. Security and intelligence cooperation among these states and Britain in the so-called Five Eyes group is critical, as is NATO membership, but this kind of cooperation does not require a new Anglosphere bloc.In reality, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand show no inclination to join Britain in new political and economic alliances. More likely, they would rather continue to work within the existing institutions \u2014 like the European Union and the World Trade Organization \u2014 and remain indifferent to, or just perplexed by, Britain\u2019s calls for some kind of formalized Anglosphere alliance.Some pomp and ceremony on this visit might improve relations between Mrs. May and Mr. Trump, which reportedly are not very warm. But it\u2019s sensible to be skeptical that Mr. Trump will think that the Anglosphere is any kind of answer for the United States, just as it has never really been the answer in the past. Despite this, and despite its practical shortcomings, the idea of the Anglosphere will probably endure.The tragedy of the different national orientations that have emerged in British politics after empire \u2014 whether pro-European, Anglo-American, Anglospheric or some combination of these \u2014 is that none of them has yet been the compelling, coherent and popular answer to the country\u2019s most important question: How should Britain find its way in the wider, modern world?As long as that is still being asked, the Anglosphere will continue to be an answer for some of Britain\u2019s political dreamers.Michael Kenny and Nick Pearce are authors of \u201cShadows of Empire: The Anglosphere in British Politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I\u2019m a Crypto Skeptic", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistI\u2019m still on vacation, hiking and biking in various parts of Europe. I\u2019m keeping up with the news, more or less, but am only occasionally and unpredictably in a place and condition where I can actually write something and post it.It comes down to two things: transaction costs and the absence of tethering. Let me explain.If you look at the broad sweep of monetary history, there has been a clear direction of change over time: namely, one of reducing the frictions of doing business and the amount of real resources required to deal with those frictions.First there were gold and silver coins, which were heavy, required lots of security, and consumed a lot of resources to produce.Even so, the system still required substantial amounts of commodity money. But central banking, in which private banks held their reserves as deposits at the central bank rather than in gold or silver, greatly reduced this need, and the shift to fiat money eliminated it almost completely.Meanwhile, people gradually shifted away from cash transactions, first toward payments by check, then to credit and debit cards and other digital methods.Set against this history, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies seems very odd, because it goes exactly in the opposite of the long-run trend. Instead of near-frictionless transactions, we have high costs of doing business, because transferring a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency unit requires providing a complete history of past transactions. Instead of money created by the click of a mouse, we have money that must be mined \u2014 created through resource-intensive computations.Banknotes worked because people knew something about the banks that issued them, and these banks had an incentive to preserve their reputation. Governments have occasionally abused the privilege of creating fiat money, but for the most part governments and central banks exercise restraint, again because they care about their reputations. But you\u2019re supposed to be sure that a Bitcoin is real without knowing who issued it, so you need the digital equivalent of biting a gold coin to be sure it\u2019s the real deal, and the costs of producing something that satisfies that test have to be high enough to discourage fraud.In other words, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are effectively celebrating the use of cutting-edge technology to set the monetary system back 300 years. Why would you want to do that? What problem does it solve? I have yet to see a clear answer to that question.Bear in mind that conventional money generally does its job quite well. Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable \u2013 orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens. So why change to a form of money that works far less well?Indeed, eight years after Bitcoin was launched, cryptocurrencies have made very few inroads into actual commerce. A few firms will accept them as payment, but my sense is that this is more about signaling \u2014 look at me, I\u2019m cutting-edge! \u2014 than about real usefulness. Crypocurrencies have a large market valuation, but they\u2019re overwhelmingly being held as a speculative play, not because they\u2019re useful as mediums of exchange.Does this mean that crypto is a pure bubble, which will eventually deflate to nothing? It\u2019s worth pointing out that there are other currency-like assets that don\u2019t actually get much use as money, but which people hold anyway. Gold hasn\u2019t been actual money for a very long time, yet it retains its value.Now, large-denomination notes aren\u2019t regularly used for payments \u2014 in fact, many stores won\u2019t accept them. So what\u2019s all that cash holding about? We all know the answer: tax evasion, illicit activity, etc. And much of that is outside the U.S., with estimates suggesting that foreigners hold more than half of U.S. currency.Clearly, cryptocurrencies are in effect competing for some of the same business: very few people are using Bitcoin to pay their bills, but some people are using it to buy drugs, subvert elections, and so on. And the examples of both gold and large-denomination banknotes suggest that this kind of demand could support a lot of asset value. So does this mean that crypto, even if it isn\u2019t the transformative technology its backers claim, may not be a bubble?Well, this is where tethering \u2014 or, more precisely, its absence for cryptocurrencies \u2014 comes in.In normal life, people don\u2019t worry about where the value of green pieces of paper bearing portraits of dead presidents comes from: we accept dollar notes because other people will accept dollar notes. Yet the value of a dollar doesn\u2019t come entirely from self-fulfilling expectations: ultimately, it\u2019s backstopped by the fact that the U.S. government will accept dollars as payment of tax liabilities \u2014 liabilities it\u2019s able to enforce because it\u2019s a government. If you like, fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do. And this means that their value isn\u2019t a bubble that can collapse if people lose faith.And the value of those $100 bills sitting in drug lords\u2019 lairs or whatever is in turn tethered to the value of smaller denominations back in America.To some extent gold is in a similar situation. Most gold just sits there, possessing value because people believe it possesses value. But gold does have real-world uses, both for jewelry and for things like filling teeth, that provide a weak but real tether to the real economy.Will that happen? I think it\u2019s more likely than not, partly because of the gap between the messianic rhetoric of crypto and the much more mundane real possibilities. That is, there might be a potential equilibrium in which Bitcoin (although probably not other cryptocurrencies) remain in use mainly for black market transactions and tax evasion, but that equilibrium, if it exists, would be hard to get to from here: once the dream of a blockchained future dies, the disappointment will probably collapse the whole thing.So that\u2019s why I\u2019m a crypto skeptic. Could I be wrong? Of course. But if you want to argue that I\u2019m wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve? Don\u2019t just try to shout down the skeptics with a mixture of technobabble and libertarian derp.Advertisement"}

Bush and the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under President Barack Obama.President Trump\u2019s next two summits, first with NATO allies in Brussels, then with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, will either restore American global leadership or kill it off, depending on how he plays our hand.Unity at NATO, followed by a firm encounter with Mr. Putin, would demonstrate American resolve to stand with allies and stand up to strategic competitors. Or Mr. Trump could squander all the power and leverage of the United States by abusing and dividing our allies, then lavishing praise and freebies on an autocrat he admires who is set on undermining our democracy and global position. It all depends which President Trump shows up in Brussels and Helsinki \u2014 the one his national security adviser says wants a strong NATO, or the man who regularly calls NATO \u201cobsolete.\u201dTraditionally, an American president gains when he meets a Kremlin boss with the wind of allied unity at his back. If he uses the NATO meeting to coordinate his message to Moscow, he multiplies the impact by speaking for dozens of free countries, not just America. And a Trump-Putin summit is overdue. The mountain of problems we have with Russia requires leader-to-leader talks because Mr. Putin has neutered decision-making at all other levels of his government.The Trump team, led on alliance issues by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, is poised to have a successful NATO summit if the president can take \u201cyes\u201d for an answer. The combined defense budget of NATO nations has grown by $14.4 billion since Mr. Trump took office (increases began under Barack Obama). All but one of 28 allies are increasing spending, and 26 are sending more troops to NATO missions. Sixteen are on track to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024, NATO\u2019s target.Rather than thrash allies, the president should celebrate this success, take credit for it, and accelerate bilateral work to help close remaining spending gaps. Other NATO achievements worth celebrating include two new military commands that will increase the readiness of alliance forces and speed deployments. These moves, directed against any further territorial ambitions Moscow may have, should strengthen Mr. Trump\u2019s hand at Helsinki.The leverage NATO gives Mr. Trump at the Putin summit will be wasted, however, if the message from Brussels mirrors the president\u2019s presentation at the Group of 7 meeting last month: Allies are feckless free-riders, America doesn\u2019t need them and it\u2019s the planet\u2019s autocrats who deserve our respect.Mr. Putin, the biggest winner from any disunity in NATO, is counting on the second outcome. The only additional thing he needs to make his Helsinki meeting a success is money. Here, Mr. Trump is holding a hand nearly as strong as Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1982 \u2014 if he plays it right. Mr. Putin survives on a governance model that requires $60-per-barrel oil, total political control of his citizenry and a kleptocratic stranglehold on the economy. The reform Russia needs is impossible without more power-sharing than he will allow.A population that he once intoxicated with military deployments in Crimea and Syria now cares most about improvements in Russia\u2019s hospitals, according to recent polls. And after four years of those costly deployments, along with sanctions and low-to-zero growth, Mr. Putin\u2019s government is broke. He has run through half of the sovereign wealth Russia saved in the oil boom of his first two terms as president, starting in 2000; the cost of living has increased for most Russians by 15 percent or more; and last week, the Russian Duma had to raise value-added taxes and the pension age to increase revenue.Mr. Putin, therefore, needs more from the United States and the West than we need from him. He needs sanctions relief. He needs direct foreign investment and trade. He needs the New Start nuclear accord extended when it expires in 2021 so he doesn\u2019t have to pay for a new generation of weapons. He wants the United States out of Syria so that Russian forces can take over the eastern oil fields we now protect, and use income from those fields to pay for the war, among other motives. He knows that if Russia\u2019s financial situation doesn\u2019t improve, he could be presiding over a 21st-century \u201cUpper Volta with rockets,\u201d as Dean Acheson once called the Soviet Union.This gives Mr. Trump considerable leverage in Helsinki if he plays our hand strongly, as Reagan would have. Rather than ceding Crimea, forgiving Mr. Putin\u2019s interference in our elections and offering sanctions relief free, Mr. Trump \u2014 with NATO at his back \u2014 can make American diplomacy great again if he demonstrates to Mr. Putin that normal relations with us require civilized global behavior by Russia. The alternative \u2014 a NATO in tatters and a re-energized Mr. Putin \u2014 would leave America weaker and Mr. Trump the loser in the great power competition he himself has declared.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Healthy Is Your Office?", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetFor decades, many developers and architects worked to ensure that their buildings were kind to the planet. Now, their focus is on the effect that buildings have on the people who work in them.Delos\u2019s new headquarters, on the fourth and fifth floors of a 10-story tower in Manhattan, were designed by the architecture firm Gensler. The 19,000-square-foot office space houses 70 employees and serves as a showplace for the Well standard.In the reception area, where a tour of the office was about to begin on a recent afternoon, the air quality was good. There was proof: A digital display measuring about 6\u00bd feet by 12 feet covering one wall showed the indoor temperature, the humidity level, and other measurements of cleanliness and comfort with data supplied by sensors throughout the office.\u201cWe have 51 sensors, which is extreme overkill,\u201d said Janna Wandzilak, a Delos director, who was leading our tour.Triple-filtered air whooshes in from floor vents, while ceiling ducts suck out carbon dioxide-filled air. Plants cascading from walls and partitions also help clean the air while satisfying our innate need to connect to nature, a concept known as biophilia.Standing desks are everywhere, and a wide oak staircase stretches between the lower and upper floors, encouraging staff to walk up and down rather than take the elevator \u2014 all contributing to fitness.\u201cI definitely find myself sitting less,\u201d Paul Scialla, Delos\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview in his office, which was decorated with framed photos. One showed him with the wellness guru Deepak Chopra, a member of the Delos advisory board.After 18 years trading bonds on Wall Street, Mr. Scialla founded the company in 2014, having identified an untapped market at the intersection of real estate and the booming wellness movement.The Well system has criteria in seven categories that promote the health of a building\u2019s occupants, including nourishment \u2014 which explains the almond butter, the whole-grain bread and the organic apples in the Delos cafe. The other categories are air, comfort, fitness, light, mind and water.According to Delos, 954 projects in 35 countries are registered for Well, certified or precertified; 327 of them are in the United States, including 24 in New York. The vast majority of projects are offices. Not surprisingly, the Delos headquarters achieved the most demanding level of certification, platinum.The workplaces are designed to coax people to change their behavior. Stairs are placed front and center, for instance, to encourage their use.But occupants benefit simply from being in an office that has been designed to optimize their health. For instance, the circadian lighting that changes throughout the day, keeping pace with the brightening and dimming of sunlight, has been shown to improve sleeping at night.\u201cIf we can engineer the box we spend 90 percent of our lives in to deliver health care automatically, that\u2019s a very big impact,\u201d Mr. Scialla said.Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fitwel is based primarily on public health data and promotes strategies shown to have the greatest effect on health.Started last year, Fitwel is essentially a do-it-yourself web-based checklist and scoring system. A building owner or manager enters information about a facility and submits photographic evidence.\u201cIt was designed to be so simple that you can walk around a building with a tablet and check on a checklist and take photos with the tablet and upload them,\u201d said Liz York, the C.D.C.\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cAt the end, you click a button.\u201dReviewers process the information and give the user a score as well as a to-do list to improve office conditions.Some companies, such as the commercial real estate firm Tishman Speyer, which has a seat on Fitwel\u2019s advisory board, are applying the program across their portfolio of buildings.\u201cYou can use Fitwel in an individual building, but we want to support massive users,\u201d said Joanna Frank, president and chief executive of the Center for Active Design. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at large-scale market transformation.\u201dCertification for Fitwel costs far less than that for Well.The Well program costs $1,800 to $4,200 to register, depending on square footage, and $7,500 to $131,250 to certify. This does not account for the financial outlay to apply the health-promoting features required to achieve certification.Furthermore, recertification every three years is recommended, to ensure that offices continue to be healthy places.Fitwel charges $500 to register and $6,000 to certify. And the financial outlay required to meet some recommendations can be quite modest. One recommendation might be to put up signs directing employees to the stairs to encourage their use; another might be to set aside a lactation room or a station for nursing mothers.Even after attaining Fitwel certification, building managers can work to increase scores \u2014 and enhance interiors \u2014 by making additional investments as their budgets allow.The expected improvements in employee wellness from either program can result in productivity gains, including lower health care costs, lower rates of absenteeism and increased revenue from better employee performance.The American Society of Interior Designers said it had achieved a 16 percent productivity gain after moving into its Well-certified headquarters in Washington two years ago. The organization, which spent about $2 million outfitting the space, tracked the impact of the design and found increased engagement and reduced absenteeism, Randy W. Fiser, the chief executive, said.Mr. Fiser, who is also a member of the Delos advisory board, said the organization added nearly $700,000 to its bottom line in its first year from the productivity increase as well as savings from energy costs.However, the desire to attract staff seems to be driving many companies to turn to programs that help them develop healthy offices, according to architects and designers who work with clients on such projects.\u201cIn today\u2019s economy, people can change jobs,\u201d said Paula McEvoy, an architect and co-director of sustainable design for Perkins & Will, which last year completed two Well-certified projects and five Fitwel certifications. \u201cThey can choose their workplace.\u201dWith the two certification systems doing essentially the same thing, some designers say there can be confusion over the programs.But Ms. Frank of the Center for Active Design brushes that off.\u201cWe believe there\u2019s room in the marketplace for both certifications,\u201d she said, adding that the existence of two programs might strengthen the healthy-office message.\u201cThe more people talking about promoting health in the workplace, the better,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Enduring Racism", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySe-woong Koo is\u00a0the publisher of an English-language\u00a0magazine in Seoul.South Korea has long been intolerant of outsiders, but the outrage triggered by this small number of Yemenis arriving on our shores shows how deep xenophobia runs here. For all of South Korea\u2019s success as a democracy and as a thriving economy, compassion and humanitarian instincts are in short supply. And the government bears much of the blame for fostering this selfish mind-set.As of 2016, slightly more than two million foreigners were living legally in this country. Even when an estimated 210,000 undocumented migrants are counted, foreigners account for only around 4 percent of the total population of about 51 million.By comparison, asylum seekers as a share of the population in South Korea were 0.02 percent in 2017, while the figure in Germany \u2014 one of the most popular destination countries for refugees \u2014 was 0.24 percent that same year.The reaction against the Yemenis, while shocking, is not a surprise. Almost a decade ago, in 2009, an Indian scholar in Seoul pursued a criminal complaint against a South Korean man who hurled racial and sexist slurs at him and his female South Korean companion (who was insulted for being with a dark-skinned man).The incident prompted much hand-wringing over the enduring hostility to foreigners, especially those who come from less developed countries or have darker skin. Not much has changed since.It would only be right for the Moon administration to take the moral high ground and put an end to this nonsense, but there is little reason for hope. Mr. Moon, who once worked as a human rights lawyer, didn\u2019t hesitate to say that he opposed homosexuality during a televised presidential debate a year ago, showing a lack of sympathy for minorities.If the government truly believed in fighting bigotry, it would have long since pushed to pass the comprehensive anti-discrimination act that has been stalled in the National Assembly since 2007, but no such initiative is on the horizon.Perhaps a better question to ask those South Koreans who seem to be devoid of compassion would be this: How would they expect other countries to treat South Korean refugees in the event of a war with North Korea?Advertisement"}

WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!Mr. Rouhani had earlier threatened the possible disruption of regional oil shipments if its own exports were blocked by United States sanctions.On Saturday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he supported Mr. Rouhani\u2019s suggestion, an indication that Iran\u2019s leadership was in accord over the apparent threat. Mr. Rouhani has long been considered a more pragmatic leader who was seen as tolerable to moderates.That has led to increasing complaints among the Iranian public about the state of the economy, and a harsher crackdown on dissent by wary authorities.IRNA, the state-controlled news agency, dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s message Monday as \u201cbullying words and the rhetoric he uses especially in his early-morning tweets.\u201dIran is both an easier case and a harder one than North Korea. There are no signs that it possesses nuclear weapons now or could in the near future. It has not made any move to pull out of the 2015 deal, even after the United States did. Its leaders appear convinced that Mr. Trump is trying to goad them into making a mistake.Mr. Trump\u2019s warning to Iran came hours after a speech by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that was harshly critical of Iran\u2019s leadership. Mr. Pompeo accused Iran\u2019s leadership of widespread corruption at the expense of its citizens\u2019 welfare.\u201cGovernments around the world worry that confronting the Islamic Republic harms the cause of moderates, but these so-called moderates within the regime are still violent Islamic revolutionaries with an anti-America, anti-West agenda,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in the speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. \u201cYou only have to take their own words for it.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s tough talk with Iran comes as he continues to face fierce criticism over his meeting last week with President Vladimir V.

{"Headline": "Amid the Trumpian Chaos, Europe Sees a Strategy: Divide and Conquer", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European allies knew to expect the unexpected from President Trump, especially after their rancorous encounter last month at the Group of 7 summit meeting in Canada.But Mr. Trump\u2019s European tour has still rattled many on the Continent and in Britain, who have watched from a distance the chaos he creates on a daily basis in the United States but had not been directly exposed to it until this week.More important, for the long term, they have begun to believe that underneath the presidential narcissism, sarcasm and bluster there is a strategy: to undercut European solidarity in NATO and the European Union so the United States can exercise its economic and military power to shape relations with individual countries, just as China and Russia seek to do.The atmospherics have been awful. Mr. Trump happily broke protocol at NATO and in Britain, skipping appointments with other leaders, forcing changes in the agenda, scolding other leaders, calling an early news conference to get onto morning television programs in America, making unfounded claims about agreements and giving an interview to the British mass-market tabloid The Sun that deeply embarrassed his host, Prime Minister Theresa May.But Europeans are now convinced that Mr. Trump has an agenda that is inimical to their interests, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a French political analyst. \u201cEuropeans realize that he\u2019s not just a temperamental child, but that he wants to dismantle the multilateral order created 70 years ago that he believes limits American power.\u201dEuropean leaders had already taken into account the disrupter Trump, said Tomas Valasek, the director of Carnegie Europe, a foreign policy think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the dark about him, but we\u2019ve never dealt with this sort of political animal before,\u201d Mr. Valasek said. \u201cThis is a new ballgame and we\u2019re learning how to play it. We\u2019re not necessarily more effective, but we\u2019re getting wiser.\u201dDifferent leaders have tried different strategies with Mr. Trump, from the \u201cbuddy-buddy\u201d approach of President Emmanuel Macron of France and Ms. May, to the cooler attitude of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. \u201cBut we found that none of this matters,\u201d Mr. Valasek said. \u201cHe\u2019ll treat you like a competitor one way or another. He wants to pit countries against one another and use U.S. power and wealth against the others for his advantage.\u201dThe frustration sometimes comes out in meetings. At the NATO meeting, for instance, Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark told Mr. Trump that Danes had suffered as many casualties per capita as the United States had in Afghanistan, and that blood mattered more than money.\u201cIn direct and clear speech, I have made it clear to him that Denmark\u2019s contribution cannot be measured in money,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said afterward.The personal distaste could also be measured in body language, when European leaders made little effort to engage with Mr. Trump, chatting to one another while Mr. Trump walked along with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a semiauthoritarian outsider.\u201cTrump is becoming politically toxic in Western Europe,\u201d Mr. Valasek said. \u201cNo one wants to be seen smiling with him after being berated on Twitter. Even more, Mr. Trump\u2019s insults and his unpopularity among European voters make it harder for European leaders to do what he wants them to do, like increase military spending, even when they think they should do it.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump split with the Europeans on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Valasek said, \u201cleaders don\u2019t want to be associated with anything he wants; it\u2019s the kiss of death.\u201dThey are also fearful of his populism, his support for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, and his affinity with their political adversaries, who share his nationalist, anti-immigration message.He continued: \u201cWe cannot delude ourselves anymore. Donald Trump only knows strength. So we have to show him that we are strong.\u201dHow to do that, however, is less clear, since Europe\u2019s security dependence on the United States is both obvious and will not change soon, despite European talk of more money for a joint European defense.The problem is visible not just in Germany but in Spain, distant from Russia. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s new Socialist prime minister, outraged the leftist lawmakers who helped put him in office when he pledged to raise his country\u2019s military spending to 2 percent from the current 0.9 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who still lives there, said that \u201cthe real problem is that postwar Europe seems not to have regained a sense of purpose and direction.\u201d\u201cIt cannot formulate self-confident and achievable goals,\u201d Mr. Kornblum continued, \u201cand above all seems unable to stand up for itself against the criminals of the world\u201d \u2014 including the former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia now.The European nations\u2019 great accomplishments \u2014 continental peace and social welfare \u2014 have led them \u201cto become self-righteous in their pride about them, but in reality these steps forward were only possible within an American bubble,\u201d Mr. Kornblum said.And now Mr. Trump has called them out on it and \u201cspoken the unspeakable,\u201d Mr. Kornblum said, and it is both unwelcome and uncomfortable.If nothing else, Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to turn over the table has gotten the attention of Western allies, creating a sense of urgency to meet the spending goals, and not everyone drew back in alarm.The French newspaper Le Monde, for example, was relaxed. \u201cOnce again, Donald Trump brought on the show, but the damage was limited,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cThe NATO summit, which threatened to become a psychodrama because of the American president\u2019s caprices, wound up reinforcing the alliance. The Europeans are ready to pay more for their defense, and the U.S. reaffirmed its military commitment to its historic allies.\u201dBut the big question is whether any amount of spending would actually satisfy Mr. Trump, or whether his real attempt is to divide NATO and the European Union, both Mr. Heisbourg and Mr. Valasek said. Mr. Trump mixes his threats about more trade tariffs if the European Union does not come to better terms with his threat to withhold security from those same countries.For Mr. Heisbourg, Mr. Trump the businessman is simply \u201cmonetizing American power.\u201d As Mr. Trump recently said, he regarded the European Union \u201cpossibly as bad as China, just smaller.\u201d He sees Germany as dominating the bloc, and Germany, for which he has a special animus, as \u201cthe weak link in an organization vulnerable to linkage between trade and security,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said.The same is true of Mr. Trump\u2019s support of Brexit, on display again on Friday in Britain. Mr. Trump\u2019s view is that \u201cif you have a soft Brexit and stick with the European Union too closely, it doesn\u2019t work for me, so goodbye, you\u2019re on your own,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, a former French ambassador to Washington. \u201cFor Trump there are no allies and no enemies, just partners or not, and the U.S. will deal with them separately. And the Europeans have no key to answer this new U.S. foreign policy.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin, Raphael Minder from Madrid and Adam Nossiter from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Elections: 5 Takeaways from L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s Victory", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCapturing more than half the vote, according to early returns, he won by the largest margin in a presidential race since the nation transitioned to democracy nearly 20 years ago.Here are five takeaways from the stunning victory of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and what to expect:To grasp the stark repudiation of the establishment, and Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s ability to capitalize on it, it is helpful to understand the recent electoral history of Mexico.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the P.R.I., dominated politics in Mexico from 1929 until 2000, when it was unseated by the conservative National Action Party, or P.A.N., at the time led by Vicente Fox.The arrival of a new party after seven decades of single-party rule stirred tremendous hope among Mexicans \u2014 hopes that were eventually dashed. Over the six-year term, poverty remained pervasive and corruption unchecked.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto appeared in 2012, a fresh-faced candidate selling a new-and-improved P.R.I. That, too, turned out to be a mirage, exposed by corruption scandals, record violence and entrenched inequality that has kept nearly half of the population living under the poverty line.With 18 years of layered disappointments, Mexicans are hungry for change, and, perhaps, a bit of revenge. This explains why a man who has been rejected twice by the electorate \u2014 once in 2006 and again in 2012 \u2014 can fare so differently all these years later.On Sunday night, President Trump congratulated Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador on his victory. \u201cI look very much forward to working with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet. It was a hopeful start to a new chapter in a bilateral relationship that is arguably at its worst point in years.Mr. Trump has badgered Mexico since he announced his candidacy, criticizing its migrants, threatening to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement and promising to build a wall between the two countries. Reflecting the current frostiness, Mr. Trump and his counterpart, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, still have not met since the American president took office.Though a leftist, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has drawn comparisons to Mr. Trump for his nationalist impulses, populist rhetoric and combative personality. But from time to time he has also displayed a pugnaciousness toward Mexico\u2019s northern neighbor and has left no doubt that he is prepared to go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump to defend Mexico\u2019s interests.The chronic ills that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador railed against, propelling him to victory, now become his problems to solve.Among them is corruption. On the campaign trail, he was short on details about how he intended to confront the problem, but said he would lead by example: His professed honesty and ethical cleanliness, he said, would flow downward through the ranks of his government and help change the nation\u2019s culture.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will also have to deliver on his promises to address widespread poverty and yawning inequality. He has laid out a development agenda that would drastically increase spending on social programs, including increasing pensions for older citizens, expanding educational opportunities for students and bolstering subsidies for farmers.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory puts a leftist at the helm of Mexico for the first time in generations, and represents a resounding rejection of the two establishment political parties that have dominated Mexican politics for the past two decades: the centrist P.R.I., and the center-right P.A.N.The results were particularly brutal for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the P.R.I., which not only lost the presidency but faces steep losses in Congress and in most state governor races. The party was once the powerhouse of Mexican politics. But Sunday\u2019s results plunged the P.R.I. into an existential crisis, and a deeply uncertain future.The prospects for the P.A.N. remain equally cloudy. Its candidate, Ricardo Anaya, is considered one of the most agile \u2014 and ambitious \u2014 politicians in Mexico, and with an eye on the 2024 election, he may seek to position himself as the leader of the opposition.For as long as Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has been running for president, accusations that he will sink the economy have chased him. He was likened in the news media to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the former socialist leader of Venezuela, and questionable news reports tried to link his campaign to Russia, creating a narrative of a radical and dangerous leader.While the comparisons to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez are overblown and the connections to Russia totally unproven, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador must still convince investors that his policies will be business friendly.\u201cThey are far from enthusiastic but they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has promised an ambitious slate of social programs while assuring investors that he will exercise fiscal prudence and respect the independence of Mexico\u2019s highly regarded central bank. In his acceptance speech Sunday night, he echoed those promises.But how will he pay for his social programs? His advisers estimate they will eat up about 10 percent of the federal budget, or roughly $25 billion, annually. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador promises to pay for his programs by cutting waste and corruption from government spending. Analysts question whether that will be enough.Investors will also be watching his approach to Mexico\u2019s energy reform, which opened up vast parts of the industry to private investment and generated commitments of $80 billion in investment to explore and produce oil. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has been a fierce opponent of attempts to privatize the oil industry, but he has said he will respect existing contracts and the rule of law.Advertisement"}

The affair is vivid and real and yet there is a shard of violence in it, the everyday violence of two people using each other to counter pain they don\u2019t know how to digest.Of a plastic surgeon in \u201cBrother on Sunday,\u201d Homes writes, \u201cHe thinks about Botox and Restylane and lasering spider veins and resurfacing a face, and sometimes he feels like a conservator, like the guy he once sat next to at a dinner who worked at the Met, touching up artworks when they chipped or when the ceiling leaked on them.\u201d The possibility of profound beauty presses from one direction; the certainty of imperfection, of shame, presses from the other. Between these forces, the characters are hardened, sometimes into coal, sometimes into diamonds. But Homes, the author of 11 other books, including the best-selling memoir \u201cThe Mistress\u2019s Daughter\u201d and the Baileys Women\u2019s Prize-winning novel \u201cMay We Be Forgiven,\u201d is interested in more than beauty or ugliness: She writes about the interaction between inner lives and outer lives and our attempts to be seen or to hide. In \u201cHello Everybody,\u201d Homes writes of two teenagers: \u201cThey are forever marking and unmarking their bodies, as though it were entirely natural to write on them and equally natural to erase any desecration or signs of wear, like scribbling notes to oneself on the palm of the hand. They are making their bodies their own \u2014 renovating, redecorating, the body not just as corpus but as object of self-expression, a symbiotic relation between imagination and reality.\u201d\u201cDays of Awe\u201d is sliced through with Homes\u2019s dark humor. After introducing the genocide conference and the communities involved \u2014 \u201cCambodia, East Timor, Rwanda, the Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, the Holocaust of World War II, the history of colonial genocides and the early response to the AIDS epidemic\u201d \u2014 the conference leader goes on to thank the event\u2019s sponsors, \u201can airline, two global search engines, an insurance firm, the already mentioned antidepressant and a family-owned ice-cream company.\u201d He also notes that there are free juice and chair massages. The attendees are people who have dedicated their lives to the study of trauma; they are also adults on a business trip in New Hampshire. The conference is its own little economy where worse is better. During one panel, a Holocaust survivor chastises the novelist, remarking: \u201cFiction is a luxury our families didn\u2019t have. \u2026 We didn\u2019t pack our summer reading and go off to the camps, happy, happy. This isn\u2019t even your story.\u201d There are no clear property claims around cruelty or despair, or our ability to ensure situations almost too terrible to believe; such experiences, Homes insists, are lands we all visit.One wants to read passages of a Homes story aloud because they are so fine: \u201cCheryl\u2019s whole family, except for her father, wears bathing suits all day, all the time, even at Christmas.\u201d As one character explains: \u201cThey\u2019re pool people. \u2026 They just want to go in and out.\u201d The daughter in this family has had her initials branded on her butt. The mother has fallen in love with the smell of Play-Doh and stashes open cans all over the house. The family goes out for dinner and the anorexic daughter asks for an entree with a maximum of 10 calories; she receives a plate of mousses and foams. These are rich people with ridiculous rich-people habits, but the story is a tragedy with a dead brother at the center, a bedroom unchanged from when he was alive and a family orbiting his absence, monitoring the only thing they have control over: their flesh.\u201cDays of Awe\u201d feels like the part of the day when the sun is about to go down and the light is brighter while the shadows are darker. Everything has a sharp edge, is strikingly beautiful and suddenly also a little menacing. As one character says, \u201cIn these times the only way to remain optimistic is to side with the darkness and then be pleasantly surprised.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Mozambique, a Living Laboratory for Nature\u2019s Renewal", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bybasicsAt Gorongosa National Park, scarred by civil war, scientists are answering fundamental questions about ecology and evolution, and how wildlife recovers from devastation.GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, MOZAMBIQUE \u2014 The 14 African wild dogs were ravenous, dashing back and forth along the fence of their open-air enclosure, or boma, bouncing madly on their pogo-stick legs, tweet-yipping their distinctive wild-dog calls, and wagging their bushy, white-tipped tails like contestants on a game show desperate to be seen. Since arriving at the park three months earlier, as they acclimated to their new setting and forged the sort of immiscible bonds that make Lycaon pictus one of the most social mammals in the world, the dogs had grown accustomed to a daily delivery of a freshly killed antelope to feast on. But it had been nearly 48 hours since the pack\u2019s last meal and, hello, anybody out there? Ah, here comes the food truck now. Paola Bouley, the park\u2019s associate director of carnivore conservation, and two of her colleagues rode up to the fence in a pickup, opened the gate, edged the vehicle just inside the boma and began lowering the carcass of a male impala. As she stood in the back of the truck, Ms. Bouley gripped a rope tied to the antelope\u2019s rear legs, with the intention of luring the dogs from the comfort of their enclosure by slowly dragging their breakfast outside. Nice idea, but the dogs couldn\u2019t wait. They snatched at the carcass, tried disemboweling it in midair, yanking at the rope so violently they practically pulled the extremely fit Ms. Bouley to the ground. Stop, stop! she cried. New plan: Let\u2019s tie the rope to the pickup instead. Again, lure and vehicle inched out through the gate, and this time the dogs followed, their coats the color of army camouflage, their ears the size of soap dishes. One, two, three, four, a baker\u2019s dozen. The dogs bounded to freedom and fell on the impala en masse, just as the scientists hoped they would do. Except something was wrong. The dogs stopped eating. They ran around in confusion. One dog was missing, and not just any cur: It was the top dog, the alpha female of the pack. Where was their queen? The scientists scrambled, too.\u201cIt\u2019s Beira \u2014 she\u2019s still inside!\u201d Ms. Bouley called out, referring to the name chosen for the alpha female by local schoolchildren in honor of the capital city of their province. Loping over to the assembled observers, Ms. Bouley said, \u201cShe\u2019s not coming out. She\u2019s cautious. She\u2019s always been cautious.\u201d Now more than ever: Beira was pregnant with pups that the entire pack would help raise. There was too much commotion. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask you to leave,\u201d Ms. Bouley said. It\u2019s tough trying to resuscitate one of Africa\u2019s most storied and biologically diverse national parks from a state of near-annihilation, the result of a brutal 16-year civil war in which an estimated one million Mozambicans were killed and a huge swath of Gorongosa\u2019s wildlife destroyed. Tough, but by no means impossible. Thirty minutes after dispersing her guests, Ms. Bouley sent a joyful update: All pack members had left the pen, and the gate had been closed to prevent their re-entry. The dogs had polished off their last free brunch and were exploring the neighborhood, clearly eager to resume their career as team hunters par excellence. \u201cThis is a very special time for me,\u201d said Pedro Muagura, Gorongosa\u2019s park warden. In Mozambique, he said, many families have a totem animal, and his family\u2019s is the wild dog. Yet until the gang of 14 had been relocated from several sites in eastern South Africa as part of Gorongosa\u2019s restoration plan, the only time Mr. Muagura had encountered a wild dog was as roadkill. \u201cTo see live dogs in my own country, to have them released into Gorongosa,\u201d he said, almost tearfully, \u201cthat is a beautiful thing.\u201dOver the next several days, the ebullient carnivores managed to dispatch another impala and two waterbucks \u2014 beefy, handsome antelopes with bright bull\u2019s-eye markings on their rears. They are all too common in Gorongosa. Beira\u2019s pregnant belly bulged ever more visibly, and the pack was digging her a den. Lions were no longer the only resident meat-eaters able to keep the burgeoning herds of grazing mammals in check. Another apex predator, absent for decades from the park\u2019s 1,500 square miles, was back \u2014 yet more evidence that Gorongosa is on track for a great second act. Named after a mountain on the rim of the park that in turn was named after the Mwani term for \u201cplace of danger,\u201d Gorongosa is far from the largest national park or game reserve in Africa. Kruger National Park in South Africa is five times its size. Gorongosa is not even the biggest park in Mozambique. Yet Gorongosa stands out from the continent\u2019s many photogenic safari destinations as a kind of living laboratory, an ongoing experiment in how nature recovers from the equivalent of a massive hemorrhaging event, and which parts mend best when left to themselves and which require infusions of new blood. Gorongosa has attracted the attention of scientists from around the world who see an opportunity to address, in real time, fundamental questions of ecology, evolution, the rise and fall and shifting distribution of species, and changes in what researchers call the landscape of fear. The bushbuck of Gorongosa, for example, are unusually brazen about venturing away from the concealing foliage that surrounds termite mounds, where the shy, slender antelope traditionally are found. Instead, Gorongosa\u2019s bushbuck are grazing in open grassland, with all the cockiness of African buffalos or zebras. Is that good, neutral or destructive to the local habitat \u2014 to the mix of vegetation and its microfaunal throngs, the flow of water, the cycling of nutrients, the ease with which dung beetles can put the far-flung bounty to use? And how long before the insouciant bushbuck realize that Gorongosa\u2019s predators are multiplying and headed their way?Gorongosa is at once more and less \u201cnatural\u201d than other game reserves in Africa. \u201cThere are no fences around Gorongosa, and that\u2019s the way a park is supposed to be,\u201d said Test Malunga, a field guide at the park. At the same time, the park management, with the blessing of the Mozambique government, has decided to \u201cactively encourage and promote science,\u201d said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University who is on the Gorongosa Project\u2019s board of directors. As a result, researchers are not confined to simple observational studies of the park\u2019s free-ranging wildlife. They can manipulate field conditions to narrow down the spurs to animal movement and foraging choices. They can dart animals to take blood samples, measure their vital signs and then outfit them with GPS collars \u2014 and for the elephants, that means necklaces big enough to girdle an oak tree. \u201cMany parks limit or even prohibit such activities,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cBut without them you can\u2019t have a truly science-based management strategy or definitively answer burning questions at the forefront of ecological knowledge.\u201d Gorongosa also is preternaturally lucky to have a wealthy benefactor dedicated to the park\u2019s restoration and future. Since 2004, Gregory C. Carr, who made a fortune in telecommunications before turning to full-time philanthropy and human rights advocacy, has spent tens of millions of dollars on the park and the 1,300 square miles of so-called buffer zone that surrounds it, where some of the poorest communities in Mozambique, and hence in the world, can be found. Mr. Carr, 59, is genial, driven and unerringly gregarious, a kind of L. pictus in a baseball cap, always looking for new connections, new ideas for helping the park and its people, new ways to win over skeptics and bridge political divides. Despite recurring guerrilla skirmishes in the region, Mr. Carr said, \u201cI think the park has done a pretty good job of being everyone\u2019s friend.\u201d His foundation and various donors-in-arms have invested in local schools, mobile clinics, bee farms, sustainable coffee plantations, girls\u2019 clubs, and a master\u2019s program in conservation biology for Mozambican students. The classroom is Gorongosa. \u201cIt\u2019s the only conservation biology program in the country,\u201d Mr. Carr said. \u201cWe\u2019re told it may be the only one in the world taught entirely in a national park.\u201d Yet thorny sociocultural challenges remain. Mr. Carr is a white American with a lot of money, and though Gorongosa is a national park that belongs entirely to Mozambique, Larissa Sousa, who works in the department of human development at the park, said that many people in the region believe Mr. Carr is the owner of Gorongosa, and they\u2019ve never been inside.In fact, Gorongosa park was founded by colonial Portugal in 1960 largely for the pleasure of affluent Western adventurists, but it was quickly claimed as a national treasure when Mozambique won independence in 1975. Behind the park\u2019s splendor, explained Piotr Naskrecki, an associate director of research at Gorongosa, is its location at the southernmost tip of Africa\u2019s Great Rift Valley, a massive geological formation that, over millions of years, has channeled huge amounts of biodiversity into Mozambique\u2019s midriff. To the east of the rift is soft limestone, kneaded and puckered by water into caves and gorges and giving rise to riverine forests, replete with endemic bats, crickets, mollusks and millipedes that thrive on the limestone\u2019s calcium bounty. On the western rim is hard granite and granitic soils that nurture an entirely different assemblage of life-forms, like a newly discovered species of lizard that wedges itself deep into rock cracks, beyond a predator\u2019s reach. In the middle are the floodplains, cycling seasonally between deluge and drainage, and turning tuxedo-black with concentrated nutrients on which vegetation can bloom and herds of herbivores can fatten. Spanning elevations from sea level to 6,000 feet at the top of Mt. Gorongosa, the park is a great mixtape of \u201cnearly every conceivable habitat,\u201d Dr. Naskrecki said: alpine forest, montane meadow, woodland savanna, grassland, scrub forest, a touch of true rain forest. And as you drive through it, bumping over roads so deeply rutted you feel like a human castanet, you realize you\u2019ve never been so happy in your life. In the 1980s, the music stopped. A civil war broke out, the park was shuttered, and government and rebel forces turned Gorongosa into a battlefield and makeshift abattoir. Elephants were slaughtered for their tusks. Elands, sables, wildebeests, zebras and other large herbivores were hunted for meat or sport. Lions, leopards and hyenas were killed for being in the way, and many animals simply died of starvation. By the time the fighting and rampant hunting ended in the mid-1990s, the park\u2019s thundering census of large mammals had been slashed by 95 percent, to numerical whimpers: 15 African buffalos here, six lions there, five zebras, a few dozen hippos and elephants. Park infrastructure had been destroyed. Only Gorongosa\u2019s bird life, some 500 species strong, survived relatively intact.The park\u2019s wildlife began recovering, but slowly, and on visiting the park in 2003, Mr. Carr said, \u201cI could drive around all day and not see a single animal.\u201d After consulting with a broad range of experts, Mr. Carr proposed to the Mozambican government a public-private partnership that he hoped would both hasten the recovery of Gorongosa\u2019s grandeur and lift the economy, too. \u201cBeing an economic engine and a promoter of human rights, that\u2019s a new way to think about national parks,\u201d said Mr. Carr. \u201cThe people who live around here, this is their homeland, and they have a right to live in a decent environment that can sustain them.\u201d The team started by restocking the larger herbivores, importing 200 buffalos and 200 wildebeests from South Africa. As the bulk grazers began trimming back the overgrown grassland, the park\u2019s array of smaller antelope species, with their twisty, calligraphic horns and their Modigliani faces, could get through to feed and more reliably breed. The expanding prey options soon lofted the lion count, which in turn began luring back tourists for whom a lion sighting is synonymous with a safari vacation. But the lions alone could not handle the swelling ranks of herbivores and omnivores, and Gorongosa\u2019s scientists realized the park needed a more diverse guild of predators. Where were the leopards? Leopards are the most widespread great cats in the world, yet for mysterious reasons they hadn\u2019t found their way back to Gorongosa. As a result, Gorongosa\u2019s baboons, a favorite leopard menu item, are breeding like gray squirrels, devouring everything they can get their unfastidious fingers on and moving fearlessly through the landscape. \u201cYou don\u2019t elsewhere in Africa see baboons walking on the ground at night or sleeping on the ground,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cBut here you do.\u201d The researchers\u2019 efforts to import leopards from elsewhere in Africa have proved legislatively challenging, and so they were thrilled when an adult male leopard, a voluntary immigrant from the buffer zone, showed up in late March and as of midsummer appeared to still be around.The scientists admitted they have made mistakes. \u201cWe tried to introduce the cheetah,\u201d Dr. Naskrecki said, \u201cbut we learned this is not the right environment for them, and historically they have not been here.\u201d African wild dogs, by contrast, have a history in Gorongosa and are under fewer trade restrictions, and Ms. Bouley said they will be bringing in another pack next year. Other puzzling aspects of Gorongosa\u2019s recrudescence remain. On most African reserves, for example, waterbucks are uncommon, bit players compared to other antelope species. In Gorongosa, their numbers have exploded to 50,000. A possible explanation: as one of the few species able to persist on the floodplain year-round, through low water and high, waterbucks may have stayed out of target range during the war and been well positioned to rebound when the shooting stopped. The waterbuck\u2019s triumph, however, may incidentally be slowing the recovery of another water-loving mammal: the hippopotamus. Zebras also have had a surprisingly hard time regaining their footing. Elephants have nearly rebounded to their prewar numbers, the population notably enriched in individuals that naturally lack tusks and thus were spared the selective wrath of ivory poachers. \u201cGorongosa is not a Ming vase that we\u2019re trying to restore,\u201d Dr. Pringle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic ecosystem in recovery\u201d \u2014 working like a dog and getting better all the time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan Begins New Term and Names His Son-in-Law Finance Minister", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sworn in on Monday for a five-year term under a new Constitution that gives Turkey\u2019s president sweeping executive powers. He promptly named his son-in-law finance minister, an appointment that unsettled financial markets and raised new concerns about the concentration of so much power in one politician.\u201cWe as Turkey, and the Turkish nation, are making a new start here in your presence,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told hundreds of foreign leaders, dignitaries and party members gathered in the gardens of the presidential palace in Ankara, the capital. \u201cWe will make major moves in every area from macroeconomic balances to investments to make Turkey one of the 10 biggest economies of the world.\u201dThe currency fell further on Monday after Mr. Erdogan named his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, a former energy minister, as treasury and finance minister. The new cabinet, announced late in the evening, was keenly awaited for an indication of what Mr. Erdogan plans with his newfound powers.Many of the appointments were of bureaucrats; only four were of elected politicians. The foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, kept his position; the former army chief of staff, Hulusi Akar, was named defense minister; and an American-trained bureaucrat, Fuat Oktay, was named vice president.Mr. Oktay had served as under secretary in the prime minister\u2019s office, which was abolished with the transition to a presidential system.\u201cThis means there will be more continuity than change,\u201d Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director in Ankara of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said before the announcement. \u201cThey will be implementers,\u201d he added, \u201cso he is taking things into his own hands.\u201dMr. Erdogan has defended his constitutional change to introduce a strong presidential system \u2014 passed by referendum last year \u2014 as necessary for greater efficiency and a responsive government.\u201cThe presidential government system is not coercive but a specific choice that the history directed us to,\u201d he told his guests. \u201cFor the first time in history since Ottoman times, Turkey made its choice at a critical crossroads not by force of a military coup,\u201d he said, \u201cbut with the free will of our nation.\u201dCritics warn the new presidential system will not solve Turkey\u2019s problems, from growing economic strains to its bitterly divided politics.\u201cIt is completely false that if we change the system problems will be solved,\u201d said Murat Sevinc, a professor of constitutional law who writes a column for the newspaper Duvar. \u201cThey have built a system that is nongovernable, nonmanageable, whoever is elected.\u201dFew Western leaders were present \u2014 the only leader from the European Union was the president of Bulgaria \u2014 although a former chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who has maintained close relations with Mr. Erdogan since his time in office, was present.Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia sat in the front row, alongside the presidents of Somalia, Sudan, Chad and Pakistan. The emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader present, and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela was the lone leader from the Americas. The United States was represented by Philip S. Kosnett, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at its embassy in Ankara.The United States and European nations have criticized Mr. Erdogan\u2019s growing authoritarianism in recent years, and in particular his harsh crackdown against political opponents since a failed coup in July 2016. Over 100,000 people have been arrested under a state of emergency since the coup, and 150,000 purged from their jobs.Hours before his inauguration, Mr. Erdogan dashed off a decree ordering the firing of another 18,000 state employees, most of them members of the police and army, but also teachers and academicians.Legislators from the main opposition parties \u2014 the Republican People\u2019s Party and the Good Party, and the pro-Kurdish Democratic People\u2019s Party \u2014 refused to stand as Mr. Erdogan took his oath before the newly elected Parliament. Mr. Erdogan entered the chamber to applause, but some boos rang out in the chamber as well.The president remained stern faced throughout, even when waving to clapping supporters.Mr. Erdogan won the presidential race with 52 percent of the vote, but his party failed to win a majority in Parliament and will work in alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party. Nearly half the Parliament \u2014 representing a population the size of Spain\u2019s \u2014 remains opposed to Mr. Erdogan, said Soner Cagaptay, author of a book on Mr. Erdogan, \u201cThe New Sultan.\u201dA clap of thunder sounded the moment after Mr. Erdogan took his oath, and rain descended upon the crowd gathering to celebrate the inauguration across town in the gardens of the presidential palace.First, Mr. Erdogan paid his respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic.\u201cEsteemed Ataturk,\u201d he wrote in a visitors\u2019 book. \u201cI promise to go on strengthening the unity and fraternity of our nation, aggrandize our country, glorify our state.\u201dThe gesture seemed intended to mollify opponents who have accused Mr. Erdogan of seeking to unravel the secular parliamentary republic that was Mr. Ataturk\u2019s legacy.Mr. Erdogan rode in a black car carpeted in red carnations, flanked by a mounted police escort to the presidential palace, arriving as Turkish artillery sounded a 21-gun salute.In regal procession, he walked the length of the palace gardens, with his wife, Emine, by his side, past a colorful honorary guard in medieval costumes. He greeted guests and supporters, and allowed himself a smile.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a book on Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by Soner Cagaptay.

{"Headline": "After Storm, Foreclosures in Puerto Rico Stopped. They\u2019re Starting Again.", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe foreclosure machine that ground to a halt in Puerto Rico after the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September is slowly cranking up again. Island residents who fell behind on their payments are facing creditors ranging from Wall Street to the federal government.Over the last four months, nearly 300 new foreclosure actions were filed in federal court in San Juan and in local courts across the island.Among the firms filing cases are an investment firm controlled by Credit Suisse, one in which the private equity firm TPG Capital is an investor and banks like Citigroup and Santander. Even the United States Department of Agriculture, which has underwritten more than 3,000 mortgages in mainly rural areas of Puerto Rico, has begun to foreclose on delinquent borrowers.The filings are some of the first in Puerto Rico since several federal agencies \u2014 including the U.S.D.A. \u2014 imposed moratoriums on new foreclosures and legal actions in existing cases after the hurricane devastated the island\u2019s electrical grid. But the moratoriums have begun to expire, setting the stage for what housing advocates have feared could be a wave of home foreclosures in the United States territory of 3.4 million people.\u201cThe main problem here is that people are not prepared, and a lot of borrowers will be taken by surprise,\u201d said Ricardo Ramos-Gonz\u00e1lez, coordinator of a consumer legal aid clinic at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. \u201cA lot of people are going to lose their homes.\u201dHe said the situation was complicated by the fact that up to 125,000 island residents temporarily relocated to the mainland after Maria. Some who get sued may not be aware they were served with a foreclosure action \u2014 and some may not be able to afford lawyers to defend themselves.In some of the new foreclosure cases, lawyers have said the homes were severely damaged.A yearlong moratorium is a long one, but given the slow economic recovery in Puerto Rico, some housing advocates have argued it is not enough time. Lenders counter that at some point a determination needs to be made whether a borrower will ever be able to make payments again.A slowly improving economy has made it easier for thousands of homeowners to resume making mortgage payments. But the number of delinquent mortgages remains high \u2014 roughly double the tally of overdue loans before the storm.Before the hurricane, there were about 13,000 pending foreclosure cases in federal and local courts.In all, there are 425,000 home-loan borrowers in Puerto Rico and roughly a quarter of those mortgages are guaranteed against default by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has its own moratorium on foreclosure filings until Aug. 17. The department, however, recently modified the moratorium to permit some older foreclosure cases to move forward.The banks and investment firms said most of the new foreclosure filings were against borrowers who had been delinquent on their mortgages long before Hurricane Maria hit. The investors and banks called their actions reasonable first steps in dealing with delinquent borrowers and in line with what the federal agencies were permitting.\u201cWe have respected the moratorium and are beginning to resume foreclosures on properties, most of which were secured by loans in serious delinquency prior to the hurricane,\u201d said Drew Benson, a Citigroup spokesman. The bank, he said, had stopped writing new mortgages in Puerto Rico a decade ago.Credit Suisse said its DLJ Mortgage Capital subsidiary is only filing foreclosures against borrowers who were already delinquent before the storm.Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for Banco Santander Puerto Rico, said the bank \u201cfully complies with federal and local laws applicable to foreclosures\u201d and works with borrowers \u201cto help them avoid foreclosure proceedings.\u201dA spokesman for the firm that manages mortgages for Roosevelt Cayman Asset Company declined to comment.Earlier this year, a number of advocacy groups lobbied public pension funds in the United States to put pressure on TPG and other investors that had bought mortgages in Puerto Rico to honor the foreclosure moratoriums. The advocacy groups also met with some of the investment firms to discuss their concerns.Most private mortgage investors were not bound by the moratoriums since any federal guarantees on those loans had expired when the mortgages were resold at discounted prices. Also, some of those loans were originally issued without federal guarantees.For the most part, the lobbying effort to honor the moratoriums was successful. Private investment firms, including Roosevelt Cayman, held off on instituting any new foreclosure proceedings until recently.Julio L\u00f3pez Varona, one of the coordinators of the lobbying effort, said that Roosevelt Cayman began filing new foreclosures cases and reopening dormant cases shortly after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big government-controlled mortgage-finance firms, decided not to extend beyond May 31 a foreclosure moratorium on loans they had guaranteed.\u201cIt is a concern because they are one of the biggest private investors in mortgages,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said of Roosevelt Cayman.Even a federal agency is starting to foreclose. The U.S.D.A. is foreclosing on mortgages issued by its Farm Service Agency. The mortgages typically written by the Agriculture Department are for homeowners, businesses and borrowers living in rural areas.The U.S.D.A. is filing foreclosures mainly on delinquent farm and emergency loans. John Shea, a spokesman for the Farm Service Agency, said in an emailed statement that the only foreclosure cases it had filed involved mortgages that became delinquent years before Maria hit the island. He added that the agency had \u201coffered substantial assistance to its Puerto Rico borrowers.\u201dBut some housing lawyers said the U.S.D.A. had taken a hard line with borrowers seeking to negotiate lower monthly payments.\u201cThey are very difficult with loan modifications,\u201d said Rafael Rodr\u00edguez Rosell\u00f3, a legal services lawyer.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said he was working with several borrowers who had mortgages from the U.S.D.A., including a disabled borrower who was denied a loan modification in April. The borrower, who lives in Gurabo, a town of 45,000, wanted to lower his payments after he stopped receiving money from a family member who had been supplementing his income.The U.S.D.A., according to letters to the borrower, rejected the modification request because Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s client had a prior loan reduction and was not entitled to another one under federal regulations.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said an appeal of the loan modification denial was pending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $3 Billion Plan to Turn Hoover Dam Into a Giant Battery", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "Hoover Dam was a public works project likened to the pyramids. Now, after channeling a river, what if it could tap the power of the sun and wind?Hoover Dam helped transform the American West, harnessing the force of the Colorado River \u2014 along with millions of cubic feet of concrete and tens of millions of pounds of steel \u2014 to power millions of homes and businesses. It was one of the great engineering feats of the 20th century.Now it is the focus of a distinctly 21st-century challenge: turning the dam into a vast reservoir of excess electricity, fed by the solar farms and wind turbines that represent the power sources of the future.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, an original operator of the dam when it was erected in the 1930s, wants to equip it with a $3 billion pipeline and a pump station powered by solar and wind energy. The pump station, downstream, would help regulate the water flow through the dam\u2019s generators, sending water back to the top to help manage electricity at times of peak demand.The net result would be a kind of energy storage \u2014 performing much the same function as the giant lithium-ion batteries being developed to absorb and release power.The process begins when the dam converts water into energy. Here's how:The Hoover Dam project may help answer a looming question for the energy industry: how to come up with affordable and efficient power storage, which is seen as the key to transforming the industry and helping curb carbon emissions.Because the sun does not always shine, and winds can be inconsistent, power companies look for ways to bank the electricity generated from those sources for use when their output slacks off. Otherwise, they have to fire up fossil-fuel plants to meet periods of high demand.And when solar and wind farms produce more electricity than consumers need, California utilities have had to find ways to get rid of it \u2014 including giving it away to other states \u2014 or risk overloading the electric grid and causing blackouts.\u201cI think we have to look at this as a once-in-a-century moment,\u201d said Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles. \u201cSo far, it looks really possible. It looks sustainable, and it looks clean.\u201dThe target for completion is 2028, and some say the effort could inspire similar innovations at other dams. Enhancing energy storage could also affect plans for billions of dollars in wind projects being proposed by the billionaires Warren E. Buffett and Philip F. Anschutz.But the proposal will have to contend with political hurdles, including environmental concerns and the interests of those who use the river for drinking, recreation and services.In Bullhead City, Ariz., and Laughlin, Nev. \u2014 sister cities on opposite sides of the Colorado, about 90 miles south of the dam \u2014 water levels along certain stretches depend on when dams open and close, and some residents see a change in its flow as a disruption, if not a threat.\u201cAny idea like this has to pass much more than engineering feasibility,\u201d Peter Gleick, a co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a think tank in Oakland, Calif., and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, internationally known for his work on climate issues. \u201cIt has to be environmentally, politically and economically vetted, and that\u2019s likely to prove to be the real problem.\u201dUsing Hoover Dam to help manage the electricity grid has been mentioned informally over the last 15 years. But no one pursued the idea seriously until about a year ago, as California began grappling with the need to better manage its soaring alternative-electricity production \u2014 part of weaning itself from coal-fired and nuclear power plants.In California, by far the leading state in solar power production, that has sometimes meant paying other states to take excess electricity. Companies like Tesla have gotten into the picture, making lithium-ion batteries that are deployed by some utilities, but that form of storage generally remains pricey.Lazard, the financial advisory and asset management firm, has estimated that utility-scale lithium-ion batteries cost 26 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared with 15 cents for a pumped-storage hydroelectric project. The typical household pays about 12.5 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity.Some dams already provide a basis for the Hoover Dam proposal. Los Angeles operates a hydroelectric plant at Pyramid Lake, about 50 miles northwest of the city, that stores energy by using the electric grid to spin a turbine backward and pump water back into the lake.But the Hoover Dam proposal would operate differently. The dam, with its towering 726-foot concrete wall and its 17 power generators that came online in 1936, would not be touched. Instead, engineers propose building a pump station about 20 miles downstream from the main reservoir, Lake Mead, the nation\u2019s largest artificial lake. A pipeline would run partly or fully underground, depending on the location ultimately approved.\u201cHoover Dam is ideal for this,\u201d said Kelly Sanders, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s a gigantic plant. We don\u2019t have anything on the horizon as far as batteries of that magnitude.\u201dSri Narayan, a chemistry professor at the university, said his studies of lithium-ion batteries showed that they simply weren\u2019t ready to store the loads needed to manage all of the wind and solar power coming online.\u201cWith lithium-ion batteries, you have durability issues,\u201d Mr. Narayan said. \u201cIf they last five to 10 years, that would be a stretch, especially because we expect to use these facilities at full capacity. It has to be 10 times more durable than it is today.\u201dMr. Narayan said he felt the Hoover Dam project should be given serious consideration because pumped-storage projects had been tested and proven for decades. In a comparison with lithium-ion batteries, he said, \u201cI think the argument is very good.\u201dThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the nation\u2019s largest municipal utility, says its proposal would increase the productivity of the dam, which operates at just 20 percent of its potential, to avoid releasing too much water at once and flooding towns downstream.Engineers have conducted initial feasibility studies, including a review of locations for the pump station that would have as little adverse impact on the environment and nearby communities as possible.But because Hoover Dam sits on federal land and operates under the Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Interior Department, the bureau must back the project before it can proceed.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the concept, but at this point our regional management has not seen the concept in enough detail to know where we would stand on the overall project,\u201d said Doug Hendrix, a bureau spokesman.If the bureau agrees to consider the project, the National Park Service will review the environmental, scientific and aesthetic impact on the downstream recreation area. If the Los Angeles utility receives approval, Park Service officials have told it, the agency wants the pumping operation largely invisible to the public, which could require another engineering feat.Among the considerations is the effect on bighorn sheep that roam Black Canyon, just below the dam, and on drinking water for places like Bullhead City. Some environmentalists worry that adding a pump facility would impair water flow farther downstream, in particular at the Colorado River Delta, a mostly dry riverbed in Mexico that no longer connects to the sea.Another concern is that the pump station would draw water from or close to Lake Mohave, where water enthusiasts boat, fish, ride Jet-Skis, kayak and canoe.Keri Simons, a manager of Watercraft Adventures, a 27-year-old rental business in Laughlin, said water levels already fluctuated in stretches of the Colorado close to the river towns. The smaller Davis Dam, just north of Laughlin, shuts off the flow overnight.One morning this year, the water level just outside town dropped so low that you could walk across the riverbed, Ms. Simons said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t put any boats out until noon,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf the river was a sandbar.\u201dEven if no water is lost because of the pumping project, the thought of any additional stress on the system worries Toby Cotter, the city manager of Bullhead City.The town thrives on the summer tourism that draws some two million visitors to the area for recreation on the greenish-blue waters, Mr. Cotter said. \u201cThat lake is the lifeblood of this community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to see 100 boats on that lake.\u201dEnvironmentalists have been pushing Los Angeles to stop using fossil fuels and produce electricity from alternative sources like solar and wind power. And Mayor Garcetti said he would like his city to be the first in the nation to operate solely on clean energy, while maintaining a reliable electric system.\u201cOur challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?\u201d he said. \u201cStorage helps. There\u2019s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.\u201dBut old wounds are still raw with some along the Colorado. A coal-fired power plant in Laughlin that the Department of Water and Power and other utilities operated was shut down in 2006, costing 500 jobs and causing the local economies to buckle. And a decision long ago to allot Nevada a small fraction of the water that California and Arizona can draw remains a sore point.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on in California with power that has given people who are dealing with them any comfort,\u201d said Joseph Hardy, a Nevada state senator. \u201cI think from a political standpoint, we would have to allay the fears of California, Nevada and Arizona. There will be a myriad of concerns.\u201dThe decision to close the coal plant angered many residents. They wanted the utility to simply add emission-control features known as scrubbers to reduce carbon pollution. The community later hoped a natural-gas plant would replace the coal facility, but Los Angeles could not agree with the local communities on a site.The 2,500-acre parcel where the coal plant stood remains largely vacant. \u201cThere\u2019s still some sting here,\u201d said Mr. Cotter, the Bullhead City official.There have been local efforts to convert the site into a development of housing and businesses \u2014 or to build a solar farm on a plot of land, if Los Angeles would buy the power.Mr. Garcetti said other states and cities had worked with Los Angeles to build economic development projects for their communities, so he would like to consider similar ideas for the Hoover Dam project, as well as ways to benefit the entire region.  \u201cI\u2019m all open ears to what their needs are,\u201d he said.Mr. Hardy is wary of big-city promises. The Department of Water and Power has treated Nevada so cavalierly, he said, that a security guard at the old coal plant site once refused to return a ball to children after it bounced over the property\u2019s fence. He said the guard had told the children\u2019s parents that they could file a claim to get it back \u2014 a process that would take two to three years.\u201cNot the kindest neighbor,\u201d Mr. Hardy said.But he said he was willing to meet with Los Angeles officials to make the project successful.\u201cThe hurdles are minimal and the negotiations simple, as long as everybody agrees with Nevada,\u201d Mr. Hardy said. \u201cIt would be nice if there was a table that they would come to. I\u2019ll provide the table.\u201dSources: The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; Bureau of ReclamationProduced by Keith Collins, Meg Felling, Whitney Richardson and Josh Williams.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Companies Are Making Customers Pay for Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________President Trump\u2019s trade war is making life uncomfortable for some large American corporations, but they have found a way to reduce the pain: Pass it on to customers.The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have pushed up the prices of steel and aluminum and have raised costs for companies that make everything from cars and tractors to dishwashers. These companies face a choice. They can bear the higher costs themselves and report weaker profits, which might crater their stocks. Or they can charge more for their products, in effect making their customers bear much of the financial burden of the tariffs, at least for a while.Many companies are opting for the latter.As they report second-quarter earnings, they are going out of their way to let their shareholders know that it is customers who are paying.Caterpillar, while reporting record profits on Monday, predicted that tariffs would add as much $200 million to its costs in the second half of this year. The company added, however, that it would try to partly offset the hit by increasing the prices of its products. Whirlpool, which uses steel and aluminum in its dishwashers and washing machines, said it had hoisted its prices this year. Coca-Cola said last week that it had increased prices in the United States in part because of tariff-related cost increases.\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard for companies to pass costs through to prices for many years,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. \u201cThe thing about tariffs is that they make a very good excuse: Blame it on Trump.\u201dThe impact of the tariffs, and who bears their brunt, could have big implications for the wider economy. The tariffs are raising expenses at a time when companies are paying more for other materials and labor. If most of these costs are passed on to consumers, inflation, already rising after being dormant for years, could accelerate. What is more, since the metals tariffs have been in effect only since the start of June, their full impact has not been felt.And telling investors that customers will pay up does not mean they will believe you.Still, some economists say companies may be able to get away with charging more for a while longer. With the economy buoyant, there may be enough customers who can afford the increases. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, noted that a deeper dig into wage data showed strong rates of growth, and, he added, a recent survey showed that consumers appeared to be stepping up purchases of big-ticket items in anticipation of price increases.The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. But the tariffs, along with other pressures, could prompt the Fed to tap the brakes more firmly, which could spook the stock market.\u201cWe are seeing tariffs adding to classic late-cycle inflation pressures,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cThis may force the Fed to do more than the market has priced in.\u201dMuch depends on whether President Trump follows through on his proposed trade policies. To some extent, the strength of corporate earnings has bolstered America\u2019s position in its trade fights. Profit margins for companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index are at their highest in many years, in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, Mr. Yardeni noted. But the longer the trade war drags on, the harder it will be for corporate America\u2019s bottom line to hold up.\u201cTrump gave companies a record profit margin, and now he might take some of that away,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Sweet It Is. And How Malignant.", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Walvin, the author of several books on slavery, takes his readers on a roller-coaster ride through 500 years of history. Sugar, he shows, was rare for most of human history, with sweetness largely derived from fruits and honey. Sugar was believed to have healing properties and in much of the world it was dispensed by apothecaries; consumption of small quantities of sugar was the prerogative of elites. Then, in the 16th century, Europeans seized large territories in the Americas and quickly dedicated much of that acreage to sugar cane. By killing off local inhabitants and enslaving Africans to do the backbreaking labor of tending the sugar plant, European settlers managed to build a huge production complex. Hungry for power and profit, they turned the fertile soils of Brazil, Barbados, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, St. Domingue and other places to the growing of sugar for European markets by slave labor, producing extraordinary wealth in cities like Bristol, Bordeaux and Boston, and unimaginable misery for millions of enslaved workers.Sugar, Walvin argues, was the cutting edge of global capitalism, with the plantations among the largest business enterprises, the most significant sources of profit and, in light of their highly regimented discipline, the most modern work sites. As a major share of the total trade of both 18th-century France and Britain, sugar lubricated the world economy and provided nutrition to the growing number of people who worked in cities and industry. Sugar catalyzed some of the first waves of globalization \u2014 notably in British North America, which entered the world economy as a supplier of goods to the Caribbean sugar complex and a processor of its harvest. Boston, as much as Barbados, is sugar\u2019s offspring.When slavery came to its slow end in the 19th century, the geography of sugar shifted. Brutalized indentured workers from India and China took up sugar production in Guyana and Fiji, Mauritius and Trinidad. Beet sugar producers in Germany and the American Midwest gained market share. And by the late 20th century, American corn growers were feeding huge quantities of high fructose corn syrup into global markets, enabling an ever-increasing quantity of sweeteners to be poured into soft drinks and cereals. Along the way, sugar turned out to be so important that governments came to regulate its production and trade, trying to secure inexpensive sugar for domestic markets and to bolster an ever more powerful food industry addicted to cheap sweeteners. Subsidies and tariffs, as well as imperial exertions on behalf of sugar-consuming industries, Walvin makes clear, shaped the global sugar market in ways that were good for industry and all too often harmful to workers and consumers. The result has been a wave of obesity that has moved at awe-inspiring speed across the planet \u2014 fattening up people from Europe to the United States, from India to Mexico, creating a global health crisis that suggests sugar is as toxic as tobacco. If current trends continue, Walvin observes, the majority of the British and American population may be obese by 2050.\u201cSugar\u201d could have used another round of edits \u2014 it is maddeningly repetitive. Its numbers are often vague, and trajectories \u2014 of sugar consumption, for example \u2014 would be clearer if shown in a table or graph. Walvin\u2019s arguments are morally forceful, but their lack of precision and specificity makes them analytically nebulous. \u201cSugar\u201d also reads almost like two books \u2014 one focused on slavery, the other on obesity. And despite its global scope, the book remains beholden to a Eurocentric perspective that has little to say about pre-European systems of sugar production in Asia, glosses over the enormous expansion of systems of indentured labor in sugar-growing Asia, and is weak on sugar consumption in places like India, Barbados or Senegal \u2014 all currently suffering from a diabetes epidemic. Perhaps it is true, as Walvin asserts, that sugar tainted \u201call involved wherever it took root,\u201d but how it tainted places and people, and who did the tainting, and how conditions changed over the past 500 years are often left unexplained, as are any resulting lessons we might learn.By alerting readers to the ways that modernity\u2019s very origins are entangled with a seemingly benign and delicious substance, \u201cSugar\u201d raises fundamental questions about our world. It does not resolve all those questions, but it provides enough information for its readers to begin to see some answers and to see how troubling and disconcerting they are.Sven Beckert is the Laird Bell professor of American history at Harvard University and the author of \u201cEmpire of Cotton: A Global History.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties.His departure, announced in Iran\u2019s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s administration had said that the nuclear agreement, reached in 2015, would bring prosperity after prolonged isolation, a miscalculation that has caused a political backlash against him and his top aides. Even after Mr. Trump was elected, there was still hope in Iran that his threat to scrap the nuclear agreement was just bluster.\u201cFrom November 2016 they should have seen the dark clouds \u2014 they were sleepwalking,\u201d said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an expert on Iran\u2019s economy.\u201cIran has had a very large shock to the economy in the last few months. That\u2019s the Trump shock,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t have people in there who expected this not to happen.\u201dMr. Rouhani\u2019s announcement of the central bank change at a cabinet meeting appeared to reflect his concession that such steps were needed to counter the criticism. Mr. Seif\u2019s replacement, Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former economics professor, banker and insurance official, had been designated as Iran\u2019s next ambassador to China before he was abruptly summoned from Beijing for the new job.Precisely how Mr. Hemmati intends to slow or halt the fall in the rial\u2019s value remains unclear.It took about 30,000 rials to buy $1 when Mr. Seif took over in 2013. Now it costs more than 90,000 to buy $1. By some estimates, Iranians have taken nearly $60 billion out of the country in the past few years.\u201cPeople don\u2019t think holding rials is the best way of preserving their savings,\u201d Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said.\u201cThe United States should not bite off more than it can chew and should know its place in this era, and make further efforts to understand Iran\u2019s status, dignity and role,\u201d Mr. Qassemi was quoted as saying.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Collins and Murkowski, It\u2019s Time to Leave the G.O.P.", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Faludi is a journalist and author.A no vote from these two senators might not be enough to offset affirmative votes from endangered red-state Democrats. And the attack on Roe may be pursued through a host of more subtle and incremental assaults, not an out-and-out declared repeal. To save Roe, Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski might need to wield a bigger stick. Fortunately, there\u2019s one at hand, and wielding it at this pivotal moment might do good beyond the single issue. They could bolt their party and shift the balance of power in the Senate.By leaving the G.O.P. \u2014 either to join the other party or, more plausibly, to become independents and caucus with the Democrats \u2014 Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski wouldn\u2019t simply be registering their opposition to a single Supreme Court justice. They\u2019d be taking a powerful stand against their party\u2019s escalating betrayals of the country. The Trump-era Republicans have made screamingly clear what should have been obvious for a long time: The G.O.P. is no longer a comfortable home for anyone who cares about the rights of women \u2014 or of minorities, immigrants, L.G.B.T. people, and the poor \u2014 or about the Constitution. Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski could drop the pretense that dissenting within the party has made one bit of \u201cmoderating\u201d difference.Ms. Murkowski holds conservative views that, arguably, explain her hanging in with the G.O.P. \u2014 just for one, she\u2019s all for drilling in pristine wildlife refuges to fuel her state\u2019s economy. She would likely be uncomfortable with some of the Democratic agenda. But she\u2019s also proved an independent voice of conscience, which earned her the Tea Party challenge; she ranks near the bottom on many right-wing scorecards. (Conservative Review gave her an F.)It\u2019s a mistake to doubt the sincerity of Ms. Collins\u2019s and Ms. Murkowski\u2019s dedication to questions of women\u2019s health. Ms. Collins was one of only three Republican senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Last year, she and Ms. Murkowski broke ranks to cast the deciding votes against defunding Planned Parenthood. And this year, the two senators again voted with the majority of Senate Democrats to oppose a ban of abortion after 20 weeks. Both have been solid defenders of family planning and birth control. Both have earned high ratings with pro-choice groups \u2014 Ms. Collins has been rated higher than 90 percent by groups like NARAL in multiple years. To cave on this particular issue would be a tragic abrogation of personal, as well as political, conviction. Which is why the Supreme Court battle may at last compel both women to abandon the party they should have abandoned already.A Senate no longer in the Republican grip could rescue women\u2019s reproductive rights on multiple fronts: maternity coverage, access to contraception, teen-pregnancy prevention, breast-cancer treatment. It could protect us from planned eviscerations of Social Security and Medicare, and stop the gutting of Obamacare, the greenlighting of partisan gerrymandering, and the enshrining of an ethically shameless kleptocracy. It would thwart the authoritarian dream of seamless one-party rule across all three branches of government. Even a threat of leaving would send a salutary shock through the party.After six moderate Republican senators signed the declaration, Mr. McCarthy labeled them, in Trumpian fashion, \u201cSnow White and the Six Dwarves.\u201d He had Ms. Smith removed from her post on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (replacing her with Richard Nixon) and lavished support on her challenger in the next election (she won anyway).Ms. Smith could at least appeal to Republican legislators willing to put reason, compassion, and country ahead of party. Trumpist Republicans have no room for such niceties \u2014 they care only about winning.

{"Headline": "Fly Farther, for Cheaper. For Now.", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayTechnology advancements and the surge in low-cost carriers, particularly on international routes, have made flying more convenient and cheaper, if not necessarily more comfortable.Summer is perennially peak season in air travel and this summer appears to be an especially good time to fly as airline competition, the increased deployment of fuel-efficient planes, and expanding route maps offer travelers more choices and often bargain fares.The number of fliers is expected to rise 3.7 percent this summer over last, with a record 246.1 million passengers traveling domestically on United States airlines between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to Airlines for America, the industry trade organization representing most of the major American airlines.Added capacity has helped keep prices down, even as demand is rising, according to research by the airfare prediction app Hopper. It estimates that prices will be down this summer 6.7 percent compared to last summer, forecasting average domestic fares to drop to $211 in July and August from $240 in June.\u201cEvery summer, there\u2019s a big spike in the number of people traveling, but the last few years we\u2019ve had low oil prices which has caused airlines to increase capacity,\u201d said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist for Hopper. \u201cThat could be coming to an end with rising oil prices. This summer may be your last chance to get a cheap deal, particularly if you\u2019re flying internationally.\u201d Since the industry was deregulated in 1979, increased competition and airline consolidation caused airfares, when adjusted for inflation, to drop 40 percent, according to the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank devoted to transportation issues. In 2016, it found the average domestic round-trip ticket in the United States cost $367 versus $187 in 1979. \u201cAirlines became very efficient at trying to get as many paying passengers onboard per flight,\u201d said Paul Lewis, the vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center. \u201cSeats got closer, load factors got higher and while we don\u2019t tend to like cramming into an airplane, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to enjoy relatively low fares.\u201dTechnology advancements and the surge in low-cost carriers, particularly on international routes, have made flying more convenient, if not necessarily more comfortable.\u201cThen they were flying quad engines and now they can do it with two,\u201d said Seth Kaplan, the managing partner at Airline Weekly, an industry publication. \u201cBeing able to cover the same distance with half as many engines with far less fuel can make it viable again.\u201dThe three major Persian Gulf carriers \u2014 Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways \u2014 have aggressively marketed to American fliers, offering relatively affordable economy fares to Asia, in particular by positioning their base airports in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, respectively, as long-distance flight hubs. Last year, I couldn\u2019t pass up a $950 flight to Sri Lanka on Qatar that required a change of planes in Abu Dhabi when the next cheapest fare, also a one-stop, was $400 more.United States airlines have cried foul, noting that Gulf governments with deep pockets are subsidizing these money-losing routes at the expense of true competition. In May, the United Arab Emirates, which owns Emirates and Etihad, agreed to more financial transparency; Qatar agreed to the same earlier this year.\u201cAmerican carriers believe they\u2019re not playing fair and over the next 12 months we\u2019ll have a better sense of how this will play out,\u201d said Mr. Lewis. Legacy carriers in the United States \u2014 American, United and Delta \u2014 have expanded their networks by partnering with foreign airlines to sync connecting flights. They are also increasing seasonal nonstop service, such as American\u2019s Chicago-to-Venice flights introduced this summer, when demand warrants. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all parties,\u201d said Rob Britton, the founder of the aviation consultancy AirLearn. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed the airlines to build networks in all directions. And it\u2019s good for the consumer because they\u2019re given enormous choice.\u201dBudget-minded fliers have embraced low-cost flights for their rock-bottom fares, so much so that legacy carriers in the United States have created frill-free fares to compete with them. Hopper found that Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air expanded their domestic capacity by 15 percent in the last year.International low-cost carriers, including WOW Air, Germanwings, Cebu Pacific and others, expanded their service to American markets by 52 percent in the past year, according to Hopper.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t fly Norwegian, other airlines have to compete with them and it puts downward pressure on airfares,\u201d said Mr. Kaplan. \u201cSo, it\u2019s an interesting time for air travel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Record $2.5 Trillion in Mergers Were Announced in the First Half of 2018", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than $2.5 trillion in mergers were announced during the first half of the year, as fears of Silicon Valley\u2019s growing ambitions helped drive a record run of deal-making.Four of the 10 biggest deals were struck in part to fend off competition from the largest technology companies as the value of acquisitions announced during the first six months of the year increased 61 percent from the same period in 2017, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That has put mergers in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion, which would top 2015 as the largest yearly total on record.Even rising global trade tensions did not manage to stifle acquisitions: Deals involving companies based in different countries nearly doubled compared with the first half of last year, and accounted for more than 40 percent of all announced transactions.Big deals, a number of them in media and health care, have driven much of the activity. So far this year, companies have announced 36 transactions valued at $10 billion or more, according to Thomson Reuters. They combined for $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38 percent of all activity.Competition from the tech sector has pushed the largest media firms to own both the content and the platforms on which it appears. So far this year, the value of the announced media deals has jumped to $323 billion, up nearly 440 percent from a year ago.Even so, the value of so-called cross-border deals jumped to more than $1 trillion in the first half of the year, its second-highest level on record. Acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers jumped 48 percent to $206 billion.A pickup in deal-making since 2015, if history is any indicator, is not necessarily a positive sign for the economy. Other recent peaks in merger and acquisition activity have been followed in short order by a recession.In 1989, deal-making topped out at $558 billion. By July of 1990, though, a recession had set in. Companies announced acquisitions worth a then-record $3.4 trillion in 2000, and within three months the dot-com bubble had burst and the United States economy had fallen into recession. Seven years later, merger activity hit another record, topping $4.1 trillion, but the economy had already slipped into recession as the year came to a close.Stephen F. Arcano, a partner specializing in mergers at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said that while the market for mergers is strong now, there could be reasons to be concerned about a slowdown.\u201cThe fundamentals for a strong M. & A. market are still in place, but there are risks that could become headwinds, such as the concerns regarding potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and, in the longer term, rising interest rates,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But his triumphal message was muddied by the woes of Midwestern soybean farmers, who have been caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump\u2019s multifront trade war.\u201cTo see an old big monster plant like this reopening, that is a great honor,\u201d he declared to a raucous crowd, clad in a mix of hard hats and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps. \u201cThe days of plundering American jobs and wealth \u2014 those days are over.\u201d\u201cI could be one of you,\u201d the president added. \u201cI\u2019d be happy if I was, because you\u2019re opening up plants all over the country.\u201dMr. Trump introduced his daughter Ivanka, who congratulated the workers at the plant, where the owner, United States Steel Corporation, has begun firing up the second of two blast furnaces after a long shutdown. Then, she thanked her father for \u201cenabling it to happen.\u201dAt the Granite City Works on Thursday, Donald J. Trump was the only thing bigger than U.S. Steel.With his obligatory attacks on the news media, his leisurely digressions into his 2016 election victory, his professions of affection for strongmen like Kim Jong-un of North Korea, and the thumping classic-rock soundtrack, Mr. Trump could have been at one of his political rallies.Still, the president\u2019s trip to the Midwest on Thursday, which included a stop in Iowa, also cast a light on farmers, whose soybean exports dried up after China struck back over the tariffs. While praising President Xi Jinping as a friend and a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d he said China was punishing farmers so it could continue its longstanding practice of stealing technology from American companies.\u201cWe will not give China or any other country a veto on United States national security,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we will not let anybody ruin our wonderful American farmers.\u201dAdministration officials contend that overall job gains outpace the losses, and that companies like Mid Continent Nail may be using Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs as an excuse for their own business shortcomings.\u201cIt\u2019s not always because of tariffs,\u201d the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cA lot of companies have been using the excuse \u2018Oh, the reason my earnings weren\u2019t good is that there were the tariffs.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump reprised familiar themes in his speeches on Thursday, mocking the news media for its coverage of his summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and promising a big number on Friday when the government announces its economic growth estimates.In Granite City, which has the vacant lots and boarded-up storefronts that are familiar landmarks in hard-luck steel towns, the sense of economic injustice is deeply ingrained. The town\u2019s website has a page describing how the practice of steel dumping hurts the local economy.But as the steelworkers waited for Mr. Trump, they expressed no bitterness toward their foreign counterparts.\u201cPeople working in China and Mexico are just doing their best to make a living and feed their families,\u201d said Mark Odom, 32, who was laid off for three years. \u201cThe problem is with the governments.\u201dMr. Odom said he made ends meet by working as a maintenance man at a hotel. But he was not able to afford insurance, and his wife had to put off surgery. He expressed gratitude to Mr. Trump for getting his job back and for what he said was a leveling of the playing field with China.Nathan Kessler, 52, a millwright who just returned to his job after 10 months out of work, said the United States needed to have its own steel production for national security reasons \u2014 citing one of the White House\u2019s criteria for imposing 25 percent tariffs on European and Asian steel.\u201cWhat happens if we get into a war?\u201d Mr. Kessler asked. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Melt down Kias?\u201dAsked whether they worried that the next president could lift the tariffs, or that Mr. Trump could reverse course as part of a broader trade agreement, the men shrugged their shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Kessler said, adding that he was just happy to be on the clock.In case the workers were not grateful enough, United States Steel\u2019s chief executive, David B. Burritt, took the podium before Mr. Trump\u2019s motorcade arrived to exhort his troops to give the president a warm welcome.\u201cWe have a president who believes in you. He is fighting for us,\u201d Mr. Burritt said, before delivering his punch line. \u201cYou hear the president say \u2018make America great again.\u2019 Let\u2019s make U.S. Steel great again.\u201dIn Granite City\u2019s faded commercial district, the politics of trade are hard to miss. Posters for Brendan Kelly, a Democratic state\u2019s attorney who is challenging the Republican congressman, Mike Bost, flank the local chapter of the United Steelworkers union.The union endorsed Mr. Kelly shortly before Mr. Trump announced the steel and aluminum tariffs, citing his better record on trade. Mr. Trump brought along Mr. Bost, who is facing a stiff challenge from Mr. Kelly, to his speech, where the congressman received a polite, if not rapturous, reception.For the most part, however, local merchants are just glad to see the workers coming back.\u201cIf the guys aren\u2019t working there, they\u2019re not coming in here,\u201d said Larry Petri, 62, who runs a family-owned cafe a few blocks from the factory gates. \u201cSix guys in here for lunch means $60.\u201dMr. Petri, who said the recent shutdown was one of the longest since his parents opened the Petri Cafe in 1946, said Mr. Trump deserved credit for the fact that the furnaces at Granite City were firing again, regardless of whatever else people might think of him.\u201cNo matter if you don\u2019t like him as a president, no matter if you don\u2019t like him as a person,\u201d Mr. Petri said, \u201che got that mill going again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the National \u2018Mood\u2019 the One in Polls or the One Online?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIn psychological terms, \u201cmood\u201d is a weather report for your personal emotions, a measure of balmy good cheer or dreary storms. But our emotions, naturally, are influenced by the same winds of change that blow on every other person\u2019s. Certain clouds gather over all our heads \u2014 the hardships of a war, or a sudden economic downturn \u2014 and dump the same cold rain on everyone. Other days we bear witness to an unexpected act of heroism or a rousing international sports triumph and bask in the same sun. Psychologists have suggested for years that moods are actually contagious, meaning yours are just one part of a vast, dynamic system: We take in what those around us say, absorb the sentiments behind those words and slowly begin mirroring those feelings with our own.The idea of scientifically measuring such moods traces back at least as far as the 1930s, when George Gallup, the man who would one day be described by Time magazine as the \u201cBabe Ruth of the polling profession,\u201d founded the American Institute of Public Opinion and committed himself to collecting accurate data on the whole nation\u2019s sensibilities, unskewed by the ulterior motives of political parties or interest groups. The institute correctly predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would defeat the Republican challenger Alfred Landon in the 1936 presidential election; just two years after that, it had already begun conducting market research for studios in Hollywood. A new industry \u2014 public-opinion data as a valuable commodity, an advance warning of which way the country\u2019s emotional winds were blowing \u2014 was off and running.It\u2019s the job of politicians and the media\u2019s pundit class to utilize such numbers in the service of advocating and implementing public policy. A Quinnipiac poll in June showed that the family separations stemming from President Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy were so resoundingly opposed that, according to NBC News, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take a political scientist to read the current public mood on the topic.\u201d Sometimes hard numbers aren\u2019t even necessary; sheer political instinct will do. John Podhoretz of Commentary, assessing whether Republicans have a chance of holding their congressional advantages in the coming midterms, concluded, without citing any polling data, that voters \u201cwill probably be in a much better mood than previous midterm electorates\u201d because of the improving economy.Whether based on data or on intuition, all these divinations of the national mood are rooted in the idea that the most important parts of our emotional weather are happening outside us as individuals, over our collective heads. We\u2019ll act and think as a kind of hive mind, driving markets and electing officials and erupting in anger en masse, always gathering up into some kind of aggregate emotional register.In January, Ryan Cummings, then an eighth grader in North Carolina, participated in a cheerleading competition with a group called Cheer Extreme Allstars. At the beginning of her group\u2019s routine, she struck a defiant pose: Her head was cocked, her steely eyes stared unblinkingly forward and her lips were tightly pursed, forming an expression set somewhere between a smirk and a sneer \u2014 the sort of withering glare that adults secretly fear whenever walking past a pack of contemptuous teenagers on the street. (\u201cWhen I made that face,\u201d Cummings would later tell BuzzFeed, \u201cI was just thinking, I really want my team to kill it.\u201d) It\u2019s very unlikely that anyone outside Cheer Extreme Allstars\u2019 immediate sphere would be aware of that face were it not for a single Twitter account, which plucked, from a nearly six-minute YouTube video of the routine, a five-second clip of Cummings and captioned it with two simple words: \u201cbig mood.\u201d The resulting tweet has since been liked more than 164,000 times.It\u2019s that viral tweet about the young cheerleader, though, that has been credited by internet-culture sites like The Daily Dot with finally bringing \u201cbig mood\u201d to its mainstream saturation point, making the phrase fair game for use by established media, moderately hip parents and corporate brands. Cummings is a big reason you may have noticed a lot more things being categorized as big moods lately: Blake Lively\u2019s testy encounter with photographers at the Met Gala (as described by E! News), or a Japanese animated series on Netflix (as described by Elle), or a video of two lynxes yelling at each other (as described by Vice), or an important win by the Boston Red Sox (as described by the Boston Red Sox). Nothing is so small or inconsequential that it can\u2019t inspire the internet\u2019s outsize passions.We would rather our moods be big in this figurative sense (rich, vibrant, specific, intensely personal) than the literal one (collective, shared, part of a system that acts upon us). Social media emboldens this feeling of specialness. Who else but you would think to sum up a personal mood with, say, a photo of an exhausted squirrel, splayed out on a railing outside an office window? But of course hundreds of people recently favorited a tweet doing exactly that, offering replies like \u201csame\u201d and \u201cshe is me and I is her.\u201dThere\u2019s no avoiding these emotional contagions. Being inundated with so many moods can affect how we see everything around us, unleashing complex waves of uplift or tumult. If you scan social media these days, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the overriding sentiments \u2014 the inescapable moods that hang over all our heads like stagnant humidity \u2014 are those of annoyance, consternation and abstract misery. Not just about the day\u2019s news or the latest grand controversy, but about everything, in general. These feelings can feed into one another, influencing the collective mood as profoundly, and maybe as adversely, as world-historic news events and natural disasters and national humiliations. Take a step back, and you see something like a rat-king of feeling, the biggest mood of all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Is Usually Off-Limits to the President. Is Trump Changing That?", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve, the powerful entity that steers the United States economy, has plenty of critics in Washington, but the White House typically holds its tongue.Is that now changing?When asked last week if the Fed might undermine the economy with too many interest rate increases, Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said he hoped the central bank would \u201cmove very slowly.\u201dLast month, Fed policymakers signaled that they may make four interest rate increases this year, up from the three they previously expected. That means the Fed could raise rates two more times this year, and three next, according to the policymakers\u2019 indications. Mr. Kudlow\u2019s remarks could be construed as a signal that the White House does not want those increases to come quickly.That the president\u2019s top economic adviser expressed an opinion on monetary policy might not seem controversial, especially when so many other economic matters are up for discussion. But it had become something of a norm for the White House to refrain from questioning the Fed.But in a phone interview, Mr. Kudlow said he merely was expressing his personal opinions. \u201cI respect the Fed\u2019s independence. In no way would I ever seek to undermine it,\u201d he said. \u201cI happen to approve of the Fed\u2019s policy.\u201dKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who was a candidate to be the Fed\u2019s chairman, came away from his interview last year with Mr. Trump with the impression that the president was not particularly mindful of central bank independence.Investors, who watch interest rates closely, do not yet appear to believe that the Trump administration has crossed the line. But if Trump administration officials made a habit of questioning the Fed\u2019s moves, investors would become unsettled, said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial.\u201cThe market can tolerate boundary skirmishes on monetary policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will not welcome constant skirmishes.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s so-called dual mandate is to foster the economic conditions that will lead to maximum employment and stable prices. It cuts interest rates to stimulate economic activity and raises them to cool the economy if there are signs that prices are rising too fast.Still, there is a chance that the Fed will be able to raise interest rates this year and next without causing a full-blown recession. If that happens, the Fed most likely will be able to go about its business without interference.\u201cRespect for Fed independence is nearly always conditional on the shape of the economy,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University who co-wrote a book on Congress\u2019s relations with the Fed.The Fed may be able to avoid slamming on the brakes because the economy could be less prone to inflation than it was. Changes in the economy and the United States work force appear to have weakened the relationship between unemployment and prices.Mr. Kudlow contends that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, like tax cuts and deregulation, are lowering costs for businesses and creating incentives for them to invest. These so-called supply-side changes, he asserts, are starting to enable the economy to grow with less risk of inflation.This was his basis for his comments last week on the pace of rate increases, which were made in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business. \u201cMy hope is that they understand that, and they will move very slowly,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, referring to the Fed.But some economists say the tax cuts will help stoke inflation because they were enacted just as the economy was picking up steam.The big question is how the Trump administration might react if the Fed does cause the economy to slow considerably. To apply real influence over the Fed, past administrations have gone beyond jawboning, said Sebastian Mallaby, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a biography of Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman. Past presidents have tried to put people on the Fed\u2019s board who share their views on monetary policy or other matters. There are currently four open spots on the Fed\u2019s board. Two of them could be filled soon.\u201cI\u2019d say the Trump team is the first time in a quarter of a century when you\u2019ve had a direct threat from a president or an administration to the independence of the Fed,\u201d Mr. Mallaby said.Mr. Kudlow, however, said he agreed with the Fed\u2019s current monetary policy, because, in his view, Mr. Powell is also likely to be wary of raising interest rates too quickly. \u201cThis is what they\u2019re doing, basically, as I understand it from Jay\u2019s comments, public comments,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, referring to Mr. Powell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War With China Is Officially Underway", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies officially began on Friday morning as the Trump administration followed through with its threat to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, a significant escalation of a fight that could hurt companies and consumers in both the United States and China.China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the United States \u201chas launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far.\u201dThe escalation of the trade war from threat to reality is expected to ripple through global supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers and roil global stock markets, which have been volatile in anticipation of a prolonged trade fight between the United States and almost everyone else.On Thursday, President Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight, saying aboard Air Force One that the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in goods would quickly be followed by levies on another $16 billion of Chinese products. And Mr. Trump continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.For now, it is unclear how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the trade war might conclude. Mr. Trump\u2019s threats have been met with vows from China to retaliate, a stalemate that will require one side to blink first in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely.\u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t see how this ends,\u201d said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThis is very much in the president\u2019s hands because he\u2019s got advisers that seem divided, some substantively, some tactically. I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had any clear signs of the resolution he wants.\u201dThe Trump administration is waging trade wars on multiple fronts as it imposes tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines from countries like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan. Yet the tariffs on China, the world\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, affect a much larger share of products and a greater percentage of companies that rely on global supply chains, potentially hurting American companies even more than the Chinese firms the Trump administration is targeting.But the trade measures come at a cost for American firms, which are facing potentially devastating disruptions to their businesses.As of Friday morning, companies like Husco International, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that makes parts for companies like Ford, General Motors, Caterpillar and John Deere, now face a 25 percent increase on a variety of parts imported from China. Austin Ramirez, Husco International\u2019s chief executive, said that increase would immediately put him and other American manufacturers at a disadvantage to competitors abroad.\u201cThe people it helps most of all are my competitors in Germany and Japan, who also have large parts of their supply chain in Asia but don\u2019t have these tariffs,\u201d he said.Mr. Ramirez said his company would not be able to absorb the additional costs, and would be forced to try to pass them on to suppliers or customers \u2014 if it could. He was also fearful of how China\u2019s tit-for-tat retaliation would ultimately affect his business in that country.\u201cOne of the big scary unknowns is we don\u2019t know how China will react,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. \u201cThere are lots of things they could do to make life difficult for U.S. businesses operating in China that would be detrimental to us.\u201dBrent Bible, a farmer who cultivates 5,000 acres of corn and soy in western Indiana, said the trade war was already damaging his farm and the broader agricultural economy. More than half of American soybeans that are exported go to China, giving the country influence over the price of the American crop. Trade worries have pushed down the price of soybeans roughly 15 percent in recent months, erasing his typical yearly profit margin of 8 percent to 10 percent.Mr. Bible said farmers are now putting off purchases of tractors, grain storage facilities and other items to make ends meet.\u201cIf we\u2019re not spending money,\u201d he said, \u201cthen other industries aren\u2019t making any money off of us, either.\u201dThe Trump administration drafted its initial tariff list to spare consumers, and many of the products that American families purchase from China, like flat-screen TVs and shoes, are not directly hit on Friday. But American companies that depend on Chinese products are expected to feel the pinch, given the tariffs focus heavily on the kind of intermediate inputs and capital equipment that businesses purchase and ultimately sell both in the United States and abroad.China\u2019s Commerce Ministry accused the United States of \u201ctypical trade bullying\u201d and said in a statement that its tariffs \u201cwill impact innocent multinational companies and ordinary enterprises and consumers alike.\u201d\u201cIt will also harm the interests of U.S. businesses and its people,\u201d it said.Economists say Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war will raise costs for American industry, potentially threatening the manufacturing jobs that the president has long said he wants to protect. And some of those higher costs will ultimately work their way through the supply chain to American consumers.Razat Gaurav, the chief executive of LLamasoft, which advises companies on organizing their supply chains, said that many of his customers have been making alternate plans to restructure their operations, with some choosing to set up in countries like Vietnam or Mexico. Others are postponing large investments, like new factories, and are trying to avoid signing long-term contracts with suppliers \u2014 all changes that will eventually take a toll on the economy.\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see an effect on the longer-term view of the U.S. as a place to export,\u201d Ms. Lovely said. \u201cThese tariffs are not hitting the mark, and they\u2019re making it much harder for American firms to do business inside the United States, let alone export markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A President With No Shame and a Party With No Guts", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s become a huge source of power for Trump and trouble for the rest of us.Opinion ColumnistIf your puppy makes a mess on your carpet and you shout \u201cBad dog,\u201d there is a good chance that that puppy\u2019s ears will droop, his head will bow and he may even whimper. In other words, even a puppy acts ashamed when caught misbehaving. That is not true of Donald Trump. Day in and day out, he proves to us that he has no shame. We\u2019ve never had a president with no shame \u2014 and it\u2019s become a huge source of power for him and trouble for us.When a president with no shame is backed by a party with no spine and a network with no integrity, you have two big problems. First, there is no one inside his party or base who is going to sustainably stop Trump from being himself and doing whatever he bloody pleases. The Republican Party has completely lost its way. Don\u2019t be fooled by the last-second tut-tutting of G.O.P. senators about Trump\u2019s kowtowing to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and spurning of our intelligence agencies. Until and unless the G.O.P.-led Congress passes legislation that protects special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by Trump or enacts into law specific, deeper sanctions on Russia if it is ever again caught trying to tilt our elections \u2014 or secures Trump\u2019s tax returns or the transcript of his two hours and 10 minutes of private conversation with Putin \u2014 it\u2019s all just talk to cover the G.O.P.\u2019s behind. Let the Republicans in Congress do something hard and concrete that shows they love our country more than they fear Trump\u2019s base and I will believe their words. The fact that Trump\u2019s party and his network always look for ways to excuse him has been hugely liberating for Trump. He can actually deny he said things that were recorded \u2014 like his trashing of the British prime minister. He can take one side of any issue (like trashing key NATO allies to satisfy his base) and, when he gets blowback, take the other side (claim to love the Atlantic alliance). And he can declare that he really meant to ask why \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d Russia be the one hacking us instead of why \u201cwould\u201d it, as he did say. If you believe that last one, I have a bridge near the Kremlin I\u2019d love to sell you.For instance, Trump is right: We do need to confront China on its trade restrictions, forced technology transfers and nonreciprocal trade arrangements. But then, look at the madness to his methods. How would you try to influence China on trade if you were thinking strategically?For starters, you\u2019d sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, creating a free-trade alliance around American values, standards and interests, with 11 other Pacific economies, creating a trade agreement covering 40 percent of global G.D.P. Then you\u2019d forgo ridiculous steel and aluminum tariffs on our European Union allies and sign them all up instead to join us in our efforts to curb China\u2019s trade abuses, which the E.U. suffers from just as much as we do.  Then you\u2019d go to the Chinese and say: \u201cLet\u2019s have secret negotiations \u2014 no one will lose face, we will present it publicly as win-win \u2014 but, just so you know, we will be coming at you with a Euro-Pacific coalition of all your major trading partners and we will be focused on eliminating all your cheating on W.T.O. rules and nonreciprocal trade shenanigans once and for all.\u201dNow that would get the attention of China \u2014 not a foolish trade war based on bilateral trade deficits. But what did Trump do with his method? Blow up TPP, blow up relations with the E.U. and confront China alone \u2014 an utterly mad method that I do not believe will produce the meaningful, sustainable trade realignment with China that we need.And then there is the sheer madness. Threatening the U.K. that if it doesn\u2019t do a full Brexit it will not get preferential trade treatment from Trump, calling the bloc a \u201cfoe\u201d on trade, and sneering at the number of refugees it has admitted.Where do you start? The E.U. is the United States of Europe \u2014 the other great center in the world of free markets, free people, liberty and democracy. It has kept the peace in Europe after a century of strife there \u2014 that dragged us into two world wars \u2014 and its economic growth as a trading partner has made both America and the E.U. steadily richer and more stable. It is sheer madness to believe that it is in U.S. interests to see the European Union fracture! Ask any senior U.S. military officer and you\u2019ll be told that our greatest strategic competitive advantage is that we have a network of allies, like the E.U., and the Russians and Chinese do not. They only have customers and vassals. Why would we give that up for closer ties to Putin?Also, speaking of sheer madness, so much of the immigration that has swamped Europe of late has come from migrants from Syria and sub-Saharan Africa. Both migrations are the product of political turmoil fed by climate change, the collapse of small-scale agriculture and rapid population growth in the Middle East and Africa. (Ditto Central America.) And what is Trump\u2019s policy? Trash all global efforts to mitigate climate change, ban all U.S. government support for family planning overseas \u2014 and get out of Syria, rather than use our leverage there to try to stabilize its refugee flow. The only way to change this situation is not by hoping that the president develops some shame or that this version of the G.O.P. develops some spine. It is by Democrats winning the House, the Senate or both in the midterm elections. Only by dealing an electoral defeat to this version of the G.O.P. in the midterms will we possibly get a healthy conservative party again (which we need) and curb Trump\u2019s power. Everything else is just words \u2014 and words without power change nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Sign of China\u2019s Slowdown: A Technology Cash Crunch", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 Wang Shidong and his two partners were still finishing graduate school two years ago when they raised $45 million in less than two months to start a venture capital fund. His wife, an elementary-school teacher in their home village, was \u201cterrified\u201d that he got to manage so much money, Mr. Wang said.Things are different this year. After three months and visits with more than 90 potential investors all over China, Mr. Wang and his partners raised only $3 million for a second fund. In June, they shut down the firm.Their fund, East Zhang Hangzhou Investment Management Ltd., was one of nearly 10,000 founded over the past three years amid a technology gold rush powered in part by China\u2019s government-guided economic growth engine. Now they have become the latest sign that China\u2019s engine is slowing down.\u201cAll industries, institutions and individuals are running short of cash,\u201d said Zhang Kaixing, founder and chief executive of an online asset management company in Shenzhen called Jinfuzi, which means \u201cgolden ax.\u201d Jinfuzi, which manages over $4.5 billion in assets, is the type of investor that technology funds court.\u201cMany investors in private equity and venture capital funds want to take their money back,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.Venture capital is a small part of the Chinese economy, which by most accounts is still growing at a quick pace compared with that of many other countries. But the industry\u2019s fund-raising problems may be a symptom of a widening malaise.After many years of easy credit and go-go growth, China is struggling with weakened investment and household consumption and increasing corporate and local government defaults. It could present Xi Jinping with his most difficult problem since he became the country\u2019s top leader in 2013. Will China\u2019s 40 years of continuous economic expansion stop under his rule? If so, how will 1.4 billion Chinese react when they realize that the country\u2019s upward trajectory is coming to an end?Many Chinese still believe that the central government has the capacity to keep the economy from sliding into a recession, just as it did during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Great Recession in 2008. Beijing controls the banks, land, foreign exchange rates and the media, so it can mobilize and manipulate them when necessary.\u201cIn China we believe in Keynesian economics,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, the Jinfuzi chief executive, referring to the economic theory that favors a bigger role for government. \u201cIf what\u2019s going on in China were happening in the U.S., it would have been called a recession. But in China, the government will step in to interfere in significant ways.\u201dYet in private conversations, investors, entrepreneurs and economists admit that with the high debt level and a trade war with the United States, the room for government maneuvering is shrinking. The degrees of pessimism vary, but many of them are bracing for a tough ride ahead.They told me to change all my savings into gold, a risk-management measure for extreme times. They worry that the trade war will hurt the tech and the venture capital industries because they operate globally. They even envision the possibility of the world\u2019s going back to the Iron Curtain era, the pre-1989 world order of distinct political, economic and ideological barriers between the Soviet bloc and the West.Wu Xiaoling, a former deputy central bank governor and now dean of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance, told the graduates last week to brace for global economic and political uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time left to revel in the carnival of bubbles,\u201d she said in a speech. \u201cEvery country, every individual should be prepared to face the reality after the tide retreats.\u201d The speech was circulated widely on the Chinese social media, possibly because she said what\u2019s on many people\u2019s minds.China\u2019s venture capital industry may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. It is sensitive to both money flows and capital sentiment, and therefore could offer a good gauge of the health of key parts of the Chinese economy. The Chinese government on Monday reported that the economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year ago.So far, funding this year is weak. In the first three months, private equity and venture capital funds raised less than two-thirds of what they had raised over the same period a year ago, according to Zero2IPO Research in Beijing. Their investing activity dropped by nearly half. Funding has slowed in the past when the economy hit bumps, but both the data and the people involved say the current slowdown is unprecedented.Venture funds like East Zhang came into existence in part because, starting in 2014, Beijing made innovation and entrepreneurship top priorities. Leaders hoped that start-ups would help elevate China from a manufacturing power to a technology power. Corporations, banks and wealthy individuals fought to give money to venture funds to invest in start-ups.\u201cWe ended up with a lot of dumb money, managed by inexperienced investors,\u201d said Ran Wang, chief executive of the investment bank CEC Capital Group in Beijing.Wang Shidong of East Zhang said his firm raised funds in 2016 without having to answer tough questions. They decided to set it up in the eastern city of Hangzhou, which \u2014 to attract funds like Mr. Wang\u2019s \u2014 provides streamlined business registration, tax cuts and below-market office rents, as many other Chinese cities do.They invested in 17 projects in e-commerce, internet, biotech and agriculture. Only one of them is doing well. The rest either have failed or are barely surviving, Mr. Zhang said.The funding climate changed completely this year, he said. \u201cInvestors started paying attention to our numbers.\u201dIt\u2019s not just newbie firms like East Zhang that are having a hard time finding investors. Funding is getting hard to come by for almost every venture capital firm.Under pressure from the government to improve their finances, banks pulled away from risky investments. This year\u2019s ailing Chinese stock market has cost companies and wealthy investors alike a great deal of money. The government has cracked down on the risky and informal sources of money within China that provided a lot of venture capital funding.Even venture capital firms with good track records are taking longer to reach their money-raising targets, said Ran Wang of CEC Capital. Some firms have to settle for smaller funds than planned, Mr. Wang said.There\u2019s another sign China\u2019s boom in start-ups may be over: They\u2019re going public. More than two dozen of China\u2019s star start-ups hope to sell shares on public stock markets this year. Generally, as in the United States, start-ups prefer not to go public as long as they have plenty of access to private money. China is home to more than 70 unicorns, or start-ups with valuations over $1 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s getting increasingly harder for companies with high valuations to raise funding from venture capital investors,\u201d said Mr. Wang of CEC Capital.As for Wang Shidong of East Zhang, he has sold his apartment and car to repay some of his investors and is getting ready to start anew. He is considering an offer from an acquaintance to work for an online payment venture in Nigeria.\u201cI\u2019m an adventurer,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the founder of the asset management company Jinfuzi. He is Zhang Kaixing, not Kaixin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Gillibrand Pushes Left, Her Economic Agenda Tilts to Populism", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Standing before a crowd of a thousand union members and progressive activists last month at a conference here that served as a 2020 audition for aspiring Democrats, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked if she supported imposing a new tax on financial transactions in the stock market.It once would have been unthinkable for a senator from New York, the epicenter of Wall Street money and influence, to back a tax so targeted at her own constituents. But Ms. Gillibrand did not hesitate to answer.\u201cI do,\u201d she said. The crowd erupted in cheers.The unequivocal embrace of the tax proposal was just the latest in a series of policy pronouncements and political moves that have thrust Ms. Gillibrand toward the front and left of the Democratic Party in the age of President Trump.If that sounds like the fundamental planks of a 2020 presidential campaign, Ms. Gillibrand, who is running for re-election in November, demurred. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about 2018,\u201d she insisted.\u201cLabels are hard,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in a wide-ranging interview about her agenda. \u201cBut I\u2019m comfortable with \u2018populist.\u2019\u201dMs. Gillibrand, unsurprisingly, views her economic platform in more generous terms, with roots in President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201csecond Bill of Rights\u201d and Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s call for full employment. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a bolder idea, and it\u2019s larger in scale, than all the things I\u2019ve worked on in the last 10 years,\u201d she said.On Capitol Hill, Ms. Gillibrand is viewed by her colleagues as one of a half-dozen senators most clearly positioning themselves for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, along with Mr. Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.When Ms. Gillibrand forswore corporate PAC money in February, she was following Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren; Mr. Booker joined them within hours. (Ms. Harris, at a town hall, initially waffled on doing so. \u201cIt depends,\u201d she said. But she soon reconsidered and joined the rest of the bloc by late April.)\u201cWhat is required of you, for that money?\u201d Mr. Oliver asked. \u201cBecause it makes me uncomfortable.\u201dToday, Ms. Gillibrand, who has long called for publicly financed campaigns, says that her decade-plus in Washington has taught her that \u201cevery ill in Congress, no matter what it is, it will stem from the fact that money corrupts politicians and politics.\u201dMs. Gillibrand\u2019s leftward tack has manifested itself in other ways. She has continued to outpace her colleagues in opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to his administration and the federal courts. (She rushed late at night to the courthouse steps after Mr. Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and led chants of \u201cStand against Kavanaugh!\u201d)And she became the first senator to call for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Her call to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d drew the attention of Mr. Parscale, the Trump campaign manager. He posted to Twitter an archived screenshot of her campaign website from when she was running in a conservative upstate New York House district. Then, she had opposed giving \u201camnesty to illegal aliens\u201d and called for English to be the country\u2019s \u201cofficial language.\u201d\u201cYou might want to update your website,\u201d Mr. Parscale wrote.\u201cHer only core belief is that her positions can be completely reversed to meet the mood of the progressive left,\u201d Mr. Parscale later said.How left is Ms. Gillibrand today?Ms. Gillibrand acknowledges her shift on immigration \u2014 \u201cI am very proud where I am today,\u201d she said \u2014 but cast her economic policies as in line with her past, citing more than once in the interview that she had opposed the bank bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, despite pressure from constituents and donors.Nationally, Ms. Gillibrand remains most closely identified with her stances and work on issues around women and sexual harassment, from her yearslong push to remove military sexual-assault cases from the chain of command to being the first Senate Democrat to call for then-Senator Al Franken to resign following allegations of sexual misconduct last year.Weeks earlier, she had declared that President Bill Clinton should have resigned over his inappropriate sexual relationship with an intern. The Clintons had been among Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s earliest and most important benefactors. (Hillary Clinton wrote the foreword to Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s book.)\u201cShe\u2019s living in a different context. And she did it for different reasons,\u201d Mr. Clinton said of Ms. Gillibrand on his recent book tour.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s Republican opponent for re-election this year, Chele Farley, has accused the senator of being \u201cbusy running for president\u201d in her first television ad. And Ms. Gillibrand does keep an aggressive schedule that includes travel across the country to hold high-dollar fund-raisers and campaign for other Senate candidates, especially women.Her outspokenness on sexual misconduct and her early adoption of the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d tagline have drawn national attention recently, but in the New York world it was her openness to a Wall Street tax that was seen as the clearest sign that her political outlook had expanded far beyond her home state\u2019s borders.\u201cWhy would the representative of the U.S. financial capital be putting an additional tax on the financial industry?\u201d asked Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of Partnership for New York City, a powerful business group. \u201cIt seems counterintuitive.\u201dNow her increasingly populist rhetoric and agenda appears to be a calculated gamble that, should she run in 2020, the traditional donor class by then may be eclipsed by the grass-roots fund-raising model for national Democrats.Indeed, her aides estimate that forgoing corporate money will cost Ms. Gillibrand $800,000 to $1 million this year alone. But she has invested heavily in digital fund-raising, collecting roughly $4.5 million online in 2017 alone, according to her campaign. About 97 percent of her donations this cycle have been $100 or less.Ms. Gillibrand sounded happy with where she is now. \u201cIt\u2019s a much better policy to take no corporate money,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia, Summit Is Seen as a Triumph for Putin", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 As President Trump faced fury in Washington for his Helsinki, Finland, performance, including from some fellow Republicans who called his deference to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia destructive and embarrassing, the view in Moscow was wholly positive.Little mention was made of the election-meddling scandal that has hovered over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. But plenty of attention was devoted to what the official Russian media described as Mr. Putin\u2019s triumph \u2014 an opinion shared, for different reasons, by Mr. Trump\u2019s critics in the United States and elsewhere.Here are some takeaways on Monday\u2019s talks, from the Russian perspective:Mr. Trump\u2019s fumbling responses to questions about the election meddling \u2014 and his apparent support for Mr. Putin\u2019s side of the story \u2014 hardly caused a stir in Russia\u2019s media, even as they dominated news coverage in the United States.Mr. Putin is not challenged by Russian journalists and can use the vast state media apparatus to portray himself favorably. Mr. Trump does not have that ability. The difference was stark in Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritative-sounding replies to questions.\u201cRussian political institutions are very weak and therefore, as president, Putin felt much more confident during the news conference,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based research group. \u201cPutin is only constrained by his own mind-set.\u201dRussian analysts conceded that the meeting offered few concrete agreements or concessions, but most saw the resumption of dialogue as a sign of things to come.Dmitri V. Badovsky, the head of the Institute of Socio-Economic and Political Research, a pro-Putin research group in Russia, told Vedomosti, the Russian business daily, that the two presidents had \u201cbegun to see one another as long-term partners.\u201d\u201cWe are exiting a period of \u2018no dialogue,\u2019 and Russia is ceasing to be toxic,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. The process will continue if Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin visit each other\u2019s capitals in the near future, he said.Russian analysts, including Kremlin critics, agreed that the meeting had allowed Mr. Putin to show that Russia is indispensable in world affairs \u2014 even with the accusations of election-meddling and other rogue-like behavior, including evidence that Russian operatives used a Soviet-designed nerve agent against suspected adversaries in Britain.\u201cThe meeting was valuable to Putin because it showed that despite the indictments and poison accusations, the West is still compelled to speak to Russia and regards it as an important and respectable country,\u201d Mr. Makarkin said.In March, Mr. Putin won re-election to his fourth term, reflecting his underlying popularity and the inability of political adversaries to seriously challenge him. But now he faces the vexing question of what will be the driving force of his next six years in the Kremlin.Under the weight of Western sanctions and Russia\u2019s own inefficiencies, the economy has performed poorly since at least 2013. Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy adventures, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and direct intervention in the Syrian war since 2015, diverted public attention from economic problems \u2014 up to now.Such distractions cannot last indefinitely, however. Despite the public\u2019s pride in a successful World Cup tournament, people\u2019s trust in Mr. Putin has weakened this year, from 57 percent in January to 38 percent in July, according to VTsIOM, the state-run pollster. Many Russians have been angered by a toughening of pension benefits and a tax increase, announced the same day as the opening of the World Cup last month.Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian organizations devoted to human rights looked to the United States for guidance and financial support. Over the past decade, the Kremlin has made it difficult for such groups to receive funding from abroad. Still, they would appeal to the White House to support their causes during talks with Russian leaders \u2014 demanding, for example, the release of political prisoners in Russia.The Helsinki meeting was different. Many rights groups do not see Mr. Trump as an ally. And their low expectations that he would raise human-rights issues with Mr. Putin appeared to be well founded. Some did not even bother to make an effort.\u201cThis time around, unlike with the previous U.S.-Russia summits, Human Rights Watch did not publish a news release or address the White House with specific human rights asks on Russia,\u201d said Tanya Lokshina, the organization\u2019s Russia program director. \u201cUnder present circumstances, we decided against it.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer and Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sergio Marchionne, Who Revived Fiat and Chrysler, Dies at 66", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySergio Marchionne, the executive who pulled two ailing carmakers from the brink of collapse and led the improbable transformation of Fiat Chrysler into an automotive giant, died on Wednesday in Zurich. He was 66.John Elkann, the chairman and chief executive of Exor, the holding company controlled by the Agnelli family, which founded Fiat in 1899, announced the death in a statement.Mr. Marchionne had been incapacitated about three weeks ago by sudden complications of shoulder surgery, which he had undergone in Zurich. He was reportedly later put on life support. After Fiat Chrysler announced that he would be \u201cunable to return to work,\u201d the company hastily appointed a successor this past weekend.\u201cUnfortunately, what we feared has come to pass,\u201d Mr. Elkann said on Wednesday. \u201cSergio Marchionne, man and friend, is gone.\u201dMr. Marchionne took over Fiat, in Turin, Italy, in 2004 and spearheaded the acquisition of Chrysler in 2009. On both occasions the businesses were near low ebbs, and few gave him any chance of success. But he defied those gloomy predictions. Today, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ferrari, which was spun off during Mr. Marchionne\u2019s tenure, are worth nearly 10 times as much as they were when he took over.An Italian-born Canadian, Mr. Marchionne had a reputation as a chain-smoking workaholic, one who forged his career as a tax consultant before moving on to a metals-trading firm and a trade services company.His legacy was defined, however, by his work in the automotive industry. When he was hired by the Agnelli family to run the company, it was faltering, and they charged him with reversing its long decline.Acting quickly, he dismissed several executives, pared back production levels to meet demand and eliminated some slow-selling models.Before long, Mr. Marchionne became closely watched as one of the fastest-moving chief executives in the auto industry.He also had a quirky side. At news conferences, he entertained reporters with answers peppered with references to philosophers, pop music and ancient history. He once gave a commencement speech at the University of Toledo, in Ohio, that quoted Nelson Mandela and Albert Einstein while lauding the city\u2019s long association with Fiat\u2019s Jeep brand.In 2006, he arrived at a meeting wearing a black sweater and black jeans; deciding that he liked not having to think about his wardrobe, he stuck with that look for years. (He said he kept dozens of identical sweaters and pairs of jeans in each of his homes.)His business acumen was also repeatedly on display. Soon after becoming chief executive, he took advantage of an existing deal between General Motors and Fiat to attempt to force G.M. to buy the Italian carmaker, a move G.M. had no desire to make. In a high-stakes game of corporate poker, Mr. Marchionne compelled G.M. to pay Fiat $2 billion to end their alliance, and used the money to develop new models, including the Fiat 500, a small car that became a hit in Europe.As the Treasury Department in Washington hastened to prevent the collapse of much of the United States auto industry in the wake of the financial crisis, Mr. Marchionne stepped forward with an audacious offer: Fiat would take control of Chrysler, the sickest of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers, and provide cars and technology to revive it.There was a catch, however: The government would have to hand Chrysler over to Fiat free of charge.It was a hardball offer typical of Mr. Marchionne. But he knew that the Treasury, as well as Chrysler\u2019s creditors and its labor union, had little room to negotiate. The American economy was slipping deeper into recession, the collapse of Chrysler would have meant the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, and no other company was willing to rescue it.It was the beginning of one of the most remarkable rescues in the auto industry. Today, Fiat Chrysler, while still facing challenges, is solidly profitable, and Mr. Marchionne is revered in the halls of two headquarters, in Turin, Italy, and in Auburn Hills, Mich., north of Detroit.A confidant of his, Mike Jackson, the chief executive of AutoNation, a large dealership chain, said Mr. Marchionne had an unusually analytical mind. \u201cHe could take a fire hose of complexity and reduce it to its fundamentals in minutes,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cHe had the courage to make very aggressive decisions, and if it went badly he\u2019d be totally accountable for it.\u201dMr. Marchionne was born on June 17, 1952, in Chieti, on the Adriatic coast of Italy. His father, a police officer, saved and invested enough to retire early and move his family to Toronto when the young Sergio was 14.Mr. Marchionne studied philosophy at the University of Toronto, earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the University of Windsor, in Ontario, and a law degree from York University, also in Toronto, before beginning his career as a tax specialist.He had planned to retire next year before becoming critically ill as a result of his shoulder surgery on July 5. The company chose Mike Manley, the head of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s North America operations and its Jeep and Ram truck brands, to succeed him.Mr. Marchionne is survived by two sons, Alessio and Tyler, as well as Manuela Battezzato, his companion of the last several years. She is a member of the Fiat Chrysler communications office.In Italy, where Fiat was synonymous with the country\u2019s postwar economic boom for decades, lawmakers from across the political spectrum paid tribute to Mr. Marchionne on Wednesday, and flags flew at half-staff at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s offices in Turin.President Sergio Mattarella said Mr. Marchionne had written \u201can important page in the history of Italian industry.\u201dThe Italian news media broadcast video recordings of Mr. Marchionne\u2019s last public appearance, on June 26, in Rome, where he donated a Jeep to the Carabinieri, Italy\u2019s paramilitary police.Taking deep breaths between words, Mr. Marchionne noted that his father had been a Carabiniere and lauded the group\u2019s \u201cvalues that were at the basis of my education: seriousness, honesty, sense of duty, discipline and the spirit of service.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, it calls for the widespread imposition of work requirements for Medicaid, food stamps and other programs. But that would have the effect of sharply reducing those programs\u2019 coverage.This decline in coverage wouldn\u2019t be the result of large numbers of people earning their way out of poverty. Instead, many poor Americans would, for a variety of reasons \u2014 poor health, job instability for low-wage workers, daunting paperwork imposed on those least able to deal with it \u2014 find it impossible to meet the requirements, and be denied aid despite remaining poor.So whatever the evidence, Republicans always reach the same policy conclusion. Was the war on poverty a failure? Let\u2019s stop helping the poor. Was it a success? Let\u2019s stop helping the poor.And let\u2019s be clear: We\u2019re talking about the whole party, not just the Trump administration. In particular, Republican governors are fanatical about cutting benefits for their lower-income residents.So what\u2019s behind the G.O.P.\u2019s war on the poor?It\u2019s also not about the money. At the state level, many Republican governors are still refusing to expand Medicaid even though it would cost them little and would bring money into their states\u2019 economies. At the federal level, it would take draconian benefit cuts, imposing immense suffering, to save as much money as the G.O.P. casually gave away in last year\u2019s tax cut.What about the traditional answer that it\u2019s really about race? Social programs have often been seen as helping Those People, not white Americans. And that\u2019s still surely part of what\u2019s going on.So what is the war on the poor about? As I see it, you need to make a distinction between what motivates the G.O.P. base and what motivates conservative politicians.And what motivates these elites is ideology. Their political identities, not to mention their careers, are wrapped up in the notion that more government is always bad. So they oppose programs that help the poor partly out of a general hostility toward \u201ctakers,\u201d but also because they hate the idea of government helping anyone.And if they get their way, society will stop helping tens of millions of Americans who desperately need that help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Cup\u2019s Hot New Accessory Comes With a Few Questions", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The must-have accessory at the 2018 World Cup is a passport-sized badge of honor that, for many fans, symbolizes the fulfillment of a lifetime\u2019s ambition.The badge, called a Fan ID, is an innovation introduced at the World Cup for the first time and is almost as valuable as a ticket. No fan can get into a World Cup stadium without one. It also grants access to perks like visa-free entry into Russia, free transport in and occasionally between host cities and discounts in certain shops and restaurants.Part identity card and conversation-starter, it hangs from a FIFA lanyard around the neck of nearly every fan at the World Cup \u2014 a laminated credential to what could pass for the world\u2019s coolest business conference.Yet it has also raised concerns about privacy in a country that has been a base for international hackers and that has a long history of closely monitoring its citizens. The Russian authorities said the only purpose of the badges is to improve the security and comfort of fans. The badges, however, do give World Cup organizers and security officials the ability to track the location of fans during the tournament and provide the authorities those fans\u2019 personal information.Many spectators simply like them as keepsakes.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep this for the rest of my life,\u201d said the Brazilian fan Arnaldo Ylem, 50, proudly looking down at his Fan ID. It displayed a small photo of his face as well as his name in both English and Russian script.The Russian authorities created the Fan ID program as part of an extensive security operation for one of the biggest groups of foreign tourists the country has ever received.Each Fan ID is logged by Russia\u2019s Communications Ministry, under a set of agreements with FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body. Organizers have said that the Russian government had agreed that all information they obtain, which includes names, dates of birth, passport numbers, phone numbers, emails and home addresses, would be \u201cstrictly confidential.\u201dIn total, more than 1.6 million Fan IDs have been distributed to tournament visitors, including V.I.P.s and celebrities. Even the disgraced former president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, who is attending the event as a guest of President Vladimir V. Putin, and the Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona were required to obtain and wear them.The Russian authorities are able to track every person\u2019s entry into every game. That might have allowed the authorities to locate Rodrigo Vicentini, a fan who had been wanted by the authorities in Brazil for two years on charges of robbing a post office.Vicentini, a 31-year-old Brazilian clad in his national team\u2019s jersey, had just watched his team score two late goals in tense victory over Costa Rica on June 22 when Russian security officers pounced. They had crosschecked the Interpol wanted list with Fan ID information and arrested him as he left the stadium. He is awaiting extradition to Brazil.The Russian authorities said that they have conducted background checks on all recipients of Fan IDs, working with counterparts around the world in what they said was an effort to prevent terrorists or known hooligans from entering the country or any of the World Cup\u2019s stadiums.\u201cThe Fan ID is to provide full security, full comfort at the stadium for those who are there for football reasons, not any other reasons,\u201d said Alexey Sorokin, the chief executive of the local organizing committee.He said the Russian authorities were bound by what he called strict rules relating to the data that are embedded in the government\u2019s contracts with FIFA.Background checks and badges for fans coming to Russia are \u201cquite understandable,\u201d said Chris Eaton, who was responsible for FIFA\u2019s security plan at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. \u201cNo one denies the threat Russia faces from domestic or international terrorist groups.\u201dStill, privacy advocates have qualms about the harvesting of so much personal data.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a surveillance economy where you are offered something that sounds enticing, like going to a sporting event without hassle and some freebies, in exchange for valuable personal information,\u201d said Timothy Edgar, a cybersecurity expert who teaches at Brown University.\u201cRussia should destroy the information as soon as the tournament is over,\u201d Edgar added. \u201cOnce the need for the data has gone away, they should do that, because potentially it could be subject to leaking or loss.\u201dBut already the Fan ID has become essential equipment for fans. And the mere threat of the revocation of the privileges it confers \u2014 chiefly, the ability to attend matches \u2014 may be conditioning fan behavior.Mexico\u2019s soccer federation, under threat of fines or worse from FIFA over fans\u2019 use of a homophobic chant, issued a warning to \u201cavoid getting your Fan ID taken away from you\u201d in order to tamp down on the slur.After the warning, the chant stopped (Mexico was eliminated by Brazil on Monday).Sorokin said local law enforcement agencies have the final say in determining whether to revoke Fan IDs.But strolling along Teverskaya Street, one of the main thoroughfares leading to Red Square, any such concerns were the last thing on the mind of soccer fans like Pierre Louvat. A 71-year-old from Reunion, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, Louvat said he could not be happier with his Fan ID.Speaking over his son, who also couldn\u2019t contain his joy with his own World Cup credential, Louvat exclaimed, \u201cC\u2019est magnifique.\u201d\u201cYou can do everything with this,\u201d he said in French. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s going to be a souvenir of the World Cup.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Criminal Groups Seek to Decide Outcome in Many Mexican Races", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHILPANCINGO, Mexico \u2014 His election campaign for state Congress was only hours old when he started to receive the threats. Sometimes they came by text, other times in phone calls, with an unidentified voice on the other end of the line.The messages were always the same: Abandon the race or you will die.Abel Mont\u00fafar was defiant, his brother said, telling his tormentors, \u201cI am not afraid of you.\u201d But on May 8, nine days into the campaign in Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast state of Guerrero, his body was found slumped in his parked van. He had been shot six times.While Mr. Mont\u00fafar\u2019s killing remains unsolved, his relatives say they have no doubt who was responsible: criminals supporting a rival candidate.Mexicans vote Sunday for a new president and to fill more than 3,400 local, state and federal posts, making it the nation\u2019s largest general election ever. It is also perhaps the most violent electoral season in modern Mexican history.Mr. Mont\u00fafar was among at least 136 politicians and political operatives who have been assassinated in Mexico since last fall, according to Etellekt, a risk analysis firm in Mexico. More than a third were candidates or potential candidates \u2014 most of them running for local offices. Others included elected officials, political party members and campaign workers.In the long run-up to the vote, much of the national and international focus has been on the presidential contest. Yet for the millions of people living in the most violent parts of the country, elections for local office may have the biggest impact on their daily lives.\u201cNo one has been more active during these campaigns\u201d than these criminal groups, said Alejandro Mart\u00ednez, a top official for the center-right National Action Party in Guerrero, one of the poorest and most violent states in Mexico.Scores, if not hundreds, have abandoned their candidacies out of fear for their lives. Some parties have not been able to field nominees willing to contest certain posts.Some candidates have been forced to travel in armored cars flanked by bodyguards and to wear body armor in public. In parts of the most violent states, threats have made campaigning impossible.\u201cYou have to be a little crazy to run for office here,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez said.Collusion between politicians and criminal organizations in Mexico is not new. But over the past decade, criminals have increasingly sought to co-opt local politics by trying to influence the electoral process, using violence to effectively handpick slates of candidates.With cooperative officials in key local offices, criminal groups have been able to better protect and grow their illegal enterprises by exerting control over local police forces, securing lucrative government contracts and demanding hefty percentages of municipal budgets.This trend has been no more evident than in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s elections.In addition to the killings, more than 400 other cases of aggression against politicians and political operatives have been reported this season, including assassination attempts, threats, intimidation and kidnappings, according to Etellekt, which collated information from government, academic, civil-society and news media reports.Cases have been reported in at least 346 municipalities across the country.This shadow campaign by organized crime, almost entirely unfettered by the nation\u2019s weak and corrupt law enforcement and judicial systems, has come amid record violence in the country, which, in turn, has been a central theme in the presidential contest.\u201cIf the Mexican state is not able to guarantee that the will of the people is respected, then you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d said Antonio Orozco Guadarrama, secretary-general of the leftist Revolutionary Democratic Party in Guerrero. \u201cThis puts our entire democracy in great danger.\u201dThe problem has worsened amid seismic shifts in both the criminal economy and Mexican politics.The government has had a longstanding strategy of attacking organized crime groups by taking down kingpins. The approach was based on the belief that by cutting off the head of a criminal organization, the body would wither.But the tactic has, instead, served to fragment large, criminal enterprises into smaller groups that are more violent and more local. Before, the large groups were mostly focused on drug production and smuggling, but the smaller, more volatile groups have branched out into a wider array of crimes such as extortion, kidnapping, prostitution, illegal gambling and fuel theft.With their businesses focused on more local concerns, the newer criminal groups have an increasing need for collaboration with local officials.\u201cFor the older cartels that were mostly about smuggling drugs in the U.S., they couldn\u2019t care less who was the mayor as long as the mayor did not get involved or try to impede the business,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. \u201cBut in this new world of more local gangs, controlling local governments is a crucial asset.\u201dThe fracturing of the criminal landscape has come alongside the fracturing of Mexico\u2019s political landscape. For 71 years, until 2000, the nation\u2019s politics were a one-party monopoly.Both the party and organized crime were monolithic and rigidly hierarchical, and collusion between the two often occurred at the upper levels. But as the one-party, top-down political system fractured into a pluralistic system, with more competition within and between political parties, more power and influence flowed to the local level.\u201cFor so long, those local authorities were taking orders from above, so the interlocutors were at the federal level for criminals,\u201d said Steven Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, a foundation that studies organized crime in the Americas. \u201cBut when you started creating democratic systems with multiple powers, the real power gets transferred to local hands.\u201dSecuring leverage over the mechanisms of local governance and politics became crucial to the new, locally focused criminal groups, and they started to seek control over the electoral process.\u201cThe groups are not just looking to link up with candidates, but they\u2019re looking to nominate candidates,\u201d said Eduardo Guerrero Guti\u00e9rrez, a security analyst at Lantia Consultores in Mexico City.So, even as Mexican democracy on the national level has continued to evolve, room at the local level for free and open elections has seemed to shrink.Most of the violence this electoral season has been in rural municipalities where gaining control over politicians is easier.\u201cIt is absurd that in many of these small communities, we have to ask for permission to run campaigns,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Caba\u00f1as, a professor who is competing for a seat in Guerrero\u2019s state Congress.While much of the political violence has been concentrated in several states, no state has been untouched.On June 8, Fernando Pur\u00f3n, a candidate in the state of Coahuila for federal Congress, was shot to death after leaving a campaign debate in the city of Piedras Negras, on the border with the United States. He was posing for a selfie with a voter when the attacker approached and shot him in the head.Mr. Pur\u00f3n had been receiving death threats because he had campaigned on the promise of ending drug-related crime and was openly defiant of the state\u2019s dominant drug trafficking organization, according to local news media.On June 9, Rosely Danil\u00fa Maga\u00f1a Mart\u00ednez, a candidate running for the local council on Isla Mujeres, an island near Canc\u00fan popular with tourists, was shot by gunmen while holding a campaign meeting with her staff in an office. She died two days later.In the space of a week this past month, three mayoral candidates in small towns in the western state of Michoac\u00e1n were shot and killed, including Fernando \u00c1ngeles Ju\u00e1rez who was running for mayor in the town of Ocampo.State authorities arrested the entire police force in Ocampo in connection with Mr. \u00c1ngeles\u2019s killing.Guerrero has been among the hardest-hit regions. At least 14 candidates and prospective candidates have been assassinated since last fall, far more than in any other state, according to Etellekt.While some of the violence in the state is related to the control of drug distribution routes and the region\u2019s enormous opium poppy industry, the spread of small criminal groups and their incursion into local crimes has helped to spur electoral violence, local politicians say.H\u00e9ctor Astudillo, governor of Guerrero State, said the growing influence of criminal gangs in local politics has undermined his own capacity to govern.\u201cHalf of my time goes to figuring out how to confront them, how to stop them,\u201d he said in an interview in his office in Chilpancingo, the state capital. He said he was forced to \u201clean heavily\u201d on federal security forces to help \u2014 \u201cbecause the municipal police forces are of almost no help.\u201dIn Chilapa de \u00c1lvarez, a town set among rugged hills and agricultural fields, four politicians have been killed in recent months. Among the victims were two women, prospective mayoral candidates for different parties, who were killed days apart.Three other prospective candidates for state Congress stepped aside because of threats.Rival criminal organizations competing for influence over the mayoral race were widely believed to have been behind the killings, said Jorge Luis Rend\u00f3n, a candidate for federal Congress representing a district that includes Chilapa.The battle for political control in Chilapa and elsewhere in the state has become more vicious amid a plunge in the price of the opium poppy, which has forced gangs to diversify their criminal activities beyond drug trafficking, officials said.The criminals\u2019 campaign to co-opt local politics in and around Chilapa was at first a quiet, somewhat hidden phenomenon, Mr. Rend\u00f3n recalled. Now, however, it has become \u201cmore open, shameless,\u201d he said, with gang members even dictating how entire communities should vote.Gang members backing a specific candidate have imposed caps on how many votes opposing candidates are permitted to win, giving the appearance of democracy to the final tallies but safeguarding their candidate\u2019s victory.Erit Mont\u00fafar, the brother of Abel Mont\u00fafar, said he had urged the candidate to renounce his bid for state Congress in Guerrero before he was killed in May. Their family was deeply involved in politics in the region, known as Tierra Caliente.When the father of four started receiving threats, his relatives grew concerned.\u201cAt some point, I suggested for him to step down considering all the great risks,\u201d his brother said. \u201cBut he refused, arguing he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong and that he had the right to participate in the election.\u201d\u201cIt was a terrible tragedy,\u201d he said, \u201cnot only for our family but for all political parties.\u201dMr. Rend\u00f3n, the local candidate in Chilapa for federal Congress, said the decision to run in spite of threats can be a bold act of conviction \u2014 at the risk that it may be your last.\u201cYes, we are afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes it is the courage to do something for this country that moves you. Sometimes the heart moves you more than fear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s Archives, a Soccer History Cloaked in Contradictions", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Each dossier holds close to 300 sheets of paper, so thin they are almost transparent, some filled with precise, clipped handwriting, others with symmetrical rows of type. Some contain allegations and accusations, but most are transcripts of interrogations carried out at the height of Stalin\u2019s Great Terror by the feared agents of the secret police.For 75 years, the files have remained locked away in the archives of Russia\u2019s state security service: The country\u2019s laws dictate that only after that amount of time can classified documents be released. In the last few months, the first two of nine volumes related to this case have been declassified. The remaining seven are scheduled to be opened next year.Yet even when those thousands of sheets of paper have spilled their secrets, even when the allegations and accusations of the K.G.B.\u2019s network of agents and informers are known, the picture of the man at their center will not be complete.Nikolai Starostin is perhaps the most significant figure in Russian soccer history. He was a player, a manager, an executive, a pioneer and a promoter, a leading light in the game here for more than half a century.Most important, as a founder of Spartak Moscow, he represents a \u201ckind of Noah figure\u201d to the club, said Sergei Bondarenko, a researcher for Memorial, a civil rights organization focused on uncovering and understanding the hidden history of the Soviet Union. Bondarenko is the man responsible for persuading the F.S.B. \u2014 the K.G.B.\u2019s successor \u2014 to open Starostin\u2019s files.His face adorns the museum at Spartak\u2019s stadium in Moscow. There is a statue of him in a park not far from Luzhniki Stadium, where this year\u2019s World Cup final will be held. He is rippling with muscles, a towel draped around his neck, cast in bronze.And yet quite what that legacy is, exactly who this icon was, is not yet set in stone. On Saturday, Russia\u2019s current generation of players will face Croatia in Sochi knowing that a win would mean Stanislav Cherchesov and his team, against all odds, will be as few as 90 minutes from the World Cup final. They will have a chance to take their place in Russian soccer history. That is a history, though, that is still being written.It is the first time that a real player has featured so prominently on a World Cup poster, traditionally a much more figurative space. When Gurovich was commissioned to create the poster, in that distinctive post-Constructivist Soviet style, though, it was obvious that Yashin should be included. \u201cHe is a symbol for all Russian fans,\u201d Mutko said at the launch ceremony.Not just Russians, in fact: Yashin, widely regarded as the finest goalkeeper in soccer history, is the one Soviet player whose fame crossed through the Iron Curtain. He came to Western attentions at the 1958 World Cup, the first to be televised; his dark-blue outfit earning him the (technically incorrect) nickname the Black Spider. In 1963, he became the first, and so far only, goalkeeper to win the Ballon d\u2019Or, the European player of the year award.Yashin is a unique figure in other ways, too. He is, Bondarenko argues, the only Russian player whose legacy is uncontested and whose status has survived the transition from the Soviet Union into modern Russia entirely unscathed. \u201cWe have just the parade version of his history,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no one is interested in investigating his story in more depth.\u201dMost of the other potential members of Russia\u2019s soccer pantheon are far more enigmatic. This is a country with a long, rich history in the sport, but one whose iconography still remains somehow indistinct. In part, that is because Soviet reality itself was mutable, shifting. Those who were revered one day were regarded as undesirable the next.To some extent, though, it is a modern process, too. As researchers and historians have been able to uncover more about the lives the characters lived, they have shed more light on exactly who they were. In some cases, though, that has served only to showcase the differences between shades of gray.He spent five years in the gulags before being released in 1963. Two years later, he returned to his club, helping Torpedo win the Russian championship and, in 1967, he was voted Soviet player of the year.The stain of his rape conviction did not seem to affect his popularity. As the years have passed, it certainly has not diminished his status. That can be attributed, most likely, to the doubt \u2014 both contemporaneously and in hindsight \u2014 most had about the validity of Soviet justice.Either way, it is hard to tell if Streltsov was a hero or a villain, or both. The truth is what you want it to be. Though the circumstances are very different \u2014 and the process almost the polar opposite \u2014 Nikolai Starostin\u2019s place in history is just as elusive.Spartak Moscow, the team Starostin and his brothers founded, was not just the Soviet Union\u2019s most popular team, one capable of packing stadiums wherever it traveled. For many years, it was also \u2014 in the eyes of some of its fans, though by no means all \u2014 a social signifier.Under Communism, most teams were linked either to a governmental department or to a government-controlled industry. Dynamo Moscow was the sporting arm of the secret police, C.S.K.A. the team of the Red Army. Spartak was different: There was no affiliation to a powerful agent of the state.In the words of Robert Edelman, a pre-eminent historian of Soviet sport at the University of California, San Diego, choosing which team to support was a \u201cmatter of identity, and preferences had political meaning.\u201d It was one of the few areas of Soviet life where the individual had agency, uninstructed by the state.To choose Spartak, then, was seen as a safe act of defiance, perhaps even a quiet rebellion.\u201cGiving your heart to Spartak, you hung on to hope that this team was apart from all that surrounded it,\u201d as the historian Aksel Vartanyan put it. In the words of one Soviet scholar, Starostin and his family were cherished as a \u201csmall way of saying no\u201d to the regime.The remarkable story of the brothers\u2019 lives helped to burnish that image. They grew up in Presnia, a tough, cramped quarter of Moscow. They consorted with actors and musicians and artists in the chic nightclubs on Tverskaya, one of Moscow\u2019s main boulevards, in the 1920s and \u201930s; and their team, Spartak, defied the might of the secret police and, in particular, its fearsome head, Lavrenti Beria, to become the powerhouse of Soviet soccer, what Edelman dubbed the People\u2019s Team in the Workers\u2019 State.Then, in 1942, the Starostins \u2014 Nikolai and his brothers, Andrey, Aleksandr and Pyotr \u2014 were arrested, initially on a far-fetched charge of plotting to assassinate Stalin. They were eventually sentenced on lesser economic charges, to a decade each in the gulag. When they returned, after Stalin\u2019s death in 1953, they were restored to their positions of primacy, their legends not only intact, but enhanced.At first glance, the dossiers held in the F.S.B. archive confirm what Bondarenko refers to as the \u201cmyth of their lives, beautifully written by them.\u201d The two volumes that have been opened so far detail how the secret police had watched Nikolai Starostin since 1933, with the help of a co-opted Spartak teammate. The transcripts of the interrogations show how the invented charges of treason were transformed into quite different offenses: profiting from the black market, introducing bourgeois morals into Soviet sport, procuring so-called white tickets \u2014 exemptions from front-line army service once the U.S.S.R. had been drawn into World War II \u2014 and other luxuries for Spartak players.What Bondarenko has found, though, is that much of the Starostins\u2019 story is much more complex than a simplistic narrative of Nikolai and his brothers as mavericks defying the establishment.\u201cNikolai represents a lot of things,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the founder of our biggest club, a politician in his own strange way, a symbol for silent resistance and \u2018our man\u2019 for the intelligentsia. But at the same time, the Starostins\u2019 legacy is problematic.\u201dBondarenko agrees with Edelman\u2019s verdict that the brothers were \u201cvery Soviet,\u201d not so much rebelling against the regime as simply trying to operate within it.What he has found in the archives \u2014 though he is quick to point out that much of the \u201cevidence\u201d in the files is not beyond doubt \u2014 bears that out: allegations of using the \u201cblack economy, bribery, some unpleasant political things.\u201d The Starostins had friends in high places, too: not Beria, a devoted Dynamo supporter, or his secret police, but elsewhere in the Politburo, looking after their interests.In Bondarenko\u2019s mind, none of this diminishes the Starostin legacy. \u201cWe can see in their lives that you cannot be good, or even a saint, in the circumstances of Stalinism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were too scared then and did anything just to save their lives. Often, those things weren\u2019t pretty.\u201dHe does not feel it makes Nikolai Starostin or his family any less great, however. It does not diminish what they should mean to Spartak, to Russian soccer, to the country as a whole. It simply places them in their true context; it allows Russian soccer to understand its history a little better. From the dark silence of the archives, it casts light on the shades of gray.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When to Get Your Bone Density Tested", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthUpdated guidelines can help women decide when to have bone density screening but may discourage men.Newly updated guidelines can help women decide when to have their bone density tested to determine their risk of fracture and perhaps get treatment that can lessen it. But the new guidelines may further discourage already reluctant men from doing the same.But for men, the task force said \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures.\u201dWith age, virtually everyone loses bone density, a process that typically starts at age 30 and accelerates rapidly in women past menopause who do not take supplemental estrogen. In men, who enter adulthood with thicker, stronger bones, bone loss in midlife is more gradual but often becomes medically significant after age 70. \u201cOsteoporosis causes bones to weaken and potentially break, which can lead to chronic pain, disability, loss of independence and even death,\u201d the task force noted. Osteoporotic fractures are very common and extremely expensive. Nearly 44 million women and men 50 and older \u2014 more than half the people in that age bracket \u2014 have low bone density that increases their chances of breaking a bone from a minor accident, like tripping on the sidewalk or over the cat.Insurance coverage for bone density tests, both government and private, is typically based on the advice rendered by the Preventive Services Task Force, so it is helpful to know what the group recommends. But it can also help to know when it may be wise to circumvent these guidelines.Few question the value of bone density screening for women 65 and older, with timely repetitions of the exam determined by the initial results. The test is painless and noninvasive, and involves a level of radiation 50 times lower than that of a mammogram, Dr. Margaret L. Gourlay, research associate professor of family medicine at the University of North Carolina, told me. There is also solid evidence that treatment with a bone-preserving or bone-building drug is beneficial when a bone density test reveals a level of bone loss defined as osteoporosis in the spine or a hip. \u201cBone density testing also has a place for women younger than 65,\u201d Dr. Gourlay said. The question is, for which women and how often should it be done? The task force concluded that the need for an initial test is best determined by first examining a woman\u2019s risk factors, a process that Dr. Gourlay said could consume half the time of a typical doctor visit.  There are three such screening tools currently available.The most popular and most time-consuming risk assessment tool is called FRAX. It involves a list of about a dozen factors that can influence a person\u2019s risk of osteoporosis, and estimates the chances of a major osteoporotic fracture occurring in the next 10 years. The factors include age, sex, weight, height, previous fracture, parental fracture history, smoking, alcohol consumption and the use of steroids. If the FRAX assessment deems a woman\u2019s risk is 3 percent or higher for a hip fracture or 20 percent or higher for a fracture on the forearm, shoulder or spine, she is likely to be urged to get a bone density test if she is 40 or older. So, ladies, if you are past menopause and thin, consider getting your bone density checked. The lower your weight, the less benefit weight-bearing activities like walking will have on the strength of your bones. Also, women who lose weight by dieting lose bone along with fat and may consider getting checked for bone density, Dr. Gourlay suggested.Dr. Cauley said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the task force issued no recommendations for testing men. \u201cMen age 70 and older who have a high probability of an osteoporotic fracture based on any one of the assessment tools should get a bone density scan,\u201d she said. \u201cOne in five men will experience an osteoporotic fracture, and bone density screening is warranted if the risk is relatively high given that there is a good screening method and effective treatment for bone loss.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Should Just Give People Money", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lowrey is the author of a new book on\u00a0universal basic income.The Trump administration, Republicans in Congress and conservative governors across the country want the government to be simpler, smaller and more effective \u2014 unless, that is, the government is dealing with the poor.In a matter of months, hundreds of thousands of low-income residents of Arkansas, New Hampshire and Indiana will have to convince local bureaucrats that they have a job or are on a path to getting one in order to receive Medicaid coverage. In a matter of weeks, Congress is likely to expand work requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. And if the Trump administration has its way, housing authorities will make their subsidies contingent on work.The initiative is galling, given President Donald Trump\u2019s boasts about slashing regulations and simplifying government. It is striking given the ample evidence of the ineffectiveness of work requirements, the negative impact of poverty on generation after generation and the power of cash. And it gives urgency to the argument that future administrations should give more to and demand less of lower-income Americans \u2014 up to and including showering them with money, no strings attached.Just giving people money: It\u2019s a method backed by extensive research, and it has a bipartisan pedigree. But it is a method the Trump administration, which is likely to oversee a better economy than any administration in two decades, seems loathe to consider. Instead, the president is choosing to increase the ranks of the poor and to slash what support this country does offer those who need it.The White House\u2019s splashiest ideas to remake the safety net \u2014 through the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the conversion of SNAP benefits into a Blue Apron-style delivery box and the merger of federal aid programs into a kind of Department of Welfare \u2014 have gone nowhere, and are likely to remain there. Yet the administration has advocated or implemented a number of smaller changes that could push millions of lower-income Americans out of the safety net and into whatever lies beneath.The general gist is to make the safety net more complicated, and more tied to personal circumstances. Unlike most other high-income countries and contrary to popular belief, the United States has no welfare entitlement \u2014 people aren\u2019t getting cash free and easy just because they are poor. For decades, many recipients of benefits from SNAP and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program have been required to work in exchange for aid. Republicans now seek to apply such work requirements to millions of people in other programs.Indeed, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who recently took a tour of Puerto Rico, Alabama and West Virginia, among other places, has argued that the country is seeking to \u201cstigmatize\u201d those in need of help and undertaking a \u201csystematic assault\u201d on the safety net.More broadly, the government could use the tax code to eliminate poverty by providing a guaranteed minimum income to all households, via something called a \u201cnegative income tax,\u201d almost implemented during the Nixon administration.The most radical and potentially transformative idea would be to grant all Americans a monthly cash payment, a policy commonly known as a universal basic income. In the past few years \u2014 with the middle class being squeezed, trust in government eroding, technological change hastening, and the economy getting Uberized \u2014 the idea has vaulted to a surprising prominence, even moving from airy hypothetical to near-reality in some places. Mark Zuckerberg, Hillary Clinton, the Black Lives Matter movement, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are just a few of the policy proposal\u2019s flirts, converts and supporters.Under such a proposal, Uncle Sam would send every American $500 or $1,000 a month, likely eliminating other stingier and less-effective programs. The price would be significant, though financing it would not raise taxes higher than they are in similarly prosperous countries. The benefits would flow not only to the very poor but also to working Americans given leverage to demand better wages, to the unemployed, to students, to the elderly, to caregivers, to young parents. In a society as rich as ours, the argument goes, everyone deserves a guarantee of financial security, and we\u2019re better off trusting each citizen to make the best decision for herself.Perhaps the biggest and most important change would be to stop judging the poor for their poverty, and to seek to repair the pernicious trauma of having too little money by just giving people money \u2014 nothing more and nothing less.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will the Trump Tax Bill Drive Down Ticket Sales?", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTyler Graffeo, the president of Interstate Truck Center, generated a lot of business while entertaining clients in luxury suites at Royals baseball and Chiefs football games in Kansas City, Mo., the past three years.But on Jan. 1, something changed that helped push Graffeo to give up at least one of those suites. Built into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which went into effect this year, was a provision stripping out the 50 percent deduction for business entertainment expenses from the tax code.Until this year, the $200,000 spent on the seats in a suite at the Royals\u2019 Kauffman Stadium effectively cost the business $100,000, and a concern like Interstate Truck Center saw the expense as an investment in happy clients. The team, of course, funneled that money toward its profit margin, general expenses and player payroll.Now, corporate fans like Graffeo have to use a different calculus before making another significant commitment to season tickets. But the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Do those savings outweigh the increased expense of not being able to write off half the cost of buying tickets?How businesses answer that question is likely to determine whether sports teams will be among those that pay a price for the end of the deduction. If so, Major League Baseball, which has seen its teams\u2019 attendance drop by a little more than 5 percent from the same period last year, could be at the leading edge of it, since a full-season ticket package involves committing to 81 games.\u201cThis is going to have an impact,\u201d said Lance Christensen, a certified public accountant and tax practice leader at Margolin Winer & Evens in Garden City, N.Y.Christensen is alerting his clients to the increased real cost of tickets and said firms would use an array of factors to calculate the costs and benefits of the tickets and other entertainment options like theater and golf outings. Those include the reduction in the corporate tax rate, but also the state of the economy and the specific business, and the fate of the teams they pay to see.\u201cWhen things start turning with your particular industry or company, or the economy in general, one of the first things companies look at is these types of entertainment expenses,\u201d Christensen added.Graffeo, the truck center executive in Kansas City, said that even with the new law, his company would keep the suite at the football games because the Chiefs are good and his clients want to attend those games. The last-place Royals, not as much, so Graffeo plans to give up that suite.\u201cI would have renewed if they were a good team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to pay the extra money to take people to watch garbage.\u201dKansas City, which won the World Series in 2015, is one of the 21 M.L.B. teams (out of 30) with an attendance drop this year compared to the same period last year.The Royals are losing roughly seven of every 10 games this season. Team officials did not respond to requests for comment.Sports teams have reason to be concerned about changes that might affect corporate spending on entertainment. Business purchases make up a significant portion of season-ticket sales for most teams. For Major League Baseball, the average is about 30 percent corporate ownership of season tickets. That does not include the accounts of ticket brokers, who resell their tickets to corporate and noncorporate fans. The rates of corporate sales for baseball range from about 15 to 50 percent, according to a baseball executive who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to speak publicly about such matters.If businesses, including the smaller ones, begin recalculating the value of entertaining clients at games, it could conceivably drive down demand for tickets and luxury suites, revenue and perhaps even players\u2019 salaries.A full understanding of the effects of the tax overhaul remains elusive for now, and for the time being, there is no sense of urgency within baseball. The subject did come up at a recent meeting of ticket sales executives in San Diego, but not at the recent Major League Baseball owners\u2019 meetings, according to the baseball executive.He said the leagues were adopting a wait-and-see approach and noted that if specific teams were to lose ticket sales because they were bad, that was a part of a familiar sports business cycle, and not necessarily a function of the new law.In fact, Major League Baseball and the other leagues are more focused on the confusing \u201clike-kind exchanges\u201d portion of the same legislation, which seeks to place a taxable value on traded players\u2019 contracts and may result in teams having to pay a tax on certain trades.A better picture from the loss of the 50 percent entertainment deduction may not emerge until at least next spring, when businesses prepare their taxes. The full impact may not be felt for years, or until there is an economic downturn.Ryan Ellis, an enrolled agent and tax lobbyist in Arlington, Va., said it was still too early to determine how companies would react. He noted that the ultimate results of a new law were sometimes counterintuitive. The field of behavioral economics is founded on the idea that people make decisions based on calculations that often have nothing to do with market-driven logic.In the early 1980s, reduced write-offs for charitable contributions caused many charities to fret.\u201cBut donations actually doubled during that period because people made their contributions based on other factors,\u201d Ellis explained. \u201cIf you are a business that derives value from taking people to Yankee games, you probably will still take them to Yankee games.\u201dAccording to Todd Lindenbaum, founder and chief executive of SuiteHop, an online luxury suite marketplace, the loss of the tax deduction goes into a basket of factors that are changing the way people consume tickets. Ever since the advent of ticket brokers and secondary markets, individuals and companies have less incentive to commit to season tickets, instead opting for the \u00e0 la carte approach for specific games.\u201cIt\u2019s another thing that kind of pushes people in the direction of being more ad hoc and doing things on demand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis movement has been going on since people realized that they can buy tickets to any games they want to go to, that games are never really sold out.\u201dStill, sports must compete with other entertainment options, and some of those remain tax deductible. Christensen, the accountant, pointed out that companies could still use the deduction for business meetings at fancy restaurants.\u201cSo do I really need so many games?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd would one of my clients be just as happy to go farther back in the stands, and instead we use that money to go to a nicer restaurant?\u201dIn January, Charles Capetanakis, a lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron in New York, told Fortune magazine that the new law would probably compel smaller businesses like his to eliminate some entertainment spending. More than seven months later, he is starting to see the effect.\u201cMy firm is definitely cutting back,\u201d he said.Capetanakis owns season tickets to the Jets, which he will retain. That is not so much because of the business use, though. He is just an incurable Jets fan.\u201cConsidering the way the Jets play,\u201d he said, \u201ctaking someone to a game might actually cause me to lose a client.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bank Earnings Climb in Growing Economy, but Lending Doesn\u2019t Keep Pace", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a nagging question has been hanging over the industry: Would banks, taking their cue from rising economic optimism and a friendlier White House, significantly increase their lending to businesses and households?Overall, lending at the four banks grew only 2.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to an analysis by The New York Times. That represents a slowdown from the 3 percent rise in the first quarter. It is also well below the 4.6 percent increase in loans that the four banks achieved in all of 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration.A pickup in lending, which would help more people buy houses and enable businesses to expand, may yet occur.Looser regulations and the robust economy can take time to translate into more lending. Tax cuts have increased cash flows at companies, perhaps reducing the near-term demand for loans. Higher interest rates may also be deterring borrowers. And banks may be holding back because they don\u2019t want to extend loans that have a higher chance of defaulting.\u201cAs we sit here right now today, I would characterize demand as being solid, as being decent \u2014 it\u2019s not what it was two years ago,\u201d JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said on a conference call with journalists. She said growth in construction loans had slowed in part because businesses were using cash from their tax cuts to expand instead of taking out more loans.JPMorgan, the nation\u2019s largest bank, had the fastest loan growth among the four banks. JPMorgan\u2019s total loans grew by 4.4 percent. In the second quarter, JPMorgan\u2019s earnings per share soared 26 percent from a year earlier.Wall Street analysts expected Citigroup, the country\u2019s third-largest bank, to report slightly more revenue than it actually did for the quarter. The difference was less than $100 million, but the miss still sent Citi\u2019s shares lower on Friday. Citi\u2019s loans grew by 4 percent from a year earlier, well below the 7 percent rise in the first quarter of this year. After adjusting for changes in exchange rates, Citi\u2019s loans grew 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the bank noted in its earnings release. Loans to corporations grew by 8 percent in the second quarter.But last month, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, said the cap was not a significant factor. \u201cIt\u2019s not a constraint on organic loan growth,\u201d he said.Wells Fargo\u2019s loans to buyers of commercial properties, like office buildings and shopping malls, declined by $2.5 billion in the second quarter from earlier this year.The bank\u2019s chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, told analysts Friday that the bank didn\u2019t want to compete for such loans by relaxing its terms. \u201cWe are seeing a deterioration in underwriting standards,\u201d he said.The recent sluggishness in loan growth is not necessarily a bad thing. Some borrowers, especially large companies, have been able to borrow freely for years. And new regulations discouraged banks from making loans that borrowers will struggle to repay. That the economy is expanding without a huge surge in debt is probably one reason the current recovery has lasted so long.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of debt out there already,\u201d said Sheila Bair, a former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily bad that loan growth is slowing. What you don\u2019t want them to do is search for borrowers and do a lot of non-creditworthy loans.\u201dStill, some analysts said the banks could be doing more to stimulate the economy.Barry Ritholtz, the chairman and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said banks were still reacting to the trauma of the financial crisis, when too much risky lending led them to the brink of collapse. \u201cThis is a case of where the lawyers and the compliance people have utterly overreacted and have created a situation that is not good for the industry,\u201d Mr. Ritholtz said.Bank of the Ozarks on Wednesday reported that its loans grew 10 percent.An earlier version of this article misstated when Bank of the Ozarks reported its second quarter results.

{"Headline": "Tariffs Trim a Factory\u2019s Profit, but Loyalty to Trump Endures", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 You might think that managers and workers at Banner Metals would be up in arms over the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies. After all, tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have pushed raw-material prices up and margins down, forcing the company to delay plans to purchase a new $1 million cutting machine and hire two new employees to operate it.But the reaction at the plant is based on more than self-interest. \u201cI\u2019m not looking at what\u2019s best for Banner right now,\u201d said Bronson Jones, a part-owner of the company and its chief executive. \u201cI\u2019m looking at what\u2019s best for the national economy. The U.S. has been taken advantage of for too long.\u201dThat proposition, tracing a volatile political fault line, is frequently encountered on the factory floor here, a few miles from this prosperous city\u2019s gleaming downtown.Casey Jackson, a maintenance technician, said he would support the tariffs even if they cost him personally. \u201cIf it comes out of my paycheck, so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got to look at the big picture. That tiny bit of sacrifice we make will create jobs.\u201dWhile the manufacturing sector is on the upswing nationally \u2014 factories have added 344,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017 \u2014 there is an abiding sense of siege among factory workers and executives alike, of having been shortchanged in the trade equation.Mr. Trump, in departing from the traditional Republican embrace of free trade, struck a chord in 2016, carrying this battleground state by eight percentage points. And the workers on the factory floor underscore his reservoir of blue-collar support \u2014 even as he pursues a trade conflict in which key American industrial sectors could be hit. For them, there is still a larger wrong that must be righted.Divisions on the issue remain stark. In a poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times in early July, 76 percent of Republicans supported the metal tariffs, while 79 percent of Democrats opposed them. Nearly half of workers with a high school diploma or some college said they approved of the tariffs, compared with 39 percent of college-educated workers.As Mr. Jackson, a 34-year-old Air Force veteran, sees it, the current trade war recalls past military conflicts. \u201cWe had victory gardens in World War II,\u201d he said during a break between shifts, which run from 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and then from 4:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. \u201cI know the tariffs have an impact on us, but I don\u2019t think it was a mistake.\u201dBesides the 20 to 25 percent increase in raw material prices in recent months, Mr. Jones has found himself scrambling to line up shipments of the steel and aluminum that Banner\u2019s two-story-tall stamping machines turn into parts for aircraft brakes and seats. Bigger manufacturers have been hoarding metal supplies, he said, ordering larger amounts to get ahead of rising prices and leaving smaller firms like Banner at a disadvantage.\u201cWe were accustomed to four weeks\u2019 lead time, but now it can be as long as 16 to 20 weeks,\u201d he said. In response, Banner has been flying in steel from an Austrian supplier, an expensive proposition when the price of airfreight and the new tariffs are taken into account.With about 70 percent of Banner\u2019s business coming from the aerospace industry, Mr. Jones can\u2019t easily switch metal suppliers. Anything going into an airplane has to be carefully certified beforehand, restricting Banner\u2019s options when raw material is delayed.\u201cWith aerospace, you can\u2019t pick up and move it,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Mr. Jones had planned to buy a laser cutting apparatus that would be able to do some production currently outsourced, but pressure on profit margins forced him to postpone the order in May. He even visited the manufacturer while the machine was under construction and had a spot picked out for it at the plant.\u201cIt was like going to see your new car in the showroom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with steel prices up, we could see the writing on the wall.\u201dNevertheless, while Mr. Jones isn\u2019t always comfortable with what the president may say or put on Twitter, he likes the overall strategy.\u201cHe\u2019s going for the jugular, which is typical Trump style,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to it, and it\u2019s not a presidential style we are accustomed to. But he\u2019s the only president who\u2019s taken a significant stance on trade, and we need a brash approach.\u201dBut a vast majority of economists argue that over all, tariffs cost more jobs than they create. And there are many more metal consumers out there, like Banner, than metal producers like U.S. Steel.Despite the perception of an uneven playing field in trade, Banner has been thriving.Founded in 1921 as a tool-and-die producer, the company has added eight workers in the last couple of years, bringing its work force to 38. Demand from customers like Boeing, Airbus and United Technologies has been strong.\u201cWe do parts for everything that flies,\u201d said Rick Sayre, Banner\u2019s vice president for engineering. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good run.\u201dEven though manufacturing accounts for only 8.5 percent of the nation\u2019s work force, compared with 15 percent a quarter-century ago, it continues to offer opportunity at plants like Banner\u2019s.Machine operators earn $15 to $20 an hour, and experienced tool-and-die makers can earn twice that. There are also avenues for advancement \u2014 Mr. Jones himself started in the shipping department at Banner 24 years ago, earning $8 an hour as a quality-assurance inspector. He eventually rose into management and bought the company with two partners in 2013.\u201cWe believe in promoting from within, and we encourage people to go back to college,\u201d he said. In some cases, Banner will pay for additional training for employees.Even as the talk of a trade war has intensified, and new duties go into effect, Mr. Jones said he saw the Trump administration\u2019s moves as part of a negotiating strategy, not a fundamental move away from free trade, which he said he supported.\u201cI don\u2019t think hundreds of billions in tariffs are going into effect with other countries, but it sure gets their attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will all stick, and they\u2019ll meet in the middle. It\u2019s short-term pain for long-term gain.\u201dThe results of the survey for The Times echoed Mr. Jones\u2019s analysis. Among Americans who said they approved of the tariffs, a third said they thought Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to trade would be \u201chelpful in the long term but harmful in the short term.\u201dMr. Sayre concurred \u2014 with one caveat. \u201cI never cared much for the way Trump does it, but he\u2019s doing O.K. as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. What exactly doesn\u2019t he like? \u201cThe way he bullies everybody and bends the truth,\u201d Mr. Sayre said.Back on the factory floor, Mr. Jackson said he was comfortable with the president\u2019s game plan. \u201cIt\u2019s aggressive, it\u2019s tough, and he won\u2019t back down,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cUsing trade as a bargaining chip will help someone else put food on the table.\u201dJames Ford, another hourly employee, who is a production supervisor, jumped into the conversation. \u201cI like that Trump doesn\u2019t sugarcoat anything,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get offended very easily by somebody being direct.\u201dOther workers, like Todd Grizzle, a 25-year-old maintenance technician, said he could see both sides of the tariff debate. But his memories of the closing of Columbus Casting on the city\u2019s South Side are still fresh.Once the nation\u2019s largest foundry, the century-old complex employed 800 people when it filed for bankruptcy in 2016. \u201cThere was a flood of people looking for work,\u201d Mr. Grizzle said.The red-brick factory, which looked like something out of Dickens and covers 90 acres, is being demolished. The lesson that Mr. Grizzle said he had learned was that American jobs needed to be protected.\u201cI like the idea of the U.S. having allies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if this can bring more jobs back to America, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201dBen Casselman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe reason is President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. The law introduced a standard corporate rate of 21 percent, down from a high of 35 percent, and allowed companies to immediately deduct many new investments. As companies operate with lower taxes and a greater ability to reduce what they owe, the federal government is receiving far less than it would have before the overhaul.In the trough of the Great Recession in 2009, when companies were laying off hundreds of thousands of workers each month, corporate tax collections plunged by almost a third. It was the largest quarterly drop since the Commerce Department began compiling the data in the 1940s. No other period came close \u2014 until this year.From January to June this year, according to data from the Treasury Department, corporate tax payments fell by a third from the same period a year ago. The drop nearly reached a 75-year low as a share of the economy, according to federal data.\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t changed our tax system,\u201d said Kimberly A. Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who studies business taxation, \u201cyou would be expecting rising revenues.\u201dThe corporate tax payments have been tumbling as Congress careens toward a fiscal showdown in September that will take still more money to resolve.The current spending bill that Mr. Trump signed earlier this year expires at the end of September, the end of the current fiscal year. Congress is unlikely to pass another comprehensive spending bill before then. Instead, Republican leaders will have to press for a stopgap spending bill if they want to prevent a government shutdown a month before the midterm elections.As the tax bill was debated last year, the Trump administration argued that losses from the cuts would be offset by increased economic growth. Companies would use money that had previously gone to taxes, the argument went, to invest in their businesses and workers, giving the government a smaller slice \u2014 but out of a bigger pie.But the drop in tax payments has come as the American economy is already the healthiest it has been since the crisis, raising questions about whether the deficit could balloon further if growth begins to slow. The Commerce Department on Friday will announce its first estimate of gross domestic product in the second quarter, and forecasters anticipate it could reach 5 percent, the highest rate since 2014. Analysts, however, expect growth to slow in the second half of the year, as interest rates continue to rise and trade tensions weigh on the economy. \u201cIt is unwise to count on sustained revenues from growth that could easily prove to be a temporary sugar-high,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington, \u201cparticularly when it ignores the very real threat that the economy slows and we enter a downturn in a very vulnerable fiscal position.\u201dBut administration officials are dismissing such concerns, arguing that they still expect economic activity to remain strong.\u201cWe are very much looking forward to the second quarter G.D.P. numbers, which we anticipate will keep us on track to a four-quarter growth rate over 3 percent for the first time in 13 years,\u201d said Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThat\u2019s a growth rate nobody thought was possible and we are glad to see the naysayers will be proved wrong.\u201dMr. Hassett added that \u201cthe positive revenue feedback of higher growth is a longer-term effect, so it isn\u2019t surprising\u201d to see corporate tax receipts falling this year.White House officials say the new law, which changed how the United States taxes multinational companies that operate here, is spurring a wave of so-called repatriation \u2014 businesses returning money to the United States that they had booked on their balance sheets abroad in order to defer American taxes.In the first quarter of this year, according to Commerce Department data, multinationals repatriated $306 billion, in the form of dividends. That was $270 billion above the average quarterly amount over the last five years. White House officials say that\u2019s a sign that the tax law is working.It\u2019s not yet clear that repatriation is generating additional economic activity, though conservative economists say the dividend payments will lead to more investment over time, which should generate greater tax revenue in the longer run.Companies, however, can spread out the tax bill for repatriation over the next eight years, which is why those payouts are not lifting corporate tax payments in the near term. The law forces multinational companies to pay a one-time tax on cash and assets held abroad, but the Internal Revenue Service allows firms to pay that bill in annual installments, even if they choose to pay out the money in dividends right away.Administration officials have said that timing has contributed to corporate collections running 20 percent below initial forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office and 10 percent below predictions from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research initiative that forecast large deficits as a result of the tax law. Other factors could also be holding corporate tax receipts down. Some analysts believe the so-called expensing provisions of the new tax law, which allow companies to write off new investments immediately, may prove more popular than some forecasters anticipated. Companies, for example, could write off investments in software or machinery or new buildings.If that\u2019s true, \u201cit means the government will lose more revenue than we all originally thought, especially in the short run,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation in Washington, which forecast a large increase in economic growth from the tax cuts and the expensing provision. Such a scenario, Mr. Pomerleau said, would mean that growth should be even stronger than expected.Multinationals could also be shifting money \u2014 on paper, basically \u2014 into the United States solely to take advantage of the expensing provision and reduce their American tax bills.\u201cThis tax law is working, in the sense that now shareholders have access to their cash,\u201d Ms. Clausing said, \u201cbut whether that translates to investment is a much different question.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lawmakers, Lobbyists and the Administration Join Forces to Overhaul the Endangered Species Act", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Endangered Species Act, which for 45 years has safeguarded fragile wildlife while blocking ranching, logging and oil drilling on protected habitats, is coming under attack from lawmakers, the White House and industry on a scale not seen in decades, driven partly by fears that the Republicans will lose ground in November\u2019s midterm elections.In the past two weeks, more than two dozen pieces of legislation, policy initiatives and amendments designed to weaken the law have been either introduced or voted on in Congress or proposed by the Trump administration.The actions included a bill to strip protections from the gray wolf in Wyoming and along the western Great Lakes; a plan to keep the sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that inhabits millions of oil-rich acres in the West, from being listed as endangered for the next decade; and a measure to remove from the endangered list the American burying beetle, an orange-flecked insect that has long been the bane of oil companies that would like to drill on the land where it lives.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the best chance that we have had in 25 years to actually make any substantial changes,\u201d said Richard Pombo, a former congressman from California who more than a decade ago led an attempt to rethink the act and is now a lobbyist whose clients include mining and water management companies.He and others argue that the act has become skewed toward restricting economic development and Americans\u2019 livelihoods rather than protecting threatened animals.If the proposal is finalized, species that remain on the endangered list would still see their habitats protected, but it would become more difficult to list a new species for protection and easier to remove those now on the list.The myriad proposals reflect a wish list assembled over decades by oil and gas companies, libertarians and ranchers in Western states, who have long sought to overhaul the law, arguing that it represents a costly incursion of federal regulations on their land and livelihoods. Until now, those efforts have largely failed, even during periods when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress.Advocates of the environmental law agree that the proposals signal a critical moment. \u201cThe last few weeks have seen the most coordinated set of attacks on the Endangered Species Act I\u2019ve faced since I got to Washington,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. \u201cThis is a crucial test,\u201d he said.The Endangered Species Act was passed by Congress in 1973, and signed by President Richard Nixon at a time when using federal authority to protect threatened species was less controversial. The act has been credited with the resurgence of the American alligator, which had been hunted to near extinction for the use of its skin in purses and other goods; the gray whale, depleted by commercial fishing in parts of the Pacific Ocean; and the bald eagle, which is flourishing again after nearly disappearing from much of the United States.Take the case of the northern spotted owl, which has been a rallying cry for both sides of the debate since it was listed as threatened in 1990. The logging industry has long blamed the owl habitats for a crippling decline in timber harvests, sparking a vicious battle over restricting the economies and livelihoods of local communities.But while opponents of the law cite an economic burden, there has been little comprehensive analysis of the precise economic costs or benefits of either enforcing or revising it.\u201cTrying to put a number on the cost to industry is incredibly challenging,\u201d said Rebecca Epanchin-Niell, an expert on the economics of the Endangered Species Act at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. Ms. Epanchin-Niell and several other economists noted that given the economic and geographical diversity of the industries affected \u2014 oil companies, ranchers, farmers, landowners, real estate developers and others \u2014 it is difficult to put a clear price tag on the law\u2019s overall economic effects.As to the economic benefits of preserving an endangered species, Ms. Epanchin-Niell pointed to what advocates for the law might describe as a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to guard against extinction. \u201cEconomists don\u2019t have tools to put a price on these intangible values,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve seen an orchestrated effort by the president, the Republican leaders in the House, the industry and the Interior Department all working together in a concentrated effort to eviscerate the act,\u201d said Bruce Babbitt, who served as the interior secretary for eight years in the Clinton administration.Opponents of the act say the current mood is simply the fruition of decades of ignored attempts to enact reasonable modifications to the law \u2014 for instance, government compensation to offset losses when landowners are unable to use portions of their property deemed critical habitat.\u201cAnyone who tries to do even modest reform is completely demagogued,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade association for the oil and gas industry. Ms. Sgamma said environmental activists and others have also failed to understand how the law has been hurting farmers and ranchers as well as industry.Brad Goehring, a vineyard owner from California\u2019s Central Valley, said he is a prime example. Mr. Goehring said he can\u2019t farm on about a quarter of his property because it is considered critical habitat for a freshwater crustacean known as the fairy shrimp.\u201cThink of the ramifications where you owe the bank money, you have loans to pay off and you\u2019re told you can\u2019t use all your property,\u201d he said. Mr. Goehring ran for Congress as a Republican in 2010 in part on a platform of modifying the act.Last December, Mr. Bernhardt convened a meeting at the Interior Department between senior political appointees and career staffers, at which he laid out his plans to streamline the law. Over the course of the spring, that plan was translated into the policy proposal unveiled on Thursday.At the same time, on Capitol Hill, the Congressional Western Caucus, a group of House lawmakers, began coordinating a strategy. On July 12, the lawmakers unveiled a package of nine bills that, if enacted, would see more permanent changes to the law than those pushed by Mr. Bernhardt\u2019s proposal. Legislation that is passed by Congress and signed into law by the president is less easily undone than regulatory changes.While it is unclear if the lawmakers\u2019 individual bills could become law this year, they also worked to add amendments to two must-pass spending bills, including the National Defense Authorization Act, which specifies the annual budget for the Pentagon.In past years, such provisions would likely have died in the Senate, chiefly because they were opposed by Senator John McCain, the Republican of Arizona.But Mr. McCain today is recuperating from brain cancer and has not been active in Washington for several months. Shepherding the measure in his stead is Senator James Inhofe, the Republican of Oklahoma who has made a signature issue of advocacy on behalf of the oil industry and denying the established science of human-caused global warming.It is expected that Mr. Inhofe will champion a provision in the House defense bill that would remove endangered species protections for the American burying beetle. The insect has a protected habitat in just four states \u2014 but one of them is Mr. Inhofe\u2019s home state of Oklahoma.\u201cI think the Endangered Species Act is endangered,\u201d said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been able to do this for 20 years, but this looks like their one chance.\u201dRepublicans also added at least nine endangered species-related amendments to the spending bill that funds the Interior Department. Among other provisions, that bill would remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list. It would also prohibit the Interior Department from reintroducing the endangered grizzly bear into the North Cascades ecosystem of Washington State, something lawmakers from the region say could threaten the area\u2019s recreation livelihood.Senator John Barrasso, the Republican of Wyoming who chairs the Environment Committee, introduced a draft bill that overlaps with many of the House proposals.\u201cWe\u2019re all aware that the Endangered Species Act hasn\u2019t undergone any significant updates in over 40 years,\u201d said Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, in a statement. \u201cNow is the time to modernize this antiquated law to simultaneously benefit both endangered species and the American people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bush: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism.Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president\u2019s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida.In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. \u201cWhat part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?\u201d Kevin O\u2019Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers.Yet both Democrats are also skeptics of trade agreements such as Nafta, which served to mute their differences with the president. And their signature proposals \u2014 Medicare for all and free college tuition for most American families \u2014 would have been expensive and would require tax increases on families making more than $200,000. Mr. Trump and other Republicans charged they would \u201cbankrupt you and bankrupt the country.\u201dMeanwhile, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the last quarter, the third consecutive quarter in which growth has exceeded 3 percent. Unemployment remains low at 4.1 percent.With neither a recession nor a major war to run against, Democrats sought instead to cast the election in starkly moral terms. Yet by Election Day, the charge that Mr. Trump is morally or intellectually unfit for office had been made so often that it had lost most of its former edge among swing voters.\u201cI don\u2019t care if he lies or exaggerates in his tweets or breaks his vows to his wife, so long as he keeps his promises to me,\u201d Leah Rownan, a self-described social conservative from Henderson, Nev., told The Times, citing the economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominations as decisive for her vote. \u201cAnd he has.\u201dMany of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters also said they felt vindicated by the conclusions of Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. While the former F.B.I. director painted a damning portrait of a campaign that was riddled with Kremlin sympathizers and a candidate whose real-estate ventures were beholden to Russian investors, no clear evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump and Moscow ever emerged and the president was never indicted.\u201cIt was always a red herring, just like Trump said,\u201d said Bernard Schwartz, a gun store owner from Houston, Tex. \u201cDemocrats wasted a lot of ammo on that one.\u201dDemocrats also failed to capitalize on, and may have been damaged by, winning back control of the House of Representatives, but not the Senate, in the 2018 midterms. Mr. Trump proved effective, if characteristically vitriolic, in making a foil of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Efforts to impeach the president mainly served to energize his base. Polling surveys suggested that wavering voters saw a Democratic Party more invested in humiliating the president than in helping them.As is often the case in losing presidential campaigns, it did not take long for campaign aides to Senator Warren to offer damning appraisals of her performance as a candidate. Historical references abounded: The Children\u2019s Crusade; Pickett\u2019s Charge; the McGovern campaign of 1972. The common thread was that the campaign\u2019s moral fervor repeatedly got the better of its message focus.\u201cTrump succeeded,\u201d lamented one moderate former Democratic lawmaker who asked to speak on background. \u201cHe got my party to lose its marbles.\u201d The lawmaker cited calls by party activists to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 calls the Warren campaign did not formally endorse but did little to refute \u2014 as emblematic of the party\u2019s broader problems.\u201cWhat do Democrats stand for?\u201d he asked. \u201cLawlessness or liberality? Policymaking or virtue signaling? Gender-neutral pronouns and bathrooms or good jobs and higher wages?\u201d As is his way, Mr. Trump wasted little time rubbing salt into Democratic wounds. \u201cDemocrats used to stand with the Working Man,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cNow it\u2019s the party of Abortion and Amnesty.

{"Headline": "Visa Restrictions for Chinese Students Alarm Academia", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s confrontation with China is beginning to ripple through American academic and research institutions, as a crackdown on visas for certain Chinese citizens has left the higher education community wondering how it will adapt to the administration\u2019s effort to stop intellectual property theft and slow China\u2019s push for technological supremacy.Academics are already wrestling with the increased attention. At an aerospace conference in Georgia last month, Ella Atkins, a University of Michigan professor, recalled a colleague approaching her with a dilemma.The colleague, an assistant professor at another university, had recently led and submitted a research proposal for a federal grant. But he worried that because he was Chinese, the judges would be biased against his team.\u201cHe said, \u2018I need to figure out how to take myself off as the P.I., the principal investigator, if that\u2019s going to compromise our project\u2019s chances of being accepted,\u2019\u201d Ms. Atkins said, declining to name the academic for fear of jeopardizing his proposal. The professor, she added, was even considering withdrawing from the project completely to avoid holding back his co-researchers.It is a sentiment that some, such as Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California, believe underscores a tone of racism behind the policy change. The restrictions, she said, equate to targeting \u201can entire ethnic group of people for suspicion that they\u2019re spies for China.\u201d\u201cI think we should take specific security threats seriously, but each of those threats should be identified by the threat, not by racial groups,\u201d said Ms. Chu, the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.Le Fang, a Ph.D. student from China studying computer science at the University at Buffalo, locked up a five-year F-1 visa in 2015. But the new policy could hurt his friends whose visas recently expired, he said. They may have to fly back to China to get new visas, and they risk denials partway through their academic career.\u201cI quite understand the security concern of the possible restriction,\u201d Mr. Fang said, but \u201cmost of us never talk about politics and never work with mainland people.\u201dThe American intelligence community, however, has increasingly seen the country\u2019s academic institutions as vulnerable to espionage, in part because they provide a collaborative environment where cutting-edge research and technology are openly handled and developed.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Wray added, \u201cis view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end. And I think it\u2019s going to take a whole-of-society response by us.\u201dBut Chinese graduate students are largely seeking better opportunities for themselves, said Jenny Lee, a University of Arizona professor who studies international student mobility.Ms. Lee said the new restrictions could deter foreign students from enrolling in American universities. \u201cWhy would a student be willing to commit to a U.S. degree without a guarantee that they would have a steady visa?\u201d she said.The policy takes into account only the risks of foreign students studying in the United States, without acknowledging the \u201cincredible positive side,\u201d according to Stephen A. Orlins, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.One of those benefits, said Yolanda Gil, director of knowledge technologies at the University of Southern California\u2019s Information Sciences Institute, is the supply of talent and innovation that international students provide.It would be \u201ca great loss,\u201d she said, not to be able to interact with and learn from Chinese graduate students and visiting scholars at research conferences, where they regularly present projects and contribute to larger innovations in artificial intelligence.The American Council on Education has questioned how the policy will be carried out, said Terry Hartle, a senior vice president at the organization. Would someone taking a course in aviation, for example, be vetted the same way as someone majoring in the subject?\u201cWe called the Department of Homeland Security the day it was announced and said, \u2018Can we talk about this?\u2019 And they said, \u2018Sure, we can, but we\u2019re reading about it the same way you are, so we got to figure it out ourselves,\u2019\u201d he said.With the contours of the policy still unclear, educators and researchers are trying to assess how it will affect the way they work.Trevor Darrell, a director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research laboratory, said that the restrictions would be \u201ca significant and unfortunate inconvenience for many group members,\u201d but that they would not \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the lab\u2019s ability to do research.Others fear the policy could have a bigger impact.The American science, technology, engineering and math community, particularly at top-tier universities, heavily relies on foreign applicants to bolster its research, said Richard M. Voyles, director of the Purdue Robotics Accelerator.Finding qualified students to replace the Chinese researchers in his lab would prove particularly challenging, Mr. Voyles said. \u201cI have an extremely hard time getting even one American to apply to my lab,\u201d he said.But Yangyang Cheng, a Chinese particle physicist and postdoctoral research associate at Cornell University, suspects that more common than researchers being deterred from attending American universities will be researchers returning home soon after earning a degree \u2014 a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that only furthers China\u2019s technological and military ambitions.\u201cHome as in still China, because they would see that the U.S. would never see them as one of their own,\u201d Ms. Cheng said, \u201cthat they\u2019re spies, guilty until proven innocent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So Is Diabetes.", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN CRIST\u00d3BAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico \u2014 Maria del Carmen Abad\u00eda lives in one of Mexico\u2019s rainiest regions, but she has running water only once every two days. When it does trickle from her tap, the water is so heavily chlorinated, she said, it\u2019s undrinkable.Potable water is increasingly scarce in San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, a picturesque mountain town in the southeastern state of Chiapas where some neighborhoods have running water just a few times a week, and many households are forced to buy extra water from tanker trucks.So, many residents drink Coca-Cola, which is produced by a local bottling plant, can be easier to find than bottled water and is almost as cheap.In a country that is among the world\u2019s top consumers of sugary drinks, Chiapas is a champion: Residents of San Crist\u00f3bal and the lush highlands that envelop the city drink on average more than two liters, or more than half a gallon, of soda a day.The effect on public health has been devastating. The mortality rate from diabetes in Chiapas increased 30 percent between 2013 and 2016, and the disease is now the second-leading cause of death in the state after heart disease, claiming more than 3,000 lives every year.200 MilesMEXICOMexico CityGulf ofMexicoArea of detailMEXICOSan Juan ChamulaSan Crist\u00f3bal de las CasasChiapasGUATEMALAPacific OceanBy The New York Times\u201cSoft drinks have always been more available than water,\u201d said Ms. Abad\u00eda, 35, a security guard who, like her parents, has struggled with obesity and diabetes.Vicente Vaqueiros, 33, a doctor at the clinic in San Juan Chamula, a nearby farming town, said health care workers were struggling to deal with the surge in diabetes.\u201cWhen I was a kid and used to come here, Chamula was isolated and didn\u2019t have access to processed food,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you see the kids drinking Coke and not water. Right now, diabetes is hitting the adults, but it\u2019s going to be the kids next. It\u2019s going to overwhelm us.\u201dBuffeted by the dual crises of the diabetes epidemic and the chronic water shortage, residents of San Crist\u00f3bal have identified what they believe is the singular culprit: the hulking Coca-Cola factory on the edge of town.Public ire has been boiling over. In April 2017, masked protesters marched on the factory holding crosses that read \u201cCoca-Cola kills us\u201d and demanding that the government shut the plant down.\u201cWhen you see that institutions aren\u2019t providing something as basic as water and sanitation, but you have this company with secure access to one of the best water sources, of course it gives you a shock,\u201d said Fermin Reygadas, the director of C\u00e1ntaro Azul, an organization that provides clean water to rural communities.Coca-Cola executives and some outside experts say the company has been unfairly maligned for the water shortages. They blame rapid urbanization, poor planning and a lack of government investment that has allowed the city\u2019s infrastructure to crumble.Climate change, scientists say, has also played a role in the failure of artesian wells that sustained San Crist\u00f3bal for generations.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t rain like it used to,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Carmona, a biochemist at the local Ecosur scientific research center, which is affiliated with the Mexican government. \u201cAlmost every day, day and night, it used to rain.\u201dBut at a time of growing strife between Mexico and the United States, fed by President Trump\u2019s vow to build a border wall and his threats to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the increasing antipathy toward Coca-Cola has come to symbolize the frustrations that many Mexicans feel about their northern neighbor.The plant is owned by Femsa, a food and beverage behemoth that owns the rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola throughout Mexico and much of the rest of Latin America. Femsa is one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful companies; a former chief executive of Coca-Cola in Mexico, Vicente Fox, was the country\u2019s president from 2000 to 2006.Nafta has been beneficial for Femsa, which has received hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment.But in San Crist\u00f3bal, Nafta is widely viewed as an unwelcome interloper. On New Year\u2019s Day in 1994, the day the trade pact went into effect, rebels from the Zapatista Army of National Liberation swept into San Crist\u00f3bal, declared war against the Mexican state and burned government buildings.Although the two sides eventually signed a peace agreement, anti-globalization sentiment still simmers across the region, one of the poorest in Mexico.\u201cCoca-Cola is abusive, manipulative,\u201d said Martin L\u00f3pez L\u00f3pez, a local activist who has helped organize boycotts and protests against the soda company. \u201cThey take our pure water, they dye it and they trick you on TV saying that it\u2019s the spark of life. Then they take the money and go.\u201dFemsa executives say the plant has little impact on the city\u2019s water supply, noting that its wells are far deeper than the surface springs that supply local residents.\u201cWhen we hear, and when we read in the news, that we\u2019re finishing up the water, the truth is it really shocks us,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez, a company spokesman.The company is also an important economic force in San Crist\u00f3bal, employing about 400 people and contributing around $200 million to the state economy, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said.Critics, however, say the sweetheart deal between Femsa and the federal government doesn\u2019t serve the city well.Laura Mebert, a social scientist at Kettering University in Michigan who has studied the conflict, says Coca-Cola pays a disproportionately small amount for its water privileges \u2014 about 10 cents per 260 gallons.\u201cCoca-Cola pays this money to the federal government, not the local government,\u201d Ms. Mebert said, \u201cwhile the infrastructure that serves the residents of San Crist\u00f3bal is literally crumbling.\u201dAmong the issues facing the city is a lack of wastewater treatment, meaning that raw sewage flows directly into local waterways. Mr. Carmona, the biochemist, said San Crist\u00f3bal\u2019s rivers were rife with E. coli and other infectious pathogens.Last year, in an apparent effort to appease the community, Femsa began talks with local residents to build a water treatment plant that would provide clean drinking water to 500 families in the area.But rather than easing tensions, the plan led to more protests by locals and forced the company to halt construction of the facility.\u201cWe\u2019re not against the treatment plant,\u201d said Le\u00f3n \u00c1vila, a professor at the Intercultural University of Chiapas, who led the protests. \u201cWe just want the government to fulfill its obligation to provide potable water for its citizens. How are we supposed to allow Coke to wash its sins after years of taking the water from San Crist\u00f3bal?\u201dSince bottles of Coca-Cola arrived here a half-century ago, the beverage has been deeply intertwined with the local culture.In San Juan Chamula, bottled soda anchors religious ceremonies cherished by the city\u2019s indigenous Tzotzil population.Inside the town\u2019s whitewashed church, tourists step gingerly across carpets of fresh pine needles as copal incense and smoke from hundreds of candles fill the air.But the main draw here for tourists is to watch the faithful, who pray over bottles of Coke or Pepsi, and also over live chickens, some sacrificed on the spot.Many Tzotzil believe carbonated soda has the power to heal the sick. Mikaela Ruiz, 41, a local resident, recalls how soda helped cure her infant daughter, who was weak from vomiting and diarrhea. The ceremony was performed by her diabetic mother, a traditional healer who has performed the soda ceremonies for more than 40 years.But, for many in San Crist\u00f3bal, the ubiquity of cheap Coca-Cola \u2014 and the diabetes that stalks nearly every household \u2014 simply compounds their anger toward the soft drink company.Local health advocates say aggressive marketing campaigns by Coke and Pepsi that started in the 1960s helped embed sugary soft drinks into local religious practices, which blend Catholicism with Maya rituals. For decades, the companies produced billboards in local languages, often using models in traditional Tzotzil garb.Although Coke has since discontinued the ad campaigns, Mr. Mart\u00ednez, the Femsa spokesman, described them as \u201ca gesture of respect toward indigenous communities.\u201dHe also rejected criticisms that the company\u2019s beverages have had a negative impact on public health. Mexicans, he said, may have a genetic proclivity toward diabetes.While scientific research does suggest that Mexicans of indigenous ancestry have higher rates of diabetes, local advocates say this puts even greater responsibility on multinational companies that sell products high in sugar.\u201cIndigenous people ate very simple food,\u201d said Mr. L\u00f3pez, the activist, who spent years living with rural communities as a missionary. \u201cAnd when Coke arrived, their bodies weren\u2019t ready for it.\u201dMs. Abad\u00eda, the security guard, said she blamed herself for drinking so much soda. Still, with her mother\u2019s health deteriorating, and having watched her father die from complications from diabetes, she can\u2019t help but fear for her own well-being.\u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll end up blind or without a foot or a hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very scared.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Opens His Arms to Russia. His Administration Closes Its Fist.", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 It was a jarring moment, even for an American leader whose curious attraction to Russia has often resulted in mixed messages from the United States.The bold move, precisely the kind that Mr. Trump has long resisted, demonstrated how he is almost wholly untethered from his administration when it comes to dealing with Moscow. Whether it is Russia\u2019s interference in the election, its annexation of Crimea or its intervention in Syria, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements either undercut, or flatly contradict, those of his lieutenants.The disconnect is so profound that it often seems Mr. Trump is pursuing one Russia policy, set on ushering in a gauzy new era of cooperation with Mr. Putin, while the rest of his administration is pursuing another, set on countering a revanchist power that the White House has labeled one of the greatest threats to American security and prosperity.As Mr. Trump prepares to meet with Mr. Putin in Finland, diplomats and former government officials said these contradictions would undermine both the president\u2019s efforts to cultivate a relationship with Mr. Putin and his government\u2019s efforts to halt Russia\u2019s campaigns to damage American democratic institutions and bully its neighbors.\u201cThe president has hobbled his own executive branch, and the executive branch has hobbled its own president,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, a Russia expert who served as deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration and was president of the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-legged race with the contestants going in opposite directions.\u201dThis past week provided a spectacle of crossed signals on Russia. In Europe, Mr. Trump disparaged the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, while in Washington, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, somberly announced the latest round of indictments in the case.\u201cI call it the rigged witch hunt,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain looked on. \u201cI think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia.\u201dIn his hawkishness toward Moscow, Mr. Coats lines up with other members of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team, from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has publicly encouraged Mr. Trump to keep pressing Russia on election meddling, noting that in a preparatory meeting with him, Mr. Putin denied Russian state involvement, but not any Russian involvement at all.\u201cThe president will have to pursue that further, and I think that\u2019s one reason he and President Putin need to have this conversation,\u201d Mr. Bolton said two weeks ago.The document says Russia and China \u201care determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence.\u201dThe administration has deployed time-tested diplomatic weapons against Moscow. According to an internal government document, the United States has imposed sanctions on 213 Russian-related targets, including close associates of Mr. Putin, since January 2017, as punishment for Russia\u2019s cyberattacks and its predatory behavior in Ukraine.In some respects, it has gone further than the Obama administration. In December 2017, the White House approved the sale of lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military for its battle against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine \u2014 a step President Barack Obama resisted because he feared it would escalate the confrontation with Russia.Mr. Trump does not hesitate to take credit for the hard line toward Russia. But he does so in perfunctory language, rarely turning his fire on Mr. Putin himself and instead making unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, Mr. Obama.\u201cPresident Obama failed very badly with Crimea,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday when asked about Russia\u2019s annexation. \u201cThis was an Obama disaster. And I think if I were president then, he would not have taken over Crimea.\u201dMr. Trump has consistently played down Russia\u2019s role in the election, or his obligation to prevent such disruption from happening again. When his spokeswoman issued a statement about the indictment of the 12 Russians, it said nothing about the attack on American democracy, emphasizing instead that no one in his campaign had been accused of wrongdoing.The president typically adopts a tone of weary irritation when he is asked about questioning Mr. Putin on the topic, like a parent being asked by a child, for the 20th time, whether a long family drive is almost over.\u201cEvery time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin, after the two spoke in Vietnam last November. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.\u201dRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy behind the special counsel inquiry, said late Friday that political forces in the United States that are opposed to a rapprochement had timed the release of the new indictments to \u201cspoil the atmosphere\u201d before the Russian-American summit meeting.Some Obama administration officials agree that the geopolitical conditions should favor the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re holding the strongest hand we\u2019ve had with a Russian president in a long time,\u201d said Victoria Nuland, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.\u201cTrump should be demanding a rollback of bad Russian behavior,\u201d said Ms. Nuland, who is now the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security. \u201cInstead we\u2019re wondering what gifts he\u2019s going to give him.\u201dDiplomats argue that in the psychology of leader-to-leader relations, Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to criticize Mr. Putin \u2014 combined with his solicitous tone in seeking a relationship with him \u2014 outweighs the effect of sanctions or the expulsion of Russian diplomats.\u201cWhat matters is what he says,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a senior diplomat who served in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that President Trump is weakening the policy \u2014 when he essentially makes the Russian argument on Crimea, when he doesn\u2019t stand up for NATO or the European Union.\u201dWhen the two leaders sit down in Helsinki, Mr. Trump\u2019s abiding desire to win over Mr. Putin will loom as a powerful dynamic.Those who have studied Mr. Putin argue that he has gotten to know his American counterpart quite well from afar, a familiarity that will give him the upper hand at a summit meeting whose very existence is in many ways an achievement for the Russian president.\u201cPutin\u2019s going to be incredibly well briefed, have a great background and knowledge about Trump, and as a former intelligence agent, the idea of manipulating Donald Trump comes naturally to him, whereas Trump assumes that he can walk into a room with anybody cold,\u201d said Derek Shearer, a former United States ambassador to Finland who organized a 1997 summit meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s distaste for reading briefing memos and impatience with extensive preparation sessions with advisers, it is unclear how he might respond to Mr. Putin\u2019s attempts to win concessions.\u201cThere\u2019s something about Putin, with his macho image and the imperial trappings that he has built up in the 18 years since he came to power that appeals to Trump, and his own self-image,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, a former United States ambassador to Russia who helped prepare Mr. Clinton for his Helsinki summit meeting two decades ago.Mr. Putin, he added, \u201cis ready to lure him into many different traps.\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Helsinki, Finland.

{"Headline": "As Zimbabwe Prepares to Vote, Robert Mugabe Resurfaces With a Message", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEPWORTH, Zimbabwe \u2014 As he buttonholed voters less than two days before Zimbabwe\u2019s general election, the opposition candidate worked the crowd alone and on foot. He bounced from voter to voter, a wide smile across his face, ready with a handshake and a joke.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing my rallies, meeting the people, and there were no disturbances. Everything is going peacefully,\u201d said the candidate, Batandai Masunda, who was running for ward councilor with the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big improvement,\u201d he added.How big an improvement was the critical question as Zimbabweans prepared to vote on Monday, the first time without Mr. Mugabe atop the ZANU-PF ticket since independence in 1980.Many Zimbabweans say they expect cheating if the race for president is very close, or if no presidential candidate wins a simple majority and there is a runoff. ZANU-PF\u2019s candidate, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is widely believed to have orchestrated vote-rigging in the past and to have led campaigns of repression.After serving as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man for decades, Mr. Mnangagwa ousted him with the army\u2019s help in November.At a last-minute news conference at his home on Sunday, Mr. Mugabe, 94, said he \u201ccan\u2019t vote for those who have tormented me.\u201d He said he would cast his ballot for a presidential candidate other than Mr. Mnangagwa, indicating that he favored Nelson Chamisa, the presidential candidate of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance.It was not clear how the comments from Mr. Mugabe, who has not been politically active since his ouster and who is deeply unpopular, might affect the election\u2019s outcome.Opposition politicians, voters, rights groups and international election observers \u2014 allowed for the first time in decades to observe the polls \u2014 say that campaigning has been much freer than in the past.Opposition parties and election observers have raised questions about the integrity of the voter rolls. And it is far from clear how voting will take place on Election Day, especially in the governing party\u2019s rural strongholds, where widespread election fraud has ensured victory for Mr. Mugabe\u2019s party in past votes.But to revive the economy, it would help if Mr. Mnangagwa can carry out a fair election \u2014 one that will satisfy international observers and Western governments enough for Zimbabwe to qualify for loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international creditors.Epworth \u2014 a poor township on the eastern outskirts of Harare, the capital \u2014 had been one of the areas to avoid for the opposition. Residents in neighborhoods that supported the opposition suffered the consequences from the police and from youths supporting the governing party.\u201cIn the previous elections, we had to abandon our homes and go to the countryside after we were beaten up,\u201d said Loveness Shagunda, a supporter of the main opposition party. \u201cAfter we voted, our homes were burned down.\u201dMs. Shagunda said she was \u201chappy\u201d about the current peaceful campaign season. She and other residents in a commercial area of Epworth said that since Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fall, they felt free to express themselves. Now, posters of opposition candidates were displayed on walls and street corners, next to those of ZANU-PF.But Ms. Shagunda was nervous that in a possible runoff between Mr. Mnangagwa and Mr. Chamisa, the governing party would revert to its old habits.On Saturday morning, Ms. Shagunda sat on a bench outside a bar playing museve, Zimbabwean dance music. Young men went in and out with bottles of beer.On the main road snaking through the township, people sold clothes, vegetables, sugar-cane stalks, lumber, handmade furniture and other goods of the informal economy that has taken over Zimbabwe in the past decade.Even evidence of the tiny formal sector spoke of the nation\u2019s economic collapse. Inside a booth, Simbarashe Matsungo exchanged electronic money, called EcoCash, for American dollars or a parallel currency, the Zimbabwean bond note. Though all the currencies are officially worth the same amount, the manipulation of supply has fueled wild swings in the exchange rates that benefited the politically connected.But Mr. Matsungo was in a good mood. The opposition had just held a rally in the area without any incident. \u201cThere was no noise,\u201d he said.Mark Bondera, who was wearing a Green Bay Packers T-shirt, stopped by to chat with a shoe repairman plying his trade in front of the bar.Mr. Bondera, too, was enjoying the newfound political freedom. But at 64 he had been around long enough not to let his guard down. In the 2008 election, he noted, the opposition leader won more votes than Mr. Mugabe in the first round, but was forced to withdraw from the runoff because of violence from the governing party.\u201cThey can rig, I tell you,\u201d he said.Across a dirt road, at Cozycare Pharmacy, Brian Chikandiwa, 23, was excited about voting for the first time.\u201cIf it\u2019s free and fair, there will be change,\u201d said Mr. Chikandiwa, who had just completed his pharmaceutical studies.Because of Zimbabwe\u2019s history of election fraud, Mr. Chikandiwa and many other voters said that only an opposition victory would be proof of a legitimate ballot.That is why, observers say, Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s government should have redoubled efforts to persuade Zimbabweans of the fairness of the vote. Instead, there is a widespread assumption of cheating, which raises the risk of violence once results are announced.Election officials argued that they were not constitutionally required to show evidence of how the voter rolls were compiled.\u201cThings have been done that are maybe in compliance with the law but certainly aren\u2019t providing that great deal of confidence,\u201d said John Tomaszewski, an observer with the International Republican Institute.Jeffrey Moyo contributed reporting from Harare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen F. Austin Defended Slavery. Should the Texas Capital Be Renamed?", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong the larger-than-life people in Texas history, only one can claim the title \u201cFather of Texas\u201d: Stephen F. Austin, the Virginia-born businessman who reluctantly accepted his father\u2019s dying wishes to turn the Mexican-controlled territory into an American colony.While in Texas in the 1820s and 1830s, Austin kept peace with Mexico, recruited white Americans to settle there and helped secure independence for the Republic of Texas. But for his near-mythological status in the state\u2019s lore, Austin had a less exalted side: the defender of slavery who warned that freed slaves would become \u201cvagabonds, a nuisance and a menace.\u201dWhile the report recommended the renaming of streets like Confederate Drive and the removal of signs like a Jefferson Davis highway marker, the delicate issue of the man behind the city\u2019s name was punted for the City Council to decide. And more than likely, that means the Austin name will stay.\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who is seriously championing to change the name,\u201d said David Green, a spokesman for the city. \u201cThere are things in our past that we may want to acknowledge and look at, but that doesn\u2019t mean you want to rename a city, especially one named after someone who founded a republic that then became a state.\u201dSo far, no one in a leadership position in Austin has come out publicly to advocate a name change.On Monday and Tuesday, Austin\u2019s mayor and the city\u2019s 10 council members did not respond to questions about the report and whether they would support a new name for the capital. A spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who lives in the Texas Governor\u2019s Mansion in downtown Austin, also did not respond to a request for comment.But one high-ranking state official, George P. Bush, the nephew of the former president and Texas governor George W. Bush, made his thoughts known: absolutely not.Stephen F. Austin\u2019s name can be found across Texas. There is Stephen F. Austin University in East Texas. There is an Austin Elementary School in the Panhandle, one in the Rio Grande Valley and another in the Permian Basin. His name is about ubiquitous on public buildings and streets as other 19th-century pioneers who settled Texas and won its independence, including Sam Houston and James Bowie.Austin\u2019s role in shaping what became the State of Texas is often likened to that of President George Washington in the United States. It was a role Austin initially did not want.In the late 1810s, Austin\u2019s father, Moses Austin, had lost his fortune in the lead mining business in modern-day Missouri after the War of 1812 and a financial collapse in 1819. His father, who had resettled his family before in the pursuit of wealth, hatched another get-rich scheme: colonizing the fertile, untouched lands of Texas.But Moses Austin died before he could realize his colonization plans and asked his son to carry out his dream. Austin reluctantly agreed. He got approval to settle in the bottomlands of the Colorado River, forged diplomatic relations and peace with the Mexican government, and persuaded American planters to join him there.As the cotton industry boomed across the South, Austin realized that the next market could be in Texas. That meant one thing: slave labor.After the economy began to surge in Texas, Mexican officials worked to abolish slavery. Austin objected and won an exemption for the colony. When Mexico tried again, Austin secured a loophole for farmers in Texas, allowing them to free their slaves and then sign them to 99 years of indentured servitude.He successfully used diplomacy with Mexican officials, but he eventually turned on them after Mexico jailed him for a year in the early 1830s.Austin owned a few slaves but did not employ them like the farmers who settled in Texas, said Gregg Cantrell, a history professor at Texas Christian University who wrote the 1999 book \u201cStephen F. Austin: Empresario of Texas.\u201d\u201cHe worked tirelessly to make sure that slavery was able to survive in Texas,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said on Tuesday. \u201cHe held a very Jeffersonian view of slavery: He thought it was evil in the abstract but then he would turn around and say in the next breath that Texas must be a slave country.\u201dAustin and other Americans in the colony desperately wanted to become part of the United States. But the issue of slavery complicated that possibility after colonists won the Texas Revolution in 1836. Slavery was already a divisive issue in the United States and politicians worried about admitting another slaveholding state. (After a brief stint as its own country, Texas was annexed in 1845.)Perhaps more than in any other state, Texas\u2019 history is ingrained in its culture. Middle schoolers devote two semesters of seventh-grade history to learning about Austin, the Battle of the Alamo and other Texas pioneers. Austin\u2019s relationship with slavery is not widely known outside historian circles, Mr. Cantrell said, but it is not the reason he is revered in Texas.\u201cIf we are going to be removing Stephen F. Austin from the public square or the city\u2019s name, then we need to start with Washington, D.C., and Washington State and Madison, Wis., and Jackson, Miss. Those people were slaveholders too,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absurd proposition.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Other claims lacked context or foundation.While Mr. Trump\u2019s figure is accurate, his suggestion that the number would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d is not. In fact, the economy added more jobs in a comparable period before his election. Given that the nation\u2019s G.D.P. is just under $20 trillion a year, and that about 160 million people are in the labor force, those increases would require several years of economic growth to achieve.

{"Headline": "Long Dormant, Inflation Reawakens Investors\u2019 Fears", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the markets ignored inflation. Not anymore.Inflation may not be a major preoccupation \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but it\u2019s back as a real concern.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too long ago when all we were concerned about was deflation,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company. \u201cRight now, what we\u2019re seeing is a transition to a normalization of inflation.\u201dFor investors who\u2019ve been worrying more about deflation \u2014 falling prices \u2014 for the last decade, even \u201cnormal\u201d inflation may feel foreign, Mr. Smith said.Recently, inflation has definitely ticked upward. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent over 12 months through June, its biggest increase in six years. That\u2019s still below the long-term average of 3 percent. Yet a year ago, consumer prices were growing at a 1.6 percent annual rate. And 12 months before that, inflation was just 1 percent.The changes are striking even for producer prices, which reflect the wholesale cost of raw materials. The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent in June, the largest increase in more than six years.Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer for Westwood Holdings, said he wasn\u2019t necessarily worried about inflation growing out of control in the near term, because wages aren\u2019t soaring. In June, average hourly wages for all employees in private-sector nonfarm jobs rose to $26.98, a 2.7 percent increase over the last year.Still, he said it\u2019s more likely that inflation pressures will grow than shrink, \u201cespecially if you have things like tariffs come into the picture.\u201d A move away from free trade could reverse the disinflationary effects that globalization has had in recent decades, he said.So as inflation becomes part of the normal environment again, he said, \u201cinvestors should be normalizing their portfolios along with it.\u201dThat needn\u2019t entail big changes overnight.Areas that were traditionally sensitive to inflation haven\u2019t been affected much, at least not yet. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that specialize in precious metals lost 5.6 percent, on average, over the last year, according to Morningstar. And funds that specialize in real estate \u2014 which tend to rise when inflation does \u2014 returned a mere 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.But it may make sense for investors to assess their comfort with their overall mix of stocks and bonds.Mr. Smith of Haverford agreed. \u201cIf this is truly a normalization of inflation, then that would pressure fixed income more than equities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is that within whatever range for stocks that investors believe they can tolerate, they should have maximum exposure to equities.\u201dHe said investors ought to tilt their stock portfolios slightly toward economically sensitive areas of the market to ride the tailwind of economic growth that is propelling inflation. Those sectors include industrials and technology.\u201cAt the margins, we\u2019re putting a little more into playing offense, with names like Honeywell and FedEx,\u201d he said.Though Honeywell is a giant industrial conglomerate, it has been growing four times as fast as its peers in terms of earnings over the last five years, according to Zacks.com. That has been helped by Honeywell\u2019s push into industrial automation and internet connectivity.FedEx is another beneficiary of the accelerating economy in the short run as well as long-term growth \u2014 in this case, from e-commerce. But the express delivery giant could benefit from rising inflation for another reason.Historically, low inflation has usually coincided with higher valuations in the stock market, as price stability offers companies a greater margin of safety. Yet as inflation heats up, the price that investors are willing to pay for every $1 of corporate earnings has tended to fall.Since 1958, the average price/earnings ratio for stocks when the inflation rate has been 2 to 3 percent has been 17.6, according to an analysis by Charles Schwab. But once inflation is between 3 and 4 percent, P/E ratios have historically fallen nearly 10 percent.At FedEx\u2019s current price/earnings ratio of 14.3, the company\u2019s shares aren\u2019t just trading below the market average, they are at a 47 percent discount to the company\u2019s five-year average, according to Morningstar.Another strategy is to look for stocks that aren\u2019t just growing faster than inflation but that also have a track record of passing on that growth to shareholders in the form of dividends.\u201cWhat you want is to own companies that have the ability to grow their dividends in excess of the rate of inflation,\u201d Mr. Freeman of Westwood Holdings said. These so-called dividend growers can be found, he said, among companies whose profits are rising faster than the market as a whole.\u201cMicrosoft has been the poster child of that over the past decade, thanks to their steady, significant earnings growth,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. And over the last eight years, the stock\u2019s dividend payout has grown 15 percent annually.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, said investors shouldn\u2019t restrict themselves to giant companies. Mr. Paulsen said that historically, large stocks have actually thrived in periods when inflation has been slowing, not accelerating.Smaller companies, on the other hand, can often thrive in an inflationary time. \u201cSmall companies are run more lean and mean, with narrow margins,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. As a result, if their revenues were to increase because of a modest rise in prices, that would have a bigger impact on their profits than it would for much larger businesses.In the recently ended quarter, small stocks have outpaced larger ones by a wide margin. The Russell 2000 small-company index returned nearly 8 percent in the quarter, compared with 1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average, which contains big companies.The recent small-stock outperformance may derive from fears over the impact of a trade war with China on big, trade-oriented companies. Small stocks tend to be more resistant to tariffs because they are usually domestically oriented. But Mr. Paulsen said investors should not underestimate inflation\u2019s effect on this recent trend.\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the peak for small-stock outperformance was in 1983,\u201d he said, when inflation was finally being brought under control after a huge increase in the 1970s.More recently, Mr. Paulsen pointed out: \u201cThe best period for small stocks was in the early 2000s, when commodity prices were booming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Elections: What to Watch For", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The superlatives have abounded during the run-up to general elections in Mexico: The most important in years. The most potential voters. The largest ever.Voters began casting their ballots on Sunday, with about 89 million Mexicans eligible to vote for more than 3,400 local, state and federal posts around the country \u2014 the most races ever contested on a single Mexican Election Day.The crown jewel is the presidency \u2014 a six-year term leading Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy, in a country with 128 million people. The race, in part, is a referendum on President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s six years in power. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who heads the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party, called the PRI, cannot run again because presidents are barred from seeking a second term.The four contenders have all offered themselves as the solution to the country\u2019s myriad problems \u2014 rampant violence and corruption, a sluggish economy, and widespread poverty and inequality. But one of them, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, appears to have had the most success capitalizing on widespread discontent. A victory by him would stand as a repudiation of the nation\u2019s two dominant establishment parties, which have traded control of the presidency since the end of the PRI\u2019s one-party dominance in 2000.More than half of Mexicans still live below the poverty line, wages have stagnated for more than a decade, the yawning gap between the nation\u2019s rich and poor persists, and a majority of workers in Mexico are in informal labor sector jobs.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftist former mayor of Mexico City making his third bid for the presidency, has positioned himself as the consummate outsider. And for the first time in decades, a leftist could be taking the helm of the nation. He promises to attack corruption and poverty.On the campaign trail, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador knew he could fire up crowds by railing against what he called \u201cthe mafia of power.\u201d It was shorthand for the small, insular Mexican political and business class that has dominated the country for generations and, he said, used its position to enrich itself and its friends.He contends that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s efforts to modernize the country came at a price, and has vowed to reverse some of those achievements. He has openly questioned an energy reform passed early in Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s term and vowed to cancel an education reform, both of which passed with resounding majorities in Congress.But while Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has made the fight against corruption central to his campaign, so have the other candidates. There may be no other issue that unifies the electorate so completely.The ruling party has given the candidates plenty to rail against, including high-profile corruption scandals that took down several of the PRI\u2019s governors. There were also allegations that top officials embezzled public funds to pay for electoral campaigns. And Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity took a plunge when it was revealed that his wife had purchased a home from a government contractor on favorable terms.The presidential campaign unfolded against a backdrop of record violence, another major theme for the candidates. The month of May saw the highest number of homicides of any single month in two decades, and there were more homicides last year than in any other year during the same period, according to the authorities.The surging violence is blamed in part on the fracturing of large organized crime groups as a result of the government\u2019s longstanding strategy of targeting drug kingpins, a cornerstone of its offensive against the nation\u2019s main drug trafficking organizations.For two years, President Trump has taken an aggressive, hectoring approach toward Mexico. He has accused the neighboring country\u2019s government of weakness on illegal immigration and promised to build a wall on the border. He also threatened to toss out the North American Free Trade Agreement and has stripped much of the hard-fought good will from the bilateral relationship.But during the Mexican presidential campaign, talk of international relations, specifically with the neighbor to the north, was notably absent. Instead, the focus was largely on domestic issues. Amid such pressing problems, international relations seemed a remote concern to many voters.Still, the relationship between the two countries will remain central on the agenda of the incoming president. The two nations are deeply intertwined through trade, migration and culture. All the candidates, to varying degrees, have said they intend to work hard to maintain and improve the relationship, though each has sought to show that he could stand up to Mr. Trump\u2019s bullying.Some see a victory by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as offering perhaps the greatest threat of disruption to relations with the U.S. But the candidate has been fairly moderate and pragmatic on the subject of Mr. Trump lately, saying in a recent interview, \u201cWe are going to maintain a good relationship. Or rather, we will aim to have a good bilateral relationship because it is indispensable.\u201dIf the polls are accurate, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, 64, will win the day with a landslide. Representing a left-right alliance led by his relatively new Morena party, he has cast himself as the only candidate who can break the status quo and lead the nation out of its frustrating stasis.His strongest challenger is Ricardo Anaya, 39, whose quick ascent has inspired awe and hatred, particularly for the way he has deftly \u2014 many say ruthlessly \u2014 sidelined and disposed of his opponents along the way.Representing a left-right alliance led by his right-leaning National Action Party, he, too, has presented himself as a break from the status quo, though a better-prepared, more forward-looking and safer option than Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.Coming in third place in most polls is Jose Antonio Meade, 49, the candidate for the governing PRI who has held various cabinet posts in two administrations. He has sought to separate himself from the deeply unpopular administration of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, even though he was a member of it until he launched his candidacy. But his campaign has not been able to escape the taint of this longstanding association.Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n, an independent candidate who took a leave of absence as governor of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n to compete, has been bringing up the rear in the polls. He has barely registered on the electorate\u2019s consciousness except at moments where his famously unbridled tongue has grabbed attention. He proposed during one presidential debate that thieves should be punished by having their hands chopped off.In his first run for president in 2006, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador lost by less than 1 percent. But he did not go quietly.He claimed fraud and led his supporters in a monthslong protest, taking over Mexico City\u2019s main square, blocking one of the city\u2019s main boulevards and even staging an inauguration ceremony for himself.If Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador does not win, protests could erupt again, with his camp charging fraud.One wild card in the polling numbers are the undecided voters. At least one major poll put the number above 20 percent. If enough of them tilt toward one of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s competitors, Mexico could be in for a long postelection dispute.With so many elected posts in play, from the nation\u2019s highest office to the lowliest municipal council seat, the presidential candidates are urging their supporters to vote their party slates.In addition to the presidency, voters will be electing a new national Congress \u2014 128 senators and 500 deputies \u2014 eight governors and a head of government in Mexico City, as well as representatives to state congresses, mayors and municipal councils.Polls close on a rolling basis at 6 p.m. local time. A \u201crapid count\u201d result of the presidential vote, based on a sampling of polling stations around the country, will be released before midnight Eastern Time. Full counts for the presidential race and for other national, regional and local elections are not expected until midmorning on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unemployment Rate Rose for the Best Possible Reason", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore Americans were looking for work in June, even if they didn\u2019t immediately find it.The unemployment rate rose to 4 percent last month, from 3.8 percent, which in many contexts would be reason to worry about a softening economy. But the details of this particular jump in the jobless rate actually imply good things for the economy.The labor force rose by 601,000 people last month, driving the proportion of the civilian adult population that is either working or looking for work up by 0.2 percentage points, to 62.9 percent.The unemployment rate rose because not all of the people looking for work found it immediately. That suggested they were ready and willing to fill the jobs that employers have kept creating at a healthy rate \u2014 an additional 213,000 positions in June alone.The month-to-month swings in the size of the labor force can be large because of statistical error. So this may prove to be a random blip that is erased as more data become available.But taken at face value, it\u2019s a sign that the hot job market is succeeding at pulling people off the sidelines and into the work force. It\u2019s easy to imagine people who have become disengaged from the work force who, in this tightening job market, are more likely than they were a few years ago to see help wanted signs everywhere, or to have friends and acquaintances urge them to start working.It is the opposite of the trend from 2010 to 2012, when the unemployment rate was falling but simultaneously millions of Americans gave up even looking for work.That\u2019s good news because it implies that the United States economy isn\u2019t overheating, and that it may have yet more growth potential than has been obvious. In contrast with a few years ago, the economy is now close enough to full employment that the availability of workers is likely to be a binding constraint on how much more it can grow.There are, to be simplistic, only two ways the economy can keep growing. Either employers can squeeze higher productivity out of the existing labor force, getting greater output per hour of work. Or they can find a new supply of workers.When there is a shortage of workers and employers poach from one another, the economy tends to grow the first way, as employees shift toward higher-wage, higher-productivity companies.The new numbers, if sustained in the data in the months ahead, suggest improvement on the second front as well: the supply of workers.That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t risks ahead, of course. A rapidly escalating trade war could cost jobs in some key industries. There have been signs of a resurgence in work force participation in the past that have then reversed themselves, including as recently as this past winter.But with the economy in mostly sound shape, this question \u2014 of how many more people are out there who might wish to work if employers can induce them to \u2014 is one of the most crucial. And last month, at least, the numbers on this front were pointing in the right direction.Advertisement"}

(He stood the entire train ride despite all the empty seats, and excitedly gave a subway mariachi musician 10 bucks.) When he emerged from underground, he didn\u2019t have his bearings. He walked south. He pivoted. He walked north. He asked a security guard for directions. Then he found what he was looking for.As Instagram bait goes, it will be hard to beat the view from the roof bar \u2014 the entire East Side skyline of Manhattan. \u201cThe Graduate was just an idea, and now it\u2019s coming to life in New York City,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, adding, as he often does, a four-letter expletive. Then he spotted a hot dog truck, ambled over and ordered two, which he gulped down in one bun.Mr. Weprin is the founder and chief executive of AJ Capital Partners, the Chicago real estate company that is behind Graduate Hotels, a four-year-old chain of boutique hotels situated near college campuses and designed to cater to the nostalgia and local boosterism that are part of the culture of university towns. (Room keys are imprinted with the names of famous alumni, and public spaces are decorated with historical photos of campus life, vintage art and other collegiate artifacts.)\u201cThe cost of living is low, you have culture, you have commerce, and you have a youthful energy,\u201d said Mr. Weprin, who, with his confident manner and determinedly youthful look (that country singer cap seems to be a staple of his wardrobe) might well represent a new generation of hotel executive: the brotelier.He and his company are trying to create a brand that will find year-round business by catering to more than just alumni coming back for once-a-year football weekends or 10-year anniversaries of their graduating classes. Travel to college towns has increased in recent years thanks to more frequent visits by \u201chelicopter parents\u201d and the rise of the parent-child college tour. Mr. Weprin, who grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from the University of Tennessee, has even come up with a name for this growing niche: \u201cvisitcation.\u201dThere are 11 Graduate Hotels in locations like Ann Arbor, Mich.; Oxford, Miss.; Tempe, Ariz.; and Charlottesville, Va.; and nine more in construction or renovation phases, including in Nashville, New Haven and Palo Alto, Calif. In September, AJ Capital expects to close a $475 million fund-raising round, said Cooper Manning, a principal of AJ Capital and its head of investor relations. The company expects the portfolio to grow to 30 hotels or more. The company has $3 billion in assets.In 2014, Mr. Manning \u2014 whose brother Eli, the New York Giants quarterback, is one of Mr. Weprin\u2019s best friends \u2014 began to advise Mr. Weprin as he was developing the Graduate in Oxford, home of the University of Mississippi, the alma mater of the two Mannings and their father, Archie. The Manning family connected Mr. Weprin to locals and helped him get a feel for the Ole Miss vibe. Mr. Weprin named the roof bar the Coop.Mr. Weprin didn\u2019t start out to be a hotelier.\u201cLarry knew everyone,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. \u201cHe had a lot of influence and power, and a lot of swagger.\u201dAfter two years in Nashville, where he and a college friend started a business buying and renovating buildings, Mr. Weprin and his wife, Mary Ann, moved back to Chicago, and Mr. Weprin took a job overseeing Mr. Levy\u2019s real estate investments.Among the investments that were in his purview was Mr. Levy\u2019s interest in Auberge Resorts, which operated luxury hotels like the Esperanza Resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In the fall of 2008, as the economy was cratering, Mr. Levy told Mr. Weprin that he intended to sell his interest in Auberge. Mr. Weprin, a new father who was studying for an M.B.A. at Northwestern University, decided he wanted to buy it.Mr. Levy was encouraging, but reminded Mr. Weprin that he was going to have a hard time getting bank financing to buy a luxury hotel business when Wall Street was in a free fall. He gave him about 45 days to get the money.\u201cMy dermatologist from Dayton, Ohio, was probably our largest investor,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. (AJ Capital sold its interest in Auberge in 2016.)\u201cThat validated us because people thought we were nuts trying to be in luxury hotels at that time,\u201d Mr. Weprin said.The idea for the Graduate started a little closer to home. Mr. Weprin was walking in his Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park when he focused in on a shuttered, neglected Days Inn. The location had none of the traditional market drivers in its favor \u2014 it wasn\u2019t in the business or tourist district. But it was near Wrigley Field, DePaul University, and the homes of thousands of young professionals and families who might need a close-by place to put up visiting relatives, if not a cool local spot to grab a drink.The first branded Graduate Hotel, in Tempe near Arizona State University, opened in 2014. Next came Athens, Ga., and Madison, Wis.\u201cWe want people to wake up and have a sense of place, and it should be secondary that they\u2019re waking up at the Graduate Hotel,\u201d Mr. Alford said.These sort of details, and the overall business model, have impressed other successful hotel owners. Jonathan Tisch, the chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels, met Mr. Weprin about six years ago, when Mr. Weprin was attending a Giants game with Eli Manning\u2019s wife, Abby. (The Tisch family owns the Giants.)The men, along with their wives, have become friends. (Mr. Tisch\u2019s wife, Lizzie, persuaded Mr. Weprin to include her student ID photo on a key card for the Graduate in Ann Arbor, putting her in the company of Gilda Radner, Iggy Pop and Desmond Howard.) But the two have a professional connection as well.\u201cI have tremendous respect for him for finding a market that was not necessarily being filled and, having been in the business for 35 years myself and knowing the challenges, for having the ability to react to the white space and create a brand,\u201d Mr. Tisch said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "L\u00f3pez Obrador, an Atypical Leftist, Wins Mexico Presidency in Landslide", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Riding a wave of populist anger fueled by rampant corruption and violence, the leftist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was elected president of Mexico on Sunday, in a landslide victory that upended the nation\u2019s political establishment and handed him a sweeping mandate to reshape the country.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory puts a leftist leader at the helm of Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy for the first time in decades, a prospect that has filled millions of Mexicans with hope \u2014 and the nation\u2019s elites with trepidation.The outcome represents a clear rejection of the status quo in the nation, which for the last quarter century has been defined by a centrist vision and an embrace of globalization that many Mexicans feel has not served them.The core promises of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign \u2014 to end corruption, reduce violence and address Mexico\u2019s endemic poverty \u2014 were immensely popular with voters, but they come with questions he and his new government may struggle to answer.How will he pay for his ambitious slate of social programs without overspending and harming the economy? How will he rid the government of bad actors when some of those same people were a part of his campaign? Can he make a dent in the unyielding violence of the drug war, which left Mexico with more homicides last year than any time in the last two decades?And how will Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a firebrand with a tendency to dismiss his critics in the media and elsewhere, govern?In the end, the nation\u2019s desire for change outweighed any of the misgivings the candidate inspired.\u201cIt is time for a change, it\u2019s time to go with L\u00f3pez Obrador, and see what happens,\u201d said Juan de Dios Rodr\u00edguez, 70, a farmer in the state of Hidalgo, a longtime bastion of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has dominated politics in Mexico for nearly his entire life. \u201cThis will be my first time voting for a different party.\u201dIn his third bid for the presidency, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, 64, won in what authorities called the largest election in Mexican history, with some 3,400 federal, state and local races contested in all.He won by capturing more than half the vote, according to early returns, more than any candidate since the nation began its transition to democracy nearly 20 years ago. In a reflection of the lopsided vote, his main competitors conceded the race within 45 minutes of the polls\u2019 closing, another historical first.With his coalition partners, it is likely that he will hold a majority in Congress, potentially giving him more power to enact his policies.In his acceptance speech Sunday night in Mexico City, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador sought to unite an electorate polarized over his election, and promised to look out for all citizens \u2014 with the poor being first among them.\u201cI call on all Mexicans to reconciliation, and to put above their personal interests, however legitimate, the greater interest, the general interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state will cease to be a committee at the service of a minority and will represent all Mexicans, rich and poor, those who live in the country and in the city, migrants, believers and nonbelievers, to people of all philosophies and sexual preferences.\u201d\u201cThe recent elections in Latin America have exhibited the same demand for change,\u201d said Laura Chinchilla, the former president of Costa Rica. \u201cThe results are not endorsements of ideologies, but rather demands for change, a fatigue felt by people waiting for answers that simply have not arrived.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who vowed to cut his own salary and raise those of the lowest paid government workers, campaigned on a narrative of social change, including increased pensions for the elderly, educational grants for Mexico\u2019s youth and additional support for farmers.He said he would fund his programs with the money the nation saves by eliminating corruption, a figure he places at tens of billions of dollars a year, a windfall some experts doubt will materialize.Realistic or not, the allure of his message is steeped in the language of nostalgia for a better time \u2014 and in a sense of economic nationalism that some fear could reverse important gains of the last 25 years.In this way, and others, the parallels between Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and President Trump are hard to ignore. Both men are tempestuous leaders, who are loath to concede a political fight. Both men lash out at enemies, and view the media with suspicion.On Sunday night Mr. Trump posted a tweet congratulating Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.But Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is not the typical Latin American populist, nor does his branding as a leftist convey the complexity of his ethos.In building his third candidacy for the presidency, he cobbled together an odd group of allies, some with contradictory visions. There are leftists, unions, far-right conservatives and support from religious groups. How he will manage these competing interests remains to be seen.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will inherit an economy that has seen only modest growth over the last few decades, and one of his biggest challenges will be to convince foreign investors that Mexico will remain open for business.If he fails to convince the markets that he is committed to continuity, or makes abrupt changes to the current economic policy, the country could find itself struggling to achieve even the modest growth of prior administrations.There is some evidence that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador knows what is at stake. Though political rivals have painted him as a radical on par with Hugo Chavez, the former socialist leader of Venezuela, Mexico\u2019s president-elect has vowed not to raise the national debt and to maintain close relations with the United States.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who is commonly referred to by his initials, AMLO, has a history of working with the private sector, and has appointed a respected representative to handle negotiations the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cToday AMLO is a much more moderate, centrist politician who will govern the business community with the right hand, and the social sectors and programs with the left,\u201d said Antonio Sola, who created the effective fear campaign that branded Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as a danger to Mexico in the 2006 election he lost.\u201cThe great difference between then and now is that the dominant emotion among voters is fury,\u201d Mr. Sola said. \u201cAnd anger is much stronger than fear.\u201dOn the issue of violence, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has largely failed to articulate a policy that goes much beyond platitudes. At one point, he said that amnesty for low-level offenders could be an option, as a way to end the cycle of incarceration.When the suggestion summoned widespread criticism, he claimed the idea was merely an effort to think outside the box. But analysts say there is little that distinguishes his platform from those of other candidates, or even his predecessor, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.More likely, he will find himself in the unenviable position of managing the crisis, as opposed to ending it.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto came to office in 2012 with a promise to bring Mexico into the 21st century, forging consensus with opposition parties to pass a slate of much needed reforms that overhauled the calcified energy, education and telecommunications sectors.But to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has spent much of his political career concerned with the nation\u2019s have-nots, these reforms meant to modernize institutions trapped in the past were little more than assaults on the people.He has promised to review the contracts for oil exploration awarded to international firms, and to respect those that are clean \u2014 and take legal measures against those that are not.It is possible that the awarding of new contracts will cease, potentially placing Mexico\u2019s future oil exploration and production back into state hands. From there, it is unclear whether Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador would hand the rights back to the nation\u2019s state-run oil company, Pemex, which has suffered severe problems with corruption and inefficiency.For many, the future of the nation\u2019s oil industry exemplifies the central concern of a L\u00f3pez Obrador presidency: uncertainty.For all the talk of change, many worry his presidency will be a back-to-the-future sort of moment.\u201cWhat concerns me the most about the energy and education is the ambiguity of the alternative road ahead, if he decides to roll them back,\u201d said Jesus Silva Herzog, a political-science professor at the School of Government at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education.Some worry about how the president-elect will handle the opposition, as his fiery personality has both delighted and concerned voters.He has a history of ignoring his detractors, or taking them on in public ways. He refers to the nonprofit community in Mexico, which has been a force for change and democracy, as \u201cbourgeoisie.\u201dFor his opponents, this election cycle has brought the three main parties of Mexico to a crisis point. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party will be vastly reduced in size and power in the new Congress, while the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution may not even survive.Perhaps the only party with enough power to serve as a counterweight will be the National Action Party, despite having endured a bruising split in the campaign.On the issue of fighting graft, perhaps the signature element of his campaign, few believe that it will be easy to address the complex realities of systemic corruption.That could set up Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador to be a continuation of the disappointment that so many voters are reacting to.\u201cThe biggest problem I see are the expectations he has built,\u201d said Carlos Illades, a professor of social sciences at the Autonomous Metropolitan University and a historian of Mexico\u2019s left. \u201cThe problem is going to be what he is not able to do. There are people who are expecting a lot.\u201dElisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Weddings in Cyprus, Israelis and Lebanese Bridge a Divide", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarnaka DispatchLARNAKA, Cyprus \u2014 They eat falafel, live on the Mediterranean and worry that a new war could erupt across the hostile border that separates them. But many Israelis and Lebanese share something else: a desire to circumvent their respective religious authorities when getting married.In both Lebanon and Israel, only religious leaders can perform marriages, so lovers who wish to keep the rabbis, sheikhs, priests and pastors out of their love life have to tie the knot elsewhere.That has been a boon for this sun-drenched beach town on the southern coast of Cyprus, where the municipal authorities provide fast civil marriages to anyone who shows up, provides the right paperwork and pays the fee.And since most of those taking advantage of the local civil marriage industry are from Israel and Lebanon, the marriage bureau \u2014 in a modest, accidental way \u2014 bridges one of the Middle East\u2019s deep divides.On any given day, lovers from the enemy nations stand in line together, offer one another congratulations and sometimes socialize unwittingly in the municipal coffee shop while waiting for their appointments to wed.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d a Lebanese bride asked a wedding party at an adjacent table one morning.\u201cIsrael,\u201d a man in the party responded. The bride\u2019s eyes widened. She murmured that she was from Lebanon.\u201cAhlan wa sahlan,\u201d the Israeli man said, Arabic for \u201cwelcome.\u201d\u201cAre you getting married today?\u201d the Israeli bride asked.The Lebanese bride nodded.\u201cCongratulations, and good luck,\u201d the Israeli bride said.Later, the Lebanese couple asked that their names not be published for fear of legal trouble at home, where interactions with Israelis can be treated as a crime.\u201cThe media around you, they say it is forbidden to be in the same place, that they are the enemy,\u201d the Lebanese bride said. \u201cBut they are people, too.\u201dOfficials in Larnaka are aware of the tension between Israel and Lebanon, the result of numerous wars over the decades, but say it has never caused problems at the marriage bureau.\u201cIt is a neutral city here,\u201d said Georgios Lakkotrypis, a member of the Larnaka municipal council who is also a volunteer marriage officer. \u201cIs it the weather? Is it the sun? Maybe, but it makes everybody happy.\u201dCyprus owes its rise as an international marriage destination to geography, economics and law. Its airports receive direct flights from cities across Europe and the Middle East; its prices are good; and its laws permit foreigners to contract marriages with no clerics involved.And its palm-studded beaches, historic sites and abundant hotels are inducements for couples to start honeymooning as soon as the ink on their marriage contract is dry.About 7,000 marriages are conducted in Cyprus per year, adding 1 million euros, or over $1.1 million, to the economy annually, according to the Cyprus Tourist Organization. While European lovers prefer more picturesque towns elsewhere on the island, Israelis and Lebanese tend toward Larnaka, which can be reached by air from both Tel Aviv and Beirut in less than an hour.The trip is so easy that couples who are short on cash or time often arrive in the morning, get hitched and fly home in the evening, squeezing in a fancy lunch or a beach visit if they can.The bureau itself is in a historic building near the town center that has been converted into a museum and art gallery.Two hard-working women handle the business side, fielding emails from interested couples from a range of countries, vetting their paperwork and assigning appointments for ceremonies. Their office alone handled 1,110 marriages in 2017, said Paraskevi Anastasiou, a marriage officer. She expects the number to rise this year.Those wishing to marry must provide birth certificates, prove they are not married to anyone else and pay \u20ac281.90. For a bit more, they can get extra certificates or be married off-site, say, on the beach or at the town\u2019s medieval castle.The office does not marry first or second cousins, or lovers who are underage or visibly intoxicated. It is not authorized to perform same-sex marriages, although another office nearby does civil unions.Most Israelis marrying in Cyprus do so to avoid the country\u2019s Orthodox Jewish religious establishment, either because they don\u2019t want a religious ceremony or because they follow different faiths and do not want either partner to have to convert.\u201cSince he\u2019s Jewish and I\u2019m Catholic, we can\u2019t get married in Israel,\u201d said Marcia Teresa Bacus Garcia, a bride from the Philippines who was marrying her Jewish Israeli husband.Once their paperwork had been vetted, they entered the marriage hall, a high-ceilinged room with wood rafters, art on the walls and a few rows of red chairs for wedding parties.The couple had come alone, so they set up two cameras on tripods to document the occasion.\u201cWe call it self-paparazzi,\u201d said Marian Plotkin, the groom.Standing behind a wooden table and a silver vase holding fake white orchids, Michalakis Mallas, the marriage officer on duty that day, welcomed them, told a brief story from Cypriot history and asked them to face each other.Without mentioning God or religion, he told them to love and support each other, to raise good children and not to marry anyone else lest they be guilty of bigamy.

Valentine\u2019s Day was often a nightmare, and on Nov. 11, 2011 \u2014 or 11/11/11 \u2014 he performed 26 weddings because so many couples had wanted to get married that day, for numerological or other reasons. He had to intervene in an argument between two couples about who got the 11:00 slot, he said.But most ceremonies were fast, simple affairs, and he tried to make them meaningful even if they ran together in his mind.\u201cYou have seen \u2018Casablanca,\u2019 with Humphrey Bogart?\u201d he said, giving a hat tip to the famous movie misquotation \u201cPlay it again, Sam.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it is.\u201dMarriage in Lebanon is handled by clerics from the country\u2019s range of religious sects, leaving no domestic marriage option for couples from different faiths or who want to leave out religion all together.And some Lebanese couples prefer Cyprus because it is easier and cheaper than getting married at home, where some clerics require premarital classes and there is often social pressure to throw large, costly parties.Dany Naim and Sabine Kamel are both Maronite Christians and so could have gotten married at home, but decided that getting hitched in Cyprus would be easier.\u201cIt\u2019s a simple kind of marriage,\u201d Ms. Kamel said.For some couples, sharing the facility with couples from an enemy country they cannot visit adds to the day\u2019s novelty.During one Lebanese wedding, an Israeli group waited at the back of the hall, clapped when the couple was declared husband and wife, and exchanged congratulations with them as they left.\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to meet my neighbors and to get to know them, because I feel that I am part of the region and I don\u2019t want to be a stranger,\u201d the Israel groom, Avner Dvir, said after his own ceremony.\u201cWe are very close and we are hoping for peace, most of us,\u201d said his bride, Karem Magdasi.Advertisement"}

Why Is Transport Such a Nightmare?", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York City Council considers a package of bills to freeze the number of Uber-type cars on city streets. But that\u2019s at best a partial answer to a systemic crisis. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The legislation before the City Council aims to address the problems in the taxi and for-hire car business \u2014 the part of the transportation breakdown that the city can fix without the help of state lawmakers, who control the subway and bus system through the M.T.A. Two bills stand out: one to impose a yearlong limit on new for-hire cars, the category of vehicles that includes Uber, Lyft, Via and other app-based companies, and another to authorize the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission to establish a minimum wage for drivers who work for those businesses. In reality, this cap would do little on its own to reduce congestion or improve the lives of drivers. There are already so many for-hire vehicles in the city that merely reducing the number of new cars that come onto the roads temporarily would not change much. If anything, it could encourage some drivers to spend even more time in Manhattan where they are more likely to get fares and less time in mass transit-starved parts of the city. In addition, people who want to start driving for Uber and Lyft would find other ways to do so, like renting licensed cars from other drivers or fleet owners \u2014 a practice that is already common with yellow taxis. Uber cars that currently spend seven or eight hours on the road could be used twice as long if new licenses become hard to get. The city also ought to consider changes that would help yellow cabdrivers earn a living wage, too. The taxi commission, for example, can increase metered fares, which it last raised in 2012. By many measures \u2014 population growth, jobs, tourism, property values \u2014 New York is booming. Yet, it lacks an efficient and fair transportation system. City and state officials have for too long neglected that failure and blamed each other for not doing enough. They need to work together to set things right. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Real Wages Still Aren\u2019t Rising", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bernstein is an economist and a\u00a0former adviser\u00a0to Vice President Joe Biden.Economists ask this question every month when the government reports labor statistics. We repeatedly get solid job growth and lower unemployment, but not much to show for wages. Part of that has to do with inflation, productivity and remaining slack in the labor market.But stagnant wages for factory workers and non-managers in the service sector \u2014 together they represent 82 percent of the labor force \u2014 is mainly the outcome of a long power struggle that workers are losing. Even at a time of low unemployment, their bargaining power is feeble, the weakest I\u2019ve seen in decades. Hostile institutions \u2014 the Trump administration, the courts, the corporate sector \u2014 are limiting their avenues for demanding higher pay.While wages have failed to accelerate, consumer prices have climbed. In 2015, inflation was close to zero. When price growth is zero, a dollar extra in your paycheck means a dollar more real purchasing power. Real hourly pay grew at a healthy pace of about 2 percent that year.Barring an unforeseen shock to the system, I expect the jobless rate to continue to fall, probably to rates we haven\u2019t seen since the 1960s. The Federal Reserve forecasts unemployment of 3.5 percent by the end of this year.Unemployment at such a low level should force up wages, but it may not be enough to generate consistent, real gains.Even before the trade war, the Federal Reserve was well into its campaign to raise the benchmark interest rate it controls, and it has suggested it may raise rates a bit more quickly than previously planned. Higher rates are intended to cool down the hot labor market, and this too could dampen the pace of wage growth.G.D.P. has sped up and may clock in at around 4 percent in the second quarter of this year, but not enough of that growth is reaching workers. This is, of course, the defining characteristic of high inequality. Since the early 1980s, G.D.P. growth has failed to consistently increase working-class incomes.Slow productivity growth is another constraint on wages. When companies are able to produce more efficiently, they can absorb higher labor costs without sacrificing profit margins. But such gains have been elusive in this recovery, so businesses are increasing profits at labor\u2019s expense.More than ever, the dynamics of this old-fashioned power struggle between labor and capital strongly favor corporations, employers and those whose income derives from stock portfolios rather than paychecks.Even if workers\u2019 real wages do pick up, their gains may be too short-lived to make a lasting difference. The next recession is lurking out there, and when it hits, whatever gains American workers were able to wring out of the economic expansion will be lost to the long-term weakness of their bargaining clout. Workers\u2019 paychecks reflect workers\u2019 power, and they are both much too weak.Advertisement"}

But that could change if the outlook worsens.A report last month by Bank of America rated the odds of a prolonged trade war low, but estimated that one could knock 1.2 percentage points off economic growth over three years and add half a percentage point to the unemployment rate.It could also intensify the impact of any other \u201cconfidence shock,\u201d a large, unforeseen negative event that raises doubts about economic growth.\u201cA major global trade confrontation would likely push the U.S. and the rest of the world to the brink of recession,\u201d the report warned.An axiom of Wall Street is that markets hate uncertainty, but they seem to become desensitized to it. That may explain why harsh talk and higher tariffs have not shaken the stock market as much lately as they did earlier in the year.\u201cRising above the noise is what the market has decided to do,\u201d said Satyam Panday, chief United States economist for S&P Global. \u201cOn the trade channel, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. There really has to be a big global supply chain disruption for the market to believe it\u2019s going to be bad for corporate earnings.\u201dAs for tighter monetary policy \u2014 the other development that hit stocks several months ago and was on display in mid-June when the Fed raised rates again \u2014 investors may not like it, but they can\u2019t say there\u2019s much uncertainty about it.\u201cThe Fed has been pretty clear on policy,\u201d Mr. Panday said. It has signaled that it will raise interest rates \u201cat a slow and gradual pace, and the market has come to believe in it.\u201d\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he added, \u201cthe fundamental driver of the market is growth, the labor market, consumer spending, and that\u2019s been holding up rather well.\u201dMr. Sri-Kumar is not as optimistic. If the economy is humming along \u2014 as of July 11, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model was estimating a 3.9 percent annual growth rate for economic output in the second quarter \u2014 then why, he wonders, aren\u2019t wages picking up appreciably?As for the sharp rise in earnings, he attributed it mainly to the sudden impact of the tax cut last year and not to a significant improvement in business conditions. By early next year, after earnings fully reflect the lower tax rates, earnings growth may start to decline, he said.Investors may be pleased enough with the economy and earnings to excuse a harsh backdrop on trade and a miserly Fed, at least for now, but disquieting developments overseas have arisen or worsened lately.For example, Italian elections in March led to the formation of a populist government that some fear will try to make Italy great again by leaving the European Union. That could create a debt crisis dwarfing the one centered on Greece a few years ago.More important, a departure from the union by Italy so soon after Britain voted to leave could threaten the union\u2019s viability. Yields on some European bonds have been rising in an apparent response to these problems.In addition, rising yields on Treasury bonds and a sharp rise in the dollar during the last few months are straining finances in emerging economies, many of which use dollar-denominated debt to stimulate economic growth.A rising dollar increases the value of dollar debt in local currencies, making repayment more difficult and depressing currencies further in a vicious cycle.Borrowers in the developing world are having an especially hard time acquiring dollars because so many are being used to buy the additional Treasury instruments coming on the market. The Fed is selling them to unwind years of purchases in its quantitative easing program, and the Treasury is raising money to cover the shortfall in revenues arising from the December tax bill.\u201cResources are being taken away for second- and third-tier borrowers,\u201d said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW. \u201cCentral banks have been running a buffet, putting out more food for years\u201d through quantitative easing.\u201cIn an era of quantitative tightening, they\u2019re taking away plates,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople recognize some of these folks are not going to be able to get a full meal out of what\u2019s left.\u201dJust who will suffer and how much remain to be seen.\u201cThere\u2019s greater awareness\u201d of the dilemma, Mr. Rivelle said. \u201cAre Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa isolated events, or are they systemic? The emerging perception is there\u2019s something systemic.\u201dInvesting in emerging markets in the second quarter was painful for bond and stock investors alike.Emerging market bond funds were down 4.8 percent, according to Morningstar, with ones that focus on debt denominated in local currencies falling 11.3 percent. Emerging market stock funds lost 8.9 percent.While it may be scant consolation, at least that was better return than the 10.3 percent drop of iShares MSCI Emerging Markets, a popular exchange-traded fund that specializes in the niche.Bond funds of all kinds lost 0.4 percent over all. Specialists in long-term government issues were up 0.4 percent, and high-yield funds rose 0.6 percent.Ten-year Treasury yields started the quarter at 2.74 percent, breached 3 percent for the first time since 2013, then fell back to 2.84 percent. The late decline provides another hint that economic growth may be more subdued.High-yield funds benefited from persistently tight yield spreads over Treasury debt, a condition that worries Mr. Rivelle.Spreads \u201care within spitting distance of where they were in 2006 and 2007,\u201d just before the financial crisis, he said. \u201cThe superficial explanation is default rates are quite low, but the skeptical investor is supposed to recognize a few things.\u201d They include loan terms that have become exceedingly lax and high indebtedness generally among corporate borrowers, Mr. Rivelle added.\u201cThe high-yield market is uniquely vulnerable to any economic disruption or something happening in emerging markets or Europe,\u201d he said.Despite the risks in many foreign markets, some investment advisers find more opportunities in them than in American stocks because there\u2019s more room for improvement.They carry lower valuations, and \u201ccyclically the U.S. is probably further along,\u201d said Martin Schulz, manager of the PNC International Equity fund. He meant that economic expansion and loose monetary policy may have longer to run overseas.Mr. Schulz acknowledged the political risk in countries like Italy but identified other places with healthier balances of risk and reward. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for good valuations, but also for markets that don\u2019t have the inherent risks we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d he said. In particular, he favors investments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Thailand and Singapore.Mr. Sri-Kumar also prefers foreign stock markets, but wherever you invest now, \u201cyou need to be more defensive in your approach,\u201d he said. \u201cTake money off from risk assets.\u201d He would emphasize stocks with high dividend yields, such as utilities, and the highest-quality bonds, such as Treasuries and bunds, their German equivalents.Mr. Rivelle recommends the same cautious posture as the end of the economic expansion draws closer.\u201cBe defensive, don\u2019t reach for yield, take a safe yield where you can get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more bad news to come, so a defensive mind-set is appropriate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Learning the Right Lessons From the Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWhat caused the financial crisis of 2008? Are policymakers ready to handle the next one?These are key questions for anyone interested in economic history and policy. In the past decade, a conventional wisdom has developed about the answers.Yet a new book questions that orthodoxy, offering a more disturbing perspective on the past and a less sanguine prognosis for the future.In a nutshell, the conventional wisdom goes like this:In the mid-2000s, the nation experienced a housing bubble. A combination of stupidity, negligence and malfeasance led a bunch of Wall Street firms to make excessively risky bets that the bubble would go on forever. Through mortgage-backed securities and related instruments, they extended credit to home buyers of dubious credit quality.For a while, this credit expansion fueled the bubble. But when the bubble burst, these new homeowners defaulted in record numbers, and the Wall Street firms headed toward insolvency. The whole financial system teetered on the edge of collapse, leading to a deep recession.Fortunately, policymakers came to the rescue. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the secretary of the Treasury, persuaded Congress to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which he and his successor, Timothy F. Geithner, used to recapitalize the banks. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, expanded the tools of monetary policy to support the financial system and the economy more broadly. Their bold steps saved us from another Great Depression.Central banks like the Fed have two tasks. The first is to adjust the money supply and interest rates as economic conditions change. The second is to help ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. As part of this second task, central banks sometimes need to act as a lender of last resort.A central bank can solve this liquidity problem by lending to a financial institution experiencing a run. That is why the Federal Reserve Act calls for an \u201celastic currency.\u201d The central bank should be there so George Bailey does not need to rely on the despicable banker Henry F. Potter \u2014 or even his own generous friends \u2014 for the temporary cash injection needed to keep the building and loan afloat.Here, according to Mr. Ball, is where policymakers failed us in 2008. When mortgage defaults started rising, many financial institutions experienced a run on their short-term liabilities. These liabilities were not traditional bank deposits but rather repurchase agreements, called repos. But the forces at work were much the same.In September 2008, the financial giant Lehman Brothers found itself facing a liquidity crisis. Yet the Fed, rather than acting as a lender of last resort, pushed Lehman into bankruptcy. In the weeks and months that followed, all hell broke loose.Mr. Ball argues that a careful look at Lehman\u2019s finances shows that it did have enough collateral. In addition, he examines the historical record and finds no evidence that Fed officials at the time were concerned about the insufficiency of collateral.The claim of inadequate collateral arose weeks later when the full impact of the Lehman bankruptcy became clear. It was, Mr. Ball suggests, an attempt to cover up a policy blunder.One fascinating element of the story is the dynamic between Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke. The decision whether to lend to Lehman was legally up to the Fed. But it seems that Mr. Paulson was calling the shots.He took a hard line because, after the rescue of Bear Stearns earlier in the year, he wanted to avoid the political fallout from being labeled \u201cMr. Bailout.\u201d Mr. Bernanke deferred to the Treasury secretary, partly because of the mistaken judgment that the markets would take the Lehman bankruptcy in stride.Looking ahead, Mr. Ball is worried about the next financial crisis. One reason is that the Dodd-Frank Act has increased restrictions on Fed lending, making it harder for the Fed to act as lender of last resort.Another is that we have not learned the right lessons from history. Mr. Ball wants to make sure that the next time a major financial institution faces a shortfall of liquidity, the Fed really will have the courage to act.N. Gregory Mankiw is the Robert M. Beren professor of economics at Harvard University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Republicans, \u2018The Dam Has Broken.\u2019 But for How Long?", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 After 17 months, three weeks and six days of Donald J. Trump\u2019s tumultuous presidency, some of his fellow Republicans had finally had enough. \u201cThe dam has broken,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, a Republican critic from Tennessee, said on Tuesday.In a presidency without precedent, mark another moment for the history books. While the accusation of treason has been thrown around on the edges of the political debate from time to time, never in the modern era has it become part of the national conversation in such a prominent way.To the president\u2019s defenders, this all sounds like another eruption of what they often call Trump Derangement Syndrome. That he drives his critics to such extremes, they argue, says more about them than it does about Mr. Trump. As the president backtracked on his deferential comments at Monday\u2019s meeting with Mr. Putin and asserted that he really does accept that Russia intervened in the 2016 election, allies assumed that this, too, would blow over.Even some of the normally friendly folks at Fox News expressed astonishment, including Neil Cavuto and Abby Huntsman, whose father, Jon Huntsman, is Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to Moscow.While Republican leaders like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin trod more carefully on Tuesday, focusing their fire on Russia rather than the president, they were seeking ways to demonstrate their distance, perhaps with new sanctions on Moscow or hearings to grill members of the Trump administration.And Republicans were eager to latch onto Mr. Trump\u2019s retreat to avoid a confrontation. \u201cI wish he had said it in front of President Putin and the world yesterday, but yeah, I take him at his word if he said he misspoke, absolutely,\u201d Senator Rob Portman of Ohio said on Fox News.That Russia would become the third rail for the party of Ronald Reagan is a sign of just how far politics have shifted under Mr. Trump. Republicans once denounced President Barack Obama for suggesting that he would have more \u201cflexibility\u201d to work with Mr. Putin after his re-election; now Mr. Trump treats Mr. Putin as a trusted friend.Reports of the president\u2019s comments prompted outcry from some lawmakers, but they were followed by notable silence from others.It later said that searches for \u201ctreason\u201d had increased by 2,943 percent. By Tuesday afternoon, the word \u201ctraitor\u201d had been used on Twitter 800,000 times and the word \u201ctreason\u201d about 1.2 million times.Mr. Dobbs said Mr. Trump had made great progress in foreign policy by crippling the Islamic State and holding unfair trading partners to account. \u201cI mean, these are fools who are prattling off their complaints today about the way he conducted himself in a joint news conference with the president of Russia,\u201d Mr. Dobbs said. \u201cIt\u2019s idiotic.\u201dRepresentative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, seconded him. \u201cI would completely agree with that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all ought to start rowing in the same direction. Let\u2019s get everybody to work. Let\u2019s do the great things that the president has fought for the American economy so that we can beat our competitors on the battlefield rather than in sniping at each other through the media.\u201dTreason is listed by the Constitution as one of the specific justifications for impeachment along with bribery and other undefined \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d as the framers put it. \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort,\u201d the Constitution says.No sitting president has ever been formally charged with treason, nor for that matter have many other Americans since the days of Aaron Burr or the political leaders who defected to the Confederacy during the Civil War. The closest was former President John Tyler, who sided with the South against the Union and was elected to the Confederate Congress but died before taking his seat. Franklin Pierce, another former president, was a Southern sympathizer and sometimes accused informally of treason.Mr. Trump\u2019s critics reach for words like treason and traitor because they, like others, are searching for an explanation for actions that are so different from those of his predecessors. Other presidents, including Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, sought to build good relations with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, but none seemed so willing for so long to overlook hostile Russian actions or side with Moscow over the agencies of their own government.Whether this leads anywhere remains unclear. Past moments that seemed decisive, like the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and Charlottesville, came and went. For now at least, hurling the treason charge seems more about making a point than making a case in a courtroom or impeachment hearing. But it is an explosive word to use and that by itself suggests how fraught this moment in the nation\u2019s history has become.Mr. Brennan said on \u201cToday\u201d on NBC News on Tuesday that he understood how charged the term was when he used it, but said that the events justified it. \u201cI\u2019m sure Ronald Reagan listening to what Mr. Trump was saying could not believe it and is rolling over right now unfortunately in his grave,\u201d he said.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernytAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chippendale at 300: A Stellar Brand in Need of Polish", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It was a precursor of the Ikea catalog. Customers could browse, select a design and then order a piece of furniture.Unlike Ikea\u2019s catalogs, the \u201cDirector,\u201d of course, was not aimed at the mass consumer. The first edition was funded by 308 subscribers, most of whom were fellow trade professionals wanting to keep up with the latest styles. Just 49 subscribers were members of the nobility or gentry who would have had the wealth to buy pieces from Chippendale\u2019s London workshop.Helped by this marketing masterstroke, Chippendale became 18th-century England\u2019s most celebrated and sought-after furniture maker. But how is his fame faring?Part of the problem is that though Chippendale was \u2014 according to Ms. Speelberg of the Met \u2014 \u201cthe first cabinet maker to have a comprehensive style named after him,\u201d many find it difficult to identify that style nowadays. The popularity of the \u201cDirector\u201d encouraged a host of imitators. And because 18th-century English makers, unlike their French counterparts, did not necessarily sign furniture, it can be difficult to verify original pieces from the Chippendale workshop. Mr. Bowett said that so far more than 800 pieces had been securely attributed.Mr. Phillips said he had been looking to the Chippendale tercentenary to re-energize the top end of the English furniture market. His gallery in the Mayfair district is currently hosting a comprehensive selling exhibition of 38 Chippendale pieces.Those include a recently discovered gilded wood mirror in the neo-Classical style, from about 1785, one of four supplied by Chippendale to a stately home in Yorkshire, and a mahogany rococo armchair that exactly corresponds to a design in the 1762 third edition of the \u201cDirector.\u201d The mirror is priced at 850,000 pounds, or about $1.1 million; the armchair at \u00a3265,000.\u201cI think the prices are too low,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cWhen you consider they\u2019re the best of the best of English furniture, they\u2019re a giveaway compared to certain paintings,\u201d he added, without mentioning any names.Mr. Phillips said on Wednesday that he had sold 12 pieces from his Chippendale show so far, priced from \u00a330,000 to about \u00a3700,000.In 1991, at a landmark sale of the Messer Collection of English furniture at the same auction house, a mahogany and ebony-inlaid commode made in the neo-Classical style by Chippendale for his fellow Yorkshireman, Rowland Wynne, fetched \u00a3935,000, an auction high for the maker. That year, the English furniture department of Christie\u2019s had a higher turnover than its Impressionist and modern-art department.The commode reappeared, among 20 select pieces, in the Chippendale tercentenary sale on July 5 at Christie\u2019s. This time round, it was estimated at \u00a33 million to \u00a35 million, reflecting the \u00a33.8 million achieved for another Chippendale commode at Sotheby\u2019s in 2010.Despite extensive marketing in Asia, it failed to sell, as did two Chippendale gilded wood sofas, each with a low estimate of \u00a32 million. The sofas did at least sell privately after the auction \u2014 as a pair, for an undisclosed price.All the other lots in the auction found buyers, and the sale achieved a relatively modest total of \u00a33.3 million.\u201cYou need a flow of masterpieces to underpin prices, and great things just haven\u2019t appeared on the market in the last few years,\u201d said Orlando Rock, co-chairman of decorative arts for Christie\u2019s. \u201cChippendale is a distinct brand. We need to inspire people.\u201dJanet Casey, curator at Dumfries House, said the collection was \u201cthe largest authenticated group of early Chippendale pieces.\u201d\u201cAnd they\u2019ve all come directly from the workshop,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbroken chain.\u201dYet the fact remains that, internationally, the Chippendale name no longer has such a stellar status. If it did, the museum-quality pieces that have been offered this year would easily have found buyers at levels routinely paid for lesser-quality Picasso paintings.The Chippendale sofa \u201ctied in beautifully with the lavish blue and bronze patterned 18th-century Axminster rug,\u201d said Hello, a glossy British magazine focused on celebrity and royal gossip.Now that is something the trailblazing publisher of the \u201cDirector\u201d would have appreciated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Goop\u2019s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Company Worth $250 Million", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "FeatureInside the growth of the most controversial brand in the wellness industry.Supported byShe moved to the teacher\u2019s desk, where she sat down and crossed her legs. She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d she\u2019d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can\u2019t miss. She wasn\u2019t just curious. She was planning this the whole time.The first iteration of the company was only these lists \u2014 where to go and what to buy once you get there \u2014 via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey rag\u00f9 and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter\u2019s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, \u201cI love what you\u2019re doing with Goop.\u201d G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn\u2019t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a \u201cgodmother\u201d to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and \u201cgave permission\u201d to start thinking about how to monetize it.By the time she stood in that Harvard classroom, Goop was a clothing manufacturer, a beauty company, an advertising hub, a publishing house, a podcast producer and a portal of health-and-healing information, and soon it would become a TV-show producer. It was a clearinghouse of alternative health claims, sex-and-intimacy advice and probes into the mind, body and soul. There was no part of the self that Goop didn\u2019t aim to serve.\u201cI want to help you solve problems,\u201d G.P. said. \u201cI want to be an additive to your life.\u201d Goop is now worth $250 million, according to a source close to the company.For all the students\u2019 questions about those newsletters and their use of all kinds of three-letter acronyms, it felt to me as if everyone was missing the point. G.P.\u2019s business began in 2008 and was incorporated in 2013, but it really started when she was being hunted by the paparazzi and living in such a lonely, high-altitude world that she could basically be friends with only Madonna. Or even before that when, as a 19-year-old, she would run lines with her mother, the actress Blythe Danner, and Danner noticed that it was all too easy for her, that there was something preternatural about her talent (an assessment one of her former co-stars also said to me almost verbatim). Or maybe even before that, when some combination of her parents\u2019 DNA formed a genetic supernova that would allow for her name to appear in the same paragraph as the word \u201cluminous\u201d 227 times when searching in a LexisNexis database.They nodded, mesmerized, stars and dollar signs in their eyes. They took notes, but why? When G.P. said \u201caspirational,\u201d she wasn\u2019t kidding. Her business depended on no one ever being able to be her. Though I guess it also depended on their ability to think they might.Before we knew it, the wellness point of view had invaded everything in our lives: Summer-solstice sales are wellness. Yoga in the park is wellness. Yoga at work is wellness. Yoga in Times Square is peak wellness. When people give you namaste hands and bow as a way of saying thank you. The organic produce section of Whole Foods. Whole Foods. Hemp. Oprah. CBD. \u201cBody work.\u201d Reiki. So is: SoulCycle, a\u00e7a\u00ed, antioxidants, the phrase \u201cmind-body,\u201d meditation, the mindfulness jar my son brought home from school, kombucha, chai, juice bars, oat milk, almond milk, all the milks from substances that can\u2019t technically be milked, clean anything. \u201cLiving your best life.\u201d \u201cLiving your truth.\u201d Crystals.Goop\u2019s first newsletter left G.P.\u2019s kitchen in 2008, right when the economy was collapsing around us. It wasn\u2019t just the homes people no longer owned and the jobs people no longer had. It was the environmental crisis. It was the endless exposure of corruption. Whom exactly were we trusting with our care? Why did we decide to trust them in the first place? Who says that only certain kinds of people are allowed to give us the answers?These phenomena gave an easy rise to Gwyneth Paltrow, who was at first curating teas and lingerie and sweaters she thought you\u2019d like. But people were looking for leaders, and she was already committing public displays of ostentatious wellness: She showed up at a movie premiere with cupping marks on her back; she let bees sting her because I don\u2019t know why. Suddenly Gwyneth Paltrow, the movie star, was a major player in an industry that was big business.Other celebrities followed. Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Company was worth more than $1 billion at its peak, but it really offers mostly cleaning and beauty products. Miranda Kerr has a line of organic beauty products. Amanda Chantal Bacon\u2019s Moon Juice, a line of supplements, is a ship launched directly from Port Goop. None of them aim to treat every single aspect of the human as wholly as Goop does. Nothing is as elemental an extension of its source as Goop is.We ate salmon hand rolls. She was trying to be low-carb today, but it wasn\u2019t happening. There was too much going on. The wellness summit, a daylong immersion in Goop-endorsed products, panels, doctors and other \u201chealers,\u201d was a \u201cheavy lift for the team.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s intense, man,\u201d she said. She reached behind her to her bookshelf, which held about a dozen blue bottles of something called Real Water, which is not stripped of \u201cvaluable electrons,\u201d which supposedly creates free radicals something something from the body\u2019s cells. \u201cIt\u2019s insane, and then I have to do a lot on the day, and I really don\u2019t like speaking in public, and I have to keep getting up in front of a crowd.\u201dThe summit is great, don\u2019t get her wrong. All three so far have sold out, with tickets ranging from $500 to $4,500, the highest of which included two dinners with G.P. plus two nights at Casa del Mar. But lately she has been wondering if the summit does everything it needs to. She worries that she\u2019s just serving the same customers over and over. She met a woman who took a very long bus ride from she thinks rural Pennsylvania to the Goop summit in New York in January. \u201cSeventy-nine percent of our American customers aren\u2019t in New York or Los Angeles,\u201d where these summits are held, she said; they\u2019re in secondary markets.So how do you bring them in? There have been pop-up Goop stores everywhere from Dallas to Miami. There would be a digital pass to the summit. But you can\u2019t taste a plate of ancient grains and avocado in citrus dressing on a computer. You can\u2019t feel someone push warm oil with a jade roller over your skin through an iPad. You can\u2019t eat a piece of chocolate that will supposedly not just regulate your hormones but restore your sex life \u2014 chocolate! \u2014 on your phone. You can only watch some panels and one-on-one conversations. So she\u2019s thinking they might take the thing on the road. Can you believe this? She was incredulous. She still remembers sitting in her kitchen in London, celebrating a day when $45 had come in because of an advertising partnership.The newsletter was at first kind of mainstream New Age-forward. It had some kooky stuff in it, but nothing totally outrageous. It was concerned with basic wellness causes, like detoxes and cleanses and meditation. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that it began to resemble the thing it is now, a wellspring of both totally legitimate wellness tips and completely bonkers magical thinking: advice from psychotherapists and advice from doctors about how much Vitamin D to take (answer: a lot! Too much!) and vitamins for sale and body brushing and dieting and the afterlife and crystals and I swear to God something called Psychic Vampire Repellent, which is a \u201csprayable elixir\u201d that uses \u201cgem healing\u201d to something something \u201cbad vibes.\u201dThat was the year after G.P. met Elise Loehnen, 38, a former magazine editor who had been ghostwriting for G.P.\u2019s friend, the extremely extreme personal trainer Tracy Anderson, in whose business G.P. is a minority stakeholder. Loehnen wasn\u2019t just interested in wellness; she was obsessed with it. Wellness, she argued, isn\u2019t just about a spa you\u2019re going to or a cleanse you\u2019ve started or a diet you\u2019re on. It\u2019s how local your food is. It\u2019s how the chickens you eat all went to the right schools. It\u2019s the water you drink. It\u2019s the cures you never thought possible. It\u2019s the level of well-being you didn\u2019t even know to ask for.With Loehnen as editorial director, Goop began publishing extended Q. and A.s with doctors and healers like Alejandro Junger, a cardiologist who created an anti-inflammatory regimen and recently talked on Goop\u2019s podcast about frog venom as a psychedelic for healing, which, O.K.! Steven Gundry, a cardiac surgeon, believes that lectins, a protein in some foods, are dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases. (There are a great many people who do not believe this.) Anyone from an acupuncturist to a psychic to an endocrinologist to a psychologist addressed questions that the modern woman couldn\u2019t seem to find answers to: Why am I so unhappy? Why am I so tired? Why am I so fat? Why don\u2019t I want to have sex anymore?There were stories that talked about bee-sting therapy (don\u2019t try it; someone died from it this year) and ashwagandha and adaptogens and autoimmune diseases \u2014 an autoimmune disease at every corner, be it thyroid disease, arthritis or celiac disease; trust them, you have one. Last year, G.P. gave a platform to her friend Shiva Rose, a healer who talked about inserting a jade egg into the vagina, which she says concubines did and which she claimed could help prevent uterine prolapse. This did not go unnoticed! They sold a brush that would help your lymph flow, a salt shampoo that would detoxify your scalp, a water bottle with rose quartz in it that would infuse your water with positive energy.Goop knew what readers were clicking on, and it was nimble enough to meet those needs by actually manufacturing the things its readers wanted. When a story about beauty products that didn\u2019t have endocrine disrupters and formaldehyde got a lot of traffic in 2015, the company started Goop by Juice Beauty, a collection of \u201cclean\u201d face creams and oils and cleansers that it promised lacked those things. When a story about \u201cpostnatal depletion,\u201d a syndrome coined by one of the Goop doctors, did even-better-than-average business in 2017, it introduced Goop Wellness, a series of four vitamin \u201cprotocols\u201d for women with different concerns \u2014 weight, energy, focus, etc. Goop says it sold $100,000 of them on their first day.With assaults coming from all sides, Goop began to dig its heels into the dirt, not only because dirt is a natural exfoliant and also contains selenium, which is a mineral many of us are lacking and helps with thyroid function. Now Goop was growing only more successful. Now Goop was a cause, and G.P. was its martyr.A woman who has worked for G.P. for a long time stood beside her, cooking an entirely separate dinner for G.P.\u2019s children. The meal we would eat \u2014 the clams and the bread \u2014 took only a half-hour to make, but G.P. said it could have taken only 15 minutes if we weren\u2019t talking so much. It is a recipe out of her fourth cookbook, \u201cIt\u2019s All Easy,\u201d which she wrote in the wake of her divorce from Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay. Suddenly, as a single mother, she wanted to create recipes that followed her particular set of food values but that she could execute quickly.G.P. asked what I would like to drink. I asked for a glass of red wine. G.P. gave the nod to someone over my left shoulder. I turned to see Jeffrey, the same man in a shawl-collar sweater who opened the door for me earlier. He nodded back.Chris Martin walked in and sat down at the kitchen island and introduced himself. He saw my tape recorder and immediately told me that though I seemed nice and trustworthy, he had no interest in being part of my article, so please keep anything he says out of it.A very good-looking young boy appeared. \u201cHi, lover,\u201d G.P. said. The boy, whom I recognized as her youngest child, Moses, immediately came to my side, made socially appropriate eye contact and shook my hand. \u201cHello, nice to meet you,\u201d he said. Moses is 12, about the same age as my older son.My phone rang. It was the mother of my son\u2019s friend, back home in stupid New Jersey, and I realized she wouldn\u2019t be calling if not for something gone awry. I apologized to G.P. and picked up the phone. The mom told me that my son was insisting that I was supposed to be picking him up. \u201cI\u2019m in California!\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m with Gwyneth Paltrow!\u201d She said she\u2019d pass the message along and proceed as usual. G.P. said something, but I couldn\u2019t concentrate because I was trying to understand how my 7-year-old didn\u2019t know that I was out of town. Had I not said goodbye?A teenage girl orbited herself into the kitchen. She stuck her hand out to me. \u201cI\u2019m Apple. Nice to meet you.\u201d She had a fine, assured grip and a blunt bob and eyeliner and looked like a child version of the Wes Anderson character Margot Tenenbaum, which, of course, she was.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d G.P. asked.\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d Apple said, frustrated, rubbing her eyes with her fists. She sounded exactly like her mother, down to the slight, soft nasal on the vowels: hiiii, Aaapple, guuuys, wooow, tiiiiired.G.P. stuck out her lips and clucked sympathy.\u201cI started watching \u2018The Office,\u2019 and I find it so funny,\u201d Apple said.\u201cThe English one?\u201d G.P. asked.\u201cNo, the U.S. one.\u201dThe children followed Martin into another room so that they could practice their musical instruments with him. As Moses left, he asked G.P. if he should leave both doors open so she could hear him play. She said, \u201cYes. I want to hear you.\u201d Then, to me: \u201cHe\u2019s going to play AC/DC. He keeps such good time.\u201d They were going to become musicians, she just knew it.She wasn\u2019t going to have more kids. That she also knew. Her business, her age, which is 45 \u2014 not impossible, but still. She\u2019d wanted a third. She told me that after she asked how many I had, and I told her I had two children as well, and it was wonderful, but I was sad I didn\u2019t have a third.She told me I should rethink it while I\u2019m still young enough. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s not nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted another one.\u201d I nodded solemnly. (Later, I cried.)Brad Falchuk, a writer and director, who is also Ryan Murphy\u2019s producing partner, entered the kitchen. He and G.P. had just announced their engagement on the cover of the second issue of Goop magazine, whose theme was, conveniently, sex and love. I congratulated them.\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, standing behind her, his arms around her waist and his face buried in her neck. She registered his snuggle and returned it with a return-snuggle body spasm without stopping her cooking actions.I heard the first few notes of \u201cBlackbird\u201d and looked up and around for the speakers. I\u2019d never heard such a beautiful version. \u201cWhere is it coming from?\u201d I asked. Again G.P. nodded her chin over my shoulder, my right one this time, and I turned around to see Apple on a couch behind me, strumming her guitar. Apple told me she doesn\u2019t like to use a pick. She likes the calluses.\u201cApple, that\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d G.P. said. I turned back to G.P. in astonishment. She smiled. In front of me, our glasses had been filled again.G.P. and Falchuk and I ate the clams with the grilled bread in a candlelit dining room with a fireplace off pewter dishes from Match, which I admired. \u201cThey\u2019re getting kind of old,\u201d she said. Her dress remained white. Mine had clam juice down the front.After dinner, G.P. and I sat in her living room on the floor. I had read that she smokes one cigarette a week. I had brought a pack of cigarettes to test this out. I used to smoke but stopped more than 10 years ago. She had her own pack of Nat Shermans hidden away somewhere and told me that these days it was more like a few times a year. Falchuk sat with us, tan and smiley, but wouldn\u2019t smoke. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a cigarette in my life.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a doctor\u2019s son,\u201d she said. Then, to him: \u201cWill you be mad?\u201dHe smiled at her and shook his head. Her feet were bare now, and they had a perfect, substantial arch, just as the Romans intended, engineered to support her statue body. I bet they were a Size 8. People make shoes so that feet like those can wear them. We blew smoke up the chimney.I drove back to my hotel to find that a family that owned a Mercedes dealership would be hosting an impromptu all-night party around the pool and that I would never get any sleep. I thought about my children, one of whom plays the flute, but unwillingly, and therefore won\u2019t practice. Yes, I thought about my children, only one of whom might shake your hand while the other would sooner spit on it, though they will both reliably do an elaborate orchestration of armpit farting while I\u2019m trying to hear myself think. I thought of my mother and father, and an earlier conversation I had with my sisters that day about where to arrange our parents in a room for one of our kids\u2019 bar mitzvahs so that they wouldn\u2019t interact, so raw still are the wounds 35 years after their divorce. I thought of my big, disgusting Size 11 feet, which are wide and flat and have the look of scuba flippers and which designers have shod only begrudgingly. I thought of the third child I don\u2019t have, the one I ache for. The car salespeople danced below.I thought about the word \u201caspiration,\u201d how to aspire seems so noble, but how aspiration is always infused with a kind of suffering, and I smoked another cigarette.That issue, like the second issue (the one with a cover photo of her and Falchuk and the words \u201cIn Deep\u201d), was $15 on newsstands and a product of a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast. At first, it seemed like a perfect fit. \u201cGoop and Cond\u00e9 Nast are natural partners, and I\u2019m excited she\u2019s bringing her point of view to the company,\u201d said Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and editor in chief of Vogue, when the deal was announced in April 2017. The print product would be a collaboration \u2014 Goop content overseen by a Vogue editor.It didn\u2019t work out. \u201cThey\u2019re a company that\u2019s really in transition and do things in a very old-school way,\u201d G.P. said. The parting was amicable. \u201cBut it was amazing to work with Anna. I love her. She\u2019s a total idol of mine. We realized we could just do a better job of it ourselves in-house. I think for us it was really like we like to work where we are in an expansive space. Somewhere like Cond\u00e9, understandably, there are a lot of rules.\u201dThe rules she\u2019s referring to are the rules of traditional magazine making \u2014 all upheld strictly at an institution like Cond\u00e9 Nast. One of them is that they weren\u2019t allowed to use the magazine as part of their \u201ccontextual commerce\u201d strategy. They wanted to be able to sell Goop products (in addition to other products, just as they do on their site). But Cond\u00e9 Nast insisted that they have a more \u201cagnostic\u201d editorial approach. The company publishes magazines, not catalogs. But why? G.P. wanted to know. She wanted the Goop magazine to be a natural extension of the Goop website. She wanted the reader to be able to do things like text a code to purchase a product without even having to leave her inert reading position and wander over to her computer. A magazine customer is also a regular customer.But the other rule is \u2014 well, the thing couldn\u2019t be fact-checked. Goop wanted Goop magazine to be like the Goop website in another way: to allow the Goop family of doctors and healers to go unchallenged in their recommendations via the kinds of Q. and A.s published, and that just didn\u2019t pass Cond\u00e9 Nast standards. Those standards require traditional backup for scientific claims, like double-blind, peer-reviewed studies. The stories Loehnen, now Goop\u2019s chief content officer, wanted to publish had to be quickly replaced at the last minute by packages like the one on \u201cclean\u201d getaways.These questions had been plaguing Goop for a while \u2014 not just what is a fact, or how important is a fact, but also what exactly is Goop allowed to be suggesting? In 2016, a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus began an inquiry into Goop for deceptive marketing claims about the life-optimizing powers of Moon Juice products, which appeared on the Goop site as a key ingredient in a smoothie that G.P. drank every morning. (Goop voluntarily stopped making these claims.) And last summer, the watchdog organization TruthInAdvertising.org (TINA) sent G.P. a letter that referred to numerous instances of deceptive marketing claims \u2014 that the site\u2019s products cured, treated or prevented inflammation, autoimmune diseases and more. Goop replied and adjusted some of its claims in the short period the letter allotted, but TINA found its response inadequate and reported Goop to the district attorney\u2019s offices in both Santa Cruz and Santa Clara. (The district attorney\u2019s offices would not comment on the matter.)But something strange happened. Each of these pronouncements set off a series of blog posts and articles and tweets that linked directly to the site, driving up traffic. At Harvard, G.P. called these moments \u201ccultural firestorms.\u201d \u201cI can monetize those eyeballs,\u201d she told the students. Goop had learned to do a special kind of dark art: to corral the vitriol of the internet and the ever-present shall we call it cultural ambivalence about G.P. herself and turn them into cash. It\u2019s never clickbait, she told the class. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural firestorm when it\u2019s about a woman\u2019s vagina.\u201d The room was silent. She then cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled, \u201cVAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!\u201d as if she were yodeling.As of June, there were 2.4 million unique visitors to the site per month, according to the numbers Goop provided me. The podcast, which is mostly hosted by Loehnen and features interviews with wellness practitioners, receives 100,000 to 650,000 listens per week. Goop wanted to publish articles about autoimmune diseases and infrared saunas and thyroids, and now it can, on its own terms \u2014 sort of.After a few too many cultural firestorms, and with investors to think about, G.P. made some changes. Goop has hired a lawyer to vet all claims on the site. It hired an editor away from Cond\u00e9 Nast to run the magazine. It hired a man with a Ph.D. in nutritional science, and a director of science and research who is a former Stanford professor. And in September, Goop, sigh, is hiring a full-time fact-checker. G.P. chose to see it as \u201cnecessary growing pain.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t as if the appetite for Goop\u2019s content was going away. I\u2019ve spoken to dozens of people who feel better after a detox cleanse, and science can\u2019t really tell them why.I once went to an internist twice, complaining of preternatural exhaustion, only to be told that I was depressed and sent home. On the third visit, she begrudgingly took my blood and called me later to even more begrudgingly apologize and tell me I had a surprising case of mononucleosis. I know women who\u2019ve been dismissed by their doctors for being lazy and careless and depressed and downright crazy. Was it any wonder that they would start to seek help from sources that assumed that their symptoms weren\u2019t all in their head?In her office, G.P. opened her MacBook. There was a guy this whole situation reminded her of, and she had forgotten his name, but a quick Wikipedia search and, ah, there it was: \u201cIgnaz Philipp Semmelweis, German,\u201d she read to me. Semmelweis, once described as a \u201csavior of mothers,\u201d discovered that cases of puerperal fever could be significantly cut by washing hands before surgery.Here she shook her head. \u201cThis is so sad. This gives me chills.\u201d She continued reading, \u201cIn 1865, Semmelweis was committed to an asylum where he died at 47 of pyaemia after being beaten by the guards only 14 days after he was committed.\u201d (There is debate about how Semmelweis died.)She stood up. Her posture was a marvel. \u201cYou ask what is happening when someone says, \u2018Have we just thought about this?\u2019 That\u201d \u2014 being beaten to death in an asylum \u2014 \u201cis what happened to this guy.\u201d\u201cWhere do you think it ends for you?\u201d I asked her, getting up from my chair.She laughed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m committed to an asylum.\u201dOr maybe it\u2019s just that G.P. disrupted the contract between the celebrity and the civilian who is observing her. In a typical women\u2019s magazine profile, the implicit pact is that the celebrity will not make the woman feel bad by implying that the woman could have what the celebrity has if only she would work: \u201cIt\u2019s all in my genes, what can I say!\u201d the celebrity proclaims. But G.P. was different. She would talk openly about the food habits and exercise obsessions that allowed her to look the way she did. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to sit home and not exercise and criticize other people,\u201d she told Elle magazine in 2011. \u201cMy life is good,\u201d she wrote on Goop\u2019s website, \u201cbecause I am not passive about it. I want to nourish what is real, and I want to do it without wasting time.\u201d People think they want celebrities to speak honestly, but we\u2019re not really that happy when they do.We talked about this one morning at a suite at the Carlyle, where she lay across a sofa like a poem. She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes. (I had taken to, when barefoot, extending the sesamoid part of my foot without pointing my toes, so that my feet looked like Barbie feet, which created an arch where I had none. \u201cSee?\u201d I\u2019d say to my husband in bed. \u201cThis is what her feet look like just regular.\u201d)She didn\u2019t know why people felt the way they did. She said the decision to stop acting and pursue Goop was not difficult, but it had nothing to do with her reputation. \u201cI really liked acting,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut at a certain point, it started to feel frustrating in a way not to have true agency, like to be beholden to other people to give you a job, or to create something, to put something into the world.\u201d She was doing three or four or five movies a year, and the primary relationship in those films was with Harvey Weinstein. \u201cThe one time that Harvey propositioned me was really almost the least of it in terms of how onerous that relationship was, and it was very quid pro quo and punitive, and I always felt like I was on thin ice, and he could be truly horrible and mean and then be incredibly generous. It was kind of like a classic abusive relationship.\u201dWhat can she say? It\u2019s hard to talk about herself like this. How can she really understand who she is in the culture anyway? She\u2019s the only one who can\u2019t see herself clearly. All she knows is what she hears, and she once heard that she eats in front of the mirror naked.The hatred used to feel personal to her, but it doesn\u2019t anymore. Now it feels as if she\u2019s watching a soap opera. She remembers the week that Star Magazine called her the most hated celebrity in the world. \u201cI remember being like: Really? More than, like, Chris Brown? Me? Really? Wow. It was also the same week that I was People\u2019s Most Beautiful Woman. For a minute I was like: Wait, I don\u2019t understand. Am I hated to the bone or am I the world\u2019s most beautiful?\u201dAnyway, this was an old conversation, she insisted. \u201cI really notice as the business grows, there\u2019s a lot less of that, and I think people are like: Oh, this is real, and I feel like that\u2019s sort of, you know, a nine-months-ago story. You know what I mean?\u201dI didn\u2019t. I was introduced to G.P. through Bill Burton, a communications strategist known for his work for Barack Obama. That\u2019s not really how stories about start-ups or celebrities typically get done. I have a Google alert for her (as I do for everyone I\u2019m writing about), and each day, that alert goes off and is somewhat filled with pictures of her in a bikini on a yacht but is mostly filled with pus and bile \u2014 for her supposed smugness, her jade eggs, her ability to smoke a cigarette without becoming an addict. Bloggers at New York magazine\u2019s The Cut regularly mock Goop\u2019s gift guides (to which G.P. said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what The Cut is\u201d).So this is why people hate her? \u201cBecause I have discipline?\u201d she said. She remembers reading that Michio Kushi, the father of macrobiotics, smoked cigarettes sometimes. She wanted to be like that. It\u2019s something she cultivated.I said, don\u2019t you see? The last cigarette she had was in February, sitting on the floor next to her chimney with me. It was June. I smoked now. I walked down the street sucking on cigarettes the way I did in my youth. I recently got into bed with my poor son, and he told me that I \u201csmell like the city.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t understand it. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s perfect. She is the way she is because of hard work. How could people hate her for that? It\u2019s just hard work. It\u2019s just intention. The content is free, and it\u2019s all right there. Go to her website. Do some meditation. Just eat more produce. Take some time for yourself. Hydrate.We\u2019re so hard on one another, G.P. said. We\u2019re so hard on ourselves, too. \u201cThat\u2019s all we do as women,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just kick the [expletive] out of ourselves. It\u2019s like that inner critic is so vicious, and it\u2019s like: Why do we do that? It\u2019s so nuts.\u201d She continued: \u201cPeople say that there\u2019s no link between emotions and consciousness and physical illness. And yet look at the plethora of autoimmune diseases around you. One man to 10 women have autoimmune. We literally have turned on ourselves.\u201dEveryone glowed. Everyone wore flowing dresses and wide-legged jumpsuits. There was a woman asleep on one of the couches. Also: a manifestation workshop; acroyoga, where we bobbed up and down on scarves hanging from the ceiling; a medium who told me my grandmother was standing next to me telling me I have thyroid disease; a man who stuck two ungloved fingers into my ears and said he \u201cfixed\u201d my jaw, which there was nothing wrong with. Trust him, he said, he\u2019s not a doctor. He\u2019s not even a physical therapist. He\u2019s a weight trainer, and he said he has a list of 2,000 people waiting to get fixed by him. All these people, wasting their money on traditional medicine, when he\u2019s willing to take you into his office and lay you on a table and make you good as new without the hassle of insurance.This always struck me as funny about the wellness world: how some people would brag about their mainstream credentials (\u201cTrust me,\u201d they\u2019d say, with a straightening of their tie. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor\u201d), while others felt that their legitimacy lay in the fact that they had no credentials. (\u201cTrust me,\u201d they\u2019d say, jamming their thumbs mockingly toward the doctors. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d)I pulled down my pants for a man in scrubs who was giving out B12 shots, never telling him my secret, that I\u2019d been taking the Goop vitamins and my urine was already a fluorescent yellow \u2014 no, gold \u2014 a superfood elixir.A woman called an akashic-records healer who reads your past, present and possible future lives sat me down and asked about my foot pain. I asked her how she knew I had foot pain. I wasn\u2019t limping. She said, \u201cYou have flat feet.\u201d I nodded, incredulous. \u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cI have flat feet.\u201d She told me that 13 lives ago, my feet were chopped off as punishment for a crime. As a result, since then, whenever I reincarnate (which is every 100 to 500 years because I like to rest between incarnations), my feet are flat because I like the surety of them entirely touching the ground.What I\u2019m saying is: There was nothing that couldn\u2019t be healed at the summit.The next morning, I had another article to write. But my hotel was on the beach, and the ocean was just a block away. I still had a bottle of Madame Dry Rose Water, which is \u201cbotanically infused, positively charged\u201d water that is filtered through rose-quartz crystals, and a bottle of Lifewtr, which is just water without vowels. I thought, for maybe the first time in my life, that work could wait. Self-care. Wellness. It started now. I had a long trip home ahead of me, and now I was someone who said \u201cself-care.\u201dI finished my waters and headed to the airport, where I dropped my rental car and boarded the Hertz bus. But something was wrong at the airport, or it was just Los Angeles being Los Angeles, and the bus didn\u2019t move. The normally 10-minute ride was now 20, and then 30, and then 40. I had to go to the bathroom so badly. My terminal was at the end and there was a stop at every single other terminal \u2014 even Air China. At 50 minutes, I realized I could no longer hold it and alerted the bus driver. Someone suggested I just get off at the next terminal and then pick the next bus up again. I screamed that I couldn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t have time! My kids and husband were waiting for me!Finally, I got off two terminals early. I ran through the check-in area, screaming: \u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom? Where\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d I peed my beautiful pee wondering what the point of it all had been. I ran through the next two terminals till I finally got to the United check-in area. I cut the line, screaming still, \u201cI was on a Hertz bus for an hour!\u201dI dropped off my suitcase just before the cutoff. I ran through the airport, my new smoker\u2019s cough slowing me down. I went through security but didn\u2019t have time to get something to eat at the fancy place, and so I got a premade fried chicken sandwich, which I would eat and feel every preservative and every sodium molecule course through my blood.As I was boarding, my sister called me.\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked.The image of the reiki workshop I\u2019d gone to at the summit returned to me. The practitioner had us lie on the floor and announced that we were all sharing one another\u2019s energy, and I didn\u2019t know how to feel about that, as if I hadn\u2019t consented to it. She said, \u201cThe future is your best teacher.\u201d She waved her hands over us like a sorceress. She gave us each a charged rose crystal that was shaped like a heart but flat and told us to put it in our bras. At the end, we lay, eyes closed, and put our hands on our hearts, and I opened my eyes before everyone else and saw all these women dressed in light colors, lined up like desperate, exquisite corpses, their hands over their hearts, totally inert.We are doomed to aspire for the rest of our lives. Aspiration is suffering. Wellness is suffering. As soon as you level up, you greet how infinite the possibilities are, and it all becomes too awful to live without.I told her, \u201cIt was ridiculous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Leonard is the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS.The president is here to trumpet a $12 billion plan to aid American farmers. Why do they need aid? For Iowans, it\u2019s because 33 percent of our economy is tied, directly or indirectly, to agriculture, and Mr. Trump recklessly opened trade wars that will hit \u201cTrump country\u201d \u2014 rural America \u2014 hardest and that have already brought an avalanche of losses. Indeed, the impact of his tariffs will probably be felt by family farms and the area for generations. So perhaps visiting Dubuque is the least he could do.But the fallout will not just be tallied in statistics. In farm country, U.S.A., the Trump tariffs have poured gas on what has been a slow-burning conflagration. Rural America is about to undergo a major demographic shift. President Trump didn\u2019t start it, but he has accelerated a crisis that might have taken a generation or two to play out. Now it might take only a few years. Rural America is going to be hollowed out very quickly. Farms will become consolidated, and towns that are already in trouble will certainly die. A friend, a small-town Iowa banker who specializes in working with farmers, offered a local example. It\u2019s time for Mom and Dad to retire, get off the farm and move to town. Much of the time, if no heir is interested in continuing the operation, the farm is auctioned to the highest bidder. This time, one son wanted to take over the farm. But there were other children entitled to their share, so the farm went up for auction. But now they had to compete with larger farm operations. The son \u201cdid the best he could,\u201d said my friend, but a big operation \u201cbid it up more than it was worth, some guy from out of town no one knew \u2014 probably from one of the big operations up north. The kid didn\u2019t have a chance. It was heartbreaking.\u201dI use Iowa in my examples, but much of rural America will be affected in a similar way. In the worst possible outcome of this scenario, losses and farm consolidation accelerated by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs will make the devastating 1980s farm crisis look like a bump in the road as it drives a significant rural-to-city migration. Smaller operations don\u2019t have the capital to weather a trade war and will be forced to sell, most likely to larger operations. In my community, I learned this week that a hog operation I drive by every day is folding. The confinements are being dismantled, and anything portable can be found on Craigslist. A friend close to the family told me pork prices have been down for years, and with the tariffs it\u2019s just not worth it anymore.Another casualty: our community banks. As farms get larger, farm loans are less likely to be local. A big operation with farms in dozens of counties that maybe even cross state lines probably won\u2019t use local banks for credit. When our community banks are gone, one of the major economic engines of our small towns will be gone. At a certain point, populations won\u2019t be enough to support rural hospitals and clinics, and they, too, will be gone. Rural hospitals are one of the major employers in the community. Even if you have a good manufacturing company in town, if you lose the hospital, they won\u2019t be able to attract the employees they need. Those plants may be forced to leave as well \u2014 especially since the tariffs have hit them hard also. One friend who has a small manufacturing business says his costs have doubled since Mr. Trump announced tariffs on aluminum and steel, and that his business is down 40 percent.Some of the farmers I speak with are unwavering in support of the president; they\u2019d vote Republican even if Mr. Trump personally slapped the heck out of the preacher at the church potluck. But others are starting to recognize how the economic impact of the tariffs is hitting them personally. Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation, all Republican with the exception of Democrat Dave Loebsack in Iowa\u2019s Second Congressional District, have warned the administration. So has Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds. This is why, earlier this summer, Vice President Mike Pence came to the Midwest for a reassuring visit and why Sonny Perdue, Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of agriculture, offered his $12 billion band-aid of a handout Tuesday. Farmers take out lines of credit in the spring \u2014 usually due the following Jan. 1 \u2014 to pay for seed and other input costs, and then pay the loans back after harvest. Like any other loan, there are consequences to not paying, including losing the farm. Farmers are going to know before the midterm elections if they are going to be able to pay back loans. The larger farm operations and the larger agribusinesses will be hovering, looking for any weakness, and ready to purchase smaller farms. And rest assured, when the Trump payments are made to farmers, the larger operations will be the ones that gobble them up. Behind the lilies are hundred-acre fields of corn or beans, and if you park your car and wander the field behind the lilies, you will invariably find nails, broken crockery and remnants of life where a farmhouse once stood. The lilies are all that\u2019s left of the dreams of the optimistic family that planted the lilies and made a farm and a life on the land generations ago, only to see it lost.The destruction of a way of life cuts as deep now as it did back then, especially when it comes from this president. The only thing he knows about food is that it always comes served to him on a silver, or maybe gold, platter. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pruitt\u2019s Successor Wants Rollbacks, Too. And He Wants Them to Stick.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In his first three weeks on the job, Andrew Wheeler, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to halt two major efforts by his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, to roll back environmental regulations, arguing that the policies are legally vulnerable, according to people who have heard his reasoning.Mr. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who served as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy, has brought a more disciplined approach to dismantling environmental rules. It is an approach that may take longer, but it may be more effective in standing up to the inevitable legal challenges.Prof. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, said Mr. Wheeler was \u201ctrying to be more careful and less sloppy\u201d than his former boss. \u201cBy taking time to improve the quality of the legal justifications, Wheeler may ensure that E.P.A. won\u2019t be subject to losing on certain types of policies,\u201d Professor Revesz said.Mr. Wheeler appeared to concede that it was unlikely to withstand legal challenge.Behind the scenes, Mr. Wheeler has clashed with other top administration officials as the White House prepares to unveil one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most consequential proposals, which would undo a major Obama-era environmental rule and let cars emit more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.Mr. Pruitt had signed off on the plan, but Mr. Wheeler fears that its legal and technical arguments are weak and that it will set up the Trump administration for an embarrassing courtroom loss, according to interviews with 11 people.A draft of the plan obtained by The New York Times proposes permitting more carbon dioxide pollution from cars and light trucks while challenging the right of California and other states to set their own, more restrictive state-level pollution standards.This is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry.The 701-page draft, which was written by a team led by two Transportation Department officials, Jeffrey A. Rosen and Heidi King, asserts that the stricter Obama-era pollution rules are too costly. It also says the rules would lead to nearly 12,903 more deaths in road accidents from drivers in cars built through 2025 because, it says, more fuel-efficient cars are less safe since they are lighter.But the plan\u2019s release has been delayed by what one person familiar with the talks called \u201ca nuclear war\u201d between Mr. Wheeler on one side and Mr. Rosen and Ms. King on the other.Mr. Wheeler has sharply questioned the analysis of the auto fatality numbers, saying that if they are proven faulty, that will undermine the legal case for the rollback, according to people who have heard him make that argument.The Obama administration\u2019s analysis concluded that, over the lifetime of the regulations, there would be 107 fewer auto fatalities than if the rules had not been implemented. Chet France, a former E.P.A. staff member who worked on that analysis, said that it may be difficult for the Trump administration to make its case by disproving the Obama-era fatality numbers, which were peer-reviewed by several panels of experts.While people familiar with the talks described a feud between Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Rosen over how to proceed, Mr. Wheeler described the negotiations between the agencies as \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\u201cThis assertion of a \u2018nuclear war\u2019 is categorically false,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur efforts with DOT have been reflective of a robust and constructive interagency process that the American people expect \u2014 and deserve \u2014 when agencies are proposing rules of such consequence.\u201dFor now, the White House is siding with Mr. Rosen. Mr. Trump is expected to announce the proposal next week.Under the Obama-era rules, automakers would be required to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles by 2025, achieving an average of about 54 miles per gallon, thus lowering oil consumption and greenhouse-gas pollution and representing the largest move by the United States to combat global warming.The Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpreferred option\u201d for weakening the rule would allow mileage standards to rise as scheduled until 2020, at which point the standard would freeze at about 37 miles per gallon.The proposal would also challenge the authority of California and other states to set their own, tougher standards. California has a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act to set its own air pollution regulations, and a dozen other states follow its lead. If the Trump administration loosens federal pollution rules, California has vowed to stick with its own stricter standards and to sue the administration.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.That fight could, in effect, split the American car market in two, with one set of regulations for the federal government and a different set of regulations for California and the other states that follow its standard. That would set up a legal battle that would quite likely reach the Supreme Court.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt appeared to relish the political prospect of a legal fight with California. Mr. Pruitt, who shared Mr. Trump\u2019s antipathy for government regulations, was prepared to sign off on the proposal despite the concerns of his staff about its legal vulnerability, according to people familiar with the negotiations.But since Mr. Wheeler stepped in, he has raised concerns about the legality of the proposal as it is written, according to at least four people familiar with the matter. Privately, even some auto executives have also asked Mr. Trump to pull back from such an aggressive rollback, fearing that the lawsuits it will create could lead to years of regulatory uncertainty.Mr. Rosen, a lawyer whose former clients have included General Motors and Hyundai, served as general counsel for the Transportation Department during the George W. Bush administration, where he was known as an opponent of efforts to combat climate change and regulate auto pollution. The plan would strip away regulations that he has fought for years.\u201cThe thinking is, whatever they do to relax the standards, California will sue,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who led the Trump administration\u2019s E.P.A. transition team. \u201cSo why not go for the whole thing?\u201dJody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard and a former adviser to President Barack Obama, noted that previous efforts to pre-empt such state-level authority have failed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a state-level waiver being revoked, and it\u2019s not clear how that would work,\u201d Ms. Freeman said.Once the rule is made public, the E.P.A. and Transportation Department will take public comments before revising it and publishing a final rule this year. People who have spoken with Mr. Wheeler say they expect to see his more cautious approach reflected in a final rule that is less radical but more legally defensible.And they note that even as on Thursday Mr. Wheeler walked back Mr. Pruitt\u2019s move not to enforce pollution rules for \u201cglider\u201d trucks, he also wrote a memo saying that he intended to revisit the policy.\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, I\u2019m abandoning this whole effort,\u201d Professor Revesz said. \u201cThe last sentence of his memo is essentially saying, \u2018We\u2019ll still proceed full steam ahead.\u2019 He\u2019s just going to find a way to proceed more cautiously. His style is different, but ultimately he\u2019s pursuing the same aim.\u201dFollow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paris Beckons as a Fare War Turns Europe Into a Bargain", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byForget Yellowstone. Right now, you can buy a ticket to travel from New York to Paris in August \u2014 on a major American airline \u2014 for under $500.Low prices on routes across the Atlantic are coming as budget carriers, Norwegian Air and Wow Air of Iceland in particular, increase routes in hopes of capturing summer travelers. Whether these low fares will last, especially if oil prices continue to climb, is uncertain.\u201cWhat used to be four-digit airfares in peak summer are now three digits,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant. Mr. Mann describes the situation as \u201cquite unusual,\u201d suggesting travelers take advantage while they can.Low-cost competition is not a new phenomena, even on long international flights. Norwegian has been flying from the United States to Europe since 2013. But trans-Atlantic capacity, in particular from smaller cities, is growing. Last week, the airline announced a new flight to London from Tampa, adding to the more than 60 routes it flies from the United States. It has added eight routes this year, and has announced plans for three more.Wow began service to the U.S. in 2015 and currently flies from 13 cities to Reykjavik, with connections to other destinations from there.Customers buying the cheaper tickets, and accepting limits on carry-on baggage or in-flight food, were never likely to pay for a premium ticket, analysts say.\u201cAirlines have seen there is a price-sensitive part of the market that can be best served by no-frills point-to-point service,\u201d said Brian Pearce, the chief economist for the airlines\u2019 trade group, the International Air Transport Association.As they tap into new markets with the added routes, the no-frills airlines are also sharply undercutting major carriers, said Mr. Mann. \u201cNorwegian, in particular, they\u2019re pricing at $50 to other people\u2019s $100,\u201d he said.The \u201cother people\u201d in this case \u2014 American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines \u2014 would not comment for this article, but they are offering low trans-Atlantic fares as well. For travelers willing to layover in Pittsburgh, a round-trip ticket from New York to Paris on Delta could be had for under $500, as of Monday.Part of the reason for the cheap airfares are new, more fuel-efficient planes like the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo, Mr. Pearce said.\u201cThis is partly technology-driven,\u201d he said. But airlines like Norwegian also keep their prices low by selling airfare-only tickets and charging more for bags and other onboard services.\u201cWe\u2019ve debundled the fare so passengers are able to choose if they want to have the luggage, assigned seats, et cetera,\u201d said Thomas Ramdahl, the airline\u2019s chief commercial officer. \u201cThe freedom to choose is important to us, but we are in the game to make money as well, so we are not giving away tickets.\u201dHe also said that the lower fares actually helped the airline save money on advertising.\u201cThe lowest prices are a tool for marketing,\u201d Mr. Ramdahl said. \u201cInstead of using tons of money on big campaigns, we can use the fares as a campaign instead.\u201d The low prices also mean the airline is less likely to have empty seats on its flights.But if oil prices continue to rise, Mr. Mann said, long-haul low-cost airlines like Norwegian could be caught in a financial bind and struggle to keep their fares so low. Other larger airlines will certainly be affected, too, but may be more resilient to short-term rises in the price of oil, partly because they have more passengers willing to pay higher fares.Mr. Pearce estimated that the larger airlines made 60 percent of their revenue from premium cabin customers on North Atlantic routes in 2017. Those margins also mean that legacy airlines are better able to compete with low-cost airlines for budget-conscious international travelers, because their larger premium cabins can help subsidize the lower fares.Nonetheless, when Norwegian enters a new market, Mr. Ramdahl said, other airlines usually lower their fares.It is one reason you could fly round-trip from New York to Key West, Fla., next month for about $300. Or for just a little bit more, you could visit Paris instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Inflation Could Reach One Million Percent by Year\u2019s End", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 The prediction was eye-popping even for Venezuela\u2019s collapsing economy: One million percent inflation by year\u2019s end, according to the International Monetary Fund.But it is Venezuela that continues to chart a different course from neighbors \u2014 with an increasingly breakneck economic disintegration.Real gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced in the economy and adjusted for inflation, is expected to fall by 18 percent in 2018, the third consecutive year of double-digit declines, the fund estimated.And then there is the million-percent inflation.\u201cWe are projecting a surge in inflation to 1,000,000 percent by end-2018 to signal that the situation in Venezuela is similar to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000\u2019s,\u201d the fund stated in its report.With Venezuela\u2019s government not releasing official figures, the fund\u2019s prediction gave a concrete number to a situation that the country has felt with increasing urgency this year.The inflation crisis comes on top of deep political repression led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was declared the winner of a vote this year that will extend his term until 2025. Lack of basic food and medicine has forced hundreds of thousands to flee the country. The authorities in neighboring Colombia said last week that 870,000 Venezuelans were now in the country.In its report, the monetary fund blamed drops in oil production and \u201clarge macroeconomic imbalances\u201d for the country\u2019s financial problems. It painted a grim picture for the months ahead, predicting that government officials would run fiscal deficits paid for by printing more money, \u201cwhich will continue to fuel an acceleration of inflation.\u201dFor its part, Venezuela\u2019s government says the woes are a result of an \u201ceconomic war\u201d waged on it by the United States and wealthy businessmen hoarding supplies and raising prices.While the million-percent figure may be largely symbolic, the fund\u2019s prediction that the country would soon mirror some of history\u2019s worst episodes of inflation caught the attention of analysts.\u201cAt this point, the Titanic is at a 270 degree angle from where it should be,\u201dsaid Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, an economist at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.The period after World War I ruined the economy of the German Weimar Republic. Before the war, the dollar was worth 4.2 marks; by 1923, a dollar cost 4.2 trillion marks. Germany eventually replaced its currency and stabilized it, but millions were financially ruined.Zimbabwe faced a similar fate under Robert Mugabe after land confiscations and strongman rule precipitated a financial collapse. At one point the country printed a note worth 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. The country eventually scrapped its currency as well.But Mr. Lansberg-Rodriguez said Venezuela might be less successful in fixing its currency issues because of a history of botched attempts to replace the bol\u00edvar. He added that Zimbabwe was in a better position to recover because it had a more diversified economy than Venezuela\u2019s.\u201cThe level of chaos in Venezuela makes it that much more difficult to restore confidence and break out of this cycle,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fact-Checking Pompeo on Iran", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySupporters called his speech, delivered to an Iranian-American audience this past Sunday, a dose of realism that laid bare what they regard as the brazen corruption and hypocrisy of Tehran\u2019s religious hierarchy. Critics called the speech a prelude to attempted regime change by the United States \u2014 and perhaps armed conflict with Iran.Obscured in the debate was how much of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech was accurate, and whether in some instances \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 he may have exaggerated, omitted facts or mixed facts with conjecture. In at least one instance, Mr. Pompeo spoke inaccurately. A look at some of his key assertions:WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cEconomically, we see how the regime\u2019s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long-term economic tailspin. During the time of the nuclear deal, Iran\u2019s increased oil revenues could have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people. Instead they went to terrorists, dictators, and proxy militias. Today, thanks to regime subsidies, the average Hezbollah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter makes on the streets of Iran. Regime mismanagement has led to the rial plummeting in value. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed, and a third of Iranians now live below the poverty line.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and conjecture.Iran used at least some earnings from oil, including money impounded by sanctions but released when the nuclear deal took effect in 2016, to fill deficiencies in its budget. Iran also spent enormous sums to attract investment, buy and refurbish airplanes and ships, and provide financing to stimulate the economy. The decline in the rial, the national currency, has been attributed by economists not only to mismanagement but to the negative impact of President Trump\u2019s decision to renounce the nuclear agreement in May and restore the sanctions.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s basis for the wage comparison of Hezbollah fighters and Iranian firefighters is unclear.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cThe bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for opportunity. The Iranian economy is going great \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a politically-connected member of the elite. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and omission. Mr. Pompeo was correct that corruption in Iran\u2019s government is pervasive, a fact that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has acknowledged. Mr. Pompeo was also correct in describing the popular anger that erupted over the leaked paystubs \u2014 but did not mention that some officials had leaked the information and that Mr. Rouhani ordered an investigation into the pay, which entangled associates that included his own brother.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cTake Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary. He is worth at least $300 million dollars. He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank account. The Trump administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human rights abuses, because we aren\u2019t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level. Call me crazy \u2014 you won\u2019t be the first \u2014 but I\u2019m a little skeptical that a thieving thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran\u2019s highest-ranking judicial official.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and conjectureThe basis for Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertions about Mr. Larijani\u2019s supposed wealth and how he obtained it is unclear. But human rights activists corroborate Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that Mr. Larijani is complicit in rights violations. \u201cAs head of the judiciary he is certainly a leading human rights abuser,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cFormer I.R.G.C. officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed \u2018the Billionaire General.\u2019 He went from being a poor I.R.G.C. officer at the end of the Iran-Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars. How\u2019d that happen? He somehow had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from businesses associated with the I.R.G.C. Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well.\u201dTHE FACTSTrue, rights advocates say.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cAnd not many people know this, but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, worth $95 billion, with a B. That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a slush fund for the I.R.G.C. The ayatollah fills his coffers by devouring whatever he wants. In 2013 the Setad\u2019s agents banished an 82-year-old Baha\u2019i woman from her apartment and confiscated the property after a long campaign of harassment. Seizing land from religious minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming. All of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei.\u201dTHE FACTSTrue, according to a Reuters investigation.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cJust earlier this month, an Iranian \u2018diplomat\u2019 based in Vienna was arrested and charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a political rally in France. This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they\u2019re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they\u2019re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe.\u201dTHE FACTSFact, conjecture and omission.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cIn response to myriad government failures, corruption, and disrespect of rights, since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and forceful protests since 1979. Some shout the slogan, \u201cThe people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.\u201d Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. The specific grievances do differ, but all those voicing dissatisfaction share one thing: They have been ill-treated by a revolutionary regime. Iranians want to be governed with dignity, accountability, and respect.\u201dTHE FACTSMostly true but one inaccuracy.The protests pale in comparison to the enormous demonstrations and rallies that followed Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s suspiciously lopsided victory in the 2009 election. Millions of Iranians demanded a recount for their candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who was considered far more moderate than Mr. Ahmadinejad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imran Khan, as New Leader, Could Help Pakistan Reshape Its Image", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 For a nation often in the news for all the wrong reasons \u2014 suicide bombings, horrific school massacres \u2014 Pakistan has reached a turning point that could possibly alter its dysfunctional trajectory.Imran Khan, the cricket star and A-list celebrity whose political party won this past week\u2019s elections, could use his fame and charisma to reset Pakistan\u2019s troubled relations with the West.Mr. Khan also may move Pakistan much closer to the expanding sphere of China, a neighbor he has praised conspicuously as a role model.Or Mr. Khan could simply follow the same path as many Pakistani leaders before him, supporting harsh Islamic laws and showing sympathy for militant groups, policies that have kept Pakistan isolated for years.Still, Mr. Khan brings something new: more star power and mystique than any recent Pakistani leader and perhaps a better chance to change the country\u2019s narrative, even though the election was widely considered tainted.\u201cHe\u2019s dangerously accommodating of extremists, and anyone who knows him knows this,\u201d said C. Christine Fair, a political scientist at Georgetown University.The dust has hardly settled from the election, which was marred by allegations of rigging and copious evidence that Pakistan\u2019s military interfered to help Mr. Khan win. Mr. Khan\u2019s party trounced the others, but as of Sunday remained short of a majority in Parliament.To become prime minister, he needs to win over independent candidates and smaller parties to build a coalition. Most analysts believe he will succeed, although it is not a sure thing.In many ways, Pakistan is a pivotal nation. It is the world\u2019s sixth-most populous country, with 200 million people. It is also nuclear-armed and strategically located next to India, China, Iran and Afghanistan.For decades it has been cast in turmoil by suicide bombers, extremist groups and a nefarious spy agency that helped create the Taliban and actively supported Al Qaeda while ostensibly serving as an ally to the United States.But many parts of the country are safer today than they were a few years ago. New malls, new schools and new Dunkin\u2019 Donuts outlets are going up. And now Pakistan is poised to get a new global salesman.It is widely expected that if Mr. Khan, 65, becomes prime minister, there will be an initial fascination with him as he tours the world. Most likely, he\u2019ll visit foreign capitals and business titans, seeking help to solve Pakistan\u2019s dire debt crisis and bring in investors. He also seems to have China in mind.In an address to the nation last week, Mr. Khan mentioned China no fewer than seven times, praising it for lifting millions out of poverty and for fighting corruption. \u201cGod willing,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll learn that from China.\u201dBut assuming Mr. Khan finally gets the prime minister job, he will be entering the inner sanctum with the whiff of scandal.By all accounts his election victory was far from fair. Human rights groups, academics, Western diplomats and political analysts have said that Pakistan\u2019s army and security services, often referred to here obliquely as \u201cthe Establishment,\u201d systematically targeted Mr. Khan\u2019s political rivals in the months before the election, helping him win. But the Establishment chiefs may now be kicking themselves for doing a job too well.But installing Mr. Khan, analysts say, was not the Establishment\u2019s primary goal. Pakistan\u2019s military has directly ruled for much of its history and meddled during the rest. What the military bosses really wanted this time, analysts say, was a weak civilian government, with the veneer of a democracy. They were so heavy-handed in their tactics they ended up getting neither.On Election Day, Mr. Khan\u2019s rivals say, soldiers guarding the polls restricted access to ballot counting rooms, raising suspicions of more foul play.With the competition so thoroughly eviscerated and Mr. Khan genuinely popular, especially among the youth, he now would surge into office with a strong national following. According to the latest updated results released this weekend, his party won nearly four million more votes than its nearest competitor, the P.M.L.-N. Mr. Khan\u2019s party commands a huge lead in the National Assembly with more than 100 seats, compared with P.M.L.-N. at around 64; it also performed well in provincial assemblies.What this all means is that Mr. Khan, whose success seems partly a creation of the military, might not be so easy to control.Conflict with the Establishment, Mr. Weinbaum said, is \u201calmost inevitable.\u201dMr. Khan\u2019s erratic personality is a further complication. He is known for running a team of one, making impulsive decisions, contradicting himself and then using his enormous reserves of self-confidence and charisma to dig himself out.Take his views on religion. He has said that he wants to reform the madrasa system in which countless young Pakistani boys have been brainwashed in Quranic schools to fight for extremist groups. At the same time, Mr. Khan has supported Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws and teamed up with hard-line religious groups that a few years ago rioted in Islamabad, the capital.His sprawling villa on Islamabad\u2019s outskirts, where he spends much of his time, symbolizes his guarded nature. The enormous compound, occupying a craggy hilltop, is tucked behind high walls. At night, you can see thousands of lights from Islamabad twinkling in the distance far below. Even though he\u2019s still officially only one of hundreds of members of Parliament, several dozen police officers this weekend blocked the roads leading to his house and stood in clumps at his gates as if he were already prime minister.To Western governments, Mr. Khan\u2019s idiosyncrasies may not even matter that much. Analysts say there are only two issues the West really cares about in Pakistan: militant groups and nuclear arms. Mr. Khan will not have much say in either. The military and intelligence establishment handles both.Economists say the steps the next prime minister must take are obvious but painful. The national budget (including the military\u2019s) needs to be cut, Pakistanis must pay more for energy, old state-run businesses need to be privatized and taxes \u2014 many more taxes \u2014 need to be collected.The third-place party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, has been coy about whether it will join Mr. Khan\u2019s side or oppose him. If it did join, that would easily push Mr. Khan\u2019s coalition into the majority.Most Pakistanis, even those who did not vote for Mr. Khan, believe he will be the next prime minister. Expectations are soaring that he will be able to change his country\u2019s image.\u201cEverybody thinks of Pakistan as a terrorist world,\u201d said a 16-year-old girl named Mahnoor, who was sitting in the food court of a fancy new mall this week, eating McDonald\u2019s French fries. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dNaveed Majeed, a rice exporter, said foreigners would listen to Mr. Khan because he brings something of an aura.\u201cAnd I want him to tell the world we\u2019re not all terrorists,\u201d Mr. Majeed said.It\u2019s clearly a sensitive subject; many Pakistanis ache for a new story for their country.Mr. Khan would not be the first Pakistani prime minister with a westernized history. Benazir Bhutto, killed in a suicide bombing in 2007, was elegant, beautiful and a bit of a global fascination as well. She also spent years in England (and the United States). But she failed to radically transform the way most outsiders viewed her homeland.Part of the reason, said Anatol Lieven, a senior researcher at the New America Foundation, was that Westerners initially saw Ms. Bhutto through a narrow lens as a British-educated upper-class liberal woman.\u201cThey missed everything else about her family, the nature of politics in Pakistan,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are part of systems.\u201dSalman Masood contributed from Islamabad.

{"Headline": "Trade War With China in Aisle 12", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The administration\u2019s trade fight with China may soon be fought in the aisles of Walmart, Best Buy, REI and Costco.Economists say that expansion will drive inflation higher and erode Americans\u2019 purchasing power, potentially hurting economic growth. Inflation is already rising, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, driven largely by energy prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent in June from a year ago, its highest rate of the last six years.The rate is lower \u2014 2.3 percent \u2014 for core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. Home furnishing prices have barely risen at all over the last year, and prices for information technology hardware and services have fallen by 2.3 percent in that time.But retail groups say a prolonged trade war could accelerate price increases on a wide range of consumer goods, giving Americans sticker shock on some of their favorite items.\u201cYou keep adding tariffs upon tariffs,\u201d said Alex Boian, vice president for government affairs at the Outdoor Industry Association, whose members include such recreation titans as North Face and Patagonia, \u201cand it really is difficult to see a way that this does not hit retail prices.\u201dThe latest tariff list includes several mainstay products of the outdoor industry, such as travel bags, backpacks and the knit fabric used in fleece vests. It also includes dog collars, sledgehammers, saw blades, baseball mitts, ski gloves, toilet paper, art supplies, ceramic tiles, windshield glass and antiques that are more than 100 years old.There are also seemingly random \u2014 and likely not household \u2014 products on the list, like bovine semen and horsehair.More than 1,000 of the 6,000 items on the list are chemicals, according to an analysis by Panjiva. Nearly 1,000 more are food products, including vegetables like cabbage, kale, carrots and beets and hundreds of types of fish. Many of those fish, such as Alaskan pollock, are caught elsewhere and processed in China.In dollar terms, the items most likely to rattle American consumers are computers and couches. The Panjiva analysis shows that $50 billion worth of goods subject to tariffs are electronics, including $17.4 billion in PC components and $5.2 billion in desktop computers. Nearly $30 billion worth of the products are furniture. In addition, the administration will soon begin imposing 25 percent tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of semiconductors, potentially driving up computer prices even more.Buying a new PC or sofa is a major purchase for most Americans, and a 10 percent tariff could force many consumers to seek out cheaper brands or delay the purchase. It seems unlikely that stores will absorb the import taxes by accepting lower profit margins. But American consumers might not have much choice but to pay them: For nearly $100 billion of the products targeted, Panjiva estimates, China supplies more than half of the imports that Americans buy.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.As the tariffs expand to cover roughly half of all Chinese goods exported to the United States, consumers will start seeing price increases on store shelves, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt is possible that they can scoot around some of the effect on consumers, but it gets increasingly difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also gets further and further away from the stated rationale of the tariffs, which is to hit high-tech products.\u201dThe National Retail Federation said in a statement on Tuesday that the threat posed by tariffs to the American economy \u201cis less about a question of \u2018if\u2019 and more about \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018how bad.\u2019\u201dThe trade group said that the sheer scope of the tariffs \u201cmake it inconceivable that American consumers will dodge this tax increase as prices of everyday products will be forced to rise.\u201dEconomists warn that a batch of similar price spikes could complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to maintain a gradual pace of interest rate increases, by juicing inflation more than economists had expected. Rising prices would cut into Americans\u2019 purchasing power, which has remained an engine of growth in the recovery from the great recession.\u201cTariffs are just a real income hit to consumers,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that these tariffs will dampen growth.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the shellfish piled up at a fish market in Beijing.

The shared secret of Lamb\u2019s and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s success is that they ran energetic campaigns, reflected the values of the people they sought to represent, and faced lackluster or entitled opponents.Still, it should be said: \u201cDemocratic socialism\u201d is awful as a slogan and catastrophic as a policy. And \u201csocial democracy\u201d \u2014 a term that better fits the belief of more ordinary liberals who want, say, Medicare for all \u2014 is a politically dying force. Democrats who aren\u2019t yet sick of all their losing should feel free to embrace them both.Start with democratic socialism. The Democratic Socialists of America, of which Ocasio-Cortez is a member, believe in economies defined by state-owned enterprises and worker-owned cooperatives. Versions of this have been tried to varying degrees before: Israel in its first decades; post-independence India; Sweden in the 1960s and \u201970s.People used to know this stuff. That someone like Ocasio-Cortez apparently doesn\u2019t is a fresh reminder that, in politics as in life, the most obvious lessons are the ones you can least afford to stop teaching.What about social democracy? Isn\u2019t it the norm in Europe, and isn\u2019t it working pretty well? You wouldn\u2019t know it by the way Europeans are voting. France\u2019s Socialists ran a left-wing candidate in last year\u2019s presidential election, and crawled away with barely 6 percent of the vote. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats had their worst electoral result since 1933. Italy\u2019s center-left was trounced by a combination of populists and right-wingers in March.You can argue that the major goals of social democracy \u2014 universal health care and other social provisions \u2014 were achieved long ago in Europe. But they aren\u2019t so fully realized, and are thus potentially popular, in America, never mind our own robust welfare state.But that misses the deeper point. Today\u2019s social democracy falls apart on the contradiction between advocating nearly unlimited government largess and nearly unlimited immigration. \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d is a proper rallying cry for hard-core libertarians and Davos globalists, not democratic socialists or social democrats. A federal job guarantee is an intriguing idea \u2014 assuming the jobs are for some defined \u201cus\u201d that doesn\u2019t include every immigrant, asylum-seeker or undocumented worker.Trump gets this, as does the far right in Europe, which is why they attract such powerful working-class support. Want to preserve the welfare state? Build a wall \u2014 or, in Europe\u2019s case, reinstate border controls. Want more immigrants and amnesty? Lower the minimum wage and abolish the closed shop.But please choose. It\u2019s one or the other.It\u2019s possible Democrats will surrender to the illusion that they can have both, puffing the sails of Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow travelers. But a Democratic Party seriously interested in defeating congressional Republicans in the fall and Trump in 2020 isn\u2019t going to win by turning itself into a right-wing caricature of the left, complete with a smug embrace of whatever it conceives to be \u201csocialism.\u201dIf Trump is the new Nixon, the right way to oppose him isn\u2019t to summon the ghost of George McGovern. Try some version of Bill Clinton (minus the grossness) for a change: working-class affect, middle-class politics, upper-class aspirations.The center is Dayton and Denver, not Berkeley and Burlington. The center is Harry Truman and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, not Eugene Debs and Michael Harrington. Democrats who want to win should know this. \u2610Gail Collins is on book leave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Promised More Oil. So Why Are Prices Rising?", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When major oil producers last met in Vienna, they said they would curb rising prices by ramping up production. Why, then, are oil prices still going up?Yet prices have remained stubbornly high. The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, has risen more than 20 percent so far this year, to around $78 a barrel.Here are some of the factors pushing prices higher.Saudi Arabia is under pressure to quickly increase its production of oil, but those increases may not be enough to offset declines in three countries grappling with crises: Iran, Libya and Venezuela.At present, Iran exports around two million barrels of oil a day, equivalent to about 2 percent of global supply. But the United States wants to drastically curb Tehran\u2019s ability to sell its natural resources, eating into any additional supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia or elsewhere.\u201cThe administration is posturing, to a certain extent, with this hard-line position,\u201d said Andrew Keller, a former state department sanctions expert who is now a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells.Still, analysts have been increasing their estimates of how far Iranian crude exports are likely to fall, from a few hundred thousand barrels a day to around a million. A loss in the upper end of that range would wipe out much of the added supply that oil producers had promised in Vienna.That looming outage is far from the only potential disruption weighing on the oil markets.\u201cIt is almost turning into a geopolitical perfect storm for the oil markets,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank. It will be tough for Saudi Arabia, she added, \u201cto bridge the gap caused by Venezuela, Iran and now Libya.\u201dOil is not in short supply \u2014 for now.Long-running production cuts by OPEC and Russia have drained once-brimming storage tanks to more normal levels. That means that any threats to output have a bigger effect on oil prices.With the world economy growing and demand for energy on the rise, \u201cprices can skyrocket well past $100 a barrel,\u201d unless supplies are quickly found to meet any potential outages, analysts at the oil and gas consultancy FGE wrote in a note to clients.Saudi Arabia is already preparing to replace the falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere \u2014 Saudi exports increased substantially in June, while storage levels also rose, according to analysts at Kayrros, a Paris-based firm that monitors oil industry activity using satellite data. Russia is increasing its own exports.But there is skepticism as to how much either country can do, and for how long. Riyadh claims to have two million barrels a day of spare production capacity, but analysts say the kingdom can realistically add only about one million barrels to its daily output without additional drilling.Most forecasters agree that a substantial global buffer now exists, but that it could be stretched in the future. Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy, estimates global spare capacity to be 2.5 million barrels a day of additional production, most of it in OPEC.Threats to production in Iran, Libya and Venezuela eat into that potential, and Nigeria\u2019s supplies are also vulnerable to strikes by workers and other issues. The oil market\u2019s increased dependency on crude exports from the United States poses its own risks, because Gulf Coast ports can be shut down by hurricanes in the summer and the fall.On top of all these factors, oil markets are also becoming increasingly politicized, potentially adding to volatility.Mr. Trump has, for example, been unusually vocal for an American president in trying to push gasoline prices down by asking King Salman of Saudi Arabia to increase production.But analysts say Iran\u2019s reaction to renewed United States sanctions could affect the market\u2019s dynamics even more. If the country\u2019s oil exports sink below one million barrels a day, the situation could \u201cget really dangerous,\u201d said Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie.Iranian officials have been vocal about the dangers. In a telephone interview from Tehran, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, a high-ranking Iranian oil official, warned that prices could rise to $100 a barrel, or even $140 a barrel, unless tensions were cooled down. \u201cYou better keep the market away from politics,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Hosting a controversial convention, they said, would signal the city\u2019s commitment to free speech at a caustic moment.\u201cCities need to stand up for our democratic process, and I\u2019m proud that Charlotte is standing up for the democratic process,\u201d former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who was also mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, said in an interview this week.Controversial gatherings, he suggested, were part of evolving into a major metropolitan area.\u201cEvery politician should support the conventions coming, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to like the convention that\u2019s coming,\u201d he said.Democrats have not yet settled on their convention site but have winnowed their options to Houston, Miami Beach and Milwaukee.

{"Headline": "How Trump Could Be Like Reagan", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moore and Mr. Laffer are informal economic advisers to President Trump. Mr. Forbes is chairman of Forbes Media.We were particularly heartened that Mr. Trump and the Europeans now have a handshake agreement to aim for zero tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.This is a winning strategy that we\u2019ve long endorsed with our friends at the White House because it is fully consistent with what Mr. Trump has often told us: his threat of tariffs is a negotiating tactic to get to lower trade barriers and a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dThe next step should be to extend this zero tariff offer to other key allies, including Britain, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.The alternative is higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and hundreds of products imported from other countries, particularly China. Those actions have led to retaliatory tariffs imposed on products grown or manufactured in America. This has hurt farmers, the stock market and economic growth. What Mr. Trump has proposed to our trading partners is similar: the United States will abolish all its tariffs, subsidies and other trade restraints on their exports if they do the same for American exports. This solution would be the economic equivalent to total trade disarmament. A no-tariffs trade strategy would also allow the United States to seize the moral high ground in the debate. Mr. Trump would be transformed from the evil disrupter of international commerce to a potential savior \u2014 just as 30 years ago Mr. Reagan\u2019s international image changed from superhawk to peacemaker almost overnight. \u200eFinally, if Mr. Trump can secure zero tariff deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, this will put America in a much stronger position as he negotiates with China. It greatly increases the odds that Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line stance with China will deliver long overdue concessions from Beijing that could enhance American economic and national security while averting a brutal escalation in the trade war that could hurt both our economies. Some of our friends in the administration question whether this policy would work because in China and other countries, nontariff barriers are the biggest deterrents to American exports. We agree that nontariff trade restraints \u2014 such as foreign companies stealing our patents with impunity, subsidies to state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation \u2014 are a problem. But reducing tariffs creates momentum for tearing down other trade restraints. We know lowering tariffs will be an uphill battle. Freer trade has always been an elusive pursuit because vested interests on both sides of the Atlantic, whether farmers or manufacturers, will fight to maintain tariffs that benefit their products. We can\u2019t predict how other nations would respond to this idea. But the European Union negotiations last week should provide Mr. Trump a clear signal that he can\u2019t win just by swinging the stick of higher tariffs. He also needs to offer the carrots of lower barriers. By putting zero tariffs on the table, Mr. Trump will also be able to determine which nations are genuinely committed to freer trade and which prefer to keep their protectionist barriers in place. We\u2019ve often reminded politicians that free trade is a pillar of prosperity and a win-win for trading partners. Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this policy, he could build a legacy as the president who expanded world commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economy Hits a High Note, and Trump Takes a Bow", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax cuts and federal spending are adding fuel to the already strong economy, putting the United States on a pace for its best year of growth in well over a decade.\u201cOnce again, we are the economic envy of the entire world,\u201d Mr. Trump declared outside the South Portico of the White House, flanked by his top economic advisers.Economists caution that the latest acceleration, while good news for American businesses and households in the short term, is unsustainable in the long term and could raise the risk that the recovery will flame out in the years ahead.The quarter\u2019s figures were pumped up by a range of one-time factors that are unlikely to recur. Most forecasters expect growth to cool in the second half of the year \u2014 even without factoring in the possibility of a trade war, which corporate executives in recent weeks have cited as a source of uncertainty that could force them to pare hiring and investment plans.But there is little question that this spring was a high point in the rebound from the recession that struck a decade ago.The unemployment rate, which topped out at 10 percent, has fallen to 4 percent. Job growth is on a record streak. American factories, an emphasis for Mr. Trump, are hiring at their fastest rate in two decades. And the second quarter\u2019s performance \u2014 the best quarterly showing since 2014 \u2014 was equaled or exceeded in just four quarters during the eight years of the Obama administration.\u201cThe bottom line is that the economy is doing better,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.At Grote Company, a manufacturer of food-processing equipment in Columbus, Ohio, business is \u201crecord fantastic,\u201d according to Bob Grote, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cEverybody I talk to is literally having banner years the past few years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any end in sight right now.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more on capital equipment this year than we probably have in the last five combined,\u201d Mr. Grote said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see the benefits of it a lot sooner.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly the kind of investment that the tax law was meant to encourage. So far, however, there is scant evidence that companies broadly are reinvesting their tax savings. Business investment in equipment has grown more slowly in the first half of the year, and many companies are choosing to pay dividends and buy back shares instead.\u201cBusiness spending is not picking up the way proponents of the tax cut had hoped,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays.Instead, the tax cuts seem to be encouraging consumer spending, which rose 4 percent in the spring quarter, the biggest increase since 2014. Increased federal spending \u2014 the result of the two-year budget deal passed by Congress this year \u2014 is likewise giving the economy a lift, helping to nudge G.D.P. growth out of the rut of 2 to 2.5 percent where it has spent much of the recovery.\u201cIt\u2019s economic conventional wisdom that in times like this you should prepare for the future and get your fiscal house in order, and we\u2019re really doing the opposite,\u201d said Michael A. Peterson, chairman of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which has long argued for reducing the federal deficit.For policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the tax cuts and spending increases could pose a nearer-term challenge. The Fed has been trying to strike a delicate balance, raising interest rates gradually in an effort to keep inflation in check without snuffing out the recovery. If the second quarter\u2019s growth rate continues, it could risk accelerating inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly. That, in turn, could cause a recession.There is little to suggest that will happen, however. Inflation slowed slightly in the second quarter, and Friday\u2019s report is unlikely to persuade officials to deviate from their gradual and carefully devised march to higher interest rates. The central bank is on track to raise rates twice more this year, after two increases in the first half of the year.The more immediate risk may be the possibility of a trade war. Mr. Trump has placed tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China, the European Union and other countries. Trading partners have responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs, and both sides have threatened more.\u201cYou\u2019re hearing some notes of caution, but nothing specific regarding pullbacks,\u201d said Bill Warlick, an analyst for Fitch, the ratings agency. Big companies, he said, make big investment decisions years in advance and will be slow to change course.In the short term, trade tensions may be contributing to growth by prompting foreign buyers to stock up on American products before their governments impose retaliatory tariffs. Soybean exports, in particular, have surged, rising more than 50 percent in May from a year earlier.Over all, exports rose at a 9.3 percent rate in the second quarter, accounting for a quarter of the total G.D.P. growth. But the trend is unlikely to last: Exports will almost certainly slump in the third and fourth quarters, and will turn into a drag on overall G.D.P. growth.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to overexaggerate the strength of the economy given the real risks that are being put in place by the policy choices,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the accounting firm RSM U.S.That said, he added, \u201cit\u2019s undeniable things are better economically.\u201dMark Landler and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Already, there are accusations of threats, intimidation and vote tampering. Last month, a grenade tore through a rally, narrowly missing Mr. Mnangagwa, killing two of his aides and injuring several others. Who set off the grenade is unknown, but suspicion has fallen on members of a rival faction in the governing party, ZANU-PF.\u201cMnangagwa doesn\u2019t represent the interests of the black majority here,\u201d said Stanley Hungwe, 32, who studied sociology at the University of Zimbabwe and is one of many jobless college graduates. \u201cLook at how he has projected himself as a darling of the Western countries whose interests he represents, instead of our own interests.\u201dTerrence Chiwawa, 46, a schoolteacher waiting to withdraw money from a bank in Harare recently, complained about a chronic currency shortage.\u201cManangagwa has kept on claiming that Zimbabwe is now open for business, and even claims that he has brokered investment deals that he has signed since he came to power, but we can\u2019t see any change in reality,\u201d Mr. Chiwawa said.Kipson Gundani, a leading economist, said the economy was unlikely to revive without electoral stability. \u201cWhat has worsened in Zimbabwe is the government\u2019s appetite to spend money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe appetite to invest in Zimbabwe has also increased, but investors are looking to what will happen in the elections.\u201dWhether the markets will be reassured remains in doubt. Mr. Mnangagwa has agreed to allow international election observers into the country to observe the polls, but the opposition alliance, dominated by the Movement for Democratic Change, remains unconvinced. There are fears of a repeat of the 2008 election, in which Mr. Tsvangirai placed first, garnering just under half the votes and triggering a runoff. After a wave of violence, Mr. Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff.ZANU-PF consolidated power over decades, giving Zimbabwe the trappings of a Soviet-style one-party state that might long outlast Mr. Mugabe, now 94.\u201cVillagers are being intimidated with the use of the biometric voter registration technology, which is the tool that was used to compile the voters roll to be used in the 2018 elections,\u201d she said. \u201cCitizens are being told that the B.V.R. is actually a surveillance tool which can smoke out those who vote against the ruling party.\u201dSo far, international observers say they believed the country\u2019s elections commission was committed to a fair and free vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big job, and it\u2019s a difficult job, but they say they are ready and they are moving toward the printing of ballot papers very shortly, and the recruitment and training of staff,\u201d said Mark Stevens, deputy chief of the European Union\u2019s election observer mission, which is expected to deploy 140 observers from the bloc\u2019s 28 countries.But two American organizations, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, have raised concerns about interference.\u201cWe have heard reports of a military presence in Zimbabwe\u2019s rural areas from different stakeholders, and we have asked our long-term observers to examine these claims during the next few weeks,\u201d said Larry Garber, co-director of the organizations\u2019 Zimbabwe International Election Observer Mission.A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Defense Forces, Overson Mugwisi, said the military had \u201cno direct role\u201d in the elections and denied that the military was helping the governing party. \u201cWe are disturbed by false reports through social media alleging that Z.D.F. has been deployed to campaign on behalf of ZANU-PF,\u201d he said.Gift Ostallos Siziba, a political analyst, said that Mr. Mnangagwa was struggling to manage his relationship with the military and with his vice president, Constantino Chiwenga, a retired general and former commander of the armed forces.Several military veterans who were involved in the struggle for independence that led to the establishment of black-majority rule under a newly independent Zimbabwe in 1980 have criticized Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Mnangagwa, saying that they maintained the repressive police state they inherited from a period of white-minority rule that lasted from 1965 to 1979.\u201cThe change that took place when whites left power was in the color of the skin, but the system of militarization of the state remained, which we see even today under Mnangagwa\u2019s government,\u201d said Ngoni Thomas Chitauro, a veterans\u2019 representative.Mlondolozi Ndlovu, an independent political analyst, said he feared that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s divide-and-rule strategy had been effective at sowing divisions within the opposition alliance.ZANU-PF is also divided: A faction associated with Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife, Grace, has been causing trouble for Mr. Mnangagwa, and one member of the faction, Jonathan Moyo, an exiled former minister of higher education, has thrown his support behind Mr. Chamisa.Mr. Chitauro said the divisions within both ZANU-PF and the opposition alliance reflected the embryonic nature of Zimbabwe\u2019s democracy.\u201cThirty-seven years of Mugabe rule made Mugabe, and what he says, goes,\u201d Mr. Chitauro said. \u201cWe need to re-educate ourselves, and have a new thinking.

{"Headline": "Theresa May Secures Cabinet Agreement Over Brexit Plan", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After nearly two years of bitter factionalism within her governing Conservative party over what terms Britain should seek in its divorce from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May summoned her cabinet to her country home on Friday and told her ministers either to support her compromise plan or resign, turn in their government cars and find their own way home.Her threats appeared to work, up to a point. At the end of the day she announced that she had won agreement from her team to back a negotiating position in talks with Brussels that would keep Britain effectively tied to many European Union rules. In doing so, she faced down supporters of making a cleaner break from the bloc, and gave her country its clearest view yet of how she wants to steer Britain into a post-Brexit future.It is not clear that the truce among Conservatives will last, especially since Mrs. May\u2019s negotiating stance is unlikely to be accepted by European Union leaders in anything like its current form. But her victory allows her to move into a more serious round of talks with Brussels in an effort to reach a deal by March, when Britain will leave the bloc whether or not is has come to terms on a new relationship.In the end, her hard-line rivals, like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, decided that this was not the day for a showdown. The meeting ended with a declaration that the cabinet had agreed to seek \u201ca common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products.\u201dIn effect, that means Britain would sign up for Europe\u2019s rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without being able to shape them. Services, like banking and finance \u2014 big component of the British economy \u2014 would be dealt with under a separate framework that would give Britain much more flexibility to set its own regulations.Mrs. May\u2019s plan envisions that Britain would no longer abide by the European demand for free movement of people across borders, a key demand of the most vociferous Brexit supporters and a position sure to draw intense opposition from Brussels. But it foresees allowing goods to flow more or less unimpeded across the border between Ireland, a member of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom \u2014 a position that would go a long way toward solving one of the most intractable problems facing negotiators.The statement said Britain would ensure that \u201cno new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament,\u201d though it acknowledged that failing to incorporate rule changes into British law \u201cwould have consequences\u201d \u2014 presumably ending some access to the bloc\u2019s big market.However, for Mrs. May, pushing her proposals through without the cabinet blowing up was a victory. She appeared to have convinced even the most recalcitrant members that economic necessity dictated hewing closely to some of the European Union\u2019s rules.Mrs. May hopes her plan can provide a basis for negotiations with the bloc\u2019s other 27 member countries, which had grown frustrated over the political paralysis in London.Certainly, Mrs. May\u2019s plan represents a big reality check for proponents of Brexit who once argued that Britain would have the upper hand in withdrawal negotiations, gaining all the benefits of current membership in the single market while still enjoying the freedom to conduct an independent trade policy.That sort of deal was never on offer from Brussels, where officials called it delusional on numerous occasions. A succession of warnings from big manufacturers, including Airbus and BMW, have recently underscored the crucial importance to big importers and exporters of keeping goods flowing easily through ports to and from continental Europe.At the same time, Brexit hard-liners know that adhering to European Union rules would amount to the \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d they have been swearing never to countenance.Even a rash of resignations would not have guaranteed Mrs. May\u2019s departure. If they blocked her new plans, they ran the risk that Parliament might then feel constrained to vote later this month to stay in the European Union\u2019s customs union \u2014 an even more distasteful outcome.Earlier, the cabinet office minister, David Lidington, had confirmed leaks in the British news media that Mrs. May\u2019s proposal would include adherence to a common rule book for some sectors like industrial and agricultural goods in order to keep supply chains open and prevent food spoiling if stopped for frontier checks.\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to,\u201d he told the BBC.One person who will take a lot more persuasion is Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s negotiator, who on Friday said that \u201cin the Brexit negotiations there are still too many questions and too few answers.\u201dThe new plan, scheduled to be published as a white paper next week, will be judged by Mr. Barnier both on practicalities and against the European Union\u2019s red lines.Mrs. May\u2019s preferred customs plan is seen by most officials in Brussels as unworkable. More generally, the European Union has insisted all along that Britain will not gain access to the single market without accepting its core principles like the free movement of people, which Brexiteers abhor.Mrs. May\u2019s plans present other difficulties, for example, by differentiating between manufactured goods \u2014 which would be under Europe\u2019s rule book \u2014 and services, which would have a more distant relationship.Distinguishing between goods and services will become increasingly hard, for example, in the auto market as vehicles, which already sometimes come with loans or insurance deals, become increasingly reliant on digital technology.Other thorny issues include the extent to which British manufacturers would be subject to Europe\u2019s state aid rules (to prevent unfair competition), the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \u2014 another institution loathed by Brexiteers \u2014 and European labor and environmental laws.Friday\u2019s declaration suggested that Britain would accept European antitrust rules but would want to set up new bodies to resolve trade disputes \u201cfounded on the principle that the court of one party cannot resolve disputes between the two.\u201dBrussels has so far insisted that Britain must either opt to stay in the single market fully \u2014 accepting free movement \u2014 or settle for a much more minimalist free trade deal like that with Canada. Mrs. May has always argued for something in between and has, in recent days, visited both the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to try to ensure that her plans are \u2014 if not exactly welcomed then \u2014 at least not dismissed out of hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan, Flush With Victory, Seizes New Powers in Turkey", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours before taking the oath of office \u2014 after 15 years already in power \u2014 Mr. Erdogan published a 143-page decree changing the way almost every government department and public body in the country operates.In the days since, he has issued several equally lengthy decrees and presidential decisions, centralizing power and giving him the ability to exert control in nearly all areas of life with almost unchecked authority.Among the changes Mr. Erdogan has put in place under the new presidential system are these:\u2022 The prime minister\u2019s office has been abolished;\u2022 The military has been brought under firmer civilian control;\u2022 The president will draft the budget and choose judges and many top officials;\u2022 The president can dismiss Parliament and call new elections at will;\u2022 The president appoints the head of the National Intelligence Agency, the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Central Bank, as well as ambassadors, governors and university rectors, among other top bureaucrats;\u2022 Virtually none of the president\u2019s appointments require a confirmation process.The voluminous decrees, analysts say, promise months of administrative upheaval as agencies are abolished and government employees reassigned.Critics have voiced concern at the lack of checks on the president\u2019s increased powers.Many of the changes, analysts point out, merely formalize what was already the case: It is Mr. Erdogan who makes the decisions. But the consolidation of his power is far-reaching.Mr. Erdogan has also amended the counterterrorism law in expectation of lifting the state of emergency, which expires on Thursday and was put in place two years ago after a failed military coup against him.But Mr. Erdogan and his fellow Islamists have long called for a presidential system and for greater civilian control over the military. Turkey\u2019s recent history has been filled with military coups, and the Islamists chafed more than others under military rule.Mr. Erdogan has placed the chief of staff of the armed forces under control of the Defense Ministry, and the Supreme Military Council, which decides senior appointments in the armed forces, has been reconfigured to include more civilian ministers than military commanders.Mr. Erdogan appointed a loyalist, the former chief of staff, Gen. Hulusi Akar, as his first defense minister under the new system. General Akar opposed the 2016 coup \u2014 he was taken prisoner on the night of the failed coup by rogue officers \u2014 and has overseen a comprehensive purge of the armed forces in the two years since.Mr. Erdogan outlined his own powers in one new decree after his inauguration. He will appoint the chief of staff of the armed forces \u2014 along with the commanders of the land, air and naval forces and the deputy chief of staff \u2014 by presidential decision, which needs no confirmation process. The president will also make promotions in the upper ranks of the security forces from colonel upward.Decree 703, issued just before Mr. Erdogan was sworn in to his new term, also removed many of the regulations in the selection process for appointments.For instance, the president will appoint the rectors of Turkey\u2019s public and private universities, without the usual shortlisting procedure by the university and Higher Education Board.\u201cYes, U.S. President Trump can appoint a replacement to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, but he does not appoint a police chief in Massachusetts or a public theater director in Boston,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas commented in Cumhuriyet. \u201cHe cannot appoint a state governor or even a university rector,\u201d she added.The decree also lowers the qualifications for judges appointed to the government\u2019s administrative courts, which regulate government departments. Previously, judges had to hold law or political science degrees, but they can now be drawn from any degree program, as the Justice Ministry sees fit.A presidential circular published in the Official Gazette over the weekend also placed the Central Bank under the responsibility of the ministry.Mr. Erdogan has emphasized that changes are needed to make state institutions more responsive and efficient. But the latest regulations diminish the legal and practical independence of the Central Bank, Umit Akcay, an associate professor of Economics at the Berlin School of Economics and Law, said in emailed comments.Turkish equities and the country\u2019s currency fell in value in the days after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s appointment of a new cabinet that removed two highly regarded officials \u2014 Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Finance Minister Naci Agbal \u2014 and that promoted Mr. Albayrak.Mr. Albayrak addressed the changes at the Central Bank last week in an effort to calm the markets.\u201cThe policy in the new period aims to render the Central Bank more effective than ever,\u201d he said at a news briefing last week. The Central Bank\u2019s decisions will be driven by market conditions, he said, promising \u201ca more predictable, simple and determined monetary policy in line with the objectives.\u201dYet Mr. Albayrak\u2019s appointment is part of the concern unsettling investors, the credit ratings service Moody\u2019s said in a statement the same day. \u201cSuch appointments will inevitably raise questions regarding the independence and experience of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.Ms. Aydintasbas warned that centralizing power had never worked in Turkey.\u201cI believe that such concentration of power will tire Turkey out, lock out the state and overload the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m mistaken.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Rebuffed at U.N. on North Korea Sanctions Enforcement", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySignaling new tensions over North Korea at the United Nations, Russia and China on Thursday blocked disciplinary steps sought by the United States to stop what it called rampant cheating on North Korea\u2019s petroleum imports.The petroleum limit is an important component of a severe regimen of sanctions imposed by the 15-member Security Council over North Korea\u2019s illicit nuclear and missile tests.The American complaint was filed last week, and under Security Council procedures the other members had until midday Thursday to object.Just before the deadline Russia, supported by China, put a \u201chold\u201d on the complaint, which delays any action for six months, the diplomats said.The United States had no immediate comment on the move by Russia and China, which appeared to undermine what the Americans have previously described as a strong commitment by the Security Council to enforce the North Korean sanctions.But questions about the willingness of other countries \u2014 particularly China and Russia \u2014 to maintain the sanctions pressure on North Korea have grown since President Trump met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, last month in Singapore.Mr. Trump has described that meeting in glowing terms and suggested the North Korean nuclear threat has eased, even though Mr. Kim has made no concrete commitments yet to denuclearize, raising doubts about his intentions.If the North Koreans are successfully subverting the sanctions on imported petroleum, Mr. Kim would be under less pressure to disarm.The American complaint said North Korea might have clandestinely imported nearly 1.4 million barrels of refined petroleum this year, triple the amount allowed for all of 2018, much of it smuggled via illicit ship-to-ship transfers at sea. The complaint requested the Security Council\u2019s sanctions panel to \u201corder an immediate halt to all transfers of refined petroleum products\u201d to North Korea.On Friday, data released by South Korea\u2019s central bank suggested the sanctions were having their intended effect.

Bus service has been restored along Fifth Avenue.The entire cleanup could take a few more days, if not longer, said Nancy Silvestri, a spokeswoman for the department. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.As the cleanup efforts continue, we had a few questions about asbestos in our city\u2019s infrastructure.Which city pipes contain asbestos?\u201cWe would rationalize that most of the 104 miles of transmission pipe that make up our steam distribution system would contain asbestos,\u201d said Philip O\u2019Brien, a spokesman for Con Edison. But that system only operates in Manhattan below 96th Street to the Battery on the West Side and below 86th Street to downtown on the East Side, he added.Why is asbestos coating our city\u2019s pipes?It was used to keep them insulated \u201cback when people thought differently about asbestos,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. It\u2019s unclear when asbestos came into use (the first underground steam pipes were installed in 1882) but it was phased out \u201ccertainly by the early 1980s,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.Why don\u2019t we swap out the asbestos?\u201cBesides the cost,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, \u201cit\u2019s fine as it is.\u201d\u201cThe way the infrastructure is designed, it is underground in its own casing and not subject to much, if any, disturbance,\u201d he added. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to disturb the asbestos, once you know it\u2019s there, because it may be released into the air. So you leave it there so that it stays contained.\u201dWhy do steam pipes explode?Typically \u201cthere has to be a drastic change in temperature in order to break the pipe,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. That could mean a small rupture the size of a pinhole. You can tell when there\u2019s a small leak nearby because of \u201cthe vapor you see coming out of the ground in Manhattan,\u201d he said. But, he added, steam coming out of the ground could also be a water pipe dripping onto a hot steam pipe or \u201cguck or muck that could have dripped onto the pipe and now it\u2019s cooking.\u201dDoes every steam pipe explosion contain asbestos?\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said. While there could be a rupture or break in a section that might not have asbestos, he said, most of the pipes are probably coated with asbestos.Here\u2019s what else is happening:The rain will not go away.Showers and thunderstorms are expected to dampen your morning commute and could continue throughout the day.

Policy Battles Are Still Ahead.", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn substance, at least, Mr. Wheeler is expected to closely resemble his predecessor, carrying out President Trump\u2019s wishes to dismantle Obama-era climate policy and reorient the E.P.A. in a more industry-friendly direction. But Mr. Wheeler\u2019s low-key style and deep familiarity with Washington \u2014 he was an E.P.A. official and a Senate Republican staff member for nearly two decades before becoming an energy lobbyist in 2009 \u2014 could make him more effective at deregulation than Mr. Pruitt, observers said.\u201cPruitt was certainly interested in the politics of these issues, but he was not always as involved in the policymaking,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, a partner at the firm Bracewell and a former E.P.A. air chief. \u201cWhereas Andy understands how to work with E.P.A. staff to get things done.

One question is whether Mr. Wheeler will try to negotiate a compromise with California and other states in order to avoid risky litigation.\u201cThis will be an early test,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a law professor at Harvard who was the counselor for energy and climate change in the Obama White House. \u201cDoes he follow Pruitt and take a big legal risk by aggressively going after California? Or does he try to pull back in search of a deregulatory result that everyone can live with?\u201dBut that proposal faces an uncertain fate in the courts: In drafting a replacement, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s E.P.A. planned to follow guidelines laid out by Justice Antonin Scalia in 2006 \u2014 in an opinion that did not receive majority support on the Supreme Court. Mr. Wheeler will be tasked with trying to write a regulation that is legally defensible.Before his resignation, Mr. Pruitt came under fire from a number of Senate Republicans \u2014\u00a0not because of his ethics issues, but because of ethanol.Some experts think that Mr. Wheeler may try to steer clear of this fight altogether.

{"Headline": "Theresa May in Fight to Save Government Amid Brexit Rift", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was battling to save her government on Monday after her foreign secretary quit in protest over her approach to withdrawing from the European Union. The resignation deepened a mood of crisis just eight months before the country is due to leave the bloc.The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was the second minister to leave Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet within 24 hours. He stepped down after she pushed ahead with a proposal that would keep Britain more closely tied to the European Union than hard-line conservatives want.\u201cWe are truly headed for the status of colony,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in his resignation letter.It has been two years since Britons voted to leave the European Union in a referendum that rattled governments on the Continent and beyond. But actually severing the intricate economic ties that bind Britain to the rest of Europe has proved far more complicated than merely casting a ballot at the polls.Many Britons remain opposed to leaving the bloc, and even among those who favor it, there are deep divisions. Some, like Mr. Johnson, advocate a clean break \u2014 or, at least, taking that stance in withdrawal negotiations with the European Union. Others, like Mrs. May, support maintaining at least some ties, including abiding by some European regulations.That drew a sharp rebuke from Mr. Johnson, who said, \u201cThis is our opening bid.\u201d It is as though, he said, \u201cwe are sending our vanguard into battle with a white flag fluttering above them.\u201dJust last week, Mrs. May appeared to have won the full cabinet\u2019s agreement on keeping Britain\u2019s economy closely anchored to the European Union. The resignations reopened speculation about a challenge to her leadership, something that Mrs. May\u2019s spokesman said she would fight.With the hard-line supporters of withdrawal, known as Brexit, in the party in full revolt, Conservative insiders predicted further resignations unless Mrs. May dropped her plan.On Monday night, Mr. Johnson was replaced as foreign secretary by Jeremy Hunt, who moved from the health department to take up the job. Although Mr. Hunt argued against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, he has since argued in favor of withdrawal and is likely to support Mrs. May\u2019s position on Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.The turmoil comes days before a scheduled visit by President Trump, a champion of the kind of sharp break with the European Union that Mrs. May and others on her side of the issue believe would seriously harm the British economy.Mr. Johnson, the public face of the 2016 campaign that persuaded Britons to quit the European Union, is perhaps the most high-profile advocate of Brexit, and his departure underscores the depth of the divisions within Mrs. May\u2019s government. His resignation followed that of David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who quit late Sunday night.After Mr. Davis\u2019s surprise resignation, there was an ominous silence from Mr. Johnson on Monday morning, although he was supposed to host a meeting in London of foreign ministers to discuss the western Balkans.Then, around 3 p.m., Mrs. May\u2019s office issued a statement that said simply: \u201cThis afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. His replacement will be announced shortly. The Prime Minister thanks Boris for his work.\u201dOn several occasions Mr. Johnson had undermined Mrs. May\u2019s strategy for withdrawing from the European Union. He described one government Brexit customs plan as \u201ccrazy\u201d and, in leaked comments, accused her government of lacking \u201cguts.\u201d He compared her negotiating style unfavorably with that of Mr. Trump, and he compared her latest Brexit plan to excrement.In his remarks, Mr. Johnson echoed others in the hard-line Brexit camp \u2014 notably Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2014 who have complained that under Mrs. May\u2019s plan Britain would become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the European Union, a \u201crule taker, not a rule maker.\u201dOn Monday, loyalist Conservative lawmakers appealed to their colleagues not to demand a confidence vote in Mrs. May\u2019s leadership.That would require the support of just 48 of her party\u2019s lawmakers \u2014 but it would take many more to dislodge her were Mrs. May to try to stay on, as her office said she would. In those circumstances, Mrs. May could keep her job if she won the support of a simple majority of the Conservative Party\u2019s 316 lawmakers.Another major drawback of a leadership contest is that it could take as long as three months, something the government can ill afford. It needs to seal a withdrawal agreement with the European Union in October.Mr. Johnson has made little secret of his ambitions to take the keys of 10 Downing Street, and his detractors say he would not hesitate to put his interests first. It remains unclear whether he commands the necessary support.There is little chance that the opposition Labour Party could force a general election. That would require some Conservative votes, and Tory lawmakers have little interest in that, given the very real possibility that they could lose.However, if the Conservatives were to change their leader, and therefore the prime minister, there would be political pressure to call a general election.Mr. Davis told the BBC he was not encouraging a challenge to Mrs. May. But Mr. Johnson\u2019s resignation reignited the debate just as Mrs. May was hoping that she had restored some stability to the government by announcing that Mr. Davis would be replaced by the pro-Brexit minister Dominic Raab.European officials will have noticed that, although it took Mrs. May almost two years to produce a detailed plan for Brexit, the truce in her party lasted only two days. That raises more questions about the government\u2019s ability to negotiate an orderly withdrawal.On Monday, Mr. Davis outlined his objections to Mrs. May\u2019s plan for withdrawal, which was announced on Friday evening and is to be published later this week in a white paper.In effect, Mrs. May\u2019s proposal means that Britain would sign up for Europe\u2019s rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without being able to shape them. Services like banking and finance \u2014 a big component of the British economy \u2014 would be dealt with separately and would not have as much access as at present to the continental European market.No changes to economic rules in the future would take place \u201cwithout the approval of our Parliament,\u201d Mrs. May insisted, rebutting the argument that Britain would simply become \u201ca rule taker.\u201dBut on Monday, Mr. Davis argued that Parliament\u2019s power would be \u201cillusory rather than real\u201d because, if it rejected future changes, the consequences would be too great. Not only could Britain lose access to continental markets, it would also face the prospect of the deployment of a contingency plan \u2014 yet to be finalized \u2014 devised to ensure that frontier controls are not erected on the Irish border.Mr. Davis also foresaw that Mrs. May\u2019s plans are hardly final.

{"Headline": "Record-Smashing Heat Wave Kills 33 in Quebec", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTREAL \u2014 Thirty-three people have died in Quebec from one of the worst heat waves to hit eastern and central Canada in decades, the authorities said on Thursday, underscoring the vulnerability of elderly, ill and poor people during the hot summer months.Dr. David Kaiser, the senior physician at Montreal\u2019s public health agency, said that most of those who had died from the heat in Montreal were 65 or older, had histories of health problems or mental illness and had been living without air-conditioning.He said that disadvantaged people who had chronic illnesses or were living alone were particularly vulnerable. \u201cWhile we are an advanced industrialized economy, these deaths reflect that there are serious social inequalities,\u201d he said, adding that many wealthy countries the world over had been hit by heat waves associated with climate change.Public health authorities in Quebec have made a concerted effort to improve the reporting of heat-related deaths. They have set up a special liaison program with hospitals and emergency rooms to monitor heat-related illnesses and mortality, Dr. Kaiser said, which may explain why the number of deaths seems high compared to elsewhere in the nation.Home appliance stores have been mobbed in recent days, with residents trying to buy air-conditioners, only to discover that all the units are sold out. At a sprawling Home Depot store in central Montreal, about 20 shoppers were seen fighting this week over the last remaining air- conditioner. \u201cIt\u2019s survival of the fittest,\u201d said Victor Perchet, who managed to get it.Environment Canada has issued a heat warning for southern Quebec, much of Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. To protect themselves against the heat, it called on residents to drink six to eight glasses of water a day, to avoid alcohol, to spend at least two hours a day in air-conditioned or cool places and to avoid leaving children or babies alone in sweltering vehicles.Police and firefighters in Montreal visited 15,000 homes this week to check on elderly residents. The emergency services in Montreal said they had experienced a sharp increase in calls since the heat wave began \u2014 a total of some 1,200 calls a day.Canadians were expected to get some relief from the heat wave, which began on June 29, when temperatures fall on Friday. The forecast in Montreal for Friday is a high of about 73 degrees.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Don\u2019t We Always Vote in Our Own Self-Interest?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe backlash against the Civil Rights movement continues to confound us.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.One question that has troubled Democrats for decades is freshly relevant in the Trump-McConnell era: Why do so many voters support elected officials who are determined to cut programs that those same voters rely upon? Over the past half century, residents of Kentucky have become steadily more reliant on the federal government. In the 1970s, federal programs provided slightly under 10 percent of personal income for Kentucky residents; by 2015, money from programs ranging from welfare and Medicaid to Social Security and Medicare more than doubled to 23 percent as a share of Kentuckians\u2019 personal income.Twenty years ago, there was only one county (out of 120) in which residents counted on the federal government for at least 40 percent of their personal income. By 2014, 28 counties were at 40 percent or higher. But as their claims on federal dollars rose, the state\u2019s voters became increasingly conservative. In the 1990s, they began to elect hard right, anti-government politicians determined to cut the programs their constituents were coming to lean on.The accompanying graphic, based on Mettler\u2019s data, documents the steady rise in government dependency among Kentucky voters as their representatives in Congress moved to the right. In her book, Mettler gives the example of the Republican congressman Andy Barr, who represents the Sixth District, which includes Wolfe County, where \u201c52 percent of income \u2014 approximately $12,000 per resident \u2014 flows from federal social policies.\u201d In the adjoining Fourth District, Representative Thomas Massie, also a Republican, \u201cresides in Lewis County, in which 43 percent of income comes from federal government transfers.\u201d Massie, Mettler notes, \u201cstridently opposes social welfare spending, having been among the group of Republicans who forced the end of the long tradition of bipartisan cooperation on the farm bill in 2013 because they opposed its inclusion of the food stamp program.\u201dSo what\u2019s going on with Kentucky voters? There is, however, one thread that runs through all the explanations of the shift to the right in Kentucky and elsewhere. Race, the economists Alberto F. Alesina and Paola Giuliano writeLeonie Huddy, a political scientist at the State University of New York \u2014 Stony Brook, made a related point in an email:It\u2019s important to stress the role of negative racial and ethnic attitudes in this process. Those who hold Latinos and African-Americans in low esteem also believe that federal funds flow disproportionally to members of these groups. This belief that the federal government is more willing to help blacks and Latinos than whites fuels the white threat and resentment that boosted support for Donald Trump in 2016.How does race intersect with other factors contributing to the opposition toward redistributive policies found not only in Kentucky, but in many regions of the country?Among the findings of this group of researchers: people \u201cmaking just above the minimum wage are the most likely to oppose its increase.\u201d Applying last-place aversion theory to means-tested federal programs for the poor reveals that the group most likely to voice opposition is made up of relatively poor whites right above the cutoff level to qualify for such programs.\u201cAmericans believe that the poor are lazy; Europeans believe the poor are unfortunate,\u201d report Alesina and Glaeser.Individuals are more willing to vote for redistribution when they perceive the recipients as being deserving. By this I mean that the recipients are willing to work hard but were experiencing bad luck that left them in need of assistance.This distinction often translates into a differentiation between poor whites and poor minorities.\u201cDepictions of immigrants or minorities in discussions or media who seem to be gaming the system may lead to beliefs that recipients of government programs are undeserving of assistance,\u201d Lefgren pointed out, adding thatAmong white respondents, the differences in the responses were striking: More than half, 58 percent, said average Americans got less than they deserved; 28 percent, however, said that African Americans do not get what they deserve.The difference, Tesler wrote, grows out of a \u201cdouble standard in deservingness.\u201d He described the double standard as follows:different portraits have their origins in what social psychologists call \u201cultimate attribution error.\u201d This error means that when whites struggle, their troubles are generally attributed to situational forces (e.g., outsourcing); but when nonwhites struggle, their plight is more often attributed to dispositional traits (i.e., poor work ethic). Consequently, whites are considered \u2018more deserving\u2019 than blacks.For years, we\u2019ve focused on how we can help Americans receive taxpayer-funded assistance. Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, we\u2019re now looking at how we can respect both those who require assistance and the taxpayers who fund that support. For the first time in a long time, we\u2019re putting taxpayers first. Taking money from someone without an intention to pay it back is not debt. It is theft. This budget makes it clear that we will reverse this larceny.the folks who work hard and pay taxes. This budget is for you. It is your government\u2019s \u2014 your new government\u2019s \u2014 way of thanking those of you who are working two jobs, saving for your kids\u2019 education, or working to buy a home or start your own business. We cannot express our gratitude and respect enough for what you do to make your families, your communities, and this nation work. Americans are the hardest working people who have ever lived. We worked hard to build this country together and will work hard to restore this country together.In exploring the issue of race and deservingness, a key question comes up: Why would race play such a pivotal role in the growing conservatism of a state like Kentucky, which is, as I mentioned earlier, overwhelmingly white? Two reasons.non-disabled working-age adults made up the majority of adult recipients on Medicaid (61 percent), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (67 percent), and rental housing assistance programs (59 percent) as of December 2013.Existing safety-net programs have \u201ccontributed to a dramatic reduction in poverty,\u201d according to the report, but at the expense of \u201ca decline in self-sufficiency among non-disabled working-age adults.\u201dwill cause many low-income adults to lose health coverage, including people who are working or are unable to work due to mental illness, opioid or other substance use disorders, or serious chronic physical conditions, but who cannot overcome various bureaucratic hurdles to document that they either meet work requirements or qualify for an exemption from them.An earlier version of this column misstated the Congressional District in which McCreary County, Ky. is located; it is the Fifth Congressional District, not the Sixth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why One Quarter\u2019s Growth Tells Us Nothing", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistFor the most part, reporting on 2nd quarter growth has been pretty decent. But I haven\u2019t seen clear explanations of why one quarter\u2019s growth tells us so little about longer-term growth prospects. I\u2019m sure that reporters get it; maybe they assume that readers already know (a very bad assumption), or maybe they\u2019re afraid of sounding too technical. But anyway, it seems as if there\u2019s a gap worth filling; so here it comes.The key point when you look at real GDP is that the economy\u2019s actual output depends both on its capacity \u2013 the amount it is capable of producing on a sustained basis \u2013 and the rate at which it is using that capacity. That is,Output = capacity * capacity utilizationCBO actually produces an estimate of capacity \u2013 \u201cpotential GDP\u201d \u2013 which you can argue with, but is a useful benchmark. And you can look at the ratio of actual GDP to potential, which is an indication of how hot the economy is running:Why does capacity utilization fluctuate? Mainly because the economy sometimes suffers from periods of inadequate demand, as it did after the 2008 financial crisis. Sometimes, also, the economy overheats, reaching levels of capacity utilization that will lead to rising inflation. The Fed thinks we\u2019re in or near to that state now, although many economists disagree. Whoever\u2019s right, the point is that there\u2019s some limit to how hot the economy can run.Now, suppose that for whatever reason capacity utilization rises. This will generate a period of rapid growth. To take a not at all arbitrary example, suppose that capacity is growing at a 2 percent annual rate, and capacity utilization rises 0.5 percent over the course of a quarter. Then growth in that quarter will be at an annual rate of 4 percent (because half a point in a quarter is two points at an annual rate.)This, however, says nothing at all about whether the economy can achieve 3 or 4 percent growth over a longer period, say a decade. That would require evidence of an acceleration in the growth of capacity.So does 2nd quarter growth say anything at all about the Trump economic agenda? The tax cut probably helped give the economy a bit of a bump: massive deficit spending will do that. (Obama could have presided over a much more rapid recovery if Republicans hadn\u2019t insisted that deficits and debt are vast evils \u2013 but only when a Democrat is in the White House.) But deficit-based Keynesian stimulus wasn\u2019t how the tax cut was sold, and isn\u2019t a basis for sustained growth.In short, one quarter\u2019s growth is a nothingburger. The real news is that we\u2019re still waiting for both the investment surge and the wage gains the tax cutters promised; as far as we can tell, they\u2019re never coming.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Threatens Tariffs on $200 Billion of Chinese Goods, From Tilapia to Handbags", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration escalated its trade dispute with China on Tuesday, saying it would impose tariffs on roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese fish, petroleum, chemicals, handbags, textiles and other products if Beijing does not change its trade practices.The threat comes just days after President Trump imposed levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, including robotics, airplane parts and ball bearings. Mr. Trump has said he is prepared to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese products.On Tuesday, his administration detailed the next list of products that would face Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath unless Beijing folds to Washington\u2019s demands. The White House is pushing China to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, halt intellectual property theft and open its markets to American companies.Neither side appears eager to blink first. China has responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s initial tariffs with its own equal amount of levies on American goods like pork, steel, cars and fiber optic cable and has said that it is prepared to continue retaliating.The Chinese government said it would take unspecified countermeasures against new tariffs and renewed its threat to take its complaints to the World Trade Organization, which handles trade disputes.\u201cThe American side\u2019s behavior harms China, harms the world and also harms itself,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.With no official discussions scheduled to settle the trade dispute, it is unclear how or when the differences get resolved. A senior White House official said on Tuesday evening that the administration welcomed China\u2019s engagement and had been \u201cextremely clear\u201d with China about its concerns over its trade practices, but that China had been \u201cnonresponsive.\u201d The official said that the process of imposing tariffs on the new list of goods would take roughly two months, with a public hearing on the tariffs scheduled for Aug. 20 through Aug 23.The trade war has already started to raise costs for businesses that depend on international supply chains, from manufacturers to retailers, and consumers that purchase their products. The Trump administration said it intended its first wave of tariffs to target industrial products that the Chinese government subsidizes and to minimize the impact to American households.But as the list of taxed products grows, the number of consumers and businesses that will feel the pinch also increases.\u201cIt gets harder for them to keep it from the shelves of Walmart and Target and Best Buy,\u201d said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt also gets harder for them to continue to hide behind this rationale of hitting China for forced technology transfer.\u201dThe administration\u2019s approach has prompted criticism from lawmakers, particularly those from farm states, who say Mr. Trump is approaching a serious issue in an undisciplined way that could backfire.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that he supported the administration\u2019s effort to crack down on Chinese practices, but the decision to use tariffs was not the proper response.\u201cTonight\u2019s announcement appears reckless and is not a targeted approach,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cWe cannot turn a blind eye to China\u2019s mercantilist trade practices, but this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China while maintaining the long-term health and prosperity of the American economy.\u201dThe White House administration disagrees. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the announcement was \u201can appropriate response.\u201d\u201cRather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against U.S. products,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no justification for such action.\u201dFor now, the limited tariffs combined with a booming economy seem to be having little impact beyond targeted industries.Goldman Sachs economists estimated this week that the initial tariffs on Chinese goods would reduce the size of the United States economy by a minimal amount, and said they did not expect the White House to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s latest threatened tariffs.Goldman economists said in a report earlier this month that, if the broader range of tariffs were actually enacted, it would be more damaging because they would hit Americans more quickly in the wallet than the initial round of tariffs.Economists have also cautioned that the potential damage to the economy could grow if the trade conflict grows. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University, said that it was difficult to see a path to cooling off tensions, especially with the highly charged midterm elections approaching in the United States.\u201cWith China in attack mode as well, additional tariffs risk escalating the trade war to a level from which it is becoming increasingly difficult to envision an exit path,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Politically, it survived the protests of 2017. The loyalty of the military ensured that President Maduro was able to bypass the opposition-controlled National Assembly, beat back protesters and stage a farcical presidential election in May, giving him six more years in office. The last fig leaf of democracy has fallen.The first 20 names in our list were easy enough to find. Cross-referencing with files seized from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, consultations with international counternarcotics agencies and extensive field research in Venezuela ensured the dossiers on these individuals were soon bulging. We stopped opening new files when we hit 123 people sitting in senior positions in government in more than 12 state institutions. We ran out of manpower, not leads.But the real money was being made, with no risk, though pillaging state coffers. With all transparency and accountability gone, with positions filled on the basis of political loyalty instead of ability or integrity, Venezuela has become a kleptocracy.The linchpin of this kleptocracy is the artificial currency control system. Today one United States dollar on the black market is worth as much as 3.4 million Venezuelan bol\u00edvares. But those privileged with access to the official exchange rate can get a dollar for 120,000 bol\u00edvares. It\u2019s one of the most lucrative deals on the planet. In addition to catastrophic economic mismanagement, this has brought Venezuela, even with all its oil riches, to the brink of bankruptcy.There is now little money left to steal from the state, yet the wheels of corruption still need to be greased. The military rank and file earn around the equivalent of less than $20 a month, while the minimum wage is around $1.50 a month. Because everyone has to be on the take to survive, Mr. Maduro has made every Venezuelan an unwilling participant in the criminal economy. If Venezuelans want food and medicine, they must resort to the black markets; they must feed the corruption that permeates every organ of the state and every aspect of their daily lives.Aruba and Trinidad and Tobago have become contraband centers. Cheap Venezuelan gasoline gushes across the Colombian and Brazilian borders. And over a million Venezuelans have fled their collapsing country in the last 12 months. Many of these are desperate people, sick and hungry. They will work for a hot meal. They are being exploited and recruited by organized crime.Isolated and broke, President Maduro has surrounded himself with figures involved in criminal activity, and as long as he remains in power the criminal credentials of the government will get only stronger.Venezuela cannot work to contain organized crime, as the very security forces that should be deployed against it run much of the business. Mr. Maduro, even if he wanted to, could not cut out the cancer of corruption and organized crime as these are the very elements that keep him in power.And for the international community there is little room for maneuvering. Mr. Maduro is not a reliable partner in any fight against organized crime and he has helped turned Venezuela into a haven for criminal activity.An earlier version of a biographical note with this article misstated the writer\u2019s association with InSight Crime.

He Isn\u2019t Acting Like It.", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBut let\u2019s take his statement at face value.\u201cIf Trump is serious about zero tariffs, then let\u2019s make it part of the agenda,\u201d said Edwin J. Feulner, founder and former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cI\u2019d be all for it.\u201dMr. Trump is correct that economists at Wharton, and at just about every other reputable business school, teach the virtues of free trade. It is one of the few propositions that unites economists across the political spectrum. (Its opponents are also odd allies: the populist, nationalist right and the anti-free-market left.)\u201cIf President Trump would seriously say we want a comprehensive agreement reducing trade barriers among the G-7, there would be a lot of support for that,\u201d said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow and specialist in international trade at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.While free trade can cause short-term disruption to specific industries, in the longer term it redeploys capital and labor to their most productive uses, which benefits consumers, workers and investors.Economists are nearly unanimous that trade between nations isn\u2019t a \u201cwar\u201d in the sense that one country wins and another loses. \u201cEvery president since F.D.R. has acknowledged that free trade is a win-win,\u201d said Daniel J. Ikenson, director of the center for trade policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cBut President Trump sees it as a zero-sum game with the trade deficit the scorecard. That\u2019s an absurd approach.\u201dEven if it is seen as a zero-sum game, the United States would come out substantially ahead in a zero-tariff world. That is because, on average, its tariffs are lower than those of its major trading partners \u2014 so it would be a net winner if all tariffs vanished.Still, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t acknowledged that many United States industries \u2014 not just foreign ones \u2014 benefit from tariffs. Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers still sell so many trucks in the United States, and at such high profit margins, in large part thanks to an existing 25 percent tariff on imports.The United States also has relatively high tariffs on imported food, clothing and building materials, and it maintains large agricultural subsidies. Eliminating those barriers would benefit American consumers, but at the expense of those favored industries. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the most regressive tax imaginable,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said of the American tariffs. \u201cThey hit food, clothing and shelter.\u201dLarry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and a longtime free-trade advocate, has said Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to lower trade barriers is real. The tariff threats, according to Mr. Kudlow, are just a means to that end, a \u201cwake-up\u201d call to America\u2019s trading partners who have long gamed the system to their advantage.If so, that approach has yet to show any results, while drawing fire from economists of all political stripes. \u201cUsing tariffs as a bargaining chip makes no sense,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said. \u201cThey\u2019re just a tax on the consumer. They invite retaliation.\u201dThat Mr. Trump is simultaneously threatening all of our major trading partners is also puzzling. \u201cI was always taught that if you spread yourself over a dozen fronts, you end up losing on all of them,\u201d Mr. Feulner said. \u201cWhy not go after China first, and then turn to whoever you think is the next troublemaker? We\u2019ve caused them all to band together.\u201dMr. Meltzer agreed. \u201cWhy wage war on everyone at once? It shows a complete lack of strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration didn\u2019t have the faintest notion of how other countries would react and wasn\u2019t prepared for it. Trump thought the U.S. was big enough that it could bully people. That has proved manifestly wrong.\u201dIf anything, foreign leaders like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel have gained political stature by standing up to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats.Many free trade supporters have argued that the United States should take the opposite approach and unilaterally lower its own barriers to lead by example. \u201cIf we did it, others would follow suit,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said.There\u2019s been talk in Britain about such an approach after Brexit. Other economies, notably Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Hong Kong and Singapore, have done so with great success. \u201cI\u2019d love to see us do it unilaterally,\u201d said Mr. Feulner, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric makes the prospect highly unlikely.Short of that, Mr. Trump could negotiate some bilateral free trade agreements as an incentive to other countries, a carrot in addition to the stick of tariffs. Mr. Feulner said both Switzerland and Taiwan have expressed willingness to reach such agreements, which Mr. Trump could simultaneously hail as victories in the trade war and point to as examples for the European Union and China.For now, \u201cit feels like we\u2019re a million miles from negotiating a productive trade deal with any country, let alone the G-7,\u201d Mr. Meltzer said. \u201cNo country ever launches a trade negotiation if there\u2019s a good chance of failure. It takes enormous amounts of preparatory work, as well as good will and a sense of trust in each other. Trump has none of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Friday\u2019s G.D.P. Number May Be a Size Too Big", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrepare to be excited about a blockbuster economic report on Friday morning \u2014 but not too excited.Preliminary data from the Commerce Department is expected to show that United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in April through June. Some economists think growth may have topped 5 percent \u2014 a figure reached only once in the eight years of the Obama administration as the economy recovered from the recession.While he said he didn\u2019t know the actual number, President Trump didn\u2019t wait to herald the rosy news. At an event in Iowa on Thursday, he said he was expecting a very strong result, noting predictions that ran to 5 percent or higher. \u201cIt could be very close,\u201d he said. \u201cCould even happen.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll take anything with a four in front,\u201d he added.Even a number starting with a four, though, will almost certainly be misleading. Several one-time factors \u2014 including a surge in exports tied, at least in part, to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies \u2014 probably combined to pump up growth in the second quarter. Those effects won\u2019t last, and economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Pretty much no one outside the White House thinks a growth rate of 4 percent is sustainable in the long term.\u201cThe bottom line is that the economy is doing better,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.Economists, though, will be digging deeper into the report to figure out how much of the acceleration is driven by short-term factors and how much reflects a real shift in the underlying pace of growth. Here are three questions that will help distinguish a solid report from a great one.Economists are nearly unanimous in thinking that the escalating rounds of tariffs and countermeasures will be bad for the United States economy in the long run. But for one quarter, at least, trade tensions could have actually led to faster growth, as foreign buyers rushed to stock up on American goods before tariffs took effect. The resulting surge in exports could add a percentage point or more to the G.D.P. figure.The trend is particularly clear in exports of soybeans, which were up more than 50 percent in May from a year earlier. Those buyers presumably didn\u2019t want more soybeans than usual \u2014 they just wanted them sooner. Exports will almost certainly slump in the third and fourth quarters, and will turn into a drag on overall economic growth.For a better sense of the pace of growth, economists will look at what the Commerce Department calls \u201cfinal sales to domestic purchasers.\u201d That measure strips out the effects of trade and of inventories, which can be similarly skewed by quirks of the calendar. (Both numbers are also subject to big revisions.) Anything above 3 percent would reflect strong underlying growth.Unlike the trade effects, the lift from government spending won\u2019t disappear overnight. Most economists expect the budget deal to keep adding to growth for the rest of the year and into 2019. After that, though, the effects will fade.As a result, some economists are focused on a measure of growth that strips out government spending, as well as trade and inventory effects. Research from President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers found that measure, known as \u201cfinal sales to private domestic purchasers,\u201d to be a better predictor of long-run growth trends.The Republican tax cuts, which took effect in January, didn\u2019t have much effect on economic growth in the first quarter. Consumer spending growth actually slowed, and business investment in equipment, which the tax law was meant to encourage, had its weakest showing in a year.The second quarter could be a different story. Retail sales and other data suggest that consumer spending rebounded, and capital spending has been picking up as well. The tax cuts probably contributed to both trends, although it will be hard to discern exactly how much.Economists will be watching business investment particularly closely. The Trump administration and its supporters argue that the tax cuts will stimulate investment, which could make the American economy more productive in the long term. Critics argue that companies will mostly return their tax windfalls to shareholders in stock buybacks and dividends, giving the economy the equivalent of a short-term sugar high but doing little for the longer run.\u201cWe have yet to see any meaningful evidence of an increase\u201d in investment, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the accounting firm RSM U.S. \u201cThat\u2019s something that you can\u2019t make a judgment on in one or two quarters. That\u2019s something that you make a judgment on in two or three years.\u201dMark Landler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Police Killing Unleashes Familiar Riots and Recrimination", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A night of rioting touched off by a police killing set off a familiar replay of grim media images on Wednesday morning in France, where law enforcement tactics in immigrant neighborhoods are a regular source of friction.French television replayed a seemingly endless loop of images from the western city of Nantes of burned-out cars, smashed bus shelters and shattered store fronts: recurrent symbols of the country\u2019s struggles with policing in minority neighborhoods.Nantes, located on the Atlantic Coast, is known for its vibrant start-up scene and tech-oriented economy, but not much of that has rubbed off on neighborhoods like Le Breil.It was there that the riot police pulled over a 22-year-old man acquaintances identified as Aboubakar, the son of immigrants from Guinea, during a traffic stop Tuesday night. (The authorities did not name him.)The accounts of residents and the officers differ, but one thing was certain: The young man was shot in the neck and died before he made it to the hospital.Police shootings are rare in France compared with the United States, and when they occur the investigative machinery of the French state is mobilized. On Tuesday evening, the mayor of Nantes, Johanna Rolland, a Socialist, called for \u201ctotal transparency over what has happened tonight,\u201d and extended her sympathies to the family of the slain man.Officials said that Aboubakar had had at least eight previous encounters with the police and that he had had an outstanding arrest warrant on a robbery charge.On Tuesday night, after he was pulled over, they said, he backed his car up at high speed toward children and a police officer. But residents say that he had not been acting aggressively.What followed was a night in which angry youths in three Nantes neighborhoods threw firebombs and burned eight buildings and some 30 cars, the authorities said.Tensions between the police and the communities they patrol have erupted in violence repeatedly over the years.Each time, the government vowed to bring in more help to the neighborhoods. President Emmanuel Macron is only the latest to announce such help, mostly through an enhanced police presence. Tensions with the police persist.\u201cIt\u2019s always the same scenario,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Mauger, an emeritus scholar at the CNRS research institute in Paris who has studied urban riots in France for decades. \u201cBut it\u2019s hardened. The score settling is more violent. Now there are guns.\u201dHe added: \u201cFor 40 years we\u2019ve had 10 percent unemployment, much higher in these neighborhoods. The first victims of it are the immigrants.\u201dIn the Le Breil neighborhood of Nantes, the police had increased their presence in recent weeks because of confrontations between local youths. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of score settling recently,\u201d Sa\u00efd En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r, who runs a local youth group, said.Mr. En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r, in a phone interview from Nantes, said, \u201cThey had beefed up the police presence to \u2018protect\u2019 the neighborhood.\u201dThierry Spitz, a representative of the local police union, said: \u201cThese neighborhoods are very on edge. There are gunshots at least once a month.\u201dOn the night Aboubakar was shot, officials said, the police were on the lookout for the car he was driving because it was tied to drug trafficking in Rennes. Mr. Spitz said the officers noticed that the young man was not wearing a seatbelt and pulled him over.Aboubakar gave the officers a phony ID, the union official said, and was ordered to the police station. The young man then \u201cbacked up his car at high speed; there were two kids behind the car,\u201d Mr. Spitz said. \u201cOne of the officers pushed them out of the way and was touched by the car,\u201d he said.\u201cThe risk was great,\u201d Mr. Spitz said. \u201cThe officer had to use his weapon. To me, it was a case of legitimate defense.\u201dMr. En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r, who knew Aboubakar from soccer matches organized by his group, vigorously disputed the police account. He said 10 witnesses interviewed by him and his group all agreed: There had been no aggression from the young man.\u201cThis is clearly a police blunder,\u201d he said. \u201cThe young man was complying with the officers. He wasn\u2019t aggressive. The police check was going just fine.\u201dHe contested the idea that the car had struck an officer.\u201cThey fired at him without warning,\u201d Mr. En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r said. \u201cThere was lots of blood coming from his neck, but it was too late; the ambulance came too late.\u201dAboubakar was known as \u201ccheerful\u201d and \u201crespectful,\u201d Mr. En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r said. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are trying to pass him off as a thug.\u201dJudicial officials in Nantes said the shooting would be investigated, and a march was being organized for Thursday.For Mr. En-N\u00e9m\u00e8r, though, the shooting demonstrated that \u201cyou might as well re-establish the death penalty.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What America Gets Out of NATO", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Burns\u00a0is a former ambassador to NATO.None of this, of course, is likely to disturb Mr. Trump, who remains steadfast in his belief that whatever benefits the United States gained from the trans-Atlantic alliance in the past, the country no longer profits. But he\u2019s wrong \u2014 there are compelling reasons that NATO in particular will be a distinct advantage for America\u2019s security far into the future.First, NATO\u2019s formidable conventional and nuclear forces are the most effective way to protect North America and Europe \u2014 the heart of the democratic world \u2014 from attack. Threats to our collective security have not vanished in the 21st century. Mr. Putin remains a determined adversary preying on Eastern Europe and American elections. NATO is a force multiplier: The United States has allies who will stand by us, while Russia has none.And while it\u2019s true that most of America\u2019s NATO allies need to increase their defense spending under the treaty, they\u2019re not freeloaders: The United States has relied on NATO allies to strike back against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Islamic State in the Middle East. European troops have replaced American soldiers in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and contribute the large majority in Kosovo.Our NATO allies are also getting better about contributing their fair share. They have increased their defense spending by a total of more than $87 billion since Mr. Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. Fourteen more allies will reach NATO\u2019s military spending target \u2014 2 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 by 2024. Mr. Trump would be smart to claim credit for this at this week\u2019s summit.A second reason for maintaining the trans-Atlantic alliance is America\u2019s economic future. The European Union is our country\u2019s largest trade partner, and its largest investor. The United States and the European Union are the world\u2019s two largest economies, and can steer global trade to their advantage if they stick together. More than four million Americans work for European companies in the United States. Forty-five of the 50 states export more to Europe than to China.Mr. Trump is right that the two sides are also economic competitors, and trade disputes are inevitable. His predecessors kept this tension in balance lest there be damaging consequences for American businesses, workers and farmers \u2014 a good reminder for Mr. Trump, whose ill-conceived trade war with Canada and Europe risks harming the American economy.Third, future American leaders will find Europe is our most capable and willing partner in tackling the biggest threats to global security: climate change; drugand cybercrime cartels; terrorism; pandemics and mass migration from Africa and the Middle East. And America\u2019s NATO allies will continue to be indispensable in safeguarding democracy and freedom, under assault by Russia and China.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to undermine the European Union and diminish America\u2019s leadership in NATO serves none of these interests. He seems driven by resentment about European trade surpluses and low defense budgets, issues that blind him to all the other benefits Americans derive from our alliance with Europe and Canada.Mr. Trump may believe his blistering attacks on Europe\u2019s trade policies and defense budgets are a good negotiating tactic before the summit. But in fact they have already done enormous damage. While he cannot outright kill NATO \u2014 the American public and Congress support it too strongly \u2014 he has eroded significant levels of trust and good will. As it became clear during my recent visits across Europe, a dangerous breach has opened in the trans-Atlantic alliance \u2014 by far the worst in seven decades.Mr. Trump wants Americans to believe that their allies are simply taking advantage of them. On Sept. 11, 2001, I witnessed a far different reality as American ambassador to NATO. Canada and the European allies volunteered within hours of the attacks to invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which compels all members to respond to an attack on any single member, for the first time in history. They came to our defense when we most needed them. They sent troops to fight with us in Afghanistan. They are still there with us 17 years later.Are we now going to throw off that mutual protection, and go it alone in a dangerous 21st-century world? That would be a historic mistake. But that is where we may find ourselves if Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Europe vendetta continues.Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state and ambassador to NATO, teaches diplomacy and international relations at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan\u2019s Likely New Leader Could Complicate Afghan Peace Talks", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The rise of Imran Khan, a former cricket star who is Pakistan\u2019s likely next leader, could complicate new talks between American diplomats and the Taliban about ending the war in Afghanistan, officials said, fraying an already strained relationship between the nuclear-armed Islamic nation and the Trump administration.But the relationship threatens to be further inflamed by Mr. Khan, who has voiced past support for the Taliban\u2019s fight in the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan, calling it \u201cjustified.\u201d He also has accused the United States of recklessness in its use of drone strikes on suspected extremists in Pakistan, signaling he wants them to stop.\u201cWith the U.S., we want to have a mutually beneficial relationship,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cUp until now, that has been one-way \u2014 the U.S. thinks it gives us aid to fight their war.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. doesn\u2019t care much about Pakistan right now, but that issue will rise to the top,\u201d said Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former State Department and White House official who oversaw Pakistan issues during the Obama administration.\u201cKhan and the Pakistani military will want Pakistan to have a very strong role in shaping Afghanistan\u2019s future,\u201d Ms. Chaudhary said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. is angling for Pakistan to have a strong role.\u201dStill, \u201cthe U.S. needs Pakistan\u2019s acquiescence, if not cooperation,\u201d said Laurel Miller, a senior foreign policy expert at the RAND Corporation, who was a top State Department official with responsibility for Afghanistan and Pakistan in both the Obama and Trump administrations.Administration officials and independent analysts voiced doubt that Mr. Khan will have much say in the issues that currently concern Washington about Pakistan: its extremist groups and steadily growing nuclear arsenal, as well as Afghanistan.Those are the domain of Pakistan\u2019s powerful military and intelligence agencies, which critics say influenced the elections in Mr. Khan\u2019s favor. Mr. Khan is still trying to gather enough support to form a majority coalition in Parliament, but the Pakistani news media is already calling him the prime minister in waiting.\u201cHis ascension will have little impact on U.S.-Pakistani relations,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cThe situation in Afghanistan, the nuclear issues \u2014 those are tightly controlled by the military establishment.\u201dThe State Department has responded tepidly to Mr. Khan\u2019s apparent victory.\u201cThe United States takes note of yesterday\u2019s election results in Pakistan,\u201d a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said last week in a statement that condemned violence at polling stations and allegations of elections rigging.At the same time, the number of American troops in Afghanistan has dropped to about 15,000 from more than 100,000 at the height of war more than a decade ago. The Pentagon relied on moving many of its war supplies through Pakistan but is much less dependent now.Even before American military and intelligence operatives tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, American officials chided Pakistan\u2019s military and intelligence agency as harboring or turning a blind eye to militants.\u201cBoth sides need each other much less than they did in the past two decades,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, who heads the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Advances in the relationship have been few under the Trump administration, which in January suspended as much as $1.3 billion in annual aid to Pakistan \u2014 an across-the-board freeze that was the most tangible sign yet of Washington\u2019s frustration with the country\u2019s refusal to crack down on terrorist networks operating there.The aid suspension underscored how quickly ties with Pakistan deteriorated after Mr. Trump took office.But it mirrored several previous rifts between the countries over Pakistan\u2019s role as a sanctuary for extremist groups \u2014 a role that has poisoned Islamabad\u2019s up-and-down relations with Washington since the terrorist attacks of September 2001.Administration officials emphasized at the time that the freeze was temporary and could be lifted if Pakistan changed its behavior.That has not happened, despite repeated urging by top American officials that the Pakistani government cut off contact with militants and reassign intelligence agents with links to extremists \u2014 a goal that Republican and Democratic administrations have pursued for years with little success.Much of the aid earmarked for Pakistan is now being allocated elsewhere, State Department officials said on Tuesday.But analysts and diplomats say it is more likely that Mr. Khan will move Pakistan much closer to the expanding sphere of China, a neighbor that he has praised conspicuously as a role model and that Islamabad increasingly relies on for aid to shore up its weak economy.Last week, Mr. Khan\u2019s party tweeted in Chinese \u2014 apparently for the first time \u2014 about \u201cstrengthening and improving\u201d ties with China.Whether the relationship remains in traditional diplomatic and security channels or is elevated into Mr. Trump\u2019s realm of personal diplomacy remains unclear.\u201cI think Trump and Imran Khan would get along fine if they get the chance,\u201d said Vikram Singh, a former top State and Defense department official in the Obama administration who is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Declaring War on Poverty \u2018Largely Over,\u2019 White House Urges Work Requirements for Aid", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers declared on Thursday that America\u2019s long-running war on poverty \u201cis largely over and a success,\u201d as it made the case for imposing new work requirements on Americans who benefit from federal safety net programs.The report contends that millions of Americans have become overly reliant on government help \u2014 and less self-sufficient \u2014 and provided data intended to support the administration\u2019s goal of tying public benefit programs more closely to work.The White House report, using census data from 2013, found that more than one-half of working-age, non-disabled beneficiaries of Medicaid, federal housing support and food stamps worked fewer than 20 hours per week in the month in which they received benefits from those programs. The report makes the case that receiving Medicaid or other federal benefits can discourage Americans from working more, since they lose access to those benefits if their incomes climb too high.\u201cExpanding work requirements in these noncash welfare programs would improve self-sufficiency,\u201d the report said, \u201cwith little risk of substantially reversing progress in addressing material hardship.\u201dIsabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution who helped draft welfare overhaul legislation as a member of the Clinton administration, said the report was right to highlight self-sufficiency as a goal. But she criticized it for ignoring the need \u2014 and cost \u2014 to provide job training and search assistance to Americans who otherwise depend on federal assistance.\u201cPeople do need life rafts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to think they don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOur poverty program has actually been enormously successful, if you measure it the appropriate way. It\u2019s time to acknowledge we succeeded,\u201d said Richard Burkhauser, a Cornell University economist who is a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is, in the months that you\u2019re on the program, you should be ready to work.\u201dThe report\u2019s estimates may overstate the number of adults enrolled in those programs who are working less than 20 hours a week. The unemployment rate has declined substantially since 2013, falling by more than three percentage points to about 4 percent. Other reports that employ different methodologies find a substantially larger amount of work among program recipients.The administration\u2019s numbers may be particularly exaggerated for Medicaid. Under the Affordable Care Act, many states expanded their Medicaid program in 2014 to include more childless adults whose incomes bring them close to the poverty line. But the report examines adults who were enrolled in Medicaid in 2013, before the expansion, when most adults who were signed up were either pregnant women, the parents of young children or adults with extremely low incomes.Critics say the administration\u2019s effort seeks to demonize the poor, particularly low-income minorities, and said the report is another weapon in the White House\u2019s attempt to hurt the most vulnerable.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of a carefully calculated strategy to reinforce myths about the people these programs help,\u201d said Rebecca Vallas, the vice president of the poverty to prosperity program at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank, and \u201cto smear these programs with a dog-whistle of welfare, in order to make them easier to cut.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Warns NATO Allies to Spend More on Defense, or Else", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has written sharply worded letters to the leaders of several NATO allies \u2014 including Germany, Belgium, Norway and Canada \u2014 taking them to task for spending too little on their own defense and warning that the United States is losing patience with what he said was their failure to meet security obligations shared by the alliance.The letters, sent in June, are the latest sign of acrimony between Mr. Trump and American allies as he heads to a NATO summit meeting next week in Brussels that will be a closely watched test of the president\u2019s commitment to the alliance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly questioned its value and has claimed that its members are taking advantage of the United States.In his letters, the president hinted that after more than a year of public and private complaints that allies have not done enough to share the burden of collective defense, he may be considering a response, including adjusting the United States\u2019 military presence around the world.\u201cAs we discussed during your visit in April, there is growing frustration in the United States that some allies have not stepped up as promised,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in a particularly pointed letter, according to someone who saw it and shared excerpts with The New York Times. \u201cThe United States continues to devote more resources to the defense of Europe when the Continent\u2019s economy, including Germany\u2019s, are doing well and security challenges abound. This is no longer sustainable for us.\u201d\u201cGrowing frustration,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cis not confined to our executive branch. The United States Congress is concerned, as well.\u201dIn the letter, Mr. Trump told Ms. Merkel that Germany also deserves blame for the failure of other NATO countries to spend enough: \u201cContinued German underspending on defense undermines the security of the alliance and provides validation for other allies that also do not plan to meet their military spending commitments, because others see you as a role model.\u201dIn language that is echoed in his letters to the leaders of other countries \u2014 including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway and Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium \u2014 Mr. Trump said he understands the \u201cdomestic political pressure\u201d brought to bear by opponents of boosting military expenditures, noting that he has expended \u201cconsiderable political capital to increase our own military spending.\u201d\u201cIt will, however, become increasingly difficult to justify to American citizens why some countries do not share NATO\u2019s collective security burden while American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas or come home gravely wounded,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote to Ms. Merkel.Mr. Trump has long complained about the alliance and routinely grouses that the United States is treated shabbily by multilateral organizations of which it is a member, be it the World Trade Organization or the North Atlantic alliance. But in Europe, the letters to NATO allies have been greeted with some degree of alarm because of their suggestion that Mr. Trump is prepared to impose consequences on the allies \u2014 as he has done in an escalating tariff fight with European trading partners \u2014 if they do not do what he is asking.\u201cTrump still seems to think that NATO is like a club that you owe dues to, or some sort of protection racket where the U.S. is doing all the work protecting all these deadbeat Europeans while they\u2019re sitting around on vacation, and now he is suggesting there are consequences,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former Defense Department official who is the executive vice president for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\u201cEuropeans have been watching Donald Trump begin to implement his rhetoric on trade in ways that are very combative,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re starting to contemplate whether he would do this regarding security issues, as well.\u201dA White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that Mr. Trump is committed to the NATO alliance and expects allies to shoulder \u201ctheir fair share of our common defense burden, and to do more in areas that most affect them.\u201dJohn R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said Sunday that it was NATO members who refused to spend more on defense \u2014 not the president \u2014 who were responsible for undercutting the alliance.\u201cThe president wants a strong NATO,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIf you think Russia\u2019s a threat, ask yourself this question: Why is Germany spending less than 1.2 percent of its G.N.P.? When people talk about undermining the NATO alliance, you should look at those who are carrying out steps that make NATO less effective militarily.\u201dBut for diplomats hoping fervently to avoid another high-profile summit meeting collapse with Mr. Trump as the instigator, the letters were concerning.\u201cEuropeans, like many folks in our Defense Department, think that there are many good things that could come out of this summit if only they can keep it from going off the rails,\u201d Mr. Chollet said. \u201cThey are hoping to survive without irreparable damage, and so the fact that you have all these storm clouds surrounding NATO and Trump is really worrisome.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s disparagement of Europe and the alliance has become almost routine, leaving some veteran diplomats aghast. Last week, Jim Melville, the United States ambassador to Estonia, told friends and colleagues that he would resign at the end of this month after more than 30 years in the Foreign Service, in part because of the president\u2019s language.Still, the president is not alone in demanding more robust military spending by NATO allies.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated the country of which Mark Rutte is the prime minister.

{"Headline": "Democrats See Openings at State Level, Thanks to Trump Resistance", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 A polarizing president electrifies the opposition party going into his first midterm election, raising the party\u2019s hopes that it can reclaim governorships, ram through major policy change at the state level and redraw legislative lines in its favor for a decade to come.It\u2019s a scenario both political parties have seen before, most recently in 2010, when out-of-power Republicans rode the Tea Party-led wave against the Obama administration to smashing victories across the country.This year, governors in both parties acknowledged at the National Governors Association conference here, it is Democrats who appear poised to make major gains as Republicans brace for a backlash against President Trump that could lead to grievous statehouse losses.\u201cIt does feel very much like 2010 reversed to me right now,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, the head of the Republican Governors Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more conviction about voting on the Democrat side than our side, which is a concern to us.\u201dWhile much of Washington was transfixed last week by the latest Trump-created uproar, this one over his widely criticized summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the nation\u2019s governors gathered here for their annual summer conference to plot how best to exploit or mitigate a president who is as divisive as he is ubiquitous.In a series of interviews, Republican and Democratic governors said opposition to Mr. Trump had galvanized liberal and many moderate voters, leading to a sizable intensity gap between the two parties. Mr. Trump has been seeking to close that political deficit for his party, leveraging the fierce loyalty of the Republican base in the remaining months of the election, while the Democrats are working to keep their base focused on channeling their anger in the midterms.But beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial behavior, the governors said the president\u2019s policies on issues like trade had created an opening for Democrats in Republican-leaning farm belt states like Iowa and Kansas, where farmers are facing retaliatory tariffs.Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who won the governorship on the strength of the 2010 Obama backlash, bluntly acknowledged he and other Republicans could be facing \u201ca blue wave,\u201d noting that \u201cthe wind nationally isn\u2019t at our back.\u201dThe president\u2019s conduct and the fight for control of Congress have overshadowed the 36 governor\u2019s races this year. But the state elections could prove even more consequential in reshaping policy and altering the long-term balance of power both in Washington and state capitals.Just as Republicans pulled a host of moderate states significantly to the right after their success eight years ago, victorious Democrats could enact sweeping changes on labor, health care and energy to tug a number of centrist states to the left and expand their policy ambitions in liberal states \u2014 fulfilling the growing expectations of their progressive base.Democrats would also be in position to protect their members of Congress when the House map is redrawn after the 2020 census. With 56 Democratic challengers outraising Republican incumbents in the last fund-raising period, senior leaders in both parties believe Democrats are likely to gain the 23 seats they need to take the chamber. Because state governments control redistricting, new Democratic governors could help cement the House gains, or at least block Republicans from repeating the post-2010 gerrymandering that helped entrench their power in Congress.The November election could have \u201cdecadal significance\u201d because of redistricting, said Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, the chairman of the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association.Mr. Inslee is all too well acquainted with wave elections. A former member of Congress, he was defeated in the Republican insurrection of 1994. The current political environment, he said, is reminiscent of that uprising.Should 2018 yield a large new class of Democratic governors, Mr. Inslee said, they would move quickly next year to shape policies that would put blue-tinged states even more sharply at odds with a Trump-led federal government.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a clean-energy jobs message can be very effective, virtually, in every state,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. He also cited gun-control and voting-rights laws as other areas where Democrats would take action. Across the country, he added, \u201cYou cannot overstate the anger, the concern and the desire to vote.\u201dIn a private meeting on Friday morning, Democratic governors reviewed their political strategy for the midterms: Corey Platt, a strategist for the governors, laid out a map of 18 Republican-controlled states where Democrats could conceivably take power, including five important Midwestern battlegrounds and traditionally conservative-leaning states like Tennessee and Georgia.Mr. Platt also highlighted several important races where the Republican Party\u2019s rightward lurch had widened political openings for Democrats, people familiar with the presentation said. In Florida, the president\u2019s support for Representative Ron DeSantis, a hard-line member of the House who appears frequently on Fox News, in a contested governor\u2019s primary has badly undermined Republican chances there, Mr. Platt argued.Mr. Platt also pointed to Adam Laxalt, Nevada\u2019s attorney general and Republican nominee for governor, as a candidate who could be too conservative to win a state Hillary Clinton carried two years ago.Mr. Laxalt is hindered by the refusal of Gov. Brian Sandoval \u2014 a more moderate Republican, who is departing \u2014 to endorse him. In a sign that the chill between the two has not thawed, Mr. Sandoval said in an interview here that he \u201cwon\u2019t support a candidate that is going to undo anything that I put forward.\u201dAs Democrats weighed how best to harness the anti-Trump energy, Republicans locked in competitive races acknowledged the headwinds they are facing and vowed to emphasize their own governing records and political identities to separate themselves from the president.Deploying euphemisms about \u201cWashington\u201d or \u201cnational politics\u201d so as not to offend the president and his supporters, Republican governors said they would seek to localize their races.\u201cThere\u2019s energy on the left, there\u2019s anger on the left and there\u2019s some signs of organization,\u201d said Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who is facing a competitive re-election bid. \u201cSo I think the role of the campaign is not only to communicate the message but to separate from Washington and differentiate what we\u2019ve done over the last four years.\u201dYet Mr. Trump remains hugely popular within the Republican Party, to a degree that even candidates in purple states are wary of seeking too much distance from him. And the president\u2019s enduring bond with rank-and-file conservatives could make him a crucial ally for Republicans in red states, like South Carolina and Oklahoma, where Democrats are trying to break through.Republicans also still have crucial structural advantages: The economy is roaring in many of the states where they hold power, the political committee led by Mr. Haslam has $87.5 million to spend on the midterms, and in state legislative elections, Republicans are shielded by gerrymandered district lines.As a result, even if Democrats win governorships in places like Ohio and Florida, they are all but certain to face divided governments and formidable Republican opposition.Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a moderate Democrat finishing his second term, said he expected the party to have to reach out to Republicans after the elections no matter how inviting the political environment appears to be.\u201cThey\u2019ll bring a voice of moderation,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said of potential Democratic governors, naming as an example Stacey Abrams, who is mounting a formidable bid for governor in traditionally red Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll swing way far to the left.\u201dBut if Republicans are likely to hold on to some measure of power in many states, there was no mistaking the deflated demeanor of a number of governors in Santa Fe.There were fewer Republicans than Democrats in attendance at the event, once a highlight of nearly every governor\u2019s calendar.Those who did come were candid about the difficulties Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive behavior and nationalist policies on issues like trade and immigration had created for the party.\u201cEvery ad is about immigration or a border wall,\u201d Mr. Haslam, who is leaving office next year, said with dismay about the Republican primary to succeed him. \u201cThe conversation has changed.\u201dDemocrats, though, expressed excitement.\u201cThis is the only time in my lifetime when I\u2019ve ever been aware of so many Republicans, moderate Republicans, who are throwing up their hands and in some cases writing checks to support Democratic candidates,\u201d said Mr. Hickenlooper, whose state is an example of one that has moved gradually to the left. \u201cI\u2019ve just never seen this level of dissatisfaction.\u201dThe scale of Democratic ambitions was on display Friday as Mr. Inslee campaigned at a local college with Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Democratic nominee for New Mexico\u2019s open governorship. They trumpeted Ms. Lujan Grisham\u2019s clean-energy plans and proposals for new environmental regulations, a suite of policies she cast as \u201crejecting the federal government\u201d and its rightward shift.Should Ms. Lujan Grisham win the general election, she would end eight years of divided government under Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, and deliver New Mexico wholly into Democratic hands \u2014 a prospect that Ms. Lujan Grisham said could clear the way for significant expansions on several fronts, clean energy chief among them.\u201cWe intend to catch up and then advance beyond all the other states,\u201d she declared.Her Republican opponent, Representative Steve Pearce, has urged voters to reject an all-Democratic government. But in a reflection of the perilous political environment, Mr. Pearce also stressed his willingness to clash with his own side \u2014 including Mr. Trump, whose demands for a border wall he has opposed.\u201cI\u2019ll fight Republicans as quickly as Democrats,\u201d Mr. Pearce said.Ms. Lujan Grisham suggested voters were most focused on one fight in particular: against a Republican administration in Washington that she described as harming New Mexico, and the president atop it.\u201cPeople are not just disappointed \u2014 they are alarmed by his behavior,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developing Countries May Need Their Own Strategies to Cope With Job-Taking Robots", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it\u2019s true that robots are coming for our jobs, developing countries could have a much tougher time coping with the shock.That poses particular concern for developing countries, where there are typically larger pools of unskilled labor working in agriculture or simple manufacturing roles.In the developed world, much of the discussion about how to address the rise of automation has focused on 1) how to constrain it and 2) how to cope with the fallout.Governments could constrain automation through policy measures such as disincentivization \u2014 by, say, taxing the use of robots \u2014 or reducing the cost of human labor through tax breaks or cutting minimum wages.The problem is that disincentivizing automation could just push it into other nations. Developing countries are likely to feel unable to implement those kinds of constraints, for fear of companies or even entire sectors relocating to regions where the use of robots isn\u2019t penalized.Mr. Schlogl told DealBook the impact of automation could be felt acutely by sectors that are labor-intensive in developing countries, irrespective of where robots are put to use. Cheap goods can be built by machines in one location and distributed worldwide; a single country could mechanize agriculture and flood a subcontinent with affordable produce.As for cutting labor costs, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much lower wages can get in many developing countries before they become unethical.The second way for governments to cope with the disruption caused by automation is to implement strategies that deal with the effects. That includes retraining workers to give them skills required for future jobs, or providing citizens with a basic income to make up for stagnant wages or job losses.Retraining would be hard to implement in developing nations, argue Mr. Schlogl and Mr. Sumner, because they typically have limited education sectors in place through which to deliver it. And a universal basic income, they argue, would be hard to finance in developing countries, as it assumes the existence of a highly productive services sector from which to siphon money, which is often missing in such economies.There are some potential routes forward. One idea suggested by Mr. Schlogl and Mr. Sumner is a so-called global universal basic income \u2014 administered internationally, and paid for in developing countries via aid. This plan, says Mr. Schlogl, \u201chas the advantage of being only politically impossible.\u201dAnother might be for developing countries to build out labor-intensive sectors that look set to be resistant to automation over the coming decades \u2014 such as social care, education, health care, tourism or infrastructure construction. But this is a risky approach, requiring large upfront investment without a guarantee of protection from automation in the long-term.That makes the pair\u2019s ultimate conclusion \u2014 that \u201cwe need to ask different policy and research questions\u201d about how automation will affect the developing world \u2014 seem justifiable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Times Reporters Answer Questions About Our G.D.P. Coverage", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo New York Times reporters answer 11 questions that readers submitted seeking more insight into our coverage of the gross domestic product.We invited readers to pose questions to Times journalists on both of those dimensions. The questions have been lightly edited.Those estimates do not mean that the economy can\u2019t grow at a 3 percent or even 4 percent rate for a quarter or two here and there, or even for a full year. Indeed, many economists on Wall Street think growth for the full year could hit 3 percent for the first time since 2005.But most economists \u2014 again, not just those on the left \u2014 think that the United States will struggle to maintain growth much above 2 percent for more than a year or two. A big part of the reason is demographics: The aging of the baby-boom generation means we\u2019ll have fewer workers to support more retirees, dragging down growth. (Immigration could help offset that trend, but current policy is pushing in the other direction.) And for reasons not fully understood, rates of growth throughout the developed world have slowed since about 2000.That said, economists are notoriously bad at forecasting long-term trends. (They\u2019re not always so great at short-term ones either.) Not many saw the post-2000 slowdown coming, so it\u2019s certainly possible that there\u2019s an acceleration around the corner that economists don\u2019t know about yet. There were some other quirks in the report as well: Consumer spending rose sharply, a trend that was probably due mostly to a real increase in demand, but also reflected a rebound from a weak showing the previous quarter. A. There is a robust (and sometimes acrimonious) debate within economics over the underlying causes of inflation, and I\u2019m not going to get into it in depth here. But in terms of what\u2019s happening right now, the concern at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street is that unemployment is well below the rate many economists consider sustainable in the long term. According to standard economic theory, that should lead to faster inflation \u2014 although some economists, particularly on the left, note that there\u2019s little evidence of an acceleration so far.The Fed is trying to keep inflation under control by gradually raising interest rates \u2014 in effect pulling money out of the economy. But its job is being made more difficult by the tax cuts and by government-spending increases that took effect earlier this year, which are essentially acting as a fiscal stimulus. In December, for example, Goldman Sachs projected that the tax bill would add three-tenths of 1 percentage point to growth in the next two years. Back then, Goldman, the Federal Reserve and several Wall Street analysts forecast G.D.P. growth for 2018 would be in the 2.5 to 2.6 percent range, and expected it would fall below 2 percent in 2019. At the moment, the economy is on track to do better than that \u2014 coming in at or just below the 3 percent mark in 2018. A. Almost every economist expects a trade war to drag down economic growth around the world, although its impact will vary widely depending on the country and sector. Over all, the United States \u2014 because it has such a large and diversified economy \u2014 is probably in a better position to withstand the disruption than other industrialized nations. But most of the ways presidents affect the economy are long-term: They can help promote tax and regulatory environments that are conducive to business investment; they can help foster education and welfare systems that ensure a healthy population with valuable skills; they can promote policies on trade, immigration and spending that set the country up for sustainable growth. All those policies are important, but their effects take years, if not decades, to play out.A. The figures for the nation\u2019s overall growth don\u2019t reveal how that prosperity is being distributed. What we have seen is that labor\u2019s share of G.D.P. has fallen over the decades, while corporate profits have gobbled up a larger and larger share of the nation\u2019s wealth. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America First or Trump First?", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe second I finished watching President Trump fawning over Vladimir Putin in Helsinki \u2014 refusing to defend the conclusions of his own intelligence services about Russia\u2019s interference in our 2016 elections \u2014 I knew I was seeing something I\u2019d never seen before. It took a few days to figure it out, but now it\u2019s obvious: I was seeing a U.S. president put Russia first, not America first.On each key question \u2014 how much Russian agents were involved in trying to tip our elections, how that issue should be further investigated, and Putin\u2019s behavior on the world stage generally (like his government\u2019s involvement in the downing of the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine, the murder of Russian journalists and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K.) \u2014 Trump embraced Putin\u2019s explanations and excuses over the judgments of his own spy agencies, Justice Department, European allies and bedrock American values.I like what Arnold Schwarzenegger said to Trump afterward: \u201cYou\u2019re the president of the United States. You shouldn\u2019t do that. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dWatching longtime anti-Russia hawks \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 shucking off everything they\u2019ve said over the years and ignoring Trump\u2019s coddling of Putin and his trashing of the F.B.I. in order to grab jobs they\u2019d long coveted is witnessing careerism, sycophancy and cynicism on an industrial scale.What are the unintended consequences of a U.S. president simultaneously starting trade wars with China, the European Union and Canada, putting Russia first over America first, preferring Putin and other autocrats over our traditional democratic allies, slashing corporate taxes and supercharging the national debt \u2014 without any compensating tax increases or spending cuts, thereby putting pressure on interest rates and the trade deficit \u2014 ignoring climate change and eliminating all restraints on the exploitation of fossil fuels, breaking the Iran nuclear deal and now threatening war with Iran, limiting immigration into our already tight labor markets, steadily eroding Obamacare and violating so many norms of how a president should behave toward his staff, allies and Americans not from his own party?What are the unintended consequences of all of these at once \u2014 none of which have been the product of traditional interagency analyses or expert hearings in Congress, but simply the crude fulfillment of campaign promises that emerged from Trump\u2019s gut?Who knows? Maybe there will be some good consequences \u2014 maybe China and Iran will cave to Trump\u2019s demands; maybe the economy and stock market will continue to surge; maybe the early promising signs from Trump\u2019s impulsive outreach to North Korea will bear fruit.What I know for sure, though, is that no U.S. president can break so many longstanding relationships, ignore so much basic science and economics and violate so many norms of presidential behavior without unintended consequences. But they will take time to play out.For instance, as Nader Mousavizadeh, co-founder of Macro Advisory Partners, a geopolitical consulting firm based in London, put it to me: \u201cWhat America\u2019s allies in Europe learned from Trump\u2019s recent visit is that the United States, at his direction, is acting more like predator than partner. They are concluding that Trump is not looking for a better deal with the European Union. He\u2019s looking to destroy the European Union. And even though they understand the difference between the president and the government he leads, they know the West may never be the same again.\u201dSo, with the G.O.P. having completely folded and with the few Trump advisers with spine neutered or fired, is there any restraint left around him?There is one critical defense line left \u2014 that formed by F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. By coincidence, two days after Helsinki, all four spoke at the Aspen Security Forum, which I attended.Wray, Coats and Rosenstein all rose to the occasion. They knew Helsinki was a test of their institutions and themselves, and they passed it with flying colors \u2014 always putting America first and not Trump first when it really mattered.Wray was unflinching. Asked about Putin\u2019s denials in Helsinki of involvement in our election, Wray said: \u201cHe\u2019s got his view. He\u2019s expressed his view. I can tell you what my view is. The intelligence community\u2019s assessment has not changed, my view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.\u201dWray also let lawmakers and other critics know that their conspiracy theories about the F.B.I. and Justice Department\u2019s Russia investigations were not intimidating him: \u201cI\u2019m a low-key, understated guy, but that should not be mistaken for what my spine is made out of. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201dCoats had already demonstrated his steel and integrity before coming to the conference. Immediately after Trump\u2019s performance in Helsinki impugning the conclusions of the intelligence agencies, Coats put out a statement defending them. He gave the White House a heads-up that it was coming \u2014 but did not ask, \u201cCaptain, may I?\u201dCoats said: \u201cWe have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.\u201dRosenstein backed up Coats 100 percent, declaring: \u201cAs Director Coats made clear, these [Russian] actions are persistent, they are pervasive, and they are meant to undermine America\u2019s democracy on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is election time or not.\u201dUnfortunately, the secretary of homeland security showed no such spine. Asked if the Russians had intervened to favor Trump, Nielsen said with a straight face: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any evidence that the attempts to interfere in our election infrastructure was to favor a particular political party. I think what we\u2019ve seen on the foreign influence side is they were attempting to intervene and cause chaos on both sides.\u201dThat was the sound of a senior national security official putting Trump first, not America first. Nielsen proved to be a shameful coward. I sure hope we do not have a homeland security crisis on her watch.Which brings me back to Schwarzenegger\u2019s question \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d It applies not just to the president but also all the people enabling him. Why do they so freely sacrifice their own reputations and their own integrity to defend a man with no integrity, a man who would sell each and every one of them down the river the second he decided it was in his interest? It is inexplicable to me.At least Stormy Daniels got paid.An earlier version of this column misstated the name of a former economic adviser to President Trump. He is Gary Cohn; not Cohen.Advertisement"}

Our consciences, naturally abhorring everything abominable, tell us that such things simply ought not exist. And yet we also know that the evil they represent is one we would not really want eradicated. Somehow we depend on it, not because it appeals to some morbid subliminal fascination with the horrific in us, and not even because it teaches us about the world\u2019s deep Darwinian laws, but because it answers to a psychological need.By exciting in the rest of us that sweet cold loathing that only they induce \u2014 that strangely tender malice, at once so delicious and yet so purifying \u2014 the Yankees and their followers provide an emotional cleansing. They give us occasion for the discharge of a dark, dangerous passion, but one unburdened by guilt.

And somehow, without having to see, one knows things about them: that the categories \u201cparent,\u201d \u201csibling\u201d and \u201cmate\u201d are only hazily delineated in their minds; that they suck nourishment from cellulose, heavy metals and cactus spines; that, should they grow hungry on the journey home from the game, they may pull over to the side of the road to devour their young. One simply knows. \u2026Or so it seems to me now. Admittedly, my bitterness over the Orioles\u2019 dismal play this season might be distorting my perspective a little. And perhaps I am avoiding a truth about the Yankees and their fans that I would rather not admit: that it is not everything grotesquely strange about them that terrifies us, but rather everything that is all too familiar. We may fear becoming like them; our greater fear, however, is of discovering that we already are. And by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean \u201cAmericans.\u201dMajor League Baseball, like America, is in decline. A faint air of doom hangs about this most exquisite of games. The median age of its fans rises each year; the young increasingly prefer other diversions; some savants predict a contraction of the National and American Leagues in the near future. Meanwhile, the only solutions the owners can contrive are trivial measures for shortening time of play, and never with appreciable effect. Yet the real cause of the problem is obvious. Though there has always been an immense inequality of resources between the richest and poorest franchises, the division has widened to catastrophic proportions in recent decades. It is hard to persuade children to invest their love in teams that cannot plausibly hope for a championship any time within, oh, the first 30 years of their lives.And so, of course, the Yankees cannot help but be emblematic of everything that characterizes us as a nation and as an idea: a thing gargantuan and heedless, invincible and yet bizarrely fragile and self-destructive. Still, I suppose one must be fair. M.L.B.\u2019s decline, America\u2019s \u2014 the Yankees may contribute mightily to the former, but they only epitomize the latter.Though, truth be told, I would blame them for both if I could.David Bentley Hart is the author of \u201cThe New Testament: A Translation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Joint News Conference by Trump and Putin: Full Video and Transcript", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter meeting privately in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia held a joint news conference. Following is a transcript as prepared by the Federal News Service.___________Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime, the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join ranks and work together. Hopefully we will reach this understanding with our American partners.Today\u2019s negotiations reflected our joint wish \u2014 our joint wish with President Trump to readdress this negative situation in the bilateral relationship. I outlined first steps for improving this relationship, to restore the acceptable level of trust and going back to the previous level of interaction on all mutual interest issues. As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. (inaudible) vital \u2014 and we mentioned this here in the negotiations \u2014 it\u2019s crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions. We believe it necessary to work together further on \u2014 to interact on the disarmament agenda, military and technical cooperation. This includes the extension of the Strategic Offensive Arms Limitation Treaty. It\u2019s a dangerous situation with a global American antimissile defense system, it\u2019s the implementation issues with the INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces] treaty. And, of course, the agenda of non-placement of weapons in space.Clearly, we mentioned the regional crisis, for instance Syria. As far as Syria is concerned, the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of the successful joint work. Russia and the United States apparently can act proactively and take considerable leadership on this issue, and organize the interaction to overcome humanitarian crisis and help Syrian refugees to go back to their homes.While we discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, we paid special attention to the bona fide implementation of Minsk Agreements by Kiev. At the same time, United States could be more decisive in nudging the Ukrainian leadership, and encourage it to work actively on this.We paid more attention to economic ties and economic cooperation. It\u2019s clear that both countries \u2014 the business of both countries are interested in this. American delegation was one of the largest delegations in the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. It featured over 500 representatives from American businesses. We agreed \u2014 me and President Trump \u2014 we agreed to create a high-level working group that would bring together captains of Russian and American business. After all, entrepreneurs and businessmen know better how to articulate this successful business cooperation. We\u2019ll let them think and make their proposals and suggestions in this regard.Once again, President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia with the American elections, and I had to reiterate things I said several times, including during our personal contacts, that the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process.In general, we are glad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting, because previously we only had a chance to talk briefly on international fora. We had a good conversation with President Trump, and I hope that we start to understand each other better. And I\u2019m grateful to Donald for it. Clearly there are some challenges left when we were not able to clear all the backlog, but I think that we made the first important step in this direction. And in conclusion, I want to point out that this atmosphere of cooperation is something that we are especially grateful for to our Finnish hosts. We are grateful for Finnish people and Finnish leadership for what they\u2019ve done. I know that we\u2019ve caused some inconvenience to Finland and we apologize for it. Thank you for your attention.I\u2019m here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy. From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility. A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world. The disagreements between our two countries are well known and President Putin and I discussed them at length today. But if we\u2019re going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we\u2019re going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests.Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything. As president, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics, or the media, or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As president, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people.During today\u2019s meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I felt this was a message best delivered in person. Spent a great deal of time talking about it. And President Putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly, because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea. We also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity: nuclear proliferation. I provided an update on my meeting last month with Chairman Kim on the denuclearization of North Korea. And after today, I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem, going to work with us. And I appreciate that commitment.The president and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. Both Russia and the United States has suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace. Last year, we told Russia about a planned attack in St. Petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold. They found them. They stopped them. There was no doubt about it. I appreciated President Putin\u2019s phone call afterwards to thank me.I also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions, and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the Middle East. As we discussed at length, the crisis in Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against ISIS. We have just about eradicated ISIS in the area.Our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in America\u2019s desire for friendship, cooperation and peace. And I think I can speak on behalf of Russia, when I say that, also. President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States. Our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia, the United States, for the greater good of all. And this was a very constructive day, this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together. It\u2019s in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today. So again, President Putin, thank you very much.Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller \u2014 we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioning. But in this case, there is a \u2014 there\u2019s another condition. This kind of effort should be a mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and that they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence service of the United States, whom we believe are \u2014 who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to \u2014 to request the presence of our law enforcement.An earlier version of this transcript, prepared by the Federal News Service, omitted part of a question asked of President Vladimir V. Putin to which Mr. Putin replied, \u201cYes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\u201d The transcript now reflects his full question. No other portion has been altered by The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Plays Down Trade Woes and Suggests Rosy Economic Outlook", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials presented a rosy economic report card to Congress on Friday, playing down risks to growth from trade tensions and declaring that the financial system is \u201csubstantially more resilient than during the decade before the financial crisis.\u201dThe Fed released its semiannual Monetary Policy Report just ahead of scheduled testimony before the House and Senate next week by Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman.The Fed\u2019s report suggests officials are likely to stay on their telegraphed path of gradually raising interest rates to bring them back to historically normal levels. Officials raised rates at their June meeting, to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent, and signaled that they could raise rates twice more for a total of four rate increases this year.At times, the report reads like a bit of self-congratulation among Fed officials for their performance in recent years, including steering inflation close to the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target, supporting strong economic growth and a low unemployment rate, and pushing Wall Street firms to strengthen their defenses against a potential financial shock.It drops language from previous reports that stressed worry that inflation would continue to run below the target. It also reaffirms that economic activity \u201cincreased at a solid pace\u201d for the first half of the year and that \u201cthe labor market has continued to strengthen.\u201dThe report highlights some lingering concerns in the economy, most notably slow wage growth. Adjusted for inflation, earnings for most American workers have not risen in the past year. Other measures, which include employer-provided benefits such as health care, have increased after inflation is factored in, but not by as much as could be expected when the unemployment rate is about 4 percent.Officials blamed that sluggishness on persistent weakness in labor productivity.\u201cThose moderate rates of compensation gains likely reflect the offsetting influences of a strong labor market and persistently weak productivity growth,\u201d officials wrote.The economic development that has most concerned stock markets and economists in recent months \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s escalating trade war with China and allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union \u2014 barely registers in the report as a threat to the recovery.While noting that trade concerns have rattled stock traders, bond buyers and currency markets, officials said they were confident that the Fed\u2019s current policy path was the right one to handle those concerns.\u201cMany participants continued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cThis view was predicated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of policy firming likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other considerations, the possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy could have larger or more persistent positive effects on real activity and that shifts in trade policy or developments abroad could weigh on the expansion.\u201dThe report includes several observations about the evolving structure of the United States economy that carry implications for policymakers, particularly members of Congress and the administration as they seek to get able-bodied individuals back to work. The Fed attributes a decline in work force participation among less-educated Americans in part to technological advancements that have automated jobs.And it says a decline in participation among women, as compared with other industrial nations, is being driven by family policies in the workplace that do not support working parents.\u201cCaregiving responsibilities play an important role\u201d in explaining why prime-age women participate less in the work force than men, the report says. \u201cThis decision may reflect a lack of affordable child care.\u201dThe report notes that rising oil prices have cost American families, on average, $300 a year more in gasoline. But it makes the case that oil price increases are far less damaging to the economy over all than they used to be, because of a surge in domestic oil production over the last decade.That surge means that more of the money Americans spend on gasoline now stays in the country, the report says: \u201cOn net, the drag on G.D.P. from higher oil prices is likely a small fraction of what it was a decade ago and should get smaller still if U.S. oil production continues to grow as expected.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perils of the Trump Cult", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn wants to ride the president\u2019s coattails to the Senate. But will her plan backfire?Mr. Cavendish is the former editor of The Nashville Scene.NASHVILLE \u2014 Few candidates have lashed themselves to President Donald Trump quite like Tennessee\u2019s Marsha Blackburn, the Republican Party\u2019s choice to succeed Bob Corker in the Senate. Consider the scene at a rally in Nashville in May, where both candidate and president stood on stage together. And that\u2019s more or less where the Republican Party stands as well, lashed to an unpredictable president. It\u2019s true nationwide, but nowhere is this shift as clearly on display as in the South. There, home to a large chunk of his base, prospective candidates have little choice but to get on board or get out of politics. Even Mark Sanford, a conservative congressman from South Carolina who dared to voice the slightest occasional criticism of the president, was beaten in a primary by a candidate who promised absolute loyalty to Mr. Trump.So it\u2019s easy to understand Ms. Blackburn\u2019s fealty. But that fealty comes with a price. And if her experience so far is any guide, it will be a growing problem for Republican candidates who allow the president\u2019s ad hoc, often extreme agenda to box them in, cutting off not just independents and moderates but even a chunk of conservatives \u2014 even here in the South.Senator Corker, whose seat Ms. Blackburn would like to fill, called the Trump-era Republican Party \u201ccultish.\u201d Ms. Blackburn is firmly in the cult. She was one of 15 House Republicans who signed a letter nominating Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize before he ever met with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a move that seems premature in the wake of the duo\u2019s Singapore meeting. She was an early primary supporter of Mr. Trump in 2016, and even floated herself as a vice-presidential option.But as with any cult, membership may bring praise from the leader, but it will also create awkward situations when dealing with the outside world. When Mr. Trump announced tariffs on steel, the state\u2019s auto industry braced for the impact. Mr. Corker and Lamar Alexander, the state\u2019s senior senator, were quick to denounce the move, but Ms. Blackburn could only waffle, saying she was \u201cwaiting to see\u201d the plan. Tennessee\u2019s automakers and suppliers are a potent force in the state economy, responsible for 135,000 jobs and 830,000 vehicles in 2016. If tariffs start to dig into their profits, they won\u2019t stay silent \u2014 and Ms. Blackburn, as the local voice of the Trumpist Republican Party, will bear the brunt of their criticism.A week after the tariff announcement, the news blew up around the Trump administration\u2019s policy of child separation for undocumented immigrants. Mr. Corker slammed the change in direction from the Obama and Bush years, saying that children \u201cshould be protected and not used for deterrence.\u201d But Ms. Blackburn followed the president\u2019s line that Democrats were to blame. \u201cWe are in this position because liberals would not pay to enforce our immigration laws,\u201d she said. It was only days later, after the president himself indicated he might change the policy, that Ms. Blackburn said the process had to end.Just one day later, a government report calling for the sale of government assets, including Tennessee Valley Authority transmission lines \u2014 considered sacrosanct by Tennessee voters \u2014 forced Ms. Blackburn to attempt to distance herself from the president yet again. But few people are buying it: A candidate who has promised to do everything to implement the president\u2019s agenda is not very convincing when she tries to walk away from the specifics.Obviously, there are a lot of voters who will support Ms. Blackburn as long as she supports the president \u2014 he won Tennessee by 26 points. But for the rest, Ms. Blackburn is creating a huge opening for her Democratic opponent, former Governor Phil Bredesen, to not just capture the center but to also peel away a few conservatives by positioning himself as the real defender of the state\u2019s interests. \u201cWhat these tariffs amount to are attacks on Tennessee,\u201d he said, adding that it would \u201ccertainly kill jobs.\u201d The state is also home to a large distilling industry, including the Jack Daniel\u2019s distillery, whose parent company\u2019s stock dropped 8 percent after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey. Ms. Blackburn retreated, while Mr. Bredesen prepared ads with whiskey barrels in the background.This is the dance that many Republicans must do in 2018: Sidestep the specifics of Trumpism, but embrace Trump. And in that tension, many Democrats may have a road map for success in deeply red areas, especially if they can put up popular centrist candidates like Mr. Bredesen. Already, 69 percent of the state\u2019s independents have a favorable view of Mr. Bredesen, compared with just 44 percent for Ms. Blackburn. Of course, Ms. Blackburn has some built-in advantages: In Tennessee, 42 percent identify as Republican here versus just 29 percent as Democrat. To win, Democrats need to run less as party stalwarts than as the independently minded alternative to lock-step Trumpism.Also unlike many national Democrats, he has not demonized the president. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States and if he has an idea and is pushing some things that I think are good for the people of Tennessee, I\u2019m going be for it. It doesn\u2019t matter where it came from,\u201d Mr. Bredesen says in a TV ad that has run on heavy rotation in the state since March. \u201cAnd likewise, if I think it\u2019s not going to be good for Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be against it. I think that\u2019s what senators ought to do.\u201dIt\u2019s a message that even Trump supporters might find appealing \u2014 independent, pragmatic thinking that conveniently allows Mr. Bredesen to pivot between criticism and agreement with the White House, a flexibility that Ms. Blackburn and other Trumpist candidates have denied themselves. If more Democrats can make that distinction, particularly in the South, they might manage to make the South a little less red this fall.Steve Cavendish, a freelance journalist in Nashville, is the former editor of The Washington City Paper and The Nashville Scene.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s time for the Macron government to bring long-awaited economic opportunity to those neighborhoods.Contributing Opinion Writer \u201cI think allowing millions and millions of people to come to Europe is very, very sad,\u201d President Trump said during his current good-will tour of the Continent. \u201cI think you are losing your culture.\u201dMr. Trump, meet Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the 19-year-old breakout star of France\u2019s newly crowned World Cup soccer champions. The son of an Algerian mother and Cameroonian father, Mbapp\u00e9 is emblematic of a team of immigrants \u2014 16 of its 23 players are from families recently arrived in France. They\u2019ve just made an entire nation very, very glad of its diversity \u2014 at least for one day.Brazilians, Argentines, Italians and Germans may object, but France can now lay claim to being master of the beautiful game. Over the past 20 years, France has won two of the quadrennial World Cups and placed second in a third. France\u2019s soccer success is global in another way. Under the rules of FIFA, international soccer\u2019s governing group, players can suit up for countries where their parents or grandparents were born, even if they were not. Some 50 French-born players took part in this year\u2019s World Cup. More than half wore another country\u2019s jersey. Brazil, the next-biggest feeder country, provided 28 participants, including five to other teams. Over the past four World Cups, France has contributed more native-born players than any other country.First, in the decades after World War II, the French government recruited successive waves of immigrants \u2014 first from Southern and Eastern Europe and North Africa, later from West Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean \u2014 to rebuild the country and then meet a labor shortage. By the 1970s, France had taken in more immigrants \u2014 some 2.7 million \u2014 than any other European country. Most settled in the mostly nonwhite, working-class suburbs \u2014 \u201cles banlieues\u201d \u2014 that ring its major cities.Second, after a long postwar period of soccer failure, France established a national academy in the early 1970s to identify, recruit and train local youth. It put a special emphasis on hardscrabble immigrant areas around Paris, where nearly 40 percent of new arrivals take root \u2014 and where almost one-third of the members of this year\u2019s world championship team were born, including Mbapp\u00e9.In the hours after Team France\u2019s victory in Russia, an iconic photograph of President Emmanuel Macron of France cheering on the team circled the globe \u2014 a powerful image of youth, vigor and success. Mr. Macron will probably get an immediate and welcome bounce in public opinion polls, where he has taken a beating after ramming unpopular but necessary labor and tax reforms through parliament. The larger test for Mr. Macron is whether he can do for the banlieues what the banlieues have done for French soccer. It\u2019s a start. One new \u201cmethod\u201d Mr. Macron might consider is the approach France took to cultivate its soccer talent \u2014 a sustained, focused national effort to find, nurture, train and place future Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s in France\u2019s newly vibrant economy. Mr. Macron has until the next World Cup \u2014 when his first term ends \u2014 to get it right. Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.You could say America is heading toward a poverty-based economy. Less-skilled workers are paid as little as employers can get away with, so the products and services they produce will be as inexpensive as possible, so other insufficiently paid workers can afford them.The authority\u2019s current minimum wage is $10.45 an hour, but workers at the New York airports earn at least $13 an hour because of the state\u2019s minimum wage laws. Under the new measure, the minimum wage for workers at Newark Liberty would rise to $12.45 an hour in September. By Sept. 1, 2019, the minimum wage at all three airports would increase to $15.60 an hour, and then it would increase in steps to $19 an hour on Sept. 1, 2023.The higher pay can\u2019t come soon enough for Takiah Garrett, a wheelchair agent at Newark Liberty.

You can see the sadness on his face when he says that his pay is so low that, even with occasional jobs as a bouncer, he cannot afford the fees for the summer football program his son loves. His family in the South helped pay for his wife\u2019s funeral, and his 80-year-old aunt sends him a little money when she can.But there are issues beyond pay. Mr. Styles runs a seven-person cabin-cleaning crew who sometimes have less than five minutes per plane to complete their job. \u201cI have been threatened with being suspended if my crew\u2019s work delayed the flight,\u201d he said.The Port Authority board can ease financial pressure on workers like Mr. Styles and Ms. Garrett by passing the wage resolution when it reconsiders it after an extended 30-pay period for comments, preferably without nickel-and-dime revisions that some employers want. It will take continued activism by unions to ease their pressures on the job and help restore some of the dignity that so many American workers have lost.An earlier version of this editorial misstated when the Port Authority board would vote on a new wage plan for airport workers. It will be in September, not in 30 days.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Averts a Trade War With Trump. But Can It Trust Him?", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 When he arrived in the Oval Office for negotiations over their growing trade war, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, brought a small gift for President Trump, a renowned admirer of military commanders. It was a photograph of the cemetery in Luxembourg where Gen. George S. Patton is buried.Mr. Juncker, a wily, if often maligned, former prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, added an inscription, alluding to the shared sacrifice of Americans and Europeans during World War II. \u201cDear Donald,\u2019\u2019 it read. \u201cLet us remember our common history.\u201dMr. Juncker left the Oval Office on Wednesday with a deal \u2014 or at least a truce \u2014 that for the moment has defused the Trump administration\u2019s growing trade war with Brussels, while bringing relief across Europe, especially in Germany. Yet if Europe\u2019s political and business leaders are cautiously optimistic that an economic crisis has been averted, they are also wary, given their history with Mr. Trump in the 18 months since he has taken office.Even as Mr. Trump cast the meeting on Wednesday as a great success, and offered gratitude to Mr. Juncker, the question is whether the deal represents a meaningful improvement in the severely strained trans-Atlantic alliance, or is simply another example of the unpredictable approach of a president who has spent months mocking and undermining European leaders \u2014 even describing the European bloc as a \u201cfoe.\u201d\u201cThe question is, how much do you give in to a bully?\u201d asked Maria Demertzis, the deputy director of Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels. \u201cThis could just be perfunctory, and if it just stops extra tariffs, that\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t really depend on Trump. His understanding of global trade is bilateral balance, which is as good as arbitrary, given global supply chains. And it depends on what side of the bed he wakes up on tomorrow.\u201dFor Mr. Juncker, the outcome was a triumph, even if he made concessions. The negotiations are also a reminder that Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, still dominate the European Union. Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose large new unilateral tariffs on imported automobiles shook German business to the core \u2014 and it would also have had a large impact on the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain and other countries that are important suppliers and manufacturers to the German car industry.\u201cJuncker\u2019s achievement was to get Trump to say publicly that he would reconsider steel and aluminum tariffs and not impose car tariffs in return for a negotiation,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel. \u201cFor the E.U., the gun is still loaded but it\u2019s not pointed at our heads, so for us it\u2019s a good moment to negotiate.\u201dIndeed, some analysts argued that the new negotiations effectively represent a resurrection, in some fashion, of the effort begun by former President Barack Obama \u2014 and halted by President Trump \u2014 for a free-trade pact with Europe, known then as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T.T.I.P. Together, the United States and the European Union comprise half of the global economy, and analysts were optimistic about the commitment by Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker to work together to overhaul the World Trade Organization, especially given the rising power of China.Focusing on the W.T.O. also better fits the European Union\u2019s overall strategy, which is to defend the multilateral world order of rules and law \u2014 rather than the kind of bilateral deal Mr. Juncker and Mr. Trump just discussed.For Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations, the mere fact that Mr. Trump negotiated directly with Mr. Juncker, as the head of the European Union institution in charge of trade, is vital.\u201cThere was a real danger that the unified position of the E.U. could break open if Trump singled out industries and countries on tariffs,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cTrade must remain an E.U. competence, otherwise the single market is meaningless.\u201dMr. Trump has angrily denounced America\u2019s trade deficit with the European Union, even as he has come under increasing domestic political pressure from farmers, businesses and the auto industry over his tariffs. On Wednesday, Mr. Juncker promised to increase purchases of American soybeans and American liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. But Ms. Demertzis said it was less clear how quickly the Europeans could deliver on those promises \u2014 meaning that the immediate value for Mr. Trump may be political.\u201cEurope has decided to change its trade policies,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Center for International Political Economy, \u201cwhich gives Trump something to sell to his political base.\u201dEuropean officials said that their offer on soybeans was important for Mr. Trump and for the success of the meeting, given that roughly 30 percent of American soybean production has traditionally gone to China. \u201cI thank you for that, Jean-Claude,\u201d Mr. Trump said, going off-script from an agreed statement.European officials and analysts acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on the auto industry was a powerful one that forced a European response, despite vows not to negotiate as long as the metal tariffs were in force. As for Mr. Juncker\u2019s claim that the suspension of that threat was \u201ca major concession,\u201d Mr. Ma\u00e7\u00e3es was amused.\u201cSo if I threaten to burn down a house unless the owner pays me, and refrain from doing it when he pays, there were concessions on both sides?\u201d he asked.Still, it was a great relief for Germany, whose foreign minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the agreement to start talks. It shows, he said on Thursday, that \u201cThe answer to America First can only be: Europe United.\u201dIndeed, European leaders now seem to have concluded that the only way to deal with Mr. Trump is to negotiate with him \u2014 a stance Mr. Juncker and other Europeans once rejected as inimical to the global system.For Ms. Demertzis, there are dangers in this new tactic. Not only does it cut against Europe\u2019s stance as the great defender of the multilateral order, it also risks feeding the tiger, the unpredictable Mr. Trump.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the end of this, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only thing that drives the message home in Washington is bad outcomes. The E.U. must stay the course and use proportional measures to whatever comes out of Washington and take the heat until the message gets home.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Is Wrong About Trade. So Is Everyone Else.", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American president isn\u2019t alone in misunderstanding how competition actually works in the global economy.Mr. Tooze is an economic historian.In fairness to Mr. Trump, one should add that he made clear that calling the Europeans a foe did not mean to imply that the Europeans were \u201cbad.\u201d What was on his mind was, he said, \u201cwhat they do to us in trade.\u201dOn July 25, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president, will be in Washington to discuss just this topic with Mr. Trump. Mr. Juncker is likely to repeat the familiar European line: When it comes to trade, the United States and Europe are not competitors but partners. To think, as Mr. Trump appears to do, of nations locked in mortal economic rivalry shows a grave misunderstanding of how competition actually works in the global economy. Competition is, of course, an ordering principle. If neoliberalism is about anything, it has been about creating the largest possible economic space for competition. But the protagonists aren\u2019t supposed to be states (or at least not members of the Atlantic club) but businesses, investors and workers. It is the job of trade and investment treaties to regulate what preference can be shown to national firms, what rights will be extended to foreign investors. The European Union boasts of particularly tough internal regulations in this regard. National preference is outlawed as far as possible.This interconnection cuts both ways. We hang together in sickness as well as in health. It is not just manufacturing but finance too that is integrated across borders. When the real estate bubble burst in 2008, European as well as American banks imploded. To keep them alive, the U.S. Federal Reserve provided liquidity running into the trillions of dollars both to their branches on Wall Street and by way of the liquidity swap lines extended to the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank. The Fed took this extraordinary step because previous decades had built a system of integration so close that it would have been lethal for the United States not to act. Saving the American financial system meant saving Europe\u2019s banks, too. But for all this integration, globalization has been haunted by a cognitive dissonance, to which Mr. Trump gives crude expression. In the popular imagination and in the words of politicians, the world economy continues to be thought of like the World Cup: cosmopolitan and transnational, yet made up of discrete national teams competing for a single prize. The lingua franca of policy talk is \u201cnational competitiveness.\u201dAngela Merkel\u2019s Germany, supposedly the last great anchor of the liberal world order, is hopelessly addicted to national competitiveness talk. Berlin measures the success of its economic policy not in terms of domestic investment or domestic well-being, but above all in the scale of its trade surplus.Nor is it merely a German obsession. Competitiveness is an endlessly repeated mantra of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk tweets about it all the time.So what then is so upsetting about Mr. Trump\u2019s latest outburst?One of the president\u2019s favorite taboo-breaking moves is that he likes to name enemies, especially those hiding in what is supposed to be America\u2019s own camp. In doing so, he not only offends Atlanticist decorum but also violates a more specific injunction, which permits politicians to talk as much as they like about global competition but not about specific competitors. Normal talk about globalization and competitiveness is directed inward, to the nation. It serves as a call to discipline and hard work. Mr. Trump is taking the idea and pointing it outward, calling out his supposed foes. In so doing, he deliberately fosters economic nationalism. Conventional competitiveness rhetoric treads a fine line. The point is to stir the pot without causing things to bubble over. With Davos types like Ms. Merkel, you know that whatever rhetoric they employ in public, there are people working behind the scenes who respect international law and global treaties, who understand that blatant national favoritism will blow the system up. The same cannot be said for the Trump administration, which has actually imposed tariffs. They are modest so far, but Mr. Trump has a relish for escalation. And this evokes an even deeper fear. It is one thing to indulge in competitiveness talk in a world fundamentally headed toward integration. But Mr. Trump speaks this way in a world in which the direction of travel is profoundly uncertain.Caught between China and the United States, you can see why the Europeans are feeling nervous. The European Union has little clout with which to sway either Beijing or Washington. Europe\u2019s main options are defensive: It can react to Mr. Trump\u2019s aggression with targeted trade retaliation. The French would like something more vigorous, but Mr. Juncker is hamstrung by German fears about prohibitive tariffs on cars. Brussels can block what look like dangerous Chinese acquisitions and seek to protect property rights of European businesses and European citizens in their Chinese ventures.But if Europe does care about the liberal order in a broader sense, it must go further. It needs to break its own competitiveness obsession, of which its huge trade surplus is the most glaring expression. It is not a matter of kowtowing to Mr. Trump. To think of redressing the surplus as a concession is to continue the habit of competitiveness talk. For its own sake, Europe needs more domestic demand, above all more investment. One should not kid oneself about the difficulties this entails, both political and economic. But that would be a real answer to the deep crisis of the present of which Mr. Trump and his ugly rhetoric are both symptom and cause. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Doesn\u2019t Get About Conservatism", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneMr. Scruton is a conservative author and commentator.I have devoted a substantial part of my intellectual life to defining and defending conservatism, as a social philosophy and a political program. Each time I think I have hit the nail on the head, the nail slips to one side and the hammer blow falls on my fingers.Like many others, both conservative and liberal, I did not foresee the political career of Donald Trump, nor did I imagine that such a man could occupy the highest office of state, in the name of a party that specifically makes appeal to conservative voters. Is this simply an aberration, or are there some deep links that tie the president to the great tradition of thought that I describe in my recent book, \u201cConservatism: An Invitation to the Great Tradition\u201d?When describing the history of an idea, one naturally looks for its best expression. A history of liberalism will have a lot to say about John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, somewhat less to say about Hillary Clinton. A survey of the conservative idea will dwell at length on Edmund Burke and Thomas Jefferson and devote only a paragraph or two to Margaret Thatcher.On the other hand, Mrs. Thatcher, and to some extent Mrs. Clinton, are known for invoking the great figures of political philosophy and for showing an educated awareness that \u201cideas have consequences,\u201d as the American conservative Richard Weaver expressed the point. In Mr. Trump we encounter a politician who uses social media to bypass the realm of ideas entirely, addressing the sentiments of his followers without a filter of educated argument and with only a marginal interest in what anyone with a mind might have said.Americans are conscious of their constitutional rights and freedoms. These assets are not guaranteed by human nature and exist only because Americans have fought for them. And they have fought for them as a nation, facing the future together. National identity is the origin of the trust on which political order depends. Such trust does not exist in Libya or Syria. But it exists in America, and the country has no more precious asset than the mutual loyalty that enables the words \u201cwe, the people\u201d to resonate with every American, regardless of whether it is a liberal or a conservative who utters them.Our political inheritance is not the property of humanity in general but of our country in particular. Unlike liberalism, with its philosophy of abstract human rights, conservatism is based not in a universal doctrine but in a particular tradition, and this point at least the president has grasped. Moreover he has understood that the legal order of the United States is rooted in customs that the Constitution was designed to protect. In this, too, Mr. Trump has shown himself to belong to the wider conservative tradition, seeking a Supreme Court that applies the Constitution, rather than one that constantly revises it, regardless of the elected legislature.But as Edmund Burke pointed out in one of the founding documents of modern conservatism, his \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France,\u201d we must \u201creform in order to conserve.\u201d Institutions, traditions and allegiances survive by adapting, not by remaining forever in the condition in which a political leader might inherit them. Conservative thinkers have in general understood this. And the principle of adaptability applies not only to law but also to the economy on which all citizens depend.In another of conservatism\u2019s founding documents, \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d Adam Smith argued that trade barriers and protections offered to dying industries will not, in the long run, serve the interests of the people. On the contrary, they will lead to an ossified economy that will splinter in the face of competition. President Trump seems not to have grasped this point. His protectionist policies resemble those of postwar socialist governments in Europe, which insulated dysfunctional industries from competition and led not merely to economic stagnation but also to a kind of cultural pessimism that surely goes entirely against the American grain.Conservative thinkers have on the whole praised the free market, but they do not think that market values are the only values there are. Their primary concern is with the aspects of society in which markets have little or no part to play: education, culture, religion, marriage and the family. Such spheres of social endeavor arise not through buying and selling but through cherishing what cannot be bought and sold: things like love, loyalty, art and knowledge, which are not means to an end but ends in themselves.About such things it is fair to say that Mr. Trump has at best only a distorted vision. He is a product of the cultural decline that is rapidly consigning our artistic and philosophical inheritance to oblivion. And perhaps the principal reason for doubting Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative credentials is that being a creation of social media, he has lost the sense that there is a civilization out there that stands above his deals and his tweets in a posture of disinterested judgment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Troubles for Ford, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler Send Shares Diving", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy may be humming, but for American car companies, the year is looking less bright.All of Detroit\u2019s Big 3 automakers issued downward revisions on Wednesday in their financial forecasts for the year, with each highlighting rising commodities costs that stem in part from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The adjustments, made as the companies announced their second-quarter earnings, sent their shares down sharply.Ford Motor recorded the worst showing of the three, as net income fell by nearly half to $1.1 billion from the same period ago. Aside from higher materials costs, Ford is struggling in Europe, South America and especially China, where it has spent heavily in recent years to expand but made just $3 million in the quarter and has watched its sales fall.\u201cThe deterioration in this important global market has been swift,\u201d Jim Farley, Ford executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a conference call. He said Ford\u2019s joint ventures in China suffered from uncompetitive costs, weak dealer networks and a shortage of sport-utility vehicles in its model line. Ford is now \u201ctaking urgent action,\u201d although its troubles will linger, he said.Casting a further cloud over the company was news it was postponing a daylong meeting with analysts scheduled for September, when Ford was supposed to detail the turnaround plan of its chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was hired in May 2017 to reinvigorate Ford, but the lack of details on Ford\u2019s plans have frustrated some analysts.\u201cThe postponement of the capital markets day is a pretty big deal, Jim,\u201d Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said on the call. In an unusually blunt question, he then wondered about Mr. Hackett\u2019s future with Ford.\u201cWill you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?\u201d Mr. Jonas asked.After replying at some length about the progress he felt the company had made, Mr. Hackett concluded by saying: \u201cAnd hell, yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we\u2019re going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.\u201dFord delivered its news after the stock market close. In after-hours trading, its shares fell about 4 percent.General Motors and Fiat Chrysler both reported their earnings before the market opened. G.M. shares ended the day off 4.6 percent, and Fiat Chrysler was down 11.8 percent.The companies\u2019 references to commodities prices signaled that the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and trade policies were already hurting auto company profits and might yet worsen their situations, said Efraim Levy, a stock analyst at CFRA Research.\u201cIt\u2019s been a bad day for auto stocks,\u201d he said. \u201cCommodities and tariffs and their interrelationship are weighing. It\u2019s the big picture that\u2019s hitting the outlook.\u201dOn a conference call, Mary Barra, the G.M. chief executive, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to have a strong U.S. auto industry, a big provider of quality jobs.\u201d The company, she added, is \u201cmaking sure we spend a lot of time with the administration\u201d so that decisions \u201caren\u2019t made that have unintended consequences.\u201dIn its earnings report, G.M. said it now expected adjusted earnings of about $6 per share for 2018. Earlier this year, it forecast earnings in line with last year\u2019s figure, which was $6.62.\u201cNot overly concerned today, but we obviously need to keep an eye on commodity prices as we move into 2019,\u201d Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief financial officer, Richard K. Palmer, said in a conference call.Fiat Chrysler now expects adjusted pretax profit of 7.5 billion to 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion to $9.4 billion), a drop of up to 14 percent from the \u20ac8.7 billion it forecast on June 1, reflecting how rapidly conditions in the industry have changed.The company has been lagging behind its rivals in China, and on Wednesday its new chief executive, Mike Manley, blamed several factors: its dealer network, its marketing and growing competition from Chinese brands. \u201cSo there are certainly a combination of things that we need to fix,\u201d he said. \u201cThat process has started.\u201dFiat Chrysler has said it is making contingency plans to reduce the impact of tariffs, while BMW has already said it will shift some production from its plant in South Carolina to avoid any retaliatory tariffs other countries could levy on vehicles exported from the United States.Advertisement"}

Courts New Partners With Japan Trade Deal", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is inciting a trade war, undermining NATO and painting Europe as a foe. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the European Union is looking elsewhere for friends.But no matter how many barriers to international commerce the European Union manages to tear down, its leaders will not change one economic fact of life: The United States remains the Continent\u2019s largest trading partner. There is no escaping the damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign against imports like cars and steel.\u201cThe United States is the one big market,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a bank based in Hamburg. The other accords, he said, are \u201cdamage limitation rather than compensation.\u201dEurope did not stand still, continuing instead to pursue other deals.Europe also reached a deal in principle with Mexico to update an existing free-trade agreement, one that should be completed by the end of the year. Accords with Vietnam and Singapore are going through the final stages of approval.\u201cIt has been a very busy month,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said in June after returning from a visit to Australia and New Zealand.Trade deals take years to negotiate, and work on the most recent pacts started before Mr. Trump was elected. The talks with Japan began in 2012. But Pascal Lamy, former director general of the World Trade Organization, said that the European Union\u2019s diplomatic offensive \u201cfits the notion that you don\u2019t need the U.S. to do open trade.\u201dThe European Union is even negotiating with China. European officials share the Americans\u2019 wariness about Chinese intentions. And they do not want to become dependent on China, even though it is on track to surpass the United States as Europe\u2019s largest trading partner in the coming years.Still, they are taking a different approach. Washington is threatening Beijing with tariffs that could encompass nearly all of China\u2019s imports into the United States, as a way to bring the country to heel. Officials in Brussels, by contrast, are negotiating an agreement that would give their companies more control over investments in China, for example by allowing them to own their operations outright rather than requiring them to work with local partners.China\u2019s ability to cozy up to the European Union is limited, however, by the mistrust that has marked the two powers\u2019 recent relations.They have sparred over whether sales of Chinese-made solar panels in Europe amounted to dumping. At a meeting last year, they failed to issue a joint statement on climate change because they disagreed on whether China should be considered a \u201cmarket economy.\u201d The designation would entitle the country to preferential treatment before the W.T.O.Last week, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met in Berlin with Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier. They watched as Chinese and German companies signed numerous cooperation agreements. One will allow BASF, the German chemical producer, to spend $10 billion building a wholly owned plant in southern China.That deal also underscores how slow China has been to open up.\u201cThere has been a big shift in the messages coming back from European companies based in China, who used to be a strong pro-China lobby but now are very critical,\u201d said Mark Leonard, co-founder and director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.After China, Japan is the European Union\u2019s second-biggest trading partner in Asia. The agreement signed on Tuesday in Tokyo by Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, and the European Council president, Donald Tusk, will eliminate 1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, in tariffs that European companies pay per year.Once the treaty takes effect in 2019, it will lead to an increase in trade of 16 percent to 24 percent, according to estimates from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. Regional producers of food products, which are subject to especially steep tariffs in Japan, are expected to be the biggest beneficiaries. Japanese carmakers will also benefit from a reduction in tariffs that have helped prevent Toyota from being anywhere near as big in Europe as it is in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a light in the increasing darkness of international politics,\u201d Mr. Tusk said of the trade agreement. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure you know what I mean.\u201dThe new trade pact will eliminate levies that add 50 percent to the price of Mr. Fagundo\u2019s shoes in Tokyo. That will help Masaltos compete with local products.\u201cWe are going to be able to grow much more quickly,\u201d said Mr. Fagundo, who sold about 500 pairs of shoes in Japan last year \u2014 a significant number for his small company. He expects that number to double once tariffs disappear.That, and growth in other export markets, will allow Masaltos to add three workers to its existing staff of 13, Mr. Fagundo said. That may not sound like much, but the city needs all the jobs it can get.

There will be more retaliation if the auto tariffs take effect, Ms. Malmstrom, the trade commissioner, has said. Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, is set to visit Washington next week for talks with Mr. Trump focusing on trade.By opening up new markets, Europe wants to at least lessen the blow. But Mr. Schmieding of Berenberg estimated that, if the European Union succeeded in negotiating a spate of trade deals, they would add up to maybe one-third of the American market. Trade between Europe and Japan is only one-fifth of Europe\u2019s trade with the United States.Mr. Fagundo, the shoemaker from Seville, also sells his products to American customers online and has not had any problems yet.

{"Headline": "Cricket Star. Sex Symbol. Prime Minister? It May Be Imran Khan\u2019s Time.", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Is Imran Khan, a legendary cricket player and international sex symbol, about to become the leader of Pakistan, an Islamic republic with nuclear weapons?Mr. Khan made a name for himself on the world\u2019s cricket pitches and in London\u2019s nightclubs. But in the two decades since he began striving for higher office in Pakistan, he has undergone a complicated transformation.He has embraced pious Islam, railing against the United States and distancing himself from his partying days \u2014 though his political organization still uses a cricket bat as its symbol. And on Wednesday, when Pakistan holds nationwide elections, Mr. Khan is the party leader widely seen as most likely to emerge with a shot at forming a government.Mr. Khan enjoys genuine popularity across this country and cordial relations with Pakistan\u2019s domineering military. He has used his celebrity, his charisma and his money to campaign against corruption, one of the most unifying issues in a poor nation that struggles with many dividing lines.Pakistanis have witnessed one political dynasty after another enrich itself while the country crumbles. Public hospitals languish in frightening disrepair; infant mortality has reached higher rates than just about anywhere else in Asia; and countless young Pakistanis flee this country each year in search of work as drivers, janitors and construction workers abroad because there are so few decent jobs at home.Mr. Khan has presented himself as a populist antidote to all that.\u201cHe has no direct corruption scandal attributed to his person, which is rare in Pakistan, particularly with politicians,\u201d said Raza Rumi, a prominent Pakistani journalist who is a political analyst at the Cornell Institute of Public Affairs.But it is not simply Mr. Khan\u2019s clean image that explains his success this time around.Many members of Mr. Sharif\u2019s party have defected, in what others have described as a targeted campaign by the security services to effectively behead the organization, which is known by the initials P.M.L.-N.If the pattern of Mr. Khan\u2019s political career to this point has been to underperform despite his advantages, in this election, he may finally have too many advantages to fail.Mr. Khan speaks in a deep voice and comes across as confident and relaxed, down-to-earth but also perhaps a touch remote.And he insists that he is not in the army\u2019s pocket \u2014 even as he expresses his support for the military.Pakistan\u2019s military has directly ruled for much of this nation\u2019s history and seriously meddled in political affairs for much of the rest. Many analysts are skeptical about Mr. Khan\u2019s claims of independence.\u201cHe is their puppet,\u201d said C. Christine Fair, a political scientist at Georgetown University. \u201cHe is where he is now because of the army and I.S.I.\u201d \u2014 the military intelligence service \u2014 \u201cwhich have engaged in massive prepoll shenanigans and will continue the day of the elections and after to ensure an Imran Khan-led coalition.\u201dHow will Mr. Khan then govern?Pakistan is a pivotal nation, the world\u2019s sixth-most populous, nuclear-armed and a geopolitical hot spot because of its longstanding enmity with India and its support for militant proxies, including the Afghan Taliban.Mr. Khan has said he would like to make peace with India. And though he criticized some of the Taliban\u2019s violence, he has also publicly defended the group and its aims. He has taken a hard line against the United States, bitterly complaining about drone strikes in Pakistan and calling the war on terrorism \u201cmadness.\u201d\u201cHis foreign policy is centrally anti-American,\u201d said Omar Waraich, deputy South Asia director at Amnesty International.Domestically, he \u2014 or anyone else who wins \u2014 is likely to be overwhelmed. Pakistan\u2019s economy keeps sliding, and many public assets are in crisis, including the electricity grid and water supply.Though Mr. Khan\u2019s personal credentials for governing are still an unknown, his party has governed the vast but sparsely populated province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa since 2013. While its record there is mixed, it has been credited with improving government services.If his party does not win an outright majority on Wednesday, things could get complex.Mr. Khan has said he will not form a coalition with either of the other two leading parties, calling them too corrupt for such an alliance. The result could be a weak and fractured Parliament that would be unable to hold its own.Mr. Khan, 65, has had an enchanting life, though not always a consistent one.Born to a privileged family, educated at Oxford, a lover to many beautiful and famous women and a superstar athlete considered one of the best in cricket\u2019s history, his experiences couldn\u2019t be more different from those of most Pakistanis.He reached heroic status in 1992, captaining Pakistan\u2019s cricket team to a World Cup final victory over England, the former colonial power. It was an immense moment of national pride, and Mr. Khan was at the center of it. He was also 39 and nursing a shoulder injury.A few years later, he went through a soul-searching conversion. He raised millions of dollars to build a cancer hospital for the poor (his mother had died of cancer) and he started to become more deeply interested in Islam. He moved away from the limelight and dating celebrities, saying that kind of life had never been very satisfying.\u201cIt looks from the outside very glamorous, great, but actually it\u2019s not,\u201d he told a British newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s these transitory relationships. They\u2019re pretty empty.\u201dIn 1996, he founded his Justice Movement. His party struggled in obscurity for years, barely winning any seats in Pakistan\u2019s legislature, and for a time, Mr. Khan the superstar became Mr. Khan the joke. A Pakistani newspaper ridiculed him as \u201cIm the Dim\u201d; others called him \u201cImran Khan\u2019t.\u201dThe other two major parties, Mr. Sharif\u2019s party and the Pakistan Peoples Party founded by the Bhutto family, proved better organized. They had established vast patronage networks throughout the country.In many areas, landlords and tribal chiefs still command enormous sway. Such grandees, if given the right incentives, can deliver huge blocks of votes, which Mr. Khan\u2019s scrappy political outfit struggled against.But even during these years, Mr. Khan attracted a passionate following. \u201cWho will save Pakistan?\u201d his supporters would cheer at his rallies. \u201cImran Khan! Imran Khan!\u201dMany conservative Muslim Pakistanis now forgive him for his decadent past.\u201cHow he behaved before, that\u2019s his business,\u201d said Tanveer Haider, a Pakistani crane operator working in the Middle East who flew home this week so he could vote for Mr. Khan\u2019s party. \u201cI care about what he will do for this country. Of all the politicians, he will do the most.\u201dAnalysts say Pakistan is desperate for change, and that\u2019s what Mr. Khan represents.\u201cThe vast section of urban Pakistanis, not all, are kind of tired of the two parties,\u201d Mr. Rumi, the journalist and political analyst, said. \u201cThey feel that we need to move beyond them and he\u2019s a way out.\u201dFor all the fawning that Mr. Khan has enjoyed, he has also taken his lumps and shown a fair bit of resilience \u2014 particularly when it comes to the consuming attention given to his private life.His first wife was Jemima Goldsmith, a British heiress with some Jewish heritage. Soon enough, Mr. Khan was accused by some Pakistanis of being controlled by a Zionist conspiracy, which he laughed off.His second wife recently published a memoir that included allegations of lurid indiscretions in Mr. Khan\u2019s private life; he has let that roll off his back as well.Trying to sum up what Mr. Khan stands for, Ashutosh Varshney, the director of the Center for Contemporary South Asia at Brown University, said: \u201cImran is a maddening medley of an incredible sporting talent, an incorrigible international playboy and a vengefully ambitious politician. He can\u2019t bring democracy to Pakistan \u2014 for democracy to institutionalize, the army must step back as a minimum condition.\u201d\u201cNo democracy can work that way,\u201d Mr. Varshney added, \u201celections or no elections.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if the Government Gave Everyone a Paycheck?", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAdvancing technologies aren\u2019t the only cause of this predicament, but notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claim to the contrary, technology is a bigger culprit than trade. The economy keeps growing yet most economic gains are going to a few \u2014 largely financiers and, increasingly, inventors and owners of the digitized devices that are replacing good jobs. Our economic system isn\u2019t designed for this. If the trend continues, it\u2019s unclear who will even earn enough to buy all the future robots.Economic change on this scale doesn\u2019t happen without something cracking. The shift from farm to factory featured decades of bloody labor conflict; the move from factory to office and other sedentary jobs caused more upheaval. What will happen when robots push most people out of steady work and into lower-wage gig jobs? I doubt we\u2019ll see a revolution. A more likely scenario is a slow slouch toward authoritarianism and xenophobia. We may already be there.What\u2019s the answer? Here in the Bay Area where I live, where inventors and engineers are busily digitizing everything, many civic and business leaders are touting something called a universal basic income, or U.B.I. It\u2019s universal in the sense that everyone would receive it, basic in that it would be just enough to live on and cash income rather than voucher-based, like food stamps or Section 8 housing. To the rest of America, a U.B.I. may seem like a pipe dream, but from my vantage point some form of it seems inevitable.U.B.I.\u2019s critics understandably worry that it would spur millions to drop out of the labor force, induce laziness or at least rob people of the structure and meaning work provides. Both Yang and Lowrey muster substantial research to rebut these claims. I\u2019m not sure they need it. After all, $12,000 a year doesn\u2019t deliver a comfortable life even in the lowest-cost precincts of America, so there would still be plenty of incentive to work. Most of today\u2019s jobs provide very little by way of fulfillment or creativity anyway.A U.B.I. might give recipients a bit more time to pursue socially beneficial activities, like helping the elderly or attending to kids with special needs or perhaps even starting a new business. Yang suggests it would spur a system of \u201csocial credits\u201d in which people trade their spare time by performing various helpful tasks for one another. (I.R.S. be warned.) Surely a U.B.I. would help compensate many people \u2014 especially women \u2014 for the unpaid labor they already contribute. As Lowrey points out, some 40 million family caregivers in America provide half a trillion dollars of unpaid adult care annually. Child care has become so expensive that one of every three stay-at-home mothers today lives below the poverty line (compared with 14 percent in 1970).But how could America possibly afford a U.B.I.? A $1,000-a-month grant to every American would cost about $3.9 trillion a year. That\u2019s about $1.3 trillion on top of existing welfare programs \u2014 roughly the equivalent of the entire federal budget, or about a fifth of the entire United States economy. Both Yang and Lowrey come up with laundry lists of potential funding sources \u2014 from soaking the rich (raising the top tax bracket to 55 percent, enlarging the estate tax and implementing new taxes on wealth, financial transactions and perhaps even the owners of the robots and related devices that are displacing jobs), to instituting a carbon tax or a value-added tax.Whatever the source of funds, it seems a safe bet that increased automation will allow the economy to continue to grow, making a U.B.I. more affordable. A U.B.I. would itself generate more consumer spending, stimulating additional economic activity. And less poverty would mean less crime, incarceration and other social costs associated with deprivation. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really expensive?\u201d Yang asks. \u201cDysfunction. Revolution.\u201dIf these measures still aren\u2019t enough to foot the bill, Lowrey suggests making a U.B.I. less universal by taxing away U.B.I. payments to high-income earners and reducing other forms of social insurance (for example, eliminating food stamps and welfare programs). As a last resort, she writes, a U.B.I. could be implemented as a kind of negative income tax, by which government simply ensures that every person or household has a certain minimum yearly income. This is what Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman had in mind. Lowrey figures that the cost of such a guarantee would approximate the current total costs of the earned-income tax credit, supplemental security income, housing assistance, food stamps and school lunches. She notes that the simplest way to achieve this would be to transform existing antipoverty programs into unconditional cash transfers.But there\u2019s a logical flaw in her argument. Once a U.B.I. is no longer universal or even basic (what if the poor are worse off when other forms of assistance are stripped away?), it\u2019s hard to see the point of having it in the first place. More troubling is Lowrey\u2019s blurring of the distinction between a U.B.I. that redistributes resources from the superrich to the growing number of vulnerable lower-income Americans and one that merely turns programs for the poor into cash assistance. The latter may be warranted, but it wouldn\u2019t touch America\u2019s growing scourge of inequality and economic insecurity, which will be made worse as robots take over good jobs.A core challenge in the future will be how to redistribute money from the ever richer owners of the robots and related technologies to the rest of us, who are otherwise likely to become poorer and less secure. This is not just an economic challenge but also a political one. As we know from recent history, vast fortunes translate directly into political power, and such power effectively resists redistribution. Sadly, neither of these authors discusses how to deal with this paradox.A world inhabited only by robots, their billionaire owners and a large and increasingly restive population is the plotline for countless dystopian fantasies, but it\u2019s a reality that appears to be drawing closer. If we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we will need to make fundamental choices about how to support human livelihoods and ensure equal participation in our economy and society. Most basically, we will have to confront the realities of vastly unequal economic and political power. Even if we manage to enact a U.B.I., it will not be nearly enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Hampshire, 94 Percent White, Asks: How Do You Diversify a Whole State?", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Catalina Celentano used to hold training sessions for hospital workers in Lynn, Mass., to familiarize them with the cultures of patients from Cambodia, Russia and the Dominican Republic. When she moved to New Hampshire, she suddenly found herself in an ethnic vacuum.\u201cI went from being able to speak Spanish every day to not speaking Spanish at all because there wasn\u2019t anybody to speak Spanish to,\u201d said Mrs. Celentano, who was born in Colombia to a Colombian mother and Hungarian father. \u201cThe only person I spoke Spanish with was a cleaning lady and she moved back to Colombia.\u201dNew Hampshire, like its neighbors Vermont and Maine, is nearly all white. This has posed an array of problems for new arrivals, who often find themselves isolated and alone, without the comfort and support of a built-in community.It has also posed problems for employers in these states, who find that their homogeneity can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining workers of different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.The issue prompted about 100 business leaders, government officials and members of nonprofit organizations to meet Thursday to search for ways that New Hampshire \u2014 which is 94 percent white \u2014 might lure other racial and ethnic groups, as well as younger people.Will Arvelo, New Hampshire\u2019s director of economic development, said the gathering appeared to be the first broad-based effort in New England, if not the country, to focus on how to diversify an entire state.\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s future economy is dependent on our ability to set ourselves up as a welcoming state,\u201d Mr. Arvelo said at the meeting. \u201cWe do a great job marketing ourselves around travel and tourism. How do we use those tools to attract talent?\u201dThe project grew out of informal talks over the last few years among a racially diverse coalition of people, including Mrs. Celentano, who say they want to change New Hampshire\u2019s demographics. The effort is so new that it has no name. But it is drawing important players.The gathering took place at the offices of Eversource, the energy company, where 17 percent of the company\u2019s 8,000 employees are not white.\u201cWe truly believe that this effort will be hugely beneficial to our business operations,\u201d said Paula Parnagian, the diversity and inclusion manager for Eversource.For Jerri Anne Boggis, executive director of the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire, in Portsmouth, N.H., the participation of major companies is a sign of the urgency of the mission.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the social justice groups that are doing this, it\u2019s the businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the economic engine of our state, and we can\u2019t move forward without them.\u201dNew Hampshire\u2019s neighbors, Vermont and Maine, are 95 percent white, making northern New England collectively the whitest region in a nation where white residents make up just over 60 percent of the population, according to the census.Northern New England does contain pockets that are less monolithic. They are concentrated in the largest communities \u2014 Portland, Me.; Burlington, Vt.; and in Manchester, N.H. In Manchester, for example, the white population has dropped to 82 percent, down from 98 percent in 1980. Since then, other ethnicities have been increasing, and as of 2016, Manchester was nearly 8 percent Hispanic, nearly 5 percent black and more than 4 percent Asian. In Lewiston, the second largest city in Maine, Somalis are well-established.Mostly, though, Northern New England is nearly all white. The reasons stem from a variety of factors, including a lack of big urban areas, where jobs are more plentiful, a wider range of housing is available and cultural differences are a little more accepted than in smaller places.\u201cNorthern New England is a huge collection of very, very small towns,\u201d said Peter Francese, a demographic analyst based in Exeter, N.H.\u201cHousing is at the core of why there aren\u2019t more immigrants \u2014 there\u2019s no place for them,\u201d he said. \u201cAn ethnic person who wants to come in with a family of four or five people is not going to find a home they can afford, and there\u2019s almost no rental housing whatsoever.\u201d In addition, Northern New England has the nation\u2019s highest concentration of second homes, making the housing market especially tight.And, he said, much of any newer housing is only for people 55 or older. If developers built housing for younger people, he said, they would likely have children, which means a need for schools, which means higher property taxes \u2014 anathema in a place like New Hampshire, which has no income tax.\u201cWe have true work force needs,\u201d said Loretta Brady, a psychology professor at St. Anselm College, who has worked with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce on matters of diversity and participated in Thursday\u2019s conference.\u201cWe have 2.7 percent unemployment, an opioid crisis that has significantly impacted employability and the reality of an aging population that will absolutely require direct service care at some point,\u201d said Ms. Brady. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have a pipeline of talent that\u2019s going to support that.\u201dPart of the problem, Rogers J. Johnson, president of the Seacoast N.A.A.C.P., told the group, was \u201ca lack of recognition as to the seriousness of this problem.\u201d He said that many people in New Hampshire view race as an issue in the South but not in the North.In workshops and panel discussions, people wrestled with ways New Hampshire could draw people of different backgrounds. Their suggestions included: a better understanding of licensing and skills that refugees bring with them so they could more easily work here; a system of rewarding businesses that hire a more diverse array of workers; a central location with a database, speakers\u2019 bureau and training opportunities that could help companies understand what \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d means and how it could benefit them, and a focus on keeping workers as much as hiring them in the first place, since many leave after finding the state inhospitable.\u201cWe haven\u2019t even talked about housing and transportation,\u201d Mrs. Celentano, who used to teach cultural training in Massachusetts and is now a community relations specialist for Eversource, told the group. In the workshop she participated in, she said, people asked: \u201cHow do we bring in millennials when they can\u2019t afford housing or can\u2019t get from Point A to Point B?\u201dShe said in an interview later that the lack of certain basic services also made settling in places like New Hampshire difficult for minorities. These include hair salons that cater to African-American women, she said, as well as restaurants and supermarkets that offer ethnic foods and stores that sell traditional clothing.The next step? Another meeting soon.\u201cAt some point we have to pull the string and say what\u2019s coming out of here,\u201d Mr. Arvelo, the state director of economic development, said. \u201cThe pressure is on us to perform and to be able to prove that this is not a one-off meeting, that it\u2019s a sustained effort.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Themes to Follow as Corporate America Reports a Surge in Profits", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarnings season is upon us once again, and analysts expect the strong economy and the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts to lead to another batch of knockout quarterly profits.Per-share earnings at companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index are forecast to have risen 20.8 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. That would be the second straight quarter of 20-percent-plus jumps, something that hasn\u2019t happened since late 2010.Tax cuts aren\u2019t responsible for all of that growth. Measures of sales, which are closely tied to the health of the economy, are also expected to rise at a robust 9 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by the data provider FactSet through Friday.Despite those leaps in sales and profit, the S. & P. 500 remains below the highs it hit in late January. Earnings reports look backward, and what really matters to investors is what lies ahead. These days that means companies have to consider a growing trade conflict and rising interest rates, wages, commodity prices and other costs that are clouding the economic outlook.Just which of these worries is front of mind is something that investors will try to divine from executives\u2019 assessments of earnings. Here are some key themes that could emerge.So far the Trump administration\u2019s trade war hasn\u2019t sunk the stock market, as many had predicted it would. Sure, there are pockets of trouble. Shares of the construction equipment company Caterpillar have struggled in part because the firm is considered doubly vulnerable to trade tensions; more than 50 percent of Caterpillar\u2019s sales last year came from outside North America. The company is also a large consumer of steel, which has risen in price thanks, in part, to Trump administration tariffs on imports.And some businesses are doing O.K. Shares of small companies, which tend to sell most of their products domestically, have performed well.But analysts and investors will pay attention for other indications that the expanding trade war is starting to delay plans for corporate spending. It hasn\u2019t materialized yet, executives say.\u201cIt is not at this point causing them to change the strategic actions and decisions that they\u2019re making,\u201d Marianne Lake, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s largest bank by assets, said on the bank\u2019s post-earnings call this month.With the economic expansion in its ninth year \u2014 the second-longest stretch of growth on record \u2014 a burst of corporate investment will be a key to keeping the streak alive. Key provisions of the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul were designed to provoke such a spending boom on new factories and equipment.In the first quarter, there was a solid uptick in business investment. Whether it\u2019s because of the tax bill or unrelated developments \u2014 such as the rebound in oil and gas prices \u2014 is a matter of some debate.\u201cWe are not yet seeing what I would call a lot of traditional capex spending occurring,\u201d Curtis Farmer, president of the midsize lender Comerica, told analysts on a conference call last Tuesday.When companies have cash to spend but are not willing to commit to big investments, they often buy up their own stock instead. A surge of buybacks, another byproduct of the tax-bill windfall, helped shore up the stock market earlier this year. When companies buy back shares, they cut the number of shares outstanding, raising earnings per share.The case for a buyback is that this can help push a stock price higher, and investors tend to applaud. Shares of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway jumped about 5 percent on Wednesday, after the company said it had removed a limit on share repurchases.Buybacks have their critics, too, who deride them as financial engineering that benefits only shareholders in the short run. Spending that money on new equipment or a factory might create jobs for the workers who will build a factory, say, and those who will be employed in it, and add to profits over the long term.In earnings updates, investors can often gauge the pace of corporate repurchases. If a company\u2019s shares have performed only modestly despite a binge of buybacks, that could mean investors\u2019 view of the stock is more pessimistic than the price might reflect.Wage growth is a key factor in the United States economy, as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product. At the same time, for investors, wage growth isn\u2019t always positive. Rising labor costs can cut into profits, muting the impact of a robust economy. In some sectors, that seems to be happening.The trucking firm J. B. Hunt Transport Services reported better-than-expected profits last week. But its shares slid after the company cited \u201cdriver pay and retention costs\u201d and \u201cdriver recruiting costs\u201d as some of the outlays that nibbled away at the benefits of higher prices and booming volumes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boris Johnson Has Ruined Britain", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cHe knows that the verdict of history is about to come down on him \u2014 and bury him.\u201d Ms. Russell is a British journalist.LONDON \u2014\u00a0For the second time in three years, Boris Johnson, a politician whose ambition and superficial charm far outstrip his ability, judgment or principles, is destabilizing the British government and threatening the country\u2019s future. On Monday, Mr. Johnson, in protest against Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plans for Brexit, resigned from his post as foreign secretary. Now Mrs. May\u2019s authority, longevity and ability to deliver a Brexit without causing an economic crisis are in question. But further political paralysis seems certain. Britain is in this mess principally because the Brexiteers \u2014 led largely by Mr. Johnson \u2014 sold the country a series of lies in the lead up to the June 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. They did so because neither Mr. Johnson nor his fellow leader of the Leave campaign, Michael Gove, intended, wanted or expected to win. At the start of 2016, Mr. Johnson was perhaps the most popular politician in Britain. Supporters and fans mobbed him at train stations and traffic lights; pollsters and pundits thought he could reach the parts of the country that other Conservatives could never touch. But he was also driven and insecure, so desperate to guarantee he would be the next prime minister that he cynically abandoned his own previous positions on the European Union in order to try to secure support from his party\u2019s Euroskeptic right wing. Because Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove were confident that the Leave campaign was a hopeless cause, they were free to make ridiculous claims that they had no expectation of ever having to fulfill. They said that Brexit would make Britain both richer and more independent, with more money for the National Health Service, much greater control of immigration and continued friction-free trade with Europe. Every earnest warning from the other side \u2014 about how any Brexit would damage trade, business and jobs \u2014 was dismissed airily by the Brexiteers. There were no costs or downsides in this vision of the future.This casual dishonesty has had devastating consequences. In the two years since the Leave campaign unexpectedly won, nobody, from the prime minister to Mr. Johnson to the Labour Party, has been able to come up with a plan for exiting the European Union that can satisfy both a majority in Parliament and the expectant public. Why? Because fulfilling the false promises peddled by Mr. Johnson during the campaign is impossible. The gulf between the easy, prosperous, productive Brexit that its voters are impatiently expecting, and the grim, complicated cost of disentangling economies that have been intertwined for decades has poisoned and paralyzed British politics. The Conservatives\u2019 leaders cannot admit to the electorate that they were deceived without splitting the party. And instead of apologizing for misleading voters, Mr. Johnson and the other Brexiteers have doubled down, taking refuge in optimistic slogans and vapid promises, refusing to believe the increasingly agitated evidence from hospitals, airlines, farmers, supermarkets and factories that a hard Brexit will damage them all.Last week, Mrs. May finally attempted to force a recognition of reality on her divided cabinet by coming up with a compromise; a partial Brexit that allows goods free access in and out of Europe at the cost of accepting many European rules. It was an imperfect plan, but still it provided, finally, a starting point for negotiations with Brussels.For three days, that compromise held, until the first political delusionist, the Brexit Secretary David Davis, broke free, still claiming that in some magical future Britain could get almost everything it wanted, if only the country would just stand by its demands. Petrified of being outflanked, Mr. Johnson followed suit, bringing with him the implicit threat that he could lead a rebellion against the government that other hard-line Brexiteers will follow. It is a desperate move by a man who has lost almost all the credibility he had three years ago. All of Mr. Johnson\u2019s weaknesses have been exposed: his lazy reluctance to do detail, his preference for bluster over thinking, his contempt for business. The campaign was meant to secure his future; instead, in damaging the country, he fears he has wrecked his own future, too. As one of his allies told me last month: \u201cHe knows that the verdict of history is about to come down on him \u2014 and bury him.\u201d Mr. Johnson seems to believe that this is his last chance to become prime minister: After his resignation this week, he hopes to be reborn as a rebel who will lead the party. But more likely is that he will once again create political chaos without delivering what he wants. Two years ago, the side effect of Mr. Johnson\u2019s ambitious maneuvering was to split the country and risk the prosperity and security of all Britons for decades. Now, just as a fragile basis for negotiation emerges, his selfish drive for vindication, attention and admiration threatens that, too. It is petrifying that the deliberate deceptions and wild ego of one man can so mislead a nation. (Americans know all about that.) One insider told me that Mrs. May was prepared for Mr. Johnson\u2019s defection, and will outflank him, persuading wavering Conservatives that the time for fantasy has passed. But Britain is teetering on the edge, on the verge of making catastrophic, irreversibly damaging mistakes. The danger is that Johnson might tip the balance in the wrong direction once again.

{"Headline": "Trump Says He\u2019ll Stump for Vulnerable Republicans \u2018Six or Seven Days a Week\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Friday that he plans to spends almost all of his time this fall campaigning for the most vulnerable Republican congressional candidates in the midterm elections, a strategy that would have him in many districts where endangered lawmakers in his own party regard him as a liability.In a friendly radio interview with Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host with whom he shares a close relationship, Mr. Trump said he was confident the strength of the economy and the demise of the Islamic State would boost the fortunes of Republicans in this fall\u2019s contests, and that he would personally work to pull lawmakers facing tough re-election challenges to victory.\u201cI am going to work very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the interview. \u201cI\u2019ll go six or seven days a week when we\u2019re 60 days out, and I will be campaigning for all of these great people that do have a difficult race, and we think we\u2019re going to bring them over the line.\u201dMr. Trump said he had instructed John F. Kelly, his chief of staff, and others on his team to compile a list of about two dozen of the most hotly contested races in the country so he could use the bully pulpit to promote the Republicans running in them.\u201cGive me the top 25 congresspeople that are, you know, could go either way, and I want to go out and campaign for those people,\u201d Mr. Trump said.But many if not most of the most competitive races are in districts where Mr. Trump is unpopular and more centrist Republican incumbents are toiling to distance themselves from him, as well as where Democrats are most motivated to turn out to vote against the president\u2019s party.Mr. Hannity seemed to allude to the phenomenon in a question, in which he asked what the president would say to motivate supporters of his \u201cwho may not like their RINO congressman,\u201d using the derisive shorthand that conservatives use for \u201cRepublican in name only.\u201dMr. Trump has confined his campaigning in recent months almost entirely to red states he won handily in 2016 that have competitive Senate races, including Tennessee, North Dakota and Montana.Next week, though, the president will hold rallies in Florida and Pennsylvania, a sign he is beginning to aim for battleground states.Mr. Trump said he was undaunted by the decades of history that has shown that a president\u2019s party typically loses seats in midterm congressional elections. He insisted he would buck the trend.\u201cThe economy may be the strongest it\u2019s ever been in the history of our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said, harkening back to a phrase Bill Clinton\u2019s aides used to capture a pivotal issue of his campaign: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201dBut he also previewed a negative message against Democrats, asserting to Mr. Hannity that they \u201cwant to raise people\u2019s taxes, they want to open up borders, they want to get rid of ICE \u2014 I mean, the things they\u2019re doing are so destructive, we won\u2019t have a country.\u201d Mr. Trump was referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has become a symbol of efforts to round up undocumented workers and migrant family separations at the border with Mexico. Some Democratic candidates say it should be abolished.And taking a cue from Mr. Hannity, who said Democrats would shut down investigations into \u201cdeep corruption\u201d if they took power on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump \u2014 facing new questions about whether his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 race \u2014 declared that his political rivals were guilty of doing just that.\u201cIf you talk about collusion, the collusion is there \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it, but it\u2019s with the Democrats and Russia,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering no evidence. \u201cAll you have to do is look at what they did and how they participated with Russia. It\u2019s a disgraceful situation.\u201dThe interview was broadcast after Mr. Trump led a National Security Council meeting at the White House about election security. His spokeswoman said that the president and his national security team discussed \u201cthreats posed to our elections from malign foreign actors\u201d and attempts to thwart and punish interference.An earlier version of this article misstated a state result in the 2016 presidential election.

{"Headline": "Tariffs Imperil a Hometown Business in South Carolina: BMW", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "The automaker became the No. 1 exporter of American-made cars, transforming Spartanburg. Now it is weighing the impact of an escalation of the trade fight.Supported bySPARTANBURG, S.C. \u2014 In the middle of David Britt\u2019s campaign to get BMW to put a car factory in this city, a man grabbed him by the tie while he was in a restaurant.\u201cDon\u2019t give that land to the Germans,\u201d the man hissed to Mr. Britt, a county official.Two decades later, the automaker has become the most important local job creator, earning the affection of a deep-red county where one in 10 people earns a living making vehicles or their parts.The Spartanburg plant is BMW\u2019s biggest in the world. It has helped draw more than 200 companies from two dozen countries to Spartanburg County. And the German company \u2014 not an American icon like Ford or General Motors \u2014 is now the largest exporter of cars made in the United States, turning the port of Charleston, S.C., into a hub for global trade.But by setting off a global trade battle, President Trump is threatening the town\u2019s livelihood. People aren\u2019t happy.\u201cBMW saved Spartanburg and transformed South Carolina into a manufacturing mecca to the world,\u201d said Mr. Britt, a member of the County Council. \u201cWhen you mess with the golden goose, they\u2019re family, and you\u2019re messing with me.\u201dThe hearing on Thursday drew dozens of witnesses, including auto-industry representatives and small-business owners, to argue against the tariff plan. They said the move would make it more expensive to build cars here and would prompt other countries to respond in kind, hurting exports.But lashing out at German carmakers could inflict wounds in this upstate swath of South Carolina. In March, BMW\u2019s chief executive, Harald Kr\u00fcger, said Mr. Trump\u2019s auto tariffs \u201cwould have an impact on jobs in the United States.\u201d In a June letter to the Commerce Department, the company said it might cut investment and production in Spartanburg if selling its American-made sport-utility vehicles abroad became too expensive.Already this year, BMW stopped exporting the X3 crossover from Spartanburg to China and began making more of the S.U.V.s in plants in Shenyang, China, and Rosslyn, South Africa.Those overseas moves are being watched warily here. \u201cThis directly affects us,\u201d said A. J. Cemprola, a software developer at BMW\u2019s Spartanburg plant. \u201cIt isn\u2019t talk anymore.\u201dMr. Cemprola, 30, said the job helped him pay off his student loans and buy a four-bedroom home with his wife. Everyone in town, he said, works at BMW or knows someone who does.\u201cThis area has grown a lot from BMW, and it\u2019s been great for South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want that to change.\u201dThe company insists it\u2019s going to produce a new vehicle, the X7, in Spartanburg. But the tariff moves have sent a shiver through the area. If the company decides to make fewer S.U.V.s here, the effects would spread far beyond Mr. Cemprola\u2019s paycheck.A significant chunk of the thousands of parts in an X3 aren\u2019t made in Munich \u2014 they're manufactured by small and midsize companies across the United States. The door system, for example, comes together at a plant in Duncan, S.C., owned by Brose, a German parts maker that also has factories in Michigan, Illinois and Alabama.A line of five South Carolinians works with three robots to fit all the pieces of the door system together. The plastic plate came from Baxter, a producer in Westminster, S.C. A supplier in Ohio made the fleece inside. Brose also makes the pair of oblong air gates that give the front of some BMWs their toothy look. It imports the air-gate motor from its plant in the Czech Republic.Brose didn\u2019t want to speculate on the impact of the tariffs. But the Brose plant manager, Michael Morgenroth, said, \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you can draw your own conclusion.\u201dOther suppliers that have set up shop in South Carolina have been more direct. ZF Friedrichshafen of Germany, a major producer of transmissions, and Magna of Canada, a giant in seat manufacturing, said in letters to the Commerce Department that the tariffs would directly hit their American workers.\u201cIt\u2019s not good what is happening at the moment,\u201d said Erwin Doll, the chief executive of R\u00f6chling Automotive, a German company that employs 400 people at a plant in Duncan. R\u00f6chling makes underbodies of S.U.V.s for BMW, along with plastic systems that make the vehicles more aerodynamic.\u201cIf BMW or Daimler or Nissan or Honda cannot export as many as they like, then obviously it will hurt our turnover as well,\u201d Mr. Doll said of the plant\u2019s prospective revenue.The company has plants in many of the places that BMW does around the world, and if the carmaker shifts more production out of Spartanburg, Mr. Doll would probably need to follow suit.\u201cWe would have to adjust our cost and think about how we invest,\u201d he said.At the Port of Charleston on Friday, as BMWs cycled out of the docks, trade barriers seemed a distant worry. Workers drove more than 300 gleaming S.U.V.s onto a massive ship that functions like a parking garage on water, with scheduled stops in England, Belgium and Germany.Workers appear less concerned, for now. \u201cI don\u2019t see where we have been affected by the trade war like they\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d said Glenn Jamison, 62, a longshoreman who spends his days checking a video feed of arriving containers to make sure they\u2019re sealed and not damaged.He looks at the count of boxes filled coming into the port and leaving every day, and the numbers keep going up. Ten percent of all of the containers that the port processes are filled with products related to the auto industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t see any instability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing about it, but we don\u2019t see it yet.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s trade strategy has won him fans on the docks, even though it could hurt some of them.\u201cAmerican workers have been sold down the river with Nafta and other agreements,\u201d said Michael Spellman, who handles the documentation for cargo. He praised Mr. Trump for trying to renegotiate deals that the president sees as unfair, even if that approach costs some jobs in the short term.\u201cHe\u2019s doing what he said he would,\u201d Mr. Spellman said. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping promises, instead of lip service like every other politician.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Presses NATO on Military Spending, but Signs Its Criticism of Russia", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Trump escalated his campaign of criticism against European allies on Wednesday, accusing Germany of being \u201ccaptive to Russia\u201d and demanding that all NATO members double their military spending targets.On the first of two days of meetings with NATO leaders, Mr. Trump stopped short of any substantive breaks with the alliance, reaching agreement on a plan to improve military readiness and signing on to a joint statement that emphasized burden-sharing and harshly criticized Russia.But coming just days before he is to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Trump\u2019s critical stance toward the allies focused additional attention on longstanding concerns by the United States about the willingness of Europe to shoulder its share of the financial burden for NATO.Mr. Trump again demanded that the allies all meet their commitment to raise their military budgets to 2 percent of their economic output by 2024, but then further stepped up the pressure by saying they should make it 4 percent, and he continued to press the point on Thursday.More broadly, his performance, leavened at times by a more reassuring tone, left his fellow leaders struggling anew to judge whether he was posturing in an effort to win a better deal for the United States, moving to weaken institutions at the heart of the post-World War II order or both.\u201cI think the secretary general likes Trump,\u201d he said, alluding to allies\u2019 stepping up their military spending in response to his pressure tactics. \u201cHe may be the only one, but that\u2019s O.K. with me.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump spent the next several few hours practically ensuring it. He laid into Germany for not spending more on its military while becoming increasingly dependent on Russia for its energy needs. His criticism was based on Germany\u2019s deal to import natural gas from Russia via a new pipeline.He dismissed as paltry \u2014 \u201ca very small step,\u201d the president said \u2014 the increases that NATO member countries have made in their military budgets in part because of his repeated lectures on the issue, eschewing a victory lap his advisers had encouraged him to take in favor of a sharp slap at allies.\u201cFrankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they\u2019re delinquent, as far as I\u2019m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them,\u201d Mr. Trump said, mischaracterizing how the commitments for NATO military spending work. \u201cThis has gone on for many presidents, but no other president brought it up like I bring it up.\u201d\u201cSomething has to be done,\u201d he added.His comments came at a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s own ties to Russia are under scrutiny and as he is also waging a spreading trade war that has ensnared allies \u2014 including NATO members like Canada and Germany \u2014 as well as foes and competitors like China. His approach has fueled concern among his critics at home and abroad that he is intent on deconstructing the postwar order and replacing it with an \u201cAmerica First\u201d breed of transactional diplomacy.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive pressure tactics have already yielded more military spending by NATO allies and a sharper focus on the issue of unbalanced burden-sharing within NATO that vexed Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush before him.Behind closed doors, Mr. Trump suggested that NATO allies increase their military budgets not to the 2 percent of their economies that they have pledged to work toward within the next six years, but to 4 percent \u2014 a steep increase that is inconceivable for many member countries. Later, he took to Twitter to demand that member countries get to 2 percent \u201cIMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.\u201d\u201cWhat good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy?\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWhy are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe\u2019s protection, then loses billions on Trade.\u201dThe United States spent less than 4 percent of its gross domestic product on the military last year.The declaration said NATO countries \u201cstrongly condemn Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimiate annexation of Crimea, which we do not and will not recognize.\u201d Last month, Mr. Trump had suggested that he might be open to acknowledging Russia\u2019s claim to Crimea. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see,\u201d he told reporters when asked about it aboard Air Force One on June 29.The first day of the summit meeting also illustrated the ways in which Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy approach matched up with his domestic political strategy. Attacking allies over trade and their willingness to pay their share of military costs has played well with his political base.The populist core of his coalition is fueled in part by anger over what his supporters consider unfair treatment of the United States on matters of trade, immigration and international affairs.\u201cI think he feels it\u2019s playing well with his base, fueling this sense of grievance against allies and trading partners, which is how he got elected,\u201d Alexander Vershbow, a former NATO deputy secretary general, said of Mr. Trump in an interview.\u201cThe danger,\u201d Mr. Vershbow said, \u201cis that he\u2019s turning at least his base, and maybe other Americans, against NATO and against U.S. global leadership by falsely defining it as a protection racket where we haven\u2019t been paid enough by the protectees, rather than as a mutually beneficial alliance that has kept peace and expanded the frontiers of democracy.\u201dBy pointing out the close connections between Germany and Russia on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and the degree to which they depend on each other financially, Mr. Trump was borrowing a page from his critics who suggest that because of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election on his behalf, he is beholden to Mr. Putin. It was a way of implying that it is Germany\u2019s leader, not he, who is too compromised to be able to effectively counter the Russian president.\u201cThe former chancellor of Germany is the head of the pipeline company that\u2019s supplying the gas,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, a former German chancellor and friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s who leads the project. \u201cSo you tell me, is that appropriate?\u201dIn a face-to-face meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany later in the day on the sideline of the summit meeting, Mr. Trump was more conciliatory, saying the two had a \u201cvery, very good relationship.\u201d But earlier, Ms. Merkel had reacted sharply to the president\u2019s talk, saying that she had firsthand experience of living under Soviet domination and that Germany made its own decisions.Across the Atlantic, Mr. Trump\u2019s performance drew howls of criticism from Democrats and an implicit rebuke from the Republican-led Congress, which unanimously passed a resolution supporting NATO without debate.The resolution, adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate on Tuesday night and taken up hastily by the House hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on Wednesday, said that the United States \u201cmust remain committed to our NATO allies in the face of any aggression irrespective of their ability to meet the NATO benchmark of spending.\u201dJorge Benitez, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Mr. Trump\u2019s comment was further evidence that he was acting alone and on instinct, and was willing to sow unrest in Brussels that would ultimately be a boon to Mr. Putin.\u201cIt is in Russia\u2019s interest, not the U.S. interest, for the Europeans to have any doubt about U.S. commitment to its allies,\u201d Mr. Benitez said of the president\u2019s actions. \u201cIn trying to get a better deal, he will severely harm the unity of the alliance.\u201dKatie Rogers contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The British Open, and More, Brings the Golf Spotlight to Scotland", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery few years in Scotland, the British Open unfolds right after the Scottish Open, giving golfers time to prepare for the major and providing fans some of the world\u2019s best golf in tournaments only miles apart in Carnoustie and East Lothian.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely huge for Scotland that we have these two events back to back and so close to each other on some of the world\u2019s best links golf courses,\u201d said David Connor, golf public relations manager at VisitScotland.The Scottish Open, which was won by Brandon Stone of South Africa last week at Gullane Golf Club in East Lothian, is about a 100-mile drive from Carnoustie Golf Links, the site of the British Open. \u201cWhen it lines up and happens like this \u2014 which is by no mistake \u2014 the month of July is very much all about golf for Scotland,\u201d Connor said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real excitement having the venues so close. But as the crow flies, it\u2019s a lot less. You could get in a boat and take it from Gullane right up to Carnoustie.\u201dIt\u2019s good for fans, but the lineup especially helps players looking to contend in the British Open, Connor said. \u201cIf you want to win a major championship like the Open, you should come and play the Scottish Open before it just to get your eye in and make sure you\u2019ve had a bit of practice on a links golf course. It\u2019s a slightly different way of playing. And being able to play their way into the Open like this is such a huge bonus for them.\u201dFor Scotland\u2019s Russell Knox, the two tournaments come after he won the Irish Open at Ballyliffin Golf Club in County Donegal earlier this month in a playoff against the Australian Ryan Fox for his second European Tour title. Knox views the Scottish doubleheader as an opportunity to continue his peak form.\u201cI\u2019m preparing well for these two weeks,\u201d Knox said in the week leading up to the Scottish Open. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been an amazing couple of weeks for me before the Scottish Open and the Open, so the key for me this year is to try and keep the momentum going but balance that with trying to save as much energy as possible.\u201dJust two weeks ago, Knox had yet to qualify for the Open. \u201cI came over for the three Rolex Series events knowing that there were three spots at each of the events for the Open and managed to grab one of them by finishing tied for second in France,\u201d he said.\u201cTo play so well on that golf course was huge for my confidence,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI had been playing well in America and was kind of just waiting for a big result.\u201cBut I knew I was playing good, so getting that result in France was huge and then what happened in Ireland on Sunday was just one of the best experiences of my career. To make the putts I did to win such a prestigious tournament was amazing, so I obviously will be going to Gullane and then Carnoustie knowing that my game is there, and that if I can keep playing at this level then I could get into contention at some point.\u201d Knox finished tied for 49th in the Scottish Open.Another homegrown player from Scotland is Stonehaven\u2019s Sam Locke, a 19-year-old barista and golf amateur who qualified for the British Open after winning by seven under par at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick earlier this month.\u201cIt was a great feeling to qualify for your first major championship \u2014 it was brilliant,\u201d Locke said. \u201cI just went out there and played. I went into it trying to play it like any other tournament. I went in just thinking only the top three get in, so just go for it. You never know what can happen. It\u2019s golf.\u201dThe next day, after securing his place playing beside his childhood heroes Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, he was back behind the counter serving coffee. \u201cSome people came in to congratulate me. But generally it was just a normal day at work.\u201dOther of the world\u2019s top golfers looking to capitalize on the Scottish doubleheader include an American contingent led by Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed and Rickie Fowler. Matt Kuchar will take advantage of both events for a potential rematch with Spieth, the defending British Open champion, reminding fans of last year\u2019s chaotic finish for the claret jug in which Spieth made a striking 13th-hole recovery from a penalty drop surrounded by equipment trucks.The doubleheader also features the Englishmen Ian Poulter and Justin Rose, Northern Ireland\u2019s McIlroy, South Africa\u2019s Louis Oosthuizen and Spain\u2019s Rafael Cabrera Bello. Sweden\u2019s Henrik Stenson, who won the British Open in 2016, withdrew from the Scottish Open with an elbow injury but plans to play at Carnoustie.Tournament officials expect roughly 40,000 to 50,000 fans to flood the small towns of East Lothian and Carnoustie during the two weeks for top-level golf, bringing millions into the local economy.\u201cCertainly from a spectator\u2019s point of view, having these two weeks of golf really gets the juices flowing,\u201d Connor said. \u201cFans love it. Scottish golf fans are quite an educated golfing crowd. While they may not be whooping and hollering, they appreciate great golf and great golf shots. They appreciate the skill that it takes to play a certain type of golf like the links course.\u201dWe take golf seriously. We are the home of golf and we enjoy watching the best players of the world coming to compete on courses that have been around for hundreds of years.\u201dFor Knox, the hometown support comes at the perfect time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty exciting couple of weeks for me. It doesn\u2019t get much better for the Scottish players to play our national Open and then the Open in back-to-back weeks on home soil. Hopefully a few of us can give the home crowd something to really cheer about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said that he was not impressed with the lone trade deal that Mr. Trump has struck, with South Korea, and warned that the strong run of economic growth was at risk.\u201cI would just assure you we very much are monitoring the impact on the economy of all these trade issues,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in response to questions about the economic effect.Mr. Mnuchin defended the administration\u2019s approach and insisted that economic growth remained Mr. Trump\u2019s priority, which did nothing to mollify Mr. Hensarling, a close ally of the president.\u201cI appreciate the words; I am concerned about the deeds,\u201d he said.\u201cThe administration needs to explain to Congress where this is all headed,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the committee\u2019s chairman, told Manisha Singh, an assistant secretary at the State Department, as she prepared to testify.\u201cTo my knowledge, not a single person is able to articulate where this is headed, nor what the plans are, nor what the strategy is,\u201d Mr. Corker said.The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, told Ms. Singh at another point that \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the pathway is here, at the end of the day.\u201dMs. Singh, who leads the department\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, defended the administration\u2019s moves. \u201cOur endgame is for China to change its behavior,\u201d she said.After Ms. Singh tried to explain the administration\u2019s approach, Mr. Corker replied, \u201cThat enlightened us in no way.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump prizes unpredictability, his approach to trade agreements is sowing uncertainty that many business leaders, officials, lawmakers and others worry could undercut an otherwise booming economy.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to, you know, dive into a bunch of hypotheticals here,\u201d Mr. Powell said, \u201cbut I would say, you can imagine situations which would be very challenging, where inflation is going up and the economy is weakening.\u201dThe Trump administration has asked China to make a wide array of changes, including reducing its trade surplus with the United States, stopping what it described as theft of American intellectual property and opening Chinese markets to American business.But by giving the Chinese a long list of demands, that has encouraged Beijing to focus on those that are easiest to fulfill, said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cThe administration, to a degree, has given the Chinese an off ramp,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving the Chinese a choice is not an optimal negotiating approach.\u201dChina has also had difficulty figuring out whom to negotiate with, after tentative agreements reached with Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, fell through.\u201cI think they\u2019re coming to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t matter whether Mnuchin or Ross or anybody is in the front of the line, that it\u2019s really going to be figuring out what Trump wants,\u201d said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer.In a sign of the impasse that the dialogue between China and the United States has reached, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a statement on Thursday arguing that it has been unfairly vilified with false claims about its trade practices.\u201cThis is a distortion of facts, therefore groundless,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cFor the purpose of meeting domestic political needs and suppressing China\u2019s development, the U.S. has fabricated a set of policy arguments that distort the truth about Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said on Thursday that Mr. Trump would not do anything to jeopardize economic growth. He insisted that he was going to help work with companies to get exemptions from tariffs and that he would try to persuade businesses such as Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle maker, not to move manufacturing abroad to mitigate the pain of retaliatory tariffs.While Mr. Mnuchin was successful in staving off draconian new Chinese investment restrictions, the tariffs have kept coming and it remains unclear how much influence he really has with Mr. Trump. Despite his private reservations, Mr. Mnuchin continues to defend the administration\u2019s trade policies.\u201cI can assure you that the president listens to my advice,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in response to a question from Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York. \u201cHe is the president. Sometimes he follows my advice, and sometimes he doesn\u2019t, which I respect.\u201dUnimpressed, Mr. Meeks mocked Mr. Trump for describing himself for the second time on Thursday as a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d and asked the Treasury secretary if he saw himself the same way.\u201cI am stable,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said with a chuckle.Ana Swanson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Holds a Peaceful Vote, Its First Ballot Since Mugabe\u2019s Fall", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Millions of Zimbabweans cast ballots on Monday in a general election that many hoped would earn the endorsement of Western governments and win economic assistance needed to repair decades of misrule under Robert Mugabe.Long lines of enthusiastic voters formed at polling stations on the outskirts of Harare, the capital, before voting began at 7 a.m., following a peaceful campaign without the widespread violence, intimidation and fraud of previous elections. Election observers from Europe and the United States, long barred by Mr. Mugabe, joined local organizations in monitoring the vote.\u201cThe election is O.K., it\u2019s taking place peacefully so far,\u201d said Nyasha Simbo, who had just voted in Westlea, a middle-class neighborhood where the opposition has long had support. In the past two elections, Ms. Simbo added, she had sheltered friends fleeing violence at the hands of the ruling ZANU-PF party and the police.By midday, voting appeared to be going peacefully and turnout seemed high nationwide, according to the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, a private Zimbabwean organization that has deployed 6,500 observers across the country.\u201cWe have yet to receive the kind of reports of problems we used to get by this time from the rural constituencies,\u201d said Andrew Makoni, the organization\u2019s chairman.Mr. Makoni added that he was receiving word of trouble with voter rolls \u2014 people incapable of voting because they had not been registered, or registered at different locations. But he added that it was too soon to say how widespread the problems were, and whether they resulted from logistical issues or fraud.Though Mr. Mnangagwa served for decades as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s enforcer, including orchestrating the rigging of previous elections, he has presented himself as a break from the past \u2014 a pragmatist eager to mend relations with the West and make Zimbabwe business-friendly.For Mr. Chamisa, 40, the election was a chance to fulfill the goal of his predecessor, Morgan Tsvangirai, who died this year, to dislodge ZANU-PF, in power since liberation from white-minority rule in 1980. Mr. Chamisa earned recognition for his tenure as minister of information, communication and technology in a government of national unity between 2009 and 2013.After Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s death, Mr. Chamisa outmaneuvered rivals to become head of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance.Western governments have made clear that a free and fair election was a precondition for the possible resumption of desperately sought loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international creditors.Zimbabwe became a pariah in the eyes of Western nations in the early 2000s, after Mr. Mugabe championed the violent seizure of farms owned by the descendants of white settlers. Despite Mr. Mugabe\u2019s attempts to cultivate China as an alternative source of assistance, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy has continued to disintegrate in recent years.Today, Zimbabwe does not have its own currency. The lack of a physical supply of American dollars and a parallel so-called bond note has created a disorientating reality: Digital cash has become widespread in the capital while many in rural areas are resorting to barter.In the months leading to the election, opposition parties were allowed to campaign in ZANU-PF\u2019s rural strongholds and other areas where they had previously faced harassment and violence. Election observers said that intimidation of rural voters had greatly decreased.But observers and opposition parties also pointed out problems, especially with the integrity of the voter rolls. Government election officials refused to provide a full accounting of how the rolls were compiled, arguing that the law did not oblige them to do so.That has raised suspicion among many voters who \u2014 given the history of vote-rigging by ZANU-PF and the central role played by Mr. Mnangagwa \u2014 assumed that fraud was taking place.\u201cThey might capitalize on the gray areas of the electoral act to do shady things,\u201d Tonderai Mapfumo, 23, said of the government\u2019s handling of the voter rolls as he walked into a polling station at a primary school.Still, an election season that compared favorably to previous ones has left many voters optimistic about Zimbabwe\u2019s future.\u201cI think it brings sanity in the country,\u201d said Kennedy Taonangoro, a banker who was preparing to vote early in the morning. \u201cI think it will give a new direction.\u201dResults were expected later this week. If no presidential candidate wins more than 50 percent of the votes, a runoff is expected to take place in early September.On Monday, in a midday news conference, election officials said they had reported two presidential candidates to the police for violating the electoral act. Though they refused to identify the candidates, they appeared to be referring to Mr. Mnangagwa and Mr. Chamisa \u2014 both of whom made political statements on Sunday, a day after campaigning had officially ended.As for Mr. Chamisa, he had to distance himself from the apparent endorsement by Mr. Mugabe. In recent weeks, there appeared to be an unusual rapprochement between Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Chamisa, who spoke favorably of the former president on a few occasions.In the endless topsy-turvy infighting and repositioning among Zimbabwe\u2019s political elites, the ZANU-PF faction that lost to Mr. Mnangagwa last November \u2014 led by Mr. Mugabe\u2019s wife, Grace, and a former education minister, Jonathan Moyo \u2014 declared its support for Mr. Chamisa, the leader of the group that has long opposed ZANU-PF.\u201cVote for Chamisa,\u201d Mr. Moyo, who is believed to be in exile in Kenya, tweeted on Monday morning.The day before, at Mr. Mugabe\u2019s news conference, as the 94-year-old former president slouched in his chair and spoke in a feeble voice, his wife instructed him to repeat his support for Mr. Chamisa. \u201cSay that again,\u201d she told him at least twice.But voters on Monday dismissed the never-ending political intrigue.\u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d said Desmond Danga, who was voting for the first time. \u201cI just want the economy to get better.\u201dJeffrey Moyo contributed reporting from Harare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employers\u2019 Hiring Push Brings Workers Off the Bench", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite sharpening trade tensions, a hefty rise in payrolls has provided the latest evidence that the American economy is strong enough to keep pulling benched workers back into action.The number of Americans working part time because of their inability to find a full-time position fell \u2014 as did the number of those too discouraged to bother searching.\u201cI\u2019m really excited to see that the labor force is growing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.Over all, the economy added 213,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent, but Ms. Barrera was unruffled, saying, \u201cThere were some people who weren\u2019t participating in the labor force who are now being encouraged to return.\u201dFor workers, the modest 2.7 percent increase in the average hourly wage over the past year was disappointing; pay raises are a nose behind some measures of inflation. But the slow pace does undercut arguments that the economy is in danger of revving too fast.\u201cThis should take a little bit of pressure off the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of tightening,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, referring to the debate over how quickly to raise benchmark interest rates.\u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d President Trump said Friday on Twitter after the Labor Department\u2019s data for June was released.For employers, the more immediate challenge has been finding qualified, reliable workers at the going wage rate. In addition to the growing ranks of new job hunters, the quickening competition is giving more employees the confidence to quit in search of a better deal. But the share of prime-age workers participating in the labor force is below the level that prevailed a decade ago. And the number of job openings is striding ahead of the number of workers ready to fill them.\u201cThere\u2019s more jobs than there are people available for jobs \u2014 at every level,\u201d from the factory floor to the executive suite, said Joe Galvin, chief research officer of Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives.Still, as this latest jobs report shows, the lengthening list of help-wanted postings has had only a modest effect on hourly earnings. Several employers said their reluctance to raise prices limited the wages they could offer.Gigi Schweikert, the president and chief operating officer Lightbridge Academy, which operates child care facilities, said the company was moving toward a $15-an-hour minimum over three years, but had to keep its fees affordable.\u201cWe are always looking for job candidates,\u201d she said, acknowledging that her industry is known for high turnover rates, low pay and a predominance of female workers. \u201cWe want to be more aggressive, but we can\u2019t price parents out of the market.\u201dLaid off 11 months ago in Philadelphia, Jim Stallard said he turned down four jobs because \u201cthey were all extremely low paid and didn\u2019t have any benefits.\u201d Mr. Stallard, 57, eventually went to work at a large-format printer for $18 an hour \u2014 far less than the $30 an hour and ample health and retirement benefits he earned previously managing the print and copy shop at Drexel University.\u201cYou just cannot be in this game without being competitive,\u201d Ms. Burke said of salaries.The unemployment rate for blacks also worsened in June from the previous month, rising to 6.5 percent, while the rate among Hispanics improved, falling to 4.6 percent. (Among whites, the jobless rate is 3.5 percent.)Heightening trade tensions are not the only risks over the longer term.As Oxford Economics, an economic research firm, noted in its newsletter, \u201cWhile it may feel like a party in the U.S.A., several risks are building,\u201d including growing consumer debt.Most economists continue to warn that the economic high has been pumped up in part by deep tax cuts financed by ballooning debt.At the moment, though, \u201cthe trends are strong,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics noted, and \u201cthe unemployment rate is going to keep falling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the value of American tariffs on Chinese goods that went into effect on Friday. It is $34 billion, not $34 million.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G-20 Finance Ministers, Failing to Halt Trump\u2019s Trade War, Warn of Its Global Risks", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo days of fitful talks at the Group of 20 gathering in the Argentine capital appeared only to raise the odds that the friction will intensify as Mr. Trump threatens more tariffs and other countries vow to retaliate. In their closing statement, or communiqu\u00e9, officials at the G-20 on Sunday pointed to trade tensions as a new risk factor that could depress global growth.\u201cGrowth has been less synchronized recently and downside risks over the short- and medium-term have increased,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said. \u201cThese include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies.\u201dThe International Monetary Fund projected last week that the currently announced tariffs would reduce global economic output by $430 billion, or half a percent, in 2020, if they remained in place and shook investor confidence. It argued that the United States was particularly vulnerable to a slowdown because it would bear the brunt of tariff retaliation from other countries.\u201cI urged once more that trade conflicts be resolved via international cooperation without resort to exceptional measures,\u201d Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, said on Sunday, referring to the message that she delivered to policymakers in meetings.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he disagreed with Ms. Lagarde\u2019s assessment of how the United States would fare. The Trump administration has said the tariffs have hurt certain industries in the United States but, at this point, not the broader economy.\u201cWorld trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle, and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,\u201d said Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister. \u201cWe call on the United States to see sense, to respect the rules of multilateralism and to respect their allies.\u201dMr. Le Maire said Europe would not negotiate \u201cwith a gun to the head.\u201dInternational summit meetings, which once showcased American leadership, have under the Trump administration become awkward affairs in which the United States is increasingly isolated. That remained the case in Argentina, where Mr. Mnuchin traveled on behalf of the United States on a fraught mission of economic diplomacy. Although he said his conversations with other leaders were cordial, he acknowledged that talks on trade were often very \u201cdirect.\u201dOlaf Scholz, the German finance minister, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation, arguing that Europe\u2019s monetary policy is \u201cvery rational\u201d and not geared to create artificial economic success.One of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s goals before the meeting was to encourage the European Union, Japan and other countries to work with the United States to pressure China to change its trade practices. However, the Treasury secretary said that no progress was made on that front in multicountry meetings, and that aside from pleasantries, he had no communication with the Chinese delegation.\u201cAnytime they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a concluding news conference on Sunday.Europe, which is increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump will impose auto tariffs, is taking Mr. Mnuchin up on such an offer this week. European Union officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will travel to Washington for a meeting with Mr. Trump and his economic team in hopes that car tariffs can be avoided.The G-20 meeting also offered the United States an opportunity to jump-start talks with Canada and Mexico about renegotiating Nafta. Mr. Mnuchin and Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s finance minister, expressed hope that such talks could gather momentum now that the Mexican election is over.\u201cMy job is to continue to be optimistic,\u201d Mr. Morneau said, suggesting that he sensed a desire by the United States to preserve the trilateral pact.However, Mr. Morneau added, the United States\u2019 imposition of tariffs has complicated the process. He warned that tariffs would raise prices on Americans and Canadians and that if Mr. Trump levied another round of them, Canada would have no choice but to retaliate again.\u201cThere continues to be anxiety around trade,\u201d he said.Besides trade, officials from the countries discussed issues such as cryptocurrencies, international tax and terrorism financing. Although drafting the communiqu\u00e9 has been a struggle in previous meetings, officials said this one was agreed to with relative ease despite the differences on trade and tariffs.For his part, Mr. Mnuchin pushed back against the premise that the United States had become a pariah in international forums. Participating in more than 20 meetings with his counterparts in two days, the Treasury secretary had little down time in Buenos Aires.\u201cIf requests for meetings is related to popularity, I\u2019m pretty popular here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He added, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel isolated at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Doomsday Prepping\u2019 for Another Round of Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Zentner is the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.Even if all the proposed actions don\u2019t go into effect, prolonged uncertainty alone can have a measurable impact on economic growth, and we should not underestimate the risks.Estimating the magnitude of the impact can be tricky. Consider this: Just the threat of trade actions, even if there is no follow-through, is enough to dent business sentiment and investment. Most business decisions are based on a five-year horizon. That means you need to be able to predict what you can charge for your product, and what it will cost to make it. Trade disputes provide a murky lens at best, which most likely delays investment.Nevertheless, the United States is on track for G.D.P. growth of more than 4 percent in the second quarter, according to my estimates. This may lead some folks to conclude that concerns over trade are overblown.I caution strongly against that conclusion.First of all, this growth is taking place against the backdrop of corporate tax cuts, which are expected to lift business spending on capital and equipment. If not for the lingering uncertainty over trade, investment in the United States might have been even stronger.Second, roughly half of the growth we are seeing now is a result of a side effect of trade tensions \u2014 \u201cdoomsday prepping.\u201d Global companies are stockpiling raw materials, intermediate goods and finished goods before tariffs take effect and raise the prices of those goods. Once the bite of tariffs hits demand, companies will no longer need to build inventories, and this boost to economic growth could end. Such a reversal is not likely to sit well with investors as they witness a potentially sharp slowdown in the second half of the year, and that could affect both stock and bond markets.Economists who believe tariffs will have only a small impact on growth need to cast a wider net. While the most direct effects will likely come from retaliatory measures that dent American exports, those impacts are just a fraction of what should be considered. Economists also need to consider the indirect effects of tariffs on consumer demand. Of the first $50 billion of announced tariffs, less than 2 percent apply to consumer goods. So the spillover effect on consumer demand \u2014 tariffs passed on as higher prices to consumers \u2014 should be quite small. But consumer goods represent more than 30 percent of the latest round of tariffs, which affect $200 billion in Chinese goods and could go into effect as soon as September.Not all industries can pass on the cost of tariffs to the consumer. There are a few other options. Companies can pursue cost-sharing with their trade partners to preserve business on both sides. Or they could choose to absorb higher costs and live with smaller profit margins. Of course, investors don\u2019t take kindly to companies facing margin squeezes. Finally, firms can absorb the tariffs and cut costs elsewhere, but labor is the largest line item, which means layoffs or slower hiring.Changes in how financial markets respond will also amplify the effects of tariffs. We\u2019ve already seen a good deal of volatility in markets every time there is news about escalating trade tensions. Since the start of the year, financial markets have become increasingly sensitive to the risks of further tensions. As the actual direct effects of each round of tariffs become clear, we should not assume that financial markets will continue to absorb the news smoothly.I believe this is perhaps the single biggest risk to the global economy: At some point, investors will start to question whether global supply chains can withstand the escalating pressures from multiple rounds of tariffs, and financial markets may start to react in unpredictable ways.The Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, has acknowledged that businesses are increasingly concerned, but the Fed has not built any negative effects from trade into its outlook \u201cjust yet.\u201d Perhaps a sharp slowdown in growth in the second half of the year will convince them it\u2019s time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript: Obama\u2019s Speech Defending Democracy", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn his highest-profile speech since leaving office, former President Barack Obama on Tuesday offered an impassioned defense of democracy and international institutions, including the United Nations and NATO, in a veiled rebuke of his successor, President Trump.Mr. Obama spoke at a cricket stadium in Johannesburg, at an annual event honoring Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid South African leader, who would have turned 100 this week.The following is a transcript of Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, which was provided by his office.________MR. OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you so much.AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!MR. OBAMA: Thank you.To Mama Gra\u00e7a Machel, members of the Mandela family, the Machel family, to President Ramaphosa who you can see is inspiring new hope in this great country, professor, doctor, distinguished guests, to Mama Sisulu and the Sisulu family, to the people of South Africa, it is a singular honor for me to be here with all of you as we gather to celebrate the birth and life of one of history\u2019s true giants.Let me begin by a correction and a few confessions. The correction is that I am a very good dancer. I just want to be clear about that. Michelle is a little better.The confessions. No. 1, I was not exactly invited to be here. I was ordered in a very nice way to be here by Gra\u00e7a Machel.Confession No. 2: I forgot my geography and the fact that right now it\u2019s winter in South Africa. I didn\u2019t bring a coat, and this morning I had to send somebody out to the mall because I am wearing long johns. I was born in Hawaii.Confession No. 3: When my staff told me that I was to deliver a lecture, I thought back to the stuffy old professors in bow ties and tweed, and I wondered if this was one more sign of the stage of life that I\u2019m entering, along with gray hair and slightly failing eyesight. I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture. I thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didn\u2019t conform to two-minute soundbites.But given the strange and uncertain times that we are in \u2014 and they are strange, and they are uncertain \u2014 with each day\u2019s news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. So I hope you\u2019ll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where we\u2019ve been, and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a road map for where we need to go next.One hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of M \u2014 oh, see there, I always get that \u2014 I got to get my Ms right when I\u2019m in South Africa. Mvezo \u2014 I got it. Truthfully, it\u2019s because it\u2019s so cold my lips stuck.So in his autobiography he describes a happy childhood; he\u2019s looking after cattle, he\u2019s playing with the other boys, eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And as many of you know, he\u2019s quoted saying, \u201cWhy she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.\u201dThere was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid.Most of Africa, including my father\u2019s homeland, was under colonial rule. The dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madiba\u2019s birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labor. And the inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given.And such a view of the world \u2014 that certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquest \u2014 that view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks.Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks. And around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and color and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country.That was the world just 100 years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second World War, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the 20th century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination, but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual.In those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed; and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted; and access to public education was expanded; and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. And in my own country, the moral force of the civil rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalized groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship.It was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homeland \u2014 a fight to end apartheid, a fight to ensure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised nonwhite citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs.Madiba\u2019s light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late \u201970s he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to re-examine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, you\u2019ll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world.Do you remember that feeling? It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted people\u2019s lives and confined the human spirit \u2014 that all that was crumbling before our eyes.And then as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections; as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood that \u2014 we understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world.And during the last decades of the 20th century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesn\u2019t mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward.Yes, there were still tragedies \u2014 bloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo. Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear d\u00e9tente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the world\u2019s system of trade \u2014 all that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the world\u2019s great powers.And from Europe to Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies. The march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive.And with these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadn\u2019t counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power; they had the possibilities of doing business.And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts. And suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once-starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted. And meanwhile, the spread of the internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially, all the world\u2019s knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village.That\u2019s what happened just over the course of a few decades. And all that progress is real. It has been broad, and it has been deep, and it all happened in what \u2014 by the standards of human history \u2014 was nothing more than a blink of an eye. And now an entire generation has grown up in a world that by most measures has gotten steadily freer and healthier and wealthier and less violent and more tolerant during the course of their lifetimes.It should make us hopeful. But if we cannot deny the very real strides that our world has made since that moment when Madiba took those steps out of confinement, we also have to recognize all the ways that the international order has fallen short of its promise. In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business.So we have to start by admitting that whatever laws may have existed on the books, whatever wonderful pronouncements existed in constitutions, whatever nice words were spoken during these last several decades at international conferences or in the halls of the United Nations, the previous structures of privilege and power and injustice and exploitation never completely went away. They were never fully dislodged. Caste differences still impact the life chances of people on the Indian subcontinent. Ethnic and religious differences still determine who gets opportunity from the Central Europe to the Gulf. It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa.And it is also a fact that the accumulated disadvantages of years of institutionalized oppression have created yawning disparities in income, and in wealth, and in education, and in health, in personal safety, in access to credit. Women and girls around the world continue to be blocked from positions of power and authority. They continue to be prevented from getting a basic education. They are disproportionately victimized by violence and abuse. They\u2019re still paid less than men for doing the same work. That\u2019s still happening. Economic opportunity, for all the magnificence of the global economy, all the shining skyscrapers that have transformed the landscape around the world, entire neighborhoods, entire cities, entire regions, entire nations have been bypassed.In other words, for far too many people, the more things have changed, the more things stayed the same. And while globalization and technology have opened up new opportunities, have driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalization has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It\u2019s also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor\u2019s bargaining power. It\u2019s made it easier for capital to avoid tax laws and the regulations of nation-states \u2014 can just move billions, trillions of dollars with a tap of a computer key.And the result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It\u2019s meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, that\u2019s a statistic. Think about that. In many middle-income and developing countries, new wealth has just tracked the old bad deal that people got because it reinforced or even compounded existing patterns of inequality, the only difference is it created even greater opportunities for corruption on an epic scale.And for once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don\u2019t have specialized skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms. In every country, just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries\u2019 political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored.Now, it should be noted that this new international elite, the professional class that supports them, differs in important respects from the ruling aristocracies of old. It includes many who are self-made. It includes champions of meritocracy. And although still mostly white and male, as a group they reflect a diversity of nationalities and ethnicities that would have not existed a hundred years ago. A decent percentage consider themselves liberal in their politics, modern and cosmopolitan in their outlook.Unburdened by parochialism, or nationalism, or overt racial prejudice or strong religious sentiment, they are equally comfortable in New York or London or Shanghai or Nairobi or Buenos Aires, or Johannesburg. Many are sincere and effective in their philanthropy. Some of them count Nelson Mandela among their heroes. Some even supported Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States, and by virtue of my status as a former head of state, some of them consider me as an honorary member of the club. And I get invited to these fancy things, you know? They\u2019ll fly me out.But what\u2019s nevertheless true is that in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. And their decisions \u2014 their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe \u2014 are often done without malice; it\u2019s just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.But too often, these decisions are also made without reference to notions of human solidarity \u2014 or a ground-level understanding of the consequences that will be felt by particular people in particular communities by the decisions that are made. And from their board rooms or retreats, global decision makers don\u2019t get a chance to see sometimes the pain in the faces of laid-off workers. Their kids don\u2019t suffer when cuts in public education and health care result as a consequence of a reduced tax base because of tax avoidance. They can\u2019t hear the resentment of an older tradesman when he complains that a newcomer doesn\u2019t speak his language on a job site where he once worked. They\u2019re less subject to the discomfort and the displacement that some of their countrymen may feel as globalization scrambles not only existing economic arrangements, but traditional social and religious mores.Which is why, at the end of the 20th century, while some Western commentators were declaring the end of history and the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy and the virtues of the global supply chain, so many missed signs of a brewing backlash \u2014 a backlash that arrived in so many forms. It announced itself most violently with 9/11 and the emergence of transnational terrorist networks, fueled by an ideology that perverted one of the world\u2019s great religions and asserted a struggle not just between Islam and the West but between Islam and modernity, and an ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq didn\u2019t help, accelerating a sectarian conflict.Russia, already humiliated by its reduced influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, feeling threatened by democratic movements along its borders, suddenly started reasserting authoritarian control and in some cases meddling with its neighbors. China, emboldened by its economic success, started bristling against criticism of its human rights record; it framed the promotion of universal values as nothing more than foreign meddling, imperialism under a new name.Within the United States, within the European Union, challenges to globalization first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right, as you started seeing populist movements \u2014 which, by the way, are often cynically funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing government constraints on their business interests \u2014 these movements tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores; fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn\u2019t look like them or sound like them or pray as they did.And perhaps more than anything else, the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in which the reckless behavior of financial elites resulted in years of hardship for ordinary people all around the world, made all the previous assurances of experts ring hollow \u2014 all those assurances that somehow financial regulators knew what they were doing, that somebody was minding the store, that global economic integration was an unadulterated good. Because of the actions taken by governments during and after that crisis, including, I should add, by aggressive steps by my administration, the global economy has now returned to healthy growth.But the credibility of the international system, the faith in experts in places like Washington or Brussels, all that had taken a blow. And a politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear, and that kind of politics is now on the move. It\u2019s on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts.Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained \u2014 the form of it \u2014 but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. In the West, you\u2019ve got far-right parties that oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. Many developing countries now are looking at China\u2019s model of authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good?The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media \u2014 once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity \u2014 has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.So on Madiba\u2019s 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads \u2014 a moment in time at which two very different visions of humanity\u2019s future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories, two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond?Should we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba\u2019s release from prison, from the Berlin Wall coming down \u2014 should we see that hope that we had as na\u00efve and misguided? Should we understand the last 25 years of global integration as nothing more than a detour from the previous inevitable cycle of history \u2014 where might makes right, and politics is a hostile competition between tribes and races and religions, and nations compete in a zero-sum game, constantly teetering on the edge of conflict until full-blown war breaks out? Is that what we think?Let me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela\u2019s vision. I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King and Abraham Lincoln. I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multiracial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they\u2019re endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible and that it can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good. That\u2019s what I believe. And I believe we have no choice but to move forward; that those of us who believe in democracy and civil rights and a common humanity have a better story to tell. And I believe this not just based on sentiment, I believe it based on hard evidence.The fact that the world\u2019s most prosperous and successful societies, the ones with the highest living standards and the highest levels of satisfaction among their people, happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal, progressive ideal that we talk about and have nurtured the talents and contributions of all their citizens.The fact that authoritarian governments have been shown time and time again to breed corruption, because they\u2019re not accountable; to repress their people; to lose touch eventually with reality; to engage in bigger and bigger lies that ultimately result in economic and political and cultural and scientific stagnation. Look at history. Look at the facts.The fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together \u2014 eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books.The fact that technology cannot be put back in a bottle, so we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we now live close together and populations are going to be moving, and environmental challenges are not going to go away on their own, so that the only way to effectively address problems like climate change or mass migration or pandemic disease will be to develop systems for more international cooperation, not less.We have a better story to tell. But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men. History shows how easily people can be convinced to turn on those who look different, or worship God in a different way. So if we\u2019re truly to continue Madiba\u2019s long walk towards freedom, we\u2019re going to have to work harder and we\u2019re going to have to be smarter. We\u2019re going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past.And so in the brief time remaining, let me just suggest a few guideposts for the road ahead, guideposts that draw from Madiba\u2019s work, his words, the lessons of his life. First, Madiba shows those of us who believe in freedom and democracy we are going to have to fight harder to reduce inequality and promote lasting economic opportunity for all people.Now, I don\u2019t believe in economic determinism. Human beings don\u2019t live on bread alone. But they need bread. And history shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly; and that once people achieve more than mere subsistence, then they\u2019re measuring their well-being by how they compare to their neighbors, and whether their children can expect to live a better life. And when economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow \u2014 and that dynamic eats away at democracy. Sometimes it may be straight-out corruption, but sometimes it may not involve the exchange of money; it\u2019s just folks who are that wealthy get what they want, and it undermines human freedom.And Madiba understood this. This is not new. He warned us about this. He said: \u201cWhere globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and the powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and the weaker, [then] we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.\u201d That\u2019s what he said.So if we are serious about universal freedom today, if we care about social justice today, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. And I would respectfully amend what Madiba said. I don\u2019t do it often, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s not enough for us to protest; we\u2019re going to have to build, we\u2019re going to have to innovate, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how do we close this widening chasm of wealth and opportunity both within countries and between them.And how we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new president is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so. But we can learn from the last 70 years that it will not involve unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism. It also won\u2019t involve old-style command-and-control socialism form the top. That was tried; it didn\u2019t work very well.For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system \u2014 one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker \u2014 that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business; that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich but they\u2019re giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.I should add, by the way, right now I\u2019m actually surprised by how much money I got, and let me tell you something: I don\u2019t have half as much as most of these folks or a tenth or a hundredth. There\u2019s only so much you can eat. There\u2019s only so big a house you can have. There\u2019s only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it\u2019s enough.You don\u2019t have to take a vow of poverty just to say, \u201cWell, let me help out and let a few of the other folks \u2014 let me look at that child out there who doesn\u2019t have enough to eat or needs some school fees, let me help him out. I\u2019ll pay a little more in taxes. It\u2019s okay. I can afford it.\u201d I mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more, instead of saying: \u201cWow, I\u2019ve got so much. Who can I help? How can I give more and more and more?\u201d That\u2019s ambition. That\u2019s impact. That\u2019s influence. What an amazing gift to be able to help people, not just yourself. Where was I? I ad-libbed. You get the point.It involves promoting an inclusive capitalism both within nations and between nations. And as we pursue, for example, the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to get past the charity mind-set. We\u2019ve got to bring more resources to the forgotten pockets of the world through investment and entrepreneurship, because there is talent everywhere in the world if given an opportunity.When it comes to the international system of commerce and trade, it\u2019s legitimate for poorer countries to continue to seek access to wealthier markets. And by the way, wealthier markets, that\u2019s not the big problem that you\u2019re having \u2014 that a small African country is sending you tea and flowers. That\u2019s not your biggest economic challenge. It\u2019s also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries, to make sure that they\u2019re providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers.But even as there are discussions to be had around trade and commerce, it\u2019s important to recognize this reality: While the outsourcing of jobs from north to south, from east to west, while a lot of that was a dominant trend in the late 20th century, the biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology. And the biggest challenge for your new president when we think about how we\u2019re going to employ more people here is going to be also technology, because artificial intelligence is here and it is accelerating, and you\u2019re going to have driverless cars, and you\u2019re going to have more and more automated services, and that\u2019s going to make the job of giving everybody work that is meaningful tougher, and we\u2019re going to have to be more imaginative, and the pact of change is going to require us to do more fundamental reimagining of our social and political arrangements, to protect the economic security and the dignity that comes with a job.It\u2019s not just money that a job provides; it provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose. And so we\u2019re going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our workweek, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. But we\u2019re going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track. Second, Madiba teaches us that some principles really are universal \u2014 and the most important one is the principle that we are bound together by a common humanity and that each individual has inherent dignity and worth.Now, it\u2019s surprising that we have to affirm this truth today. More than a quarter century after Madiba walked out of prison, I still have to stand here at a lecture and devote some time to saying that black people and white people and Asian people and Latin American people and women and men and gays and straights, that we are all human, that our differences are superficial, and that we should treat each other with care and respect. I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well established.But it turns out, as we\u2019re seeing in this recent drift into reactionary politics, that the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished. So we\u2019ve got to constantly be on the lookout and fight for people who seek to elevate themselves by putting somebody else down. And by the way, we also have to actively resist \u2014 this is important, particularly in some countries in Africa like my own father\u2019s homeland; I\u2019ve made this point before \u2014 we have to resist the notion that basic human rights like freedom to dissent, or the right of women to fully participate in the society, or the right of minorities to equal treatment, or the rights of people not to be beat up and jailed because of their sexual orientation \u2014 we have to be careful not to say that somehow, well, that doesn\u2019t apply to us, that those are Western ideas rather than universal imperatives.Again, Madiba, he anticipated things. He knew what he was talking about. In 1964, before he received the sentence that condemned him to die in prison, he explained from the dock that, \u201cThe Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.\u201d In other words, he didn\u2019t say well, those books weren\u2019t written by South Africans so I just \u2014 I can\u2019t claim them. No, he said that\u2019s part of my inheritance. That\u2019s part of the human inheritance. That applies here in this country, to me, and to you.And that\u2019s part of what gave him the moral authority that the apartheid regime could never claim, because he was more familiar with their best values than they were. He had read their documents more carefully than they had. And he went on to say, \u201cPolitical division based on color is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one color group by another.\u201d That\u2019s Nelson Mandela speaking in 1964, when I was three years old.What was true then remains true today. Basic truths do not change. It is a truth that can be embraced by the English, and by the Indian, and by the Mexican and by the Bantu and by the Luo and by the American. It is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion \u2014 that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. That we see ourselves in other people. That we can recognize common hopes and common dreams. And it is a truth that is incompatible with any form of discrimination based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation. And it is a truth that, by the way, when embraced, actually delivers practical benefits, since it ensures that a society can draw upon the talents and energy and skill of all its people. And if you doubt that, just ask the French football team that just won the World Cup. Because not all of those folks \u2014 not all of those folks look like Gauls to me. But they\u2019re French. They\u2019re French.Embracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities. Madiba never stopped being proud of his tribal heritage. He didn\u2019t stop being proud of being a black man and being a South African. But he believed, as I believe, that you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that you\u2019re a little insecure about your heritage if you\u2019ve got to put somebody else\u2019s heritage down. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Don\u2019t you get a sense sometimes \u2014 again, I\u2019m ad-libbing here \u2014 that these people who are so intent on putting people down and puffing themselves up that they\u2019re small-hearted, that there\u2019s something they\u2019re just afraid of.Madiba knew that we cannot claim justice for ourselves when it\u2019s only reserved for some. Madiba understood that we can\u2019t say we\u2019ve got a just society simply because we replaced the color of the person on top of an unjust system, so the person looks like us even though they\u2019re doing the same stuff, and somehow now we\u2019ve got justice. That doesn\u2019t work.It\u2019s not justice if now you\u2019re on top, so I\u2019m going to do the same thing that those folks were doing to me and now I\u2019m going to do it to you. That\u2019s not justice. \u201cI detest racialism,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it comes from a black man or a white man.\u201dNow, we have to acknowledge that there is disorientation that comes from rapid change and modernization, and the fact that the world has shrunk, and we\u2019re going to have to find ways to lessen the fears of those who feel threatened. In the West\u2019s current debate around immigration, for example, it\u2019s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you\u2019re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home.Those are legitimate things and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly. But that can\u2019t be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion. There\u2019s got to be some consistency. And we can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognize that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child.Third, Madiba reminds us that democracy is about more than just elections. When he was freed from prison, Madiba\u2019s popularity \u2014 well, you couldn\u2019t even measure it. He could have been president for life. Am I wrong? Who was going to run against him? I mean, Ramaphosa was popular, but come on. Plus he was a young \u2014 he was too young. Had he chose, Madiba could have governed by executive fiat, unconstrained by check and balances. But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new Constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom.No individual \u2014 not Mandela, not Obama \u2014 are entirely immune to the corrupting influences of absolute power, if you can do whatever you want and everyone\u2019s too afraid to tell you when you\u2019re making a mistake. No one is immune from the dangers of that. Mandela understood this. He said, \u201cDemocracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.\u201d He understood it\u2019s not just about who has the most votes. It\u2019s also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work. So we have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets 90 percent of the vote because all the opposition is locked up or can\u2019t get on TV is a democracy.Democracy depends on strong institutions and it\u2019s about minority rights and checks and balances, and freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press, and the right to protest and petition the government, and an independent judiciary, and everybody having to follow the law. And yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. I know, I promise. But the efficiency that\u2019s offered by an autocrat, that\u2019s a false promise. Don\u2019t take that one, because it leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual and not the other way around. And it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real.So for those of us who are interested in strengthening democracy, let\u2019s also stop \u2014 it\u2019s time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world\u2019s capitals and the centers of power and to start focusing more on the grass-roots, because that\u2019s where democratic legitimacy comes from. Not from the top down, not from abstract theories, not just from experts, but from the bottom up. Knowing the lives of those who are struggling.As a community organizer, I learned as much from a laid-off steelworker in Chicago or a single mom in a poor neighborhood that I visited as I learned from the finest economists in the Oval Office. Democracy means being in touch and in tune with life as it\u2019s lived in our communities, and that\u2019s what we should expect from our leaders, and it depends upon cultivating leaders at the grass-roots who can help bring about change and implement it on the ground and can tell leaders in fancy buildings, this isn\u2019t working down here. And to make democracy work, Madiba shows us that we also have to keep teaching our children, and ourselves \u2014 and this is really hard \u2014 to engage with people not only who look different but who hold different views. This is hard.Most of us prefer to surround ourselves with opinions that validate what we already believe. You notice the people who you think are smart are the people who agree with you. Funny how that works. But democracy demands that we\u2019re able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they\u2019ll change ours. And you can\u2019t do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can\u2019t do it if you insist that those who aren\u2019t like you \u2014 because they\u2019re white, or because they\u2019re male \u2014 that somehow there\u2019s no way they can understand what I\u2019m feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters.Madiba, he lived this complexity. In prison, he studied Afrikaans so that he could better understand the people who were jailing him. And when he got out of prison, he extended a hand to those who had jailed him, because he knew that they had to be a part of the democratic South Africa that he wanted to build. \u201cTo make peace with an enemy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cone must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one\u2019s partner.\u201dSo those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether it\u2019s on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable. You can\u2019t expect to get 100 percent of what you want all the time; sometimes, you have to compromise. That doesn\u2019t mean abandoning your principles, but instead it means holding on to those principles and then having the confidence that they\u2019re going to stand up to a serious democratic debate. That\u2019s how America\u2019s founders intended our system to work \u2014 that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and proof it would be possible to arrive at a basis for common ground.And I should add for this to work, we have to actually believe in an objective reality. This is another one of these things that I didn\u2019t have to lecture about. You have to believe in facts. Without facts, there is no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to cooperate. I can find common ground for those who oppose the Paris Accords because, for example, they might say, well, it\u2019s not going to work, you can\u2019t get everybody to cooperate, or they might say it\u2019s more important for us to provide cheap energy for the poor, even if it means in the short term that there\u2019s more pollution. At least I can have a debate with them about that and I can show them why I think clean energy is the better path, especially for poor countries, that you can leapfrog old technologies. I can\u2019t find common ground if somebody says climate change is just not happening, when almost all of the world\u2019s scientists tell us it is. I don\u2019t know where to start talking to you about this. If you start saying it\u2019s an elaborate hoax, I don\u2019t know what to \u2014 where do we start?Unfortunately, too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in state-sponsored propaganda; we see it in internet-driven fabrications, we see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment, we see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they\u2019re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be if you caught them lying they\u2019d be like, \u201cAh, man.\u201d Now they just keep on lying.By the way, this is what I think Mama Gra\u00e7a was talking about in terms of maybe some sense of humility that Madiba felt, like sometimes just basic stuff, me not completely lying to people seems pretty basic, I don\u2019t think of myself as a great leader just because I don\u2019t completely make stuff up. You\u2019d think that was a baseline. Anyway, we see it in the promotion of anti-intellectualism and the rejection of science from leaders who find critical thinking and data somehow politically inconvenient. And, as with the denial of rights, the denial of facts runs counter to democracy, it could be its undoing, which is why we must zealously protect independent media; and we have to guard against the tendency for social media to become purely a platform for spectacle, outrage or disinformation; and we have to insist that our schools teach critical thinking to our young people, not just blind obedience.Which, I\u2019m sure you are thankful for, leads to my final point: We have to follow Madiba\u2019s example of persistence and of hope.It is tempting to give in to cynicism: to believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back; that the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the \u201990s, now you are hearing people talk about end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strongman. We have to resist that cynicism.Because, we\u2019ve been through darker times, we\u2019ve been in lower valleys and deeper valleys. Yes, by the end of his life, Madiba embodied the successful struggle for human rights, but the journey was not easy, it wasn\u2019t preordained. The man went to prison for almost three decades. He split limestone in the heat, he slept in a small cell, and was repeatedly put in solitary confinement.And I remember talking to some of his former colleagues saying how they hadn\u2019t realized when they were released, just the sight of a child, the idea of holding a child, they had missed \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something available to them, for decades.And yet his power actually grew during those years \u2014 and the power of his jailers diminished, because he knew that if you stick to what\u2019s true, if you know what\u2019s in your heart, and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for it, even in the face of overwhelming odds, that it might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen in the next week, it might not even happen in your lifetime. Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might, not the other way around, ultimately, the better story can win out and as strong as Madiba\u2019s spirit may have been, he would not have sustained that hope had he been alone in the struggle, part of buoyed him up was that he knew that each year, the ranks of freedom fighters were replenishing, young men and women, here in South African, in the ANC and beyond; black and Indian and white, from across the countryside, across the continent, around the world, who in those most difficult days would keep working on behalf of his vision.And that\u2019s what we need right now, we don\u2019t just need one leader, we don\u2019t just need one inspiration, what we badly need right now is that collective spirit. And, I know that those young people, those hope carriers are gathering around the world. Because history shows that whenever progress is threatened, and the things we care about most are in question, we should heed the words of Robert Kennedy \u2014 spoken here in South Africa, he said, \u201cOur answer is the world\u2019s hope: it is to rely on youth. It\u2019s to rely on the spirit of the young.\u201dSo, young people, who are in the audience, who are listening, my message to you is simple: Keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world. Mandela said, \u201cYoung people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom.\u201d Now is a good time to be aroused. Now is a good time to be fired up.And, for those of us who care about the legacy that we honor here today \u2014 about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body \u2014 we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madiba\u2019s values, who are poised to lead the way.People like Abaas Mpindi, a journalist from Uganda, who founded the Media Challenge Initiative, to help other young people get the training they need to tell the stories that the world needs to know.People like Caren Wakoli, an entrepreneur from Kenya, who founded the Emerging Leaders Foundation to get young people involved in the work of fighting poverty and promoting human dignity.People like Enock Nkulanga, who directs the African Children\u2019s mission, which helps children in Uganda and Kenya get the education that they need and then in his spare time, Enock advocates for the rights of children around the globe, and founded an organization called LeadMinds Africa, which does exactly what it says.You meet these people, you talk to them, they will give you hope. They are taking the baton, they know they can\u2019t just rest on the accomplishments of the past, even the accomplishments of those as momentous as Nelson Mandela\u2019s. They stand on the shoulders of those who came before, including that young black boy born 100 years ago, but they know that it is now their turn to do the work.Madiba reminds us that: \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.\u201d Love comes more naturally to the human heart, let\u2019s remember that truth. Let\u2019s see it as our North Star, let\u2019s be joyful in our struggle to make that truth manifest here on earth so that in 100 years from now, future generations will look back and say, \u201cThey kept the march going, that\u2019s why we live under new banners of freedom.\u201d Thank you very much, South Africa, thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Mulls a Unilateral Tax Cut for the Rich", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress to grant a $100 billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy, a legally tenuous maneuver that would cut capital gains taxation and fulfill a long-held ambition of many investors and conservatives.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month that his department was studying whether it could use its regulatory powers to allow Americans to account for inflation in determining capital gains tax liabilities. The Treasury Department could change the definition of \u201ccost\u201d for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells.\u201cIf it can\u2019t get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we\u2019ll consider that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, emphasizing that he had not concluded whether the Treasury Department had the authority to act alone. \u201cWe are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth.\u201dCurrently, capital gains taxes are determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference, usually at 20 percent. If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable \u201cgain\u201d to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000.The move would face a near-certain court challenge. It could also reinforce a liberal critique of Republican tax policy at a time when Republicans are struggling to sell middle-class voters on the benefits of the tax cuts that President Trump signed into law late last year.\u201cAt a time when the deficit is out of control, wages are flat and the wealthiest are doing better than ever, to give the top 1 percent another advantage is an outrage and shows the Republicans\u2019 true colors,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cFurthermore, Mr. Mnuchin thinks he can do it on his own, but everyone knows this must be done by legislation.\u201dConservative advocates for the plan say that even if it is challenged in court, it could still goose the economy by unleashing a wave of asset sales. \u201cNo matter what the courts do, you\u2019ll get the main economic benefit the day, the month after Treasury does this,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, a tax lobbyist in Washington and former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform.Liberal tax economists see little benefit in it beyond another boon to the already rich.\u201cIt would just be a very generous addition to the tax cuts they\u2019ve already handed to the very wealthy,\u201d said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of tax policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, \u201cand it would play into the hands of their tax advisers, who would be well positioned to take advantage of the loopholes that were opened by it.\u201dThe decades-long push to change the taxation of investment income has spurred a legal debate over the original meaning of the word \u201ccost\u201d in the Revenue Act of 1918, and over the authority of the Treasury Department to interpret the word in regulations.\u201cI think we ought to look at not penalizing Americans for inflation,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who said he would like to see the Treasury Department make the change through regulation.Mr. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department determined that redefining \u201ccost\u201d by regulatory fiat would be illegal \u2014 a conclusion buttressed by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which found that \u201ccost\u201d means the price that was paid for something.But conservatives have disputed this conclusion. Pushing Mr. Trump to make the change, Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has cited a 2002 Supreme Court decision in a case between Verizon Communications and the Federal Communications Commission that said regulators have leeway in defining \u201ccost\u201d to make the case that the Treasury Department can act alone.\u201cThis would be in terms of its economic impact over the next several years, and long term, similar in size as the last tax cut,\u201d Mr. Norquist said, suggesting that making the change would raise revenue for the government by creating new economic efficiencies and faster growth. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s going to be huge.\u201d\u201cIt is unlikely, however, that a significant, or any, effect on economic growth would occur from a stand-alone indexing proposal,\u201d the report said.Michael Graetz, a tax law professor at Columbia University who worked in the Treasury Department\u2019s tax policy office when the department determined that taxing capital gains could not be changed by regulation, said he still thought that the decision to change the law should fall to Congress.He pointed out that the department would have to make decisions about what types of assets would be indexed and that it would essentially be picking winners and losers.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no legal authority for Treasury to choose what assets to treat this way,\u201d Mr. Graetz said.A framework for a second round of tax cuts, released by the Ways and Means Committee last week, did not address taxation of capital gains. It is highly unlikely that Congress will pass another tax bill this year because of the slim Republican majority in the Senate.Democratic senators have written to Mr. Mnuchin, urging him to stand down.\u201cTreasury does not have the unilateral authority to take our tax code and expose it to widespread gamesmanship,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIndexing capital gains under this regime is a boondoggle for the rich, plain and simple.\u201dA Treasury Department official wrote Mr. Wyden a two-paragraph reply this month. \u201cWe appreciate your taking the time to express the thoughts outlined in the letter,\u201d it read. \u201cWe will take them under advisement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Europe Could Melt Down Over a Simple Question of Borders", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterLONDON \u2014 The European Union has always been sold, to its citizens, on a practical basis: Cheaper products. Easier travel. Prosperity and security.But its founding leaders had something larger in mind. They conceived it as a radical experiment to transcend the nation-state, whose core ideas of race-based identity and zero-sum competition had brought disaster twice in the space of a generation.France\u2019s foreign minister, announcing the bloc\u2019s precursor in 1949, called it \u201ca great experiment\u201d that would put \u201can end to war\u201d and guarantee \u201can eternal peace.\u201dBut instead of overcoming that barrier, European leaders pretended it didn\u2019t exist. More damning, they entirely avoided mentioning what Europeans would need to give up: a degree of their deeply felt national identities and hard-won national sovereignty.Now, as Europeans struggle with the social and political strains set off by migration from poor and war-torn nations outside the bloc, some are clamoring to preserve what they feel they never consented to surrender. Their fight with European leaders is exploding over an issue that, perhaps more than any other, exposes the contradiction between the dream of the European Union and the reality of European nations: borders.Establishment European leaders insist on open borders within the bloc. Free movement is meant to transcend cultural barriers, integrate economies and lubricate the single market. But a growing number of European voters want to sharply limit the arrival of refugees in their countries, which would require closing the borders.This might seem like a straightforward matter of reconciling internal rules with public demand on the relatively narrow issue of refugees, who are no longer even arriving in great numbers.But there is a reason that it has brought Europe to the brink, with its most important leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, warning of disaster and at risk of losing power. The borders question is really a question of whether Europe can move past traditional notions of the nation-state. And that is a question that Europeans have avoided confronting, much less answering, for over half a century.In 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, Ms. Merkel warned that if European countries did not \u201cfairly\u201d share the burden, then opportunistic leaders could exploit the issue to dismantle Europe\u2019s freedom of internal movement. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the Europe we want,\u201d she said.Most refugees arrive in Italy, Greece or Spain and are meant to remain there while waiting for asylum. In practice, though, many head north.But how to pick out refugees from dozens of open roads and rail lines that connect Germany with Austria?One option is to screen selectively for possible refugees; in essence, racial profiling. No one is sure how this would work. Spotters on border watchtowers with binoculars? Random pullovers? Any scheme seems likely to miss most refugees while harassing enough dark-skinned non-refugees to guarantee a backlash.The other option is to set up checkpoints and screen everyone, making travel from Austria to Germany far more difficult, likely hurting both economies. In either scheme, Ms. Merkel\u2019s plan calls for camps along the border to hold refugees seeking to cross.As Ms. Merkel warned three years ago, this could break the European Union as we know it. It would tacitly encourage other countries to harden their own borders, if only to protect from becoming holding pens for stricter nations like Germany.Should enough borders harden, refugees could end up stuck in Italy, Greece and Spain \u2014 an outcome Ms. Merkel has also warned could doom the bloc by encouraging those countries to leave.Shutting down internal movement would withdraw some of the union\u2019s most popular perks \u2014 ease of travel for work, vacation or family \u2014 and undercut trade and labor transfers, weakening the single market economy.It might seem strange, then, that such a policy could be seen as indulging public demand. The fact that its ramifications would go so far beyond refugees, whose arrivals are anyway down sharply, suggests that public demand is about more than anti-refugee sentiment.Perhaps the drive to restore European borders is, on some level, about borders themselves. Maybe when populists talk about restoring sovereignty and national identity, it\u2019s not just a euphemism for anti-refugee sentiment (although such sentiment is indeed rife). Maybe they mean it.Populist supporters would often bring up refugees as a focal point and physical manifestation of larger, more abstract fears. They would often say, as one woman told me outside a rally for the Alternative for Germany, a rising populist party, that they feared their national identity was being erased.\u201cGermany needs a positive relationship with our identity,\u201d Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a leading far-right figure in the party, told my colleague. \u201cThe foundation of our unity is identity.\u201dAllowing in refugees, even in very large numbers, does not mean Germany will no longer be Germany, of course. But this slight cultural change is one component of a larger European project that has required giving up, even if only by degrees, core conceits of a fully sovereign nation-state.National policy is suborned, on some issues, to the vetoes and powers of the larger union. That includes control over borders, which are partially open to refugees but fully open to other Europeans.Though the backlash has focused on refugees, who tend to present as more obviously foreign, studies suggest that it is also driven by resentment toward European migrants.Traveling recently through Yorkshire, a postindustrial swath of northern England, I heard complaints that began about refugees but shifted quickly to Polish workers, who have arrived in much greater numbers. Some spoke ominously, if implausibly, of towns where Polish was more commonly heard than English.It is not easy for Europeans to abandon the old-style national identity, rooted in race and language, that has caused them such trouble. The human desire for a strong group identity \u2014 and for perceived homogeneity within that group \u2014 runs deep.Germany for the Germans, Catalonia for the Catalans. A country of people who look like me, speak my language and share my heritage. These nationalist impulses, however dangerous, emerge from basic human instinct. It makes us feel safe; losing it makes us feel threatened. It is reinforced in our popular culture and built into the international order.European leaders hoped they could rein in those impulses long enough to transform Europe from the top down, but the financial crisis of 2008 came when their project was only half completed. That led to the crisis in the euro, which revealed political fault lines the leadership had long denied or wished away.The financial crisis and an accompanying outburst in Islamic terrorism also provided a threat. When people feel under threat, research shows, they seek a strong identity that will make them feel part of a powerful group.European leaders, unable to square their project\u2019s ambition of transcending nationalism with this reality of rising nationalism, have tried to have it both ways. Ms. Merkel has sought to save Europe\u2019s border-free zone by imposing one hard border.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, has called for ever-harder \u201cexternal\u201d borders, which refers to those separating the European Union from the outside world, in order to keep internal borders open.This might work if refugee arrivals were the root issue. But it would not resolve the contradiction between the European Union as an experiment in overcoming nationalism versus the politics of the moment, in which publics are demanding more nationalism.That resurgence starts with borders. But Hungary\u2019s trajectory suggests it might not end there. The country\u2019s nationalist government, after erecting fences and setting up refugee camps, has seen hardening xenophobia and rising support for tilting toward authoritarianism.As the euro crisis showed, even pro-union leaders could never bring themselves to fully abandon the old nationalism. They are elected by their fellow nationals, after all, so naturally put them first. Their first loyalty is to their country. When that comes into conflict with the rest of the union, as it has on the issue of refugees, it\u2019s little wonder that national self-interest wins.Amanda Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They line up daily, newly released from detention, having had no time even to put the laces back on their shoes. They hold government-issued bags with their few belongings close, and their children even closer.July 18, 1:06 p.m.\u201cI feel safer here than I did in Honduras.\u201d\u201cWe can work, we can go to school.

Yet unlike that historic gateway on New York Harbor, all of the immigrants passing through the McAllen bus terminal \u2014 young or old, healthy or sick \u2014 have effectively been jailed by the authorities when they first arrived in the United States.Today, most of the immigrants arriving at the border have fled their homes in Central America and traveled through Mexico. While some enter the United States in California or Arizona, a majority cross the Rio Grande in Texas, and then either turn themselves in or are caught by Border Patrol agents. They are detained in federal facilities in McAllen and other South Texas cities and then released.Government-contracted buses drop many of them off at Central Station downtown. They stand in line outside, get their bus tickets inside and then walk to a nearby immigrant-services center run by Catholic Charities. They return later to board buses to cities across the country, where most will join relatives already living in the United States.The national spotlight has been shining on the hundreds of migrant children who were separated from their relatives as part of the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance immigration policy. But thousands of other men, women and children continue to steadily and quietly arrive at America\u2019s border.They continue to come, regardless of politics or policies, or who occupies the White House. They do it, they say, because they want to escape violence, poverty or gangs in their native countries. Most these days are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, some of the most impoverished and chaotic places in the world.\u201cIn our country, the state of the economy makes it very difficult to live,\u201d said one 36-year-old mother of four, who traveled with her children from Olancho, Honduras, for 33 days and nearly 2,000 miles. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen other cases of people finding success here, so we\u2019re trying as well.

Four buses dropped them off in groups of roughly 30 from the late morning through the early afternoon. They stood behind a row of tattered traffic cones outside the Central Station\u2019s side entrance.Some gripped blue boxes that the authorities had handed them upon their release \u2014 inside were  chargers for the GPS monitors they would now have to wear on their ankles. Some did not walk so much as shuffle, because their shoes were missing laces. While in detention, their shoelaces, considered potential weapons, were confiscated and then returned upon their release.Most of the migrants had been held in custody only a few days, largely because they had no criminal history. The ankle monitors are intended to track their whereabouts and discourage them from escaping as their cases proceed through the immigration court system. Some have petitioned for asylum, fearing persecution in their native countries.Rosa Marisol Vielman Marroquin, 31, stepped off the first bus from the detention center with her 11-year-old daughter at 10:50 a.m., the sleek black device on her right ankle locked above her unlaced hiking boots.She and her daughter had left Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala, 15 days earlier. They were headed to New Jersey, to join her boyfriend there. \u201cI left Guatemala because of the economic situation there, and for fear of the crime,\u201d Ms. Vielman said. \u201cI thought that the U.S. was a beautiful place.\u201dJuly 18, 1:42 p.m.\u201cI want to work.\u201d\u201cIn Nicaragua, the government made us fear for our lives.\u201d\u201cThe journey to get here was difficult. We didn't want to do it. But we had to.\u201d\u201cIn Nicaragua, the government made us fear for our lives.\u201d\u201cThe journey to get here was difficult. We didn't want to do it. But we had to.\u201dJuana Susana Orozco Gomez, 21, stood outside the swinging glass doors of the bus terminal, holding her 3-year-old daughter in her arms. She spoke in a near-whisper as she described their journey from Guatemala, a trek that would be extraordinary were it not so common among those in the line. \u201cWe walked over a mountain to cross the border,\u201d Ms. Orozco said.She and the others assembled outside the bus station: alert, nervous, quiet or quietly talking. It was hard to imagine that some had risked their lives to stand there, paying thousands of dollars to the smugglers known as coyotes to guide them, or braving the journey on their own.Hundreds of bodies have been found in recent years in the desolate South Texas brush north of the bus station \u2014 migrants like themselves whose journey had ended in dehydration, heat stroke or hypothermia.On the fourth and last bus of the day was a 36-year-old woman and her 10-year-old daughter. They had left their native Nicaragua two months prior. \u201cI thought something was going to happen to me on the journey here, but thank God, nothing did,\u201d said the woman.A few standing in line with her spoke of hunger, and of overcoming difficulties they declined to detail. Inside Central Station, his travel to New Jersey finally arranged after talking to the clerks behind the counters, one man who had left Honduras on the Fourth of July stared at the lobby floor, choking back tears when asked about the family he left behind. His 12-year-son stood silently next to him.The man, Santiago Antonio Rodriguez Hernandez, couldn\u2019t get the words out to explain his emotion. In his hands he clutched, as if they were precious, two items that had been given to him and other migrants on their way to the terminal. They were the first gifts they had received in America: red apples.July 18, 11:30 a.m.\u201cWe left Guatemala to provide a better future for our kids.\u201d\u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened and all that we\u2019ve experienced \u2014 hunger, cold, sleeping here \u2014 I\u2019m feeling happy.\u201d\u201cWe left Guatemala to provide a better future for our kids.\u201d\u201cAfter everything that\u2019s happened and all that we\u2019ve experienced \u2014 hunger, cold, sleeping here \u2014 I\u2019m feeling happy.\u201dThey arrived overdressed for Texas in July. Some wore sweatshirts or jackets, or had them draped over their arms or tied around their waists. Many had just been released from a place migrants have named La Hielera \u2014 The Cooler, or The Icebox.That\u2019s what they call the Border Patrol\u2019s processing center on Ursula Avenue in McAllen, known for its frigid temperatures. Detainees keep warm with blankets that resemble giant sheets of aluminium foil.Ms. Vielman, the woman from Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala, was detained there for five days with her 11-year-old daughter, Yerlin. She spoke of the cold, and of being in a separate holding area from her daughter \u2014 she could see Yerlin, but only from far away.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t talk to each other except for an hour each day,\u201d Ms. Vielman said. \u201cIt was hard, but I told my daughter to be strong and to not cry, and that we were going to be O.K.\u201dAs she spoke, volunteers hovered nearby. All of the immigrants released at the bus station are assisted by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, which runs an immigrant respite center blocks away. Their volunteers help the migrants get their bus tickets and escort them to the respite center, where they can eat, rest, call relatives and put on new clothes, all without charge.Without the assistance of Catholic Charities, and the ad-hoc, orderly system they established, the scene in the bus station would be confused and chaotic.The roughly 125 migrants dropped off at the bus terminal that day were a typical number. Since 2014, the respite center has assisted nearly 100,000 migrants released at the downtown bus station.Last week, the migrants spoke as much about the future as the past. They were headed across the country to new cities, and all had hearings and appointments scheduled with immigration officials in those cities. Their immigration status, at that moment, was uncertain. But they were eager for whatever was coming next.\u201cI want to work in Miami,\u201d said Gerardo Mendoza, 27, from Honduras.\u201cI want to play soccer at school,\u201d said Anthony, 16, from Guatemala.\u201cThis is so beautiful,\u201d said Nelson, 35, from Honduras. \u201cIs all of the United States like this?\u201dAdvertisement"}

They also warn that policies designed to aid one group will eat into someone else\u2019s business in ways that policymakers should have anticipated.\u201cI would like to tell the president, \u2018Man, you are messing up our market,\u2019\u201d said Kevin Scott, a soybean farmer in South Dakota and the secretary of the American Soybean Association. The idea of changing Nafta, he said, \u201cgives us a lot of heartburn in farm country.\u201dRichard Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington, described the administration\u2019s overall approach as \u201cwhac-a-mole policy\u201d that suggests a lack of appreciation of the complexity of global commerce. \u201cThe law of unintended consequences abounds,\u201d Mr. Newell added. If nothing else, experts say, the unpredictability of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals \u2014 the lack of clarity on when or how Nafta might be renegotiated; the risk of potential litigation over his rollback of auto-pollution rules; the ways in which other countries might retaliate against Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 seeds confusion across the American economy, making it tough for businesses to plan effectively for the future. \u201cThat just wreaks havoc with American farmers and businesses with the investments they have to make,\u201d said Matthew Slaughter, a professor of international business at Dartmouth College. \u201cIt creates massive uncertainty for these industries.\u201dA spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, acknowledged that while some policies might not always be to the liking of specific industries, \u201cA lot of these groups benefit from broader policies \u2014 all these groups benefit from the tax cut and regulatory relief.\u201d\u201cThe only constituency the president is looking out for is the American people,\u201d Mr. Shah said.The president has repeatedly promised to protect metal producers, iconic Rust Belt industries that the administration says are hurt by low-priced imports from countries like China. But not all metal producers agree with the administration\u2019s strategy.\u201cWe are disappointed by the broad tariffs on aluminum imports into the United States,\u201d said Marco Palmieri, president of Novelis North America, an aluminum maker. \u201cThis action does not provide relief from our industry\u2019s most significant trade issue, which is subsidized Chinese aluminum overcapacity. Instead, the tariffs bring the unfortunate potential to increase cost for the consumer.\u201d If California enforces the stricter pollution rules, that would in effect create two separate auto markets. Several other states have pledged to follow California\u2019s lead.\u201cIt\u2019s quite disruptive to the companies bringing a car to market, and it\u2019s disruptive to all of the suppliers of the car companies,\u201d said Doug Richman, a technical expert with the Aluminum Association. Mr. Trump has sought to follow through on campaign promises to help the coal industry, but those efforts are angering oil and natural gas producers. Mr. Trump has ordered Energy Secretary Rick Perry to \u201cprepare immediate steps\u201d to stop the closing of unprofitable coal and nuclear power plants nationwide. One proposal would order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants for two years, using emergency authority that is normally reserved for crises like natural disasters.Such a move would cut deeply into the market share for natural gas producers, many of which are also among the nation\u2019s largest oil companies \u2014 a group Mr. Trump has also sought to support. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cseems counter to what he campaigned on,\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and the owner of Canary LLC, a Phoenix oil field services company. \u201cHe campaigned on unleashing America\u2019s energy, but this tortured coal policy penalizes natural gas.\u201dIn coming weeks, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department are expected to jointly propose a new rule to dramatically roll back the Obama-era standard on tailpipe emissions. And Detroit is watching closely.The Obama rule would have required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, S.U.V.s and light trucks by 2025, achieving an average of more than 50 miles per gallon. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, automakers have complained to him that the Obama standard was too stringent.But the administration\u2019s current proposal would go so far in the opposite direction that, rather than simply loosening the Obama standard, it would likely set off years of litigation, creating regulatory uncertainty for automakers, say people familiar with the draft plan. The proposal, according to people who have seen it, would both cut back the Obama standard to 35 or 40 miles per gallon, and would pre-empt states from setting their own standards. That amounts to a direct challenge to California, which has a waiver under the Clean Air Act to impose its own, stricter, air pollution regulations on cars and trucks. California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, has made clear that he will fight in court. \u201cWe are supporting some level of increased fuel economy year over year,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents many of the world\u2019s largest automakers. \u201cOur customers don\u2019t want to pay the unnecessary costs of separate regulatory proposals.\u201dRegarding the Trump idea to place tariffs on auto imports, she said: \u201cWhile we understand that the administration is working to achieve a level playing field, tariffs are not the right approach.\u201d They raise prices for car buyers, she said, \u201cand invite retaliatory action by our trading partners.\u201d\u201cThe auto industry has always wanted one, rather than two or more standards across the country,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard. \u201cThis is very troubling to the auto industry.\u201d Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies and advisers maintain that his moves will benefit the economy overall, even if they hurt some of the industries he said he wanted to help. \u201cOn net, President Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back regulations and create a better regulatory climate for all is better for these industries,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump campaign and president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization that promotes fossil fuel use.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Headwinds, de Blasio\u2019s Housing Plan Moves Forward as Costs Rise", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday that New York City had financed the creation or preservation of more than 32,000 units of subsidized rental housing during the previous year, an annual total that outstripped those seen under Mayor Ed Koch when a crisis of decay and disinvestment prompted historic city action.The milestone is the result of significant and increasing investment by Mr. de Blasio \u2014 more than $1.6 billion in direct city subsidy over the last fiscal year \u2014 aimed at stemming a different sort of crisis: rising rents and New Yorkers struggling to afford them.It comes in the face of headwinds from Washington, in the form of a less favorable market for tax credits for affordable housing projects nationwide, and in New York City, where the cost of construction has been growing.That is largely because the cost to the city for new construction jumped considerably since last year, to as much as $200,000 per unit from as much as $165,000 per unit in the previous fiscal year, said Molly Park, the deputy commissioner for development at the city\u2019s Housing Preservation and Development Department.The city also revamped its housing plan last year to increase the subsidies for apartments aimed at lower-income New Yorkers, adding to the cost. The plan also grew by 50 percent: The mayor is now pledging to preserve or construct 300,000 units by 2026. At $83 billion, the total price tag for the mayor\u2019s plan is more than double where it was when Mr. de Blasio introduced it four years ago.\u201cWe are paying more, in a very large part, to get more,\u201d said Ms. Park.City officials attributed the surge to a number of factors, including a focus on preserving the affordability of units that were part of the city\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program and in some large developments in Manhattan. In all, the city financed the preservation of 23,000 units over the last fiscal year, and the new construction of another 9,000.But the most significant portion \u2014 nearly 6,000 \u2014 came from maintaining affordable housing in Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn development that President Trump had partially owned. The development was sold in May.The city did not directly spend any money, but it is foregoing the collection of about $460 million in property taxes through 2054, officials said.For Mr. de Blasio, the announcement of new housing numbers has become an annual ritual. He stood on a terrace of a newly built building in Harlem last July. On Thursday, he toured a ninth-floor apartment in a new building in the Bronx, guided by a garrulous 6-year-old named Destin and his mother.\u201cI remind everyone that if we don\u2019t get this right,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, standing at a lectern along Walton Avenue in the summer sun, \u201cit will not be the same New York City anymore.\u201dHe said a number of factors explained the results over the past year and that they could vary in the future.\u201cThere\u2019s the economy, which right now is strong; different economy might yield different results,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut I think one of the reasons we are seeing these new numbers is that a bunch of seeds that got planted finally bore fruit.\u201dFor most casual observers, the newly constructed units are often not evident \u2014 a mix of subsidized units with market-rate housing that is a feature of the mayor\u2019s housing plan. As a result, numbers that might indicate a small town rising in the midst of the city instead melt into the backdrop of New York\u2019s still-hot real estate market.Asked whether his housing plan could alter the city\u2019s housing market and bring down rents, Mr. de Blasio demurred, saying its most direct effect has been to boost the chances of a resident\u2019s success in the city-run affordable housing lotteries.\u201cIt\u2019s better chances of winning the lottery and just using sheer volume,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He has degrees from some of the world\u2019s best universities, including the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India\u2019s capital, and Harvard Business School.But the area he represents, centered in the bushy town of Hazaribagh (which means \u201ca thousand gardens\u201d), is poor, troubled and socially conservative. Lying more than 500 miles east of New Delhi in the state of Jharkhand, it is home to coal mines, Maoist rebels and land-grabbing gangs.Like so much of India today, Hazaribagh is more polarized between majority Hindus and minority Muslims than it has been in a long time. Many people here support Hindu vigilante groups, especially the so-called cow protectors who hunt down those who break Hinduism\u2019s taboo against killing cows.It was one such vigilante group that swarmed Alimuddin Ansari, a Muslim trader, in Mr. Sinha\u2019s constituency last year. A rumor spread that Mr. Ansari was transporting beef, and a mob dragged him out of his van and beat him. Police officers eventually pulled him away, but he died a few hours later from internal injuries, officials said.His family is now broke.\u201cMy life is doomed,\u201d said Mariam Khatoon, his widow. She sat in a plastic chair in a ramshackle house, the concrete foundation cracking beneath her feet.But a higher court recently granted an appeal, saying the evidence was flimsy. Upon their release on bail, eight of the men went to visit Mr. Sinha at his house, where he was waiting with wreaths of marigolds.There is still doubt about the circumstances of Mr. Ansari\u2019s death. A lawyer representing some of the convicted men said that, yes, the mob had roughed up Mr. Ansari but that it was actually police officers who beat him to death, in custody. The lawyer pointed to photos that have been circulating on social media that show Mr. Ansari looking alert and apparently not badly injured as officers led him away from the mob. The trial court had heard many of these arguments and rejected them.Mr. Sinha said he was helping the convicts because there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that they killed Mr. Ansari. He has actively supported their legal defense, paying several hundred dollars to one of the defense lawyers and connecting this lawyer to an experienced attorney friend to craft a persuasive appeal.He celebrated their release from jail with sweets and flowers, he said, to show how happy he was that they \u201cgot a fresh lease on life.\u201dBut Mr. Sinha concedes that he never made a condolence call to Mr. Ansari\u2019s widow, who is also his constituent. He said it was too dangerous to visit her, an excuse that raises questions. Her scruffy little house sits on a quiet lane. And with his ministerial security detail, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone in that neighborhood bothering Mr. Sinha.National elections are scheduled for next year, and Mr. Sinha might have been feeling vulnerable. He has hewed to the political right since his time in the United States, but in today\u2019s India, his right may not be right enough.Neither he nor his father came up through the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu ideological group that molded Mr. Modi and other top members of his party. Recently, Mr. Sinha had been taking heat from a former lawmaker in his constituency who said he was not doing enough to help the convicted killers.\u201cThere was a lot of resentment toward Jayant,\u2019\u2019 said Abhijit Sen, a senior journalist in Hazaribagh. \u201cThose others forced him to act.\u201dMr. Sinha insisted that he had tried to stay out of the case because it was so divisive. But after he studied the files, he said, he became convinced that there was much more to it than initially reported. He regrets the garlands but not helping the convicts.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s simply a matter of justice,\u201d he said.But the criticism keeps coming.And a recent letter to the newspaper The Indian Express was headlined: \u201cDespicable Act.\u201dThis headline and article have been edited to reflect fairness concerns toward the story\u2019s subject, Jayant Sinha, a politician in India who has been criticized for garlanding a group of men convicted of attacking and killing a Muslim man. An earlier version of the headline was not intended to suggest that he was personally motivated by religious hatred, and the article has been changed to remove any implication that Mr. Sinha\u2019s public wearing of traditional dress and showering supporters with flower petals was a sign of Hindu nationalist intent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Takeaways From a Long-Term G.D.P. Revision", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA batch of new measurements of economic growth reveals changes in the nation\u2019s savings rate, tweaks to cure the winter blues and how the sweet deal you got on that iPhone was better than you thought.The federal government acknowledged on Friday that your last few cellphones were more valuable than it thought.That disclosure came tucked in a package of revisions the government made to the economic growth statistics it published from 2012 to 2017.From time to time, data wizards at the Commerce Department take a new look at their past estimates of how large the economy was in a given quarter, and how fast it was growing, and re-evaluate those estimates using new information that has come to light. This year, that new information includes a better way to measure the quality of cellphones, which, you may have noticed, usually improve with each new iteration. The statisticians concluded America\u2019s imported cellphones were improving more rapidly than previously calculated \u2014 that consumers had actually gotten more for their money than we thought. That change had a ripple effect, all the way up to annual economic growth figures, which emerged from the revisions ever so slightly changed from previous estimates. Here are four takeaways from the total package of revisions:Revisions added $82.7 billion to the size of the United States economy at the end of 2016, which means it grew a tenth of a percentage point faster in President Barack Obama\u2019s second term than previously thought. Growth in President Trump\u2019s first year in office, 2017, was actually smaller by the same amount. That\u2019s not an economic earthquake, but the headline change does mask some bigger swings in individual components of gross domestic product. For example, companies appear to have invested $110 billion more in 2012 than previously thought, largely because the statisticians more or less missed some huge corporate spending on cloud computing technology. The revisions employed improved measures of I.T. investments, and voil\u00e0. Well, surprise! It was a mistake, apparently. The bureau made use of a new Internal Revenue Service analysis and concluded that the government had been overestimating the amount of national income held by corporations and underestimating how much of it was held by proprietors of businesses. That meant people \u2014 as opposed to corporations \u2014 had been sitting on more money than the government previously thought. And that meant the savings rate was higher. Americans buy a lot of phones that are made in other countries. And those phones keep getting better \u2014 a phone you can buy for $100 today is capable of much more (for good or ill) than the phone you bought for the same price in 2013. That means it\u2019s more valuable.Using a new tool from the Fed, the government is now better able to estimate the value of that improvement \u2014 and see how much it underestimated it in the past.Increasing the trade deficit detracts from the gross domestic product, so we\u2019re left with an interesting math exercise from all these revisions. For 2015, for example, a positive revision to the G.D.P. from larger-than-previously-measured levels of investment and personal spending was partially canceled out by the increase in the trade deficit from the phone you bought.In other words, you got a better deal than you knew on that phone. Which kind of hurt the economy. At least, so far as we can tell right now. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Latest Hot E-Commerce Idea in China: The Bargain Bin", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Apple, Gucci, Tesla. Many Chinese shoppers love their top-shelf brands.But another big slice of the population goes gaga for a 40-cent pair of earrings, a $1.50 wireless smartphone charger and 50 rolls of toilet paper for $4.75.These are the shoppers on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app that drew close to 350 million customers in the past year, more than the entire population of the United States. Its parent company is expected to list shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, just three years into its existence.They live outside the country\u2019s prosperous megacities, in the cities, towns and hamlets that over a billion Chinese call home. They skew older, less internet savvy. And they absolutely cannot resist a bargain, even if the stuff they\u2019re buying isn\u2019t exactly top of the line.In the southern city of Foshan, Li Tianqiang and his wife sell rice noodles and other breakfast food out of a three-wheeled truck to hungry factory workers. Over the past two years, Mr. Li, 45, has bought nearly $1,000 worth of merchandise on Pinduoduo \u2014 the equivalent of around two months\u2019 income for him. Among his purchases: an inflatable paddle boat, a fishing bag and a cherry-red motorized car for his young daughter to drive around.Mr. Li knows he is a little addicted. And regretted purchases? He has a few.Some were made out of curiosity. In other cases, the items were of such lousy quality that he threw them out after they arrived. The toys he has bought for his daughter \u2014 including dolls, a violin and a keyboard \u2014 have been particularly bad, he said.It is all so inexpensive, though, that he said he didn\u2019t mind the occasional misfire.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really,\u201d he said of his spending on the app.For many years, China was a byword for shoddy goods produced at mass scale. But that is changing. Wages are rising, forcing manufacturers to compete on quality. Communist Party leaders want to nurture brands known globally for their innovations. Gadget makers such as Xiaomi and Huawei are investing heavily in design, chasing cool and cachet.To shop on Pinduoduo, however, is to be reminded that many Chinese consumers still check prices first, and that low-end suppliers remain a big part of the country\u2019s economy. The Pinduoduo app\u2019s main page is a bottomless cascade of groceries, fast fashion, household sundries and electronic bric-a-brac \u2014 all carrying wildly improbable price tags.A pair of stretchy, \u201cPlayboy\u201d-brand men\u2019s pants: less than $3. Eleven pounds of rice: $4. A four-pack of boxer briefs printed with an image of a wolf\u2019s head: $2. A purple water kettle with \u201cLOL\u201d written along the bottom: $3. A pink, around-the-neck smartphone stand that lets you lie down and watch videos at the same time: $1. A vibrating electric belt that goes around the midsection and supposedly helps shed fat: $6.Shipping is always free.Pinduoduo wants shoppers to involve their online friends in the process. Group orders receive discounts. New users who persuade others to sign up are rewarded with one of a selection of free purchases. Tiny pop-ups within the app provide relentless, real-time updates on what others are buying, creating a sense of urgency. Everyone is getting great deals and you are not.Between the deliriously strange product selection, the next-to-nothing prices, the barrage of coupons and deals, and the ease with which purchases are made, the experience feels less like shopping and more like playing a shopping video game. In regulatory filings, the company calls the app \u201ca combination of Costco and Disneyland.\u201dPinduoduo started operations only in 2015. The app is a platform for merchants to sell products: Sellers pay for their wares to be promoted on the app, and pay a fee for each sale. The company, which is based in Shanghai, has grown swiftly enough to attract powerful backers including the venture firm Sequoia Capital and the Chinese internet giant Tencent. It expects to raise $1.4 billion in this week\u2019s share offering. That would give the company a valuation of more than $20 billion.Because it offers so much cheap stuff, however, Pinduoduo is still way behind its rivals in the total value of goods sold. The company, which is unprofitable, said that its average shopper spent less than $90 on the platform last year. That translates into revenue per shopper of a dollar and change.\u201cThis is the lowest quality of traffic you can get,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. And if older people are driving Pinduoduo\u2019s popularity, Mr. Zhu added, then its prospects for long-term growth are grim by default.His own mother complained to him when two of the nine mangoes she had bought for $1.50 on the app turned up rotten, Mr. Huang told Caijing. Still, he said, she continued to use Pinduoduo. \u201cIf you can buy seven good mangoes for $1.50, you\u2019re not losing out,\u201d he said.For the most part, Kang Xia agrees. Ms. Kang, a 52-year-old retiree in the southwestern city of Chengdu, has used Pinduoduo to buy shoes, clothes, gadgets \u2014 \u201cquite a lot,\u201d she said, although the quality isn\u2019t always great.This spring, she got stung by two bad purchases. First, there was a $5 wardrobe with colorful fabric panels and a \u201creal wood\u201d frame. One touch was all she needed to realize the thing was no good. Then she bought a chiffon skirt with a floral pattern \u2014 less than $6, including a yellow T-shirt to wear with it \u2014 that arrived with a jagged tear down the side.Ms. Kang said she is now less likely to buy things on Pinduoduo solely because they are cheap. But she still looks at the app every day.For the established big shots of Chinese e-commerce, it is unwelcome news that many shoppers will buy very nearly anything if the price is right.To retain customers and avoid regulators\u2019 ire, Alibaba, which served more than 500 million buyers last year, has fought sales of fakes on its Taobao marketplace. The retailer JD.com, which had around 300 million buyers, has courted upmarket brands and cultivated a reputation for reliability.\u201cFrom time to time, there are new players, but the question is whether they can sustain themselves,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said at a recent event in San Francisco. \u201cWe are also climbing.\u201dTerry Yao lives in Dandong, a small city in China\u2019s northeast. After looking at some sneakers on Pinduoduo \u2014 pairs that should retail for more than $100 were going for a tiny fraction of that, he said \u2014 he made up his mind about the authenticity of the platform\u2019s products.\u201cChina has developed so much,\u201d said Mr. Yao, 28. \u201cBut if residents of these third- and fourth-tier cities can only use things like Pinduoduo, it feels to some degree like a big failure. We\u2019ve gone backward.\u201dBut Pinduoduo does not have to be stuck in the bargain bin forever, said Tian X. Hou, founder of T. H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. Now that it has used low prices to attract so many users, it can do as Alibaba did and go premium.\u201cOnce you have this trust, you can grow out of the current business and create a new business,\u201d Ms. Hou said.That might turn off the most fervent deal hunters. But it could raise Pinduoduo\u2019s profile among other consumers.Zhang Huajin, 34, a manager at a tech company in Guangzhou, bought an iPhone 7 Plus on Pinduoduo this month. Or he thought he did. What arrived was a smartphone, but it was not made by Apple.Mr. Zhang got his money back, though. And if Pinduoduo improves quality control and helps big brands sell directly on the app, he will probably buy from there again, he said.Taobao managed the transition, he said, and shoppers\u2019 expectations shifted accordingly. On Taobao, Mr. Zhang said, \u201ceverybody already knows what kinds of product should be sold at what price.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Owns the Booming Economy. Republicans on the Trail Barely Mention It.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK, Ohio \u2014 His Republican opponent doesn\u2019t say much publicly about the Trump tax cuts, but on a warm night in a small-town union hall an hour outside Columbus, Danny O\u2019Connor was happy to talk about them \u2014 a lot.\u201cWe just saw, this last December, a $2 trillion swipe of the national credit card, a giveaway to big corporations,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor, the Democrat in a special election on Aug. 7 for an open congressional seat here, told the crowd, drawing nods. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t do anything for us. It doesn\u2019t do anything for working people.\u201dThat seems to go against what Republicans intended. Party leaders in Washington talk frequently about the tax cuts and a \u201cTrump boom\u201d that will doom the \u201cblue wave\u201d this election year \u2014 or at least shrink it to a ripple. News on Friday that the economy grew at a robust 4.1 percent between April and June seemingly supplied more ammunition to a message centered on tax cut-fueled prosperity.But so far, that is not how it is playing out on the campaign trail.With little more than a week to go before voters here head to the polls, the airwaves are instead dominated by more general promises to create jobs and, from Republicans, by dark warnings on wedge issues such as immigration, meant to rally the conservative base. A Republican \u201csuper PAC\u201d is blitzing the Ohio airwaves, contending that electing Mr. O\u2019Connor will mean \u201cmore crimes, more drugs.\u201d\u201cDanny O\u2019Connor would join the resistance,\u201d the Congressional Leadership Fund ad concludes, with the Democrat flanked by three women: Hillary Clinton, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Elizabeth Warren.A Wesleyan Media Project analysis of national advertising data from Kantar Media/CMAG also shows Republicans are rarely bragging to voters about the economy\u2019s strength.Republicans have reason to doubt the efficacy of an economic message in hotly contested midterm campaigns, which have historically been referendums on the sitting president. The last time the economy grew 4 percent in a quarter was in the middle of 2014, under President Barack Obama, just before Senate Democrats lost nine seats \u2014 and their majority \u2014 that fall.For their part, Democrats are weaponizing the tax law \u2014 which is mired in only middling popularity \u2014 against Republican opponents in some key races. Their critiques have been fed by government statistics showing that wages for typical American workers have not risen over the past year, after adjusting for inflation, even though Republicans promised the tax cuts would unleash rapid wage growth.That\u2019s true in Ohio\u2019s 12th District, which stretches from mostly affluent suburbs of Columbus, where residents probably benefited a good deal from the tax cuts, to the foothills of the Appalachians, where they haven\u2019t. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s first ad in this special election opened with a hit on the Republican, Troy Balderson, for supporting \u201ca massive corporate tax break that helps rack up $2 trillion in debt.\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor and his allies have now spent more money attacking the tax cuts than Mr. Balderson and Republican groups have spent extolling them, even though the Democrat is being outspent over all, two to one.The National Republican Congressional Committee has run ads criticizing Mr. O\u2019Connor on taxes and playing up the strength of the economy. But on the Columbus airwaves, those messages have largely given way to more inflammatory issues.Mr. Balderson\u2019s campaign did not respond to repeated requests for an interview on tax policy and his advertising decisions. But other Republicans say the messaging strategy reflects a judgment over how best to motivate their core supporters to vote in the Aug. 7 election to replace Representative Patrick J. Tiberi, a Republican who helped write the House version of the tax bill and who retired this year to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable.The district has been held by Republicans for nearly four decades. Until this year, it was considered solidly red, thanks in part to a redrawing of its boundaries by Republicans in 2012, which pushed thousands of Democratic voters into another district. Mr. Balderson, a state senator, won a crowded primary this spring with Mr. Tiberi\u2019s support.Mr. Tiberi said in an interview that the timing of the special election \u2014 in the depths of summer, as many families vacation and prepare for the start of a new school year \u2014 was forcing Mr. Balderson to focus on issues that can best grab Republican voters\u2019 attention. Regardless of the outcome next month, the two candidates will face off again in November.\u201cThis right now, for the Balderson campaign, is about turning out Republicans \u2014 if Republicans vote, Troy wins,\u201d Mr. Tiberi said. \u201cIn the fall, I think you\u2019ll see more issues, and more economic issues.\u201dMany Republicans said last year, as the tax cuts were speeding through Congress, that the new law would excite their base and help preserve their congressional majorities in the midterms. The law permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from a high of 35 percent. It doubled the standard deduction for individuals and cut individual tax rates, although those provisions expire at the end of 2025. Party leaders predicted that as Americans began to see the law\u2019s benefits, its popularity would rise.Attendees at Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s union hall fund-raiser on Wednesday here in Licking County expressed concern over the tax law, especially on fiscal grounds.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Ann Petrushka, a teacher in Licking County, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can recover from it.\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor said that many of the voters he talks to feel as if they are still not getting ahead, even with low unemployment and accelerating economic growth, and that even affluent voters in his district see the law as unfair.\u201cIncome inequality is high, wage growth is low,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks doing well still want to have an economy that works for the middle class.\u201dAs they turn to November, Democratic candidates across the country are echoing that message. They are working critiques of the tax bill into a broader argument about stagnating real wages and rising health care costs, to portray Republican rule under President Trump as primarily benefiting the wealthy and leaving American workers to pick up the tab.\u201cDemocrats are right to press this,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge, a liberal opposition research group that is helping Democrats in the midterms. \u201cRepublicans ran on populism in 2016, and their policies delivered the opposite.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat running for re-election against Representative James B. Renacci, a Republican, in a state that Mr. Trump won handily, said Republicans \u201cshould be ashamed of their tax bill, and I think they are.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Brown said he would be willing to devote an entire debate with Mr. Renacci just to the tax law: \u201cI think this is a fundamental difference between the two parties.\u201dRepublican officials said the strong growth report on Friday could soften candidates\u2019 reluctance to dwell on economic themes, though they also said that Republicans would continue to attack Democrats on other issues, especially their ties to the House Democratic leader, Ms. Pelosi, who is unpopular with conservatives.Mr. Trump said on Friday that he would stump for Republicans in tough races nearly every day for the last two months of the campaign, arguing that the strength of the economy would help lift his party\u2019s fortunes.\u201cIt\u2019s a positive, unifying message for Republicans around the country\u201d to talk about tax cuts and growth, said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not shying away from it, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it in every ad.\u201dSo far, voters have seen it in hardly any. The tax law \u201ctakes a back seat\u201d in campaign advertising, said Erika Franklin Fowler, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, and few candidates are talking about the strength of the stock market or economic growth.\u201cGeneric tax references are pretty common,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they make tax statements, they typically are, \u2018I will fight for lower taxes for the middle class.\u2019\u201dMr. Tiberi said Republicans should be proud to tell voters that cuts in corporate tax rates encourage companies to move their headquarters to central Ohio and other parts of America.Tim Kane, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, agreed.\u201cTax policy is a winning issue; it\u2019s one that I think Republicans are smart to embrace,\u201d Mr. Kane said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In House Race, 2 Female Candidates Clash on Economy and Guns", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWATERTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 On a sultry day at the Jefferson County Fair, Tedra Cobb, a Democratic nominee for Congress in New York\u2019s North Country, posed with alpacas, sampled fried dough and admired blue-ribbon Guernseys.Wherever Ms. Cobb goes, she tries to make the case to potential voters that they would be better served by a Democrat in Washington, rather than the two-term Republican incumbent, Elise Stefanik.But on this day, Ms. Cobb also took time to engage people like Kim Slate, who said she had voted for Ms. Stefanik in the past, about the challenges of dairy farming and foster parenting. (Ms. Cobb\u2019s parents ran a foster-care agency and adopted nine children.)\u201cI\u2019m impressed because she wanted to listen and was sympathetic,\u201d said Mrs. Slate, 45, who adopted three foster children and operates a farm with her husband. \u201cShe has my vote. First of all, she\u2019s in with the cattle, and I haven\u2019t seen the other one here.\u201dThe district is considered reliably Republican, with registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 50,000 voters. And Ms. Stefanik, 34, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she first ran in 2014, won her last election by 35 points.Still, Ms. Stefanik\u2019s predecessor was a two-term Democrat, and the district\u2019s 94,000 independents could constitute a powerful voting bloc in a season when President Trump has alienated many voters.Mostly, Ms. Cobb hammers away at the notion that Ms. Stefanik is out of touch with a district where rural poverty is a fact of life. After graduating from Harvard in 2006, Ms. Stefanik worked in Washington, first in the White House under President George W. Bush and then for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.Indeed, the Democrat has revived the carpetbagger label that followed Ms. Stefanik during her first run for Congress. Ms. Stefanik spent summers in the district near Lake Champlain, but was born and raised in the Albany area, where she attended a private girls\u2019 high school.By contrast, Ms. Cobb said, she has lived in the district for 30 years, since attending the State University of New York at Potsdam. She has experience in several fields that put her in contact with residents. She has worked as an AIDS educator, substitute teacher, founder of a health care nonprofit, strategic planner and two-term county lawmaker.When she and her husband, Scott Shipley, had a tough time making ends meet after the birth of their second child, they briefly collected federal food assistance to help pay for infant formula.\u201cI loved being a legislator,\u201d Ms. Cobb said. \u201cI liked going to the grocery store and hearing people\u2019s stories. To me, that\u2019s why you want a congressperson who lives in your district and shares your values and understands the struggle you are having economically.\u201dIn a telephone interview, Ms. Stefanik countered Ms. Cobb\u2019s narrative, saying that her family has had a home in Willsboro, N.Y., since she was 3 years old. \u201cI have very deep ties to the district,\u201d she said. \u201cI am home almost every weekend.

Ryan for his vice-presidential debate, called her opponent \u201ca desperate candidate who was one of the weakest in the Democratic field,\u201d adding that she \u201ccontinues to struggle both substantively on very basic issues, but also in terms of fund-raising and getting attention at the national level.\u201dMs. Cobb\u2019s campaign did receive some recent national attention, though of the unwelcome variety. Ms. Cobb was talking with teenagers at an event about gun violence in May when she relayed her conversation with a gun-control advocate at an earlier event that day.The National Rifle Association and the Stefanik campaign pounced on the recording, which found its way to the internet, as evidence that Ms. Cobb, who has publicly called for a ban on bump stocks and silencers, but not assault weapons, would push for such a ban if elected to Congress.\u201cI think it\u2019s a form of lying,\u201d said Ms. Stefanik, who owns a Remington 870 shotgun and has an A rating from the N.R.A. \u201cIt\u2019s really important as a candidate to be clear about what your positions are.\u201d\u201cWe were talking about their very real fear of gun violence in their schools, and I told them the truth,\u201d Ms. Cobb said in a statement.Preserving gun access is just one of the accomplishments that Ms. Stefanik points to. She touts her defense of the Army\u2019s Fort Drum military base in Watertown, which was threatened with the loss of thousands of positions. In the end, it shed only 100 jobs.Ms. Stefanik also sponsored a bill to extend federal Pell grants, which provide financial aid for low-income students, year-round. \u201cI have a lot of nontraditional students in my district,\u201d she said.But to Ms. Cobb\u2019s supporters, Ms. Stefanik\u2019s record in Washington is no match for their candidate\u2019s rural bona fides.For 11 years when her children were young, she and her husband, who installs solar panels, lived off the grid and used a hand pump for water.

The new rules being suggested extend the government\u2019s reach when it comes to foreign takeovers, lowering the threshold to include acquisitions of even small companies, intellectual property, individual assets or company shares.Britain and other governments in the West have had to tread a fine line when it comes to handling investment from China.Beijing and its homegrown companies are increasingly a competitive force in the global economy, in sectors ranging from technology to energy. But China is also the second-largest economy in the world, with deep pockets to invest overseas and a large market of consumers at home.Britain and other countries in Europe are trying to protect strategic industries, while courting Chinese investment and fighting to obtain better access to customers in China for their own companies.The challenge is especially stark for Britain as the country negotiates its withdrawal from the European Union. Dire warnings abound that companies will leave if they lose access to the 28-nation bloc.Under the plans, business owners will be encouraged to notify the government of any transaction that might trigger a host of potential national security risks contained in a set of guidelines. They could also face criminal charges for failing to comply with information requests or other steps the government might take to halt what it deems risky transactions.Those would involve \u201chostile parties acquiring control over entities or assets with the potential to undermine national security,\u201d including foreign governments acquiring sensitive assets through \u201ctraditional and nontraditional means,\u201d or individuals or entities affiliated with hostile states, the British government said.The government said that only a small number of investment activities, mergers and transactions in Britain actually pose a risk to national security. But Britain has noted that it could review as many as 50 a year under the new plan.The proposed changes could allow the government to clamp down on virtually every sector of the economy, including energy, defense and transportation, and in assets as diverse as energy networks, major airports and health care databases. \u201cThe reforms,\u201d the government proposal said, must \u201cbe designed to ensure that control over assets themselves cannot be acquired by those who wish our country harm.\u201dChinese companies have spent billions of dollars buying strategic real estate and companies in Britain in recent years, including the prominent Leadenhall Building in London, known as the Cheesegrater. And they have been enthusiastic buyers of businesses and properties from New York to Frankfurt.But Chinese buyers are facing increased scrutiny around the world.The impact of growing concerns has been significant: The value of new Chinese deals in the United States over the first five months of this year fell 92 percent from the same period last year, to $1.8 billion, according to Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investment overseas.Despite the pressure, Chinese companies, faced with increased difficulties in the United States, have been able to continue making investments at a good clip in Europe. Over the past six months, the value of newly announced Chinese deals in the region has surpassed that of new deals in the United States by nine times, according to Rhodium Group and Baker Mackenzie, the law firm.\u201cDespite the tightening of investment screening practices in several countries, Europe remains relatively open to Chinese investment,\u201d said Thilo Hanemann, director at Rhodium Group.\u201cOnly a handful of deals are reviewed and instances of intervention remain rare compared to North America. Not to forget, in the era of Trumpian politics, Europe provides Chinese investors with a more stable and predictable political environment,\u201d Mr. Hanemann said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a building in London.

{"Headline": "In Wine and Critics, Populists Find an Easy Target", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourStudies keep drawing the conclusion that people like cheap wines best and should not trust experts. But the findings say more about fears than tastes.Every few years an article bubbles up with claims that expensive wines are really no better than cheap ones. The findings come with an inevitable corollary: essentially, that you are better off seeking advice from random strangers in a bar than from wine experts.The bigger question is: Why is wine so regularly singled out in the United States to be assailed as something of a con game? And what is it about wine critics that invites such gleeful dismissals of their knowledge and judgment?One reason these populist studies resonate is that they all contain elements of truth. While it may be ridiculous to assert generally that expensive wines are no better than cheap wines, it is absolutely true that many expensive wines are not as good as many cheaper wines. The essential point the wine populists, and many of these studies, make is that ordinary people with little knowledge of wine prefer cheap wines to expensive ones, even if wine critics prefer more expensive bottles. Therefore, people should not listen to know-it-all wine critics because they will lead them to spend more for wines that are not to their tastes. The studies concede that the more people knew about wine, the more their tastes aligned with the critics\u2019. So it might have been reasonable for the studies to conclude instead that people\u2019s tastes evolve as they learn more about wine. But that would not have offered the same satisfying punch line.In any case, what is it about wine that permits it to be subjected to the indignity of a popularity contest? J.K. Rowling has sold a lot more books than Saul Bellow, and given the choice, most people would probably prefer to read Ms. Rowling. But does that lead to the conclusion that Nobel-winning authors like Mr. Bellow are for suckers?Authors of these gotcha wine expos\u00e9s may know better, but they publish them anyway because they understand that an American audience will find them particularly gratifying.Wine in American culture has long been a synonym for snobbery. I\u2019m sorry to say that wine culture has partly brought this on itself with its history of pretension, its equating of wine with connoisseurship, and the absurd vocabulary and rituals that many people assume must be mastered simply to enjoy wine.No politicians, no matter how much they enjoy wine in private, would dare be seen campaigning with a stemmed glass in hand \u2014 not when a can of Bud could be brandished instead. As much as people love wine and as important as it is to the economy of several American states, it is still viewed by American society as somehow foreign, un-American, effete, prissy and intellectual. Wine is a convenient subject for bashing because, let\u2019s face it, it is intimidating and anxiety-producing no matter what silly steps the wine business takes to simplify or demystify it. It\u2019s a little late for that, anyway. For far too long, the industry has been complicit in equating wine with stuffy connoisseurship. Before one could simply enjoy wine, one had to take \u201cwine appreciation\u201d classes, read textbooks and learn the esoteric vocabulary of tasting notes in which, simply to enjoy a glass of wine, one had to break down the constituent elements of a swallow into a grocery list of aromas and flavors. Left out of the equation are the emotions that wine provokes, the companionship it brings and its place on the table (except in the sense of the so-called art of food-and-wine pairing, which, with its own formulas and rules can be as intimidating as wine itself). The efforts to demystify and simplify never ring true because they ignore the fact that wine by its nature is mystifying and complicated. These qualities can be embraced and celebrated without suggesting that they require mastering, but that would force us to think and talk about wine in a different sort of way, as a food staple to be enjoyed rather than as a symbol of status or as a \u201clifestyle.\u201dI think we have made a start in that direction, but the regular reappearance of articles like Vox\u2019s demonstrate that the old way of looking at wine still has a firm hold. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that many people will not enjoy the mass-produced bottles, nor do I fault anybody who is satisfied with those wines. But if you are curious and want to drink better, more distinctive wines, the slightly higher price is money well spent. It\u2019s a matter of choosing craft over commerce, the difference between a fast-food burger and one from a cook who grinds the beef, cooks it to order and sees that the roll and condiments are of similar high quality. It will cost more, but for some people the expense will be worth it. Good wine critics present arguments and offer as evidence the bottles themselves. They make their cases with love and hope. The goal is to inspire curiosity, to promote ease and comfort with wine, to enlighten, to entertain and, occasionally, to offer vicarious pleasure. For those who believe they are demeaned by wine or wine writers, I would suggest it is the wine populists who are doing the demeaning, by pandering to inchoate feelings of fear and resentment. These feelings may well be real. But they are not caused by wine.Advertisement"}

But what about your household? What is it going to cost you?For the more than $80 billion in tariffs that the United States has already placed on washing machines and solar energy cells and panels; on most steel and aluminum imports; and on hundreds of products made in China, the short answer is $60 a year per household. That\u2019s about one-tenth of 1 percent of a typical household\u2019s income.The household impact numbers are based on analysis of government data by Kirill Borusyak, a postdoctoral associate at Princeton University, and Xavier Jaravel, an economics professor at the London School of Economics. They should be thought of as rough estimates, as they don\u2019t account for the full range of ways businesses and consumers will react; they assume, for example, that companies pass the entire cost of tariffs on to consumers rather than taking a hit to profit margins.The numbers also don\u2019t include the costs to some Americans in their roles as producers, as opposed to consumers \u2014 people who could lose their jobs or see lower incomes because other countries retaliate by taxing American products.But the data gives a sense of how the tariffs are likely to affect the typical household budget and increase consumer prices. The magnitude is small for now, but prices could rise substantially if a tit-for-tat escalation drives the total of affected goods toward or beyond $1 trillion.For the already active tariffs, here\u2019s how the $60 per average household breaks down: American households will pay about $7 a year extra for the washing machine and solar tariffs, $20 for the steel and aluminum tariffs, and $33 more because of the newly taxed Chinese goods that went into effect last week.A trade war can affect the economy in several ways, however. A tariff on a product from China might raise       prices for that product in other countries. If Chinese suppliers are facing a tariff from the United States,   suppliers in the United States and other countries might feel as if they have a little room to raise their prices as well.Economists aren\u2019t sure exactly how big this effect is, but Katheryn Russ, a professor of trade at the University of California, Davis, says it might add a further $20 to the estimate.It\u2019s also important to remember that these are average costs. Households that buy expensive items like trucks and washing machines this year will pay more because of the tariffs than households that don\u2019t.\u201cThe issue with the tariffs is that they\u2019re really distorting,\u201d Mrs. Russ said. \u201cThey don\u2019t fall evenly across the population, and they hit us in random ways.\u201dAssuming you don\u2019t buy a new car or washing machine, $60 over the course of a year may seem underwhelming, considering the more apocalyptic warnings about the risks of a trade war.One reason these numbers are relatively small is that the United States doesn\u2019t really import that much relative to the size of its economy. Even though it imported nearly $2.2 trillion of goods in 2015, American imports were only 12 percent of G.D.P., the lowest percentage among advanced nations. Of that, only about 3 percent of American imports (based on 2015 figures) are subject to these initial waves of taxes.Richer households tend to spend more money over all, particularly on high-end electronics that are covered by the tariffs. So a household making over $160,000 is looking at a $140 annual hit, a slightly higher percentage of income than lower-earning Americans face.If the proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods tariffs were to take effect, Mr. Borusyak and Mr. Jaravel estimate that they would cost the average household $127 annually.For households that earn:Washing machines and solar panelsSteel and aluminum$5-15k$46Chinese imports enacted July 6Chinese imports announced July 10$15-25k$62$25-35kAVERAGE: $127$79$35-45k$86$45-55k$92$55-65k$100$65-80k$121$80-100k$136$100-120k$157$120-160k$178$160k+$261For householdsthat earn:Washing machines and solar panelsSteel and aluminum$5-15k$46Chinese imports enacted July 6$15-25k$62Chinese imports announced July 10$25-35k$79$35-45k$86$45-55k$92$55-65k$100$65-80k$121$80-100k$136$100-120k$157$120-160k$178$160k+$261For households that earn:Washing machines and solar panelsSteel and aluminum$5-15k$90Chinese imports enacted July 6The rest of the imports from China$15-25k$122$25-35kAVERAGE: $270$154$35-45k$166$45-55k$182$55-65k$196$65-80k$238$80-100k$266$100-120k$307$120-160k$354$160k+$533For households that earn:Washing machines and solar panelsSteel and aluminum$5-15k$90Chinese importsenacted July 6$15-25k$122The rest of the imports from China$25-35k$154$35-45k$166$45-55k$182$55-65k$196$65-80k$238$80-100k$266$100-120k$307$120-160k$354$160k+$533The first wave of tariffs has been focused on things like industrial equipment that consumers pay for only indirectly. President Trump has threatened escalation that could reach $1 trillion or beyond. In further waves, more goods directly purchased by consumers, like electronics and automobiles, would probably be covered, meaning a more direct hit to consumers\u2019 wallets.\u201cAt some point the logic breaks down,\u201d said Mr. Jaravel, who added there may be tariffs on \u201csome products in which we cannot substitute and then we are in big trouble.\u201dThe trade war poses much more substantive risks to people whose livelihoods are tied to industries directly affected. That includes both industries that face more expensive raw materials because of tariffs, like a nail manufacturer grappling with higher steel prices, and those that are subject to retaliation, such as soybean farmers who will see lower incomes because of Chinese tariffs on their products.Economists also point out that these tariffs are to some degree rolling back some of the gains families saw from the tax cut the Trump administration passed seven months ago.\u201cYou\u2019re cutting taxes with the tax reform and then you\u2019re slapping them back on with the tariffs,\u201d Mrs. Russ said. \u201cIn that context they don\u2019t look trivial, especially for low- to middle-income households.\u201dThe researchers estimate the tariffs\u2019 effects on imported goods and goods that use imported components. The estimates are produced by matching customs and detailed supply chain data with consumer expenditure data  from 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "26 Vehicles Played in the Mud. Here\u2019s the Dirt.", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsMudfest puts a range of vehicles to the test both on the road and off. If you\u2019re looking to buy an S.U.V. \u2014 and lots of consumers are \u2014 the event\u2019s winners are a good place to start.When a friend of mine asked me for advice on the best sport utility vehicle for him and his wife as they expected their first child, I asked what attribute was most important to him. I told him that what he really needed was therapy and a well-stocked emergency kit, but his request for advice was to be expected. Automotive writers are much like doctors who are asked to diagnose maladies at parties. Twenty-seven automotive writers evaluated 26 vehicles at the Ridge Motorsports Park near Shelton, Wash., during the annual event, which is put on by the Northwest Automotive Press Association. Day 1 was dedicated to performance on the road, which, let\u2019s face it, is where most of these rigs will live out their days. On Day 2, they got down and dirty on an off-road course that simulated rough forest service roads. Details such as value, interior features, ride quality, fuel economy and performance were considered by the group. Four vehicles took six of the Mudfest categories, and any of them will do you proud. But we writers are opinionated, so I\u2019m offering up alternatives when the collective pick didn\u2019t match mine. Outdoor Activity Vehicle of the Year$53,200 as tested. 18 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway/20 m.p.g. averageThe Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon was Mudfest\u2019s big winner, taking home top honors and being named the best Compact and Midsize Vehicle while conquering the Extreme Capability Vehicle category.Those who had the pleasure of wallowing through turns in previous Wranglers may wonder how a loud, rough-riding and ponderous machine wins three Mudfest awards. The answer is simple: This one is better.The all-new 2018 model is significantly better than its predecessor. It\u2019s no Lexus, mind you, but the Wrangler\u2019s fussy pavement-going manners have been quieted and smoothed, and its considerable trail prowess is improved. If my friend is looking for a rig to tackle earthquakes \u2014 and perhaps a subsequent zombie apocalypse \u2014 the Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon is the best choice.Designer pride is obvious in this machine. Its removable doors gain a handhold for easier one-person detachment. Folding the windshield forward (a remnant of the need to ship jeeps in crates during World War II) is vastly simplified. The bolts that are removed to open the Jeep to the great outdoors each have labeled slots in the cargo hold. Its folding fabric top operation loses the recalcitrant zippers, meaning that owners will actually lower it.Other competitors may suit families better than the Rubicon that waltzed through the optional severe off-road course spur. The practical Midwestern boy in me feels that the Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk ($41,245) is the best practical choice for the Compact and Midsize Vehicle prize. It\u2019s easier for kids to enter and exit, and the Cherokee delivers a more docile ride. And if timeless Wrangler style is your thing, skipping the Rubicon edition for the Sahara model will provide a better daily driving experience.Best Subcompact Utility Vehicle$29,805. 26/29/27Small crossovers are becoming a big deal, and the Kona handily won the Subcompact Utility Vehicle segment. Among competitors, only the Ford EcoSport was shorter (by about 2.5 inches). Though the Kona is one of the smallest in its class, its cargo hold and well-trimmed cabin are among the roomiest \u2014 kudos to Hyundai\u2019s engineers. The Kona carved up the on-road handling section (part of which ran on a go-kart track) and easily scampered through the modified motocross track that was Mudfest\u2019s off-road course. The United States census says the average household has three people, so the diminutive Hyundai will serve couples or young families well. Consider options and models carefully. If you opt for the 147-horsepower, 2-liter four-cylinder, consider the front-drive SEL model with the $1,500 Tech Package for a total of $23,630. This combination provides a sunroof and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.We drove the full-kit Ultimate model, which adds a 175-horsepower, 1.6-liter turbo engine and a seven-speed automatic transmission. Maybe it was the snappy performance, or perhaps it was the retina-searing Lime Twist paint, but the journalists getting out of the Kona always wore a smile. Best Family Utility Vehicle$45,235. 17/23/19The big three-row VW took home the Family Utility Vehicle trophy in a tightly contested battle that also involved the Kia Sorento, the Ford Expedition and (seriously) a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Crew Van. For families that often use a third row of seats, the roomy Atlas will shoulder their needs. It can tote seven average-size adults fairly comfortably and slips into shopping mall parking spaces without the drama of docking an aircraft carrier (looking at you, Sprinter).Part of the Atlas\u2019s appeal is its usability. Access to the back row is nearly as easy as in a minivan. Folding both back rows of seats makes for a remarkably flat load floor. The second row offers two USB ports and a standard 115-volt household outlet for charging your passengers\u2019 devices. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard. There are so many storage cubbies, you may lose a child in one. Those who tow should consider the excellent 2018 Ford Expedition. Though its aluminum body effectively gives it a lower center of gravity, this big, truck-based S.U.V. unsurprisingly lost points on the tight go-kart handling course. And if the third row is a just-in-case proposition, you might test-drive the refreshed 2018 Kia Sorento. It\u2019s handsome, refined and smaller than the Atlas. Best Premium Utility Vehicle$50,920 21/31/25Some highly regarded models didn\u2019t make this list. But keep in mind that each manufacturer chose which vehicles it felt would compete best at Mudfest. For whatever reason, Honda decided against bringing the excellent CR-V to the fight. Same with Volvo and its avant-garde XC40. Still, the results of Mudfest are a great place to start when shopping for an S.U.V. or a crossover. But the members of the Northwest Automotive Press Association may not understand your specific vehicle demands. So the lesson here is to test-drive as many as possible. That helps ensure that the one that ends up in your driveway \u2014 or at your favorite trailhead \u2014 is the best for your particular needs. Oh, and makes sure that emergency kit is well stocked.Advertisement"}

The United States has also imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines from countries like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan.For now, it is unclear how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the trade war might conclude. On Friday, China\u2019s, Ministry of Commerce said the United States \u201chas launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far,\u201d and President Trump on Thursday continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.Most Fed officials at the table \u201cnoted that uncertainty and risks had intensified,\u201d and that tariffs and other trade measures \u201ccould have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.\u201dAs of Friday morning, companies like Husco International, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that makes parts for companies like Ford, General Motors, Caterpillar and John Deere, now face a 25 percent increase on a variety of parts imported from China. Austin Ramirez, Husco International\u2019s chief executive, said that increase would immediately put him and other American manufacturers at a disadvantage to competitors abroad.\u201cThe people it helps most of all are my competitors in Germany and Japan, who also have large parts of their supply chain in Asia but don\u2019t have these tariffs,\u201d he said.The Trump administration drafted its initial tariff list to spare consumers, and many of the products that American families purchase from China, like flat-screen TVs and shoes, are not directly hit on Friday. But American companies that depend on Chinese products are expected to feel the pinch, given the tariffs focus heavily on the kind of intermediate inputs and capital equipment that businesses purchase and ultimately sell both in the United States and abroad.Also, health and hygiene concerns have led China\u2019s increasingly well-off shoppers to prefer food imported from the United States or elsewhere.Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington.\u201cOf course I want China to fight back,\u201d said Cathy Yuan, 32, who was shopping at an upscale Shanghai supermarket on Friday. \u201cWe are defending our rights as a nation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My grandparents built it overlooking a bay that partially emptied with the tide and clams squirted their whereabouts to be dug for dinner.

This was, of course driven by the flood of refugees \u2014 including my family \u2014 into a bombed-out West Germany with little housing for themselves.

It embodied the view of Canada most Germans still have today.Ingrid Hurtubise, Marietta, Ga.My log cabin was built in 1903, on an island just outside Ontario\u2019s Algonquin Park, by three American industrialists as a place to send their families in the summer to escape the heat and pollution of the Midwest.

{"Headline": "If the Trade War Starts to Damage the Economy, Here\u2019s How You\u2019ll Be Able to Tell", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s no question that some American companies are feeling the bite of the trade war that the Trump administration is waging against much of the world. But it\u2019s a mistake to assume that difficulties of individual companies and industries are the same as a force powerful enough to bend the overall trajectory of the United States economy.\u201cThe direct effects on the U.S. economy are small, because the economy is really big and it is mostly domestically driven,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services. \u201cStill, tariffs hurt, and we\u2019re starting to see some precursors of an impact already.\u201dTo assess how the trade war could affect growth, the job market and inflation at the macroeconomic level, you need data. The trouble is that much economic data operates with long time lags. By the time there would be solid evidence that the trade war was doing damage, the damage would already have been done.But certain indicators are likely to provide early signs of trouble: data that is more big picture than individual anecdotes, but more timely than things like G.D.P. and the unemployment rate.If you want a dashboard for evidence of economic damage from the trade war, here\u2019s what should be on it.One of the key ways trade tensions can slow a nation\u2019s overall growth is by causing businesses to pull back on capital expenditures.The hard data on business investment tends to be released with long delays. If executives become gloomier about the future, the earliest evidence will probably come from frequent surveys of them.But while the evidence is uneven today, these market indicators and confidence surveys could amount to the canary in the trade war coal mine if they take a decisive turn for the worse.\u201cI am watching business sentiment very closely,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist of PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cIf we started to see business sentiment turn, that would be an indication that key constituencies in the business community are getting nervous.\u201dThe closest thing to a real-time indicator of the trade war\u2019s possible effect on corporate profits is the stock market. Several household-name companies with deep exposure to global commerce, like Boeing, Caterpillar and John Deere, have become bellwethers for the trade war.But to understand whether trade tensions are affecting the overall economy, it\u2019s worth watching whether dips in the stock market remain limited to those companies with direct exposure to global commerce, or start to encompass even service industries and those with mainly domestic business. If that changes, it will be evidence that the trade war is translating into gloomier prospects for the United States economy as a whole.This will eventually show up in overall inflation numbers, but that could take time, especially since most of the early rounds of tariffs are aimed not at finished consumer goods but at raw materials and industrial products.You can get some sense of what\u2019s coming by looking at commodity futures markets for items that are affected. Many businesses, for example, have reported higher steel and aluminum prices because of tariffs on imported metals.In other words, for that particular commodity, the smart money seems to think that higher prices will be temporary.The inverse of higher prices for metals is evident in lower prices for soybeans and other agriculture products \u2014 caused by Chinese and European retaliatory tariffs that depress international demand.For both goods, the market prices suggest the trade distortions will be temporary. If that changes, it will be a bigger deal for both overall price inflation facing consumers and for the incomes of farmers and other producers of commodities.It\u2019s also worth keeping an eye on the producer price index, calculated by the Labor Department, which captures the prices of the raw materials that companies use to make finished products. If the trade war is going to feed into broader consumer inflation, it is likely to show up there first.The trade war is arriving amid the healthiest labor market in at least 18 years, with the unemployment rate around 4 percent. But how will we tell if it\u2019s starting to cause pain?If indicators like that one started to fall, it would be a sign that the trade war was making companies more reluctant to hire.Similarly, if the anecdotal reports of layoffs caused by tariffs became widespread, you would expect to see the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits spike upward.How do things look if you put it all together? As of mid-July, the evidence that the trade war is doing meaningful economic damage is scarce. But by keeping an eye on the right tools, it\u2019s possible to get early warning signs if that starts to change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Lounge Wars Heat Up as Airlines Vie for High-End Passengers", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo you think your only choice during a long layover or a flight delay is to suffer in the airport terminal?Think again.But be prepared to pay handsomely one way or another for the alternative.The airline lounge competition is heating up around the globe, and two new entrants, American and United, have, somewhat belatedly, become serious contenders.Like the difference between first-class and economy seats, the luxury lounges offered by many major airlines are yet another way in which air travel is separating the haves from the have-nots.Entry usually requires the purchase of a business- or first-class ticket, and some V.I.P. lounges charge thousands of dollars per visit by individuals or small groups of travelers. There are some exceptions for holders of certain credit cards, and occasionally a traveler can make a one-time visit for a relatively low fee.But regardless of the cost, lounge access has become paramount for business travelers, especially those on overnight flights from the Northeastern United States to Europe, experts say. They want to shower and eat fresh food in the lounge, and then sleep on their flight, so when they arrive in Europe they can head directly to their meeting.American Airlines offers Flagship Lounge access to first- and business-class passengers on transcontinental and international flights and has opened new ones at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Miami International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago since last year. The lounges have hot and cold buffets, wine, champagne and create-your-own cocktails, showers and quiet rooms. All lounges except O\u2019Hare\u2019s also have restaurant-style dining for first-class passengers.Other Polaris lounges are also planned in Los Angeles and at Washington Dulles International Airport. These will feature a restaurant offering local cuisine; relaxation areas, including daybeds with Saks Fifth Avenue bedding; and shower suites with valet service.But American\u2019s and United\u2019s lounges are in many ways overshadowed by older and newer top-tier airport lounges operated by carriers based outside the United States.Take for example Lufthansa\u2019s First Class Terminal, which opened at Frankfurt Airport in 2004 and was refurbished in 2014, and Cathay Pacific Airways\u2019 Pier first-class lounge at Hong Kong International Airport, which opened in 2001 and was refurbished in 2014.And then there is Qantas\u2019s Perth Transit Lounge, which opened in March for business-class fliers on the airline\u2019s new 787-9 flights that originate in Melbourne, Australia, stop in Perth and continue nonstop for 17 hours to London; the lounge is also available on return flights from London.The Perth lounge offers seasonal menus from Rockpool Bar & Grill, a Sydney restaurant; an outdoor barbecue and hydration station; bathrooms that provide light therapy and help travelers adjust to the time zone to which they are flying; and a well-being studio that has stretching and breathing classes conducted by a yoga teacher, also custom designed to combat jet lag.Since 2013, American Express has opened a Centurion Lounge at eight airports in the United States and in Hong Kong. New lounges are scheduled to open next year at New York\u2019s J.F.K., Denver and Los Angeles airports. The lounges are only for holders of its Platinum and Centurion credit cards. These lounges offer menus designed by well-known chefs, shower suites, noise-buffering work spaces, family rooms and staff members who provide credit-card and concierge services.And for travelers in London who want privacy, there are suites available through the Heathrow V.I.P. service. Originally used by members of the British royal family, heads of state and diplomats, 17 suites are available for business- and first-class passengers. Up to six travelers can buy a two-hour visit in a suite for 2,750 pounds, or about $3,600, which includes concierge and baggage handling services, food prepared by a Michelin-starred chef, private security clearance and transportation in a BMW 7 Series to the airplane. The car can also transfer travelers from London to the airport.Many carriers use their top-tier lounges as \u201can extension of their premium onboard experience,\u201d promoting them on their websites, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group.Indeed, Paul Priestman, director of PriestmanGoode, a London industrial design company that was hired by United to help develop Polaris, including its website and lounges, said his company\u2019s concepts for the Polaris experience were designed to create consistency, which he called \u201ceverything in the travel experience. It\u2019s what people remember. We try and make sure all touch points are similar, so the overall effect is calmer, and travelers enjoy the experience more, so they repeat, become regular.\u201dAmerican Express\u2019s motives for entering the airport lounge business differ somewhat from the carriers\u2019, experts say.The credit-card issuer \u201cknows it has high-value travelers and wants to be able to control its own destiny with a high-quality lounge experience,\u201d Mr. Dikman said.Equally significant, according to Mr. Harteveldt, is the reshuffling in recent years of airlines\u2019 relationships with credit-card companies.As a result of revisions in their credit-card partnerships, neither American nor United provides American Express cardholders access to their airport lounges. He called the establishment of Centurion Clubs a \u201cdefensive move\u201d by American Express that he believed had paid off. These lounges have raised the bar, he said, \u201cfor all lounges, with an experience that\u2019s closer to international business-class lounges.\u201dOne challenge facing any airline, alliance or company aiming to expand existing lounges or open new ones could be space constraints, Mr. Harteveldt said, noting, \u201cThere is a limited amount of real estate, especially in older terminals, when the lounge concept was different.\u201dMr. Priestman said he thought lounges might play an even greater role if airports became a destination for people who were not actually flying.Visitors could shop in an airport\u2019s duty-free store, go to the IMAX theater or nine-hole golf course at the Hong Kong airport or the Butterfly Garden at Singapore Changi Airport. \u201cLounges could become more like a reception area,\u201d he said, \u201cand if you spend more money, you could go into the V.I.P. lounge and prolong your stay.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the location of O\u2019Hare International Airport. It is in Chicago, not outside Chicago. Also, an earlier version of a picture caption misstated the year in which Lufthansa\u2019s First Class Terminal in Frankfurt was refurbished. As the article noted, it was 2014, not 2015. The article and a picture caption also described imprecisely who may use United\u2019s Polaris Lounges. Passengers traveling in United\u2019s Polaris business class and Polaris first class on long-haul international flights may use them, as well as passengers traveling in business class or first class on Star Alliance airlines\u2019 long-haul international flights; the lounges are not open only to those in Polaris business class and those in first class on Star Alliance flights.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Voters May Be the Biggest Losers From Trump\u2019s Auto Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Trump has complained about seeing too many German cars on Fifth Avenue, and threatened heavy tariffs on the companies that produce them. There is a good chance, though, that those Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs were not only made in the United States, but made by workers who voted for Mr. Trump.European companies have turned Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee into auto manufacturing powerhouses in recent years, churning out cars not just for American buyers but also for export to China and Europe. Germany\u2019s three biggest carmakers all have facilities there, and Volvo Cars, which is owned by a Chinese company but based in Sweden, began producing at a new plant in South Carolina just last month.Yet being major employers in regions that voted heavily for Mr. Trump has not protected them.Carmakers, both foreign and domestic, say such penalties would severely damage their lines of supply, interfere with exports and eventually force them to curtail operations in, of all places, Republican strongholds.Mr. Trump won 63 percent of the vote in Spartanburg, S.C., home of BMW\u2019s biggest factory anywhere in the world. But Allen Smith, president of the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce, said the president\u2019s tariffs would threaten the region\u2019s livelihood.\u201cFor BMW and its many, many suppliers scattered across the state and region, you\u2019re talking tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe would all agree with the president\u2019s overall aim to improve trade with America\u2019s interests top of mind. But getting to that end by inflicting so much pain on American business is the wrong approach.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose auto tariffs would be the latest manifestation of his willingness to alienate longtime allies and American companies, ostensibly to protect domestic jobs. He has already imposed levies on steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other nations, and on Friday will place tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products.But this new front in the trade war carries substantial risk not just for the auto industry but for Mr. Trump and Republican officeholders nationwide, given the impact that a full-blown trade war could have on American jobs tied to the auto industry.\u201cThe times are gone that a producer was only headquartered in one country with production in that country and exporting from that country to the rest of the world,\u201d said Erik Jonnaert, the secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, in an interview in Brussels.The economic impact would be greatest in a triangle demarcated by BMW\u2019s factory in Spartanburg; Daimler\u2019s Mercedes complex in Tuscaloosa, Ala.; and Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.Beginning in the 1990s, Southern states, desperate to replace manufacturing jobs lost when the textile industry decamped to Asia, wooed carmakers with tax breaks and other sweeteners. When Volkswagen was looking for a place to build a factory in 2008, Chattanooga officials deployed 200 bulldozers, wood chippers and other heavy equipment to clear a potential site after company representatives complained that it was too overgrown. The factory began operating in 2011.Over time, the European carmakers have expanded their operations in those regions not only to build vehicles for American buyers, but also to serve customers in places like China. Last year, Daimler added 900 jobs to its American operations, which also include truck factories, and it is investing $1 billion to expand the Tuscaloosa operation to produce electric vehicles and batteries.Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that these companies may present a threat to American national security, though, has thrown that growth into doubt.BMW exports 70 percent of the vehicles that it makes in Spartanburg, about 270,000, helping to reduce the trade deficit that Mr. Trump often complains about. BMW plans to add 1,000 jobs in Spartanburg as part of a $600 million expansion. If trade tensions continue to escalate, BMW warned in a letter on June 28 to Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, the result could be \u201cstrongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States.\u201dThat argument is unlikely to carry much weight with Mr. Trump. BMW and Mercedes export \u201cmillions\u201d of cars to the United States, Mr. Trump said in a speech in June, \u201cand we hardly tax them at all.\u201dCountries across the globe charge varying tariffs on certain types of automobiles. The United States imported about 1.2 million cars of all brands from Europe last year \u2014 five times as many as were sent the other way \u2014 and imposed a relatively low tariff of 2.5 percent. The European Union charges a levy of 10 percent on car imports from the United States and other countries.But tariffs on larger vehicles are lopsided in the other direction. The United States charges a 25 percent tariff on light trucks and vans from Europe, effectively barring them from the American market. That\u2019s one reason Volkswagen vans made in Hanover, Germany, once synonymous with 1960s flower power, are a rare sight on American roads these days.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs would also apply to car parts, adding another layer of disruption to the companies that supply automakers across the world \u2014 especially if Europe retaliates.Suppliers like ZF Friedrichshafen, a German company that has a transmission factory in South Carolina, say they produce most of what they need locally. But occasionally ZF imports or exports niche products when the market is too small to justify having more than one production site.\u201cWe are vulnerable to further escalations of this conflict because we ship products from the U.S. to Europe and from Europe to the U.S.,\u201d Wolf-Henning Scheider, the chief executive of ZF Friedrichshafen, said in an emailed statement.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for over 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen a more united and aligned response than this one,\u201d said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign automakers operating in the United States.Legislation introduced by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee that would curtail the president\u2019s authority to impose tariffs because of national security has failed to advance, but the idea still has powerful backers. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, who has called the proposed levies \u201cdeeply misguided,\u201d said he planned to move legislation on tariffs through his committee. And representatives including Jackie Walorski, a Republican from Indiana, and Ron Kind, a Democrat from Wisconsin, have gathered more than 70 signatures for a letter expressing concern about the potential impact of the tariffs on the automotive industry.Ann Wilson, the senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts makers, said her group had met with Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, staff at the Treasury and Commerce Departments, and lawmakers of both parties to convey the dire impact that tariffs could have on the industry.Many smaller manufacturers of auto parts, especially those whose costs have risen because of steel and aluminum tariffs, would not be able to last even three months with a substantial tariff on imports, she said.\u201cWhat is going to play out in the industry is higher costs, lower employment and a massive disruption that could ultimately result in an economic downturn for the country,\u201d Ms. Wilson said.Mr. Trump has shown no signs of backing down.When asked in an interview on Fox News last weekend about his threats of a 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cWell, actually it\u2019s 20 percent. Tell them to get their numbers right.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Shaming of Young Dancer Draws Backlash", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Like many teenage girls, Maedeh Hojabri liked to dance in her bedroom, record it and post clips to Instagram.But Ms. Hojabri lives in Iran, where women are not allowed to dance, at least not in public. The 19-year-old was quietly arrested in May and her page was taken down, leaving her 600,000 followers wondering where she had gone.Whatever the authorities\u2019 intent, the public shaming of Ms. Hojabri and the arrest of others who have not been identified have created a backlash in a society already seething over a bad economy, corruption and a lack of personal freedoms.But for Iran\u2019s hard-liners, who have regained some credibility since President Trump fulfilled their predictions by pulling out of the nuclear deal, her videos are yet another example of why Instagram, the only Western social media tool still available in Iran, should be blocked. The messaging app Telegram was closed down in April.Last week the judiciary warned that Instagram, which has 24 million users in Iran, might be closed because of its \u201cunwanted content.\u201d Ms. Hojabri, and other internet celebrities like her are called \u201cantlers\u201d by hard-liners for the way they stand out on Instagram.President Hassan Rouhani, elected in 2013 on the promise of expanding personal freedoms, has promoted social media, tried to defend Telegram and increased the speed of the internet to allow Iranians to stream video on cellphones. But now, hard-liners have set their sights on Instagram.In April, the commander of the national police, Kamal Hadianfar, announced that \u201cInstagram celebrities\u201d would soon be arrested and that 51,000 Instagram pages were under police surveillance for vulgar and obscene videos.\u201cInstagram started out as an innocent tool, available on the internet, where people would upload photos and write some words,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. \u201cBut the Westerners behind it gradually turned Instagram into a mischievous tool for dangerous subversive actions against the state or pornographic purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally we must block it.\u201dThat Instagram should come into the cross hairs of the hard-liners is no surprise. For decades the ruling clerics, bowing to reality, have said that people are free to do as they like, but only in the privacy of their own homes.So a balance has been maintained. In the public realm in Iran, conservative Islamic rules apply and are enforced, so women have to wear veils and are normally barred from singing or dancing. (There are exceptions, such as the dancing in the streets that followed an Iranian World Cup victory.) In the private sphere they are free to ignore the strictures.But Instagram has brought down the walls between private and public life in Iran. All one has to do is search \u201c#Iran\u201d to peek right into the Iran the clerics do not want you to see: dancers, clips of the deposed shah, girls in bikinis.Just as elsewhere in the world Iran has its share of influencers and celebrities, who attract hundreds of thousands of followers and the advertising that comes with it, some earning enough to live from it. Now, those stars would seem to be in jeopardy.Iranian officials have grown increasingly exercised by the online behavior of their fellow citizens. In the \u201cWrong Path\u201d program, a justice official said that many people online suffer from \u201cinferiority complexes\u201d and are only interested in getting as many likes as possible. Talking to one of those arrested, the official, Farid Najafnia, said he was shocked.\u201cI asked, \u2018Did you have no shame, no modesty,\u201d he said in an interview for the TV program. \u201c\u2018You published publicly the most private things that should be protected by personal privacy.\u2019 She said: \u2018I recognize cyberspace as a totally private space.\u2019 Private, in a way that for instance 8,000 people would come and \u2018like it\u2019? Is this real? Is this true?\u201dIn 2014 six young people were arrested after making their versions of \u201cHappy,\u201d a video by the American singer Pharrell Williams. They were brought on state television, where they confessed and were sentenced to 90 lashes, though the punishment was never administered. One of the members of the group, Reihane Taravati, went on to become an Instagram celebrity.The televised confession of Ms. Hojabri made Ms. Taravati relive her own experience, Ms. Taravati said. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to learn from what they did in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cDancing is in our culture, it\u2019s a way of showing happiness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Rejects Settlement Over McDonald\u2019s Labor Practices", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a setback for McDonald\u2019s, a federal administrative law judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed settlement between the company and the government\u2019s top labor-law prosecutor in a case that could threaten the viability of the franchise business model.In the trial, which had begun under the Obama administration in 2015, the government contended that McDonald\u2019s was liable for numerous labor-law violations committed by its franchisees. A finding for the government could have exposed companies that rely heavily on the franchise model to enormous liability.But in January, the new general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an appointee of President Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case to negotiate a settlement with the company, even though the trial was only days from concluding.The judge, Lauren Esposito, rejected the settlement, saying it was not \u201ca reasonable resolution based on the nature and scope of the violations alleged and the settlements\u2019 limited remedial impact.\u201dJudge Esposito argued that a legitimate settlement must at least approach the effectiveness of a remedy resulting from a finding against the company. She said McDonald\u2019s refused even to guarantee that its franchisees would abide by the terms.Some of the proposed remedies included giving workers back pay and placing detailed notices in the workplace describing the settlement. The notices would have apprised workers of their right to form a union or band together to improve their working conditions, and would have included a pledge not to interfere.\u201cThe way this is all structured, all the liability is on the franchisees, there is no obligation on McDonald\u2019s part,\u201d said Micah Wissinger, a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups, who helped represent the workers in the case. \u201cPart of why she has rejected it is that they have no real obligations to do anything.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s and Mr. Robb\u2019s office must now decide whether to abandon the settlement approach and resume the trial; try again on a new settlement agreement; or, most likely, appeal the decision to the National Labor Relations Board, where Republicans hold a majority.\u201cWe are disappointed that the administrative law judge failed to approve the settlement agreement, further prolonging this already lengthy and expensive litigation,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s and its franchisees are evaluating our options.\u201dThe National Labor Relations Board declined to comment.The key question is whether McDonald\u2019s is a so-called joint employer of the workers hired by its franchisees, meaning it controls working conditions. The legal standard for what constitutes control has moved in recent years, as the partisan composition of the labor board has changed.In addition to making McDonald\u2019s liable for violations by its franchisees, a joint-employer finding would also force the company to bargain with workers who formed a union.The workers at the center of the case complained that their supervisors had punished and even fired some of them for taking part in a campaign for a $15 hourly wage and a union, an effort that begin in 2012.In her decision, Judge Esposito noted the lengths to which McDonald\u2019s had gone to prolong the proceedings, including initially refusing to hold pretrial conference calls with the other parties unless the calls were transcribed (a request she denied) and raising questions about the authenticity of documents submitted as evidence by the government, even though most of the documents had been subpoenaed from McDonald\u2019s.\u201cFrom the moment the first witness took the stand in this case on March 14, 2016, the evidentiary issues raised by McDonald\u2019s and the franchisee respondents have simply been extraordinary,\u201d she wrote.Jennifer Abruzzo, who was deputy general counsel at the National Labor Relations Board during the Obama administration, said the judge was implying that McDonald\u2019s had tried to hold out for the possibility that a Republican would win the presidency in 2016 and appoint a new general counsel.\u201cWithout saying it, she was like, McDonald\u2019s just delayed this long enough to have a change, so that they could push through this settlement agreement with a general counsel who was willing, able and wanted it,\u201d Ms. Abruzzo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Fake Fix for a Bad Economic Policy", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUsing tax dollars to bailout farmers hurt by President Trump\u2019s tariffs is not the way to strengthen the economy. Mr. Block is a professor of economics at Loyola University in New Orleans.As an economist who shares President Trump\u2019s belief that we should be cutting taxes and shrinking government, I might be expected to be enthralled by his policies. But that is not the sentiment I and many other libertarians feel when it comes to his decision to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum and a host of other products made overseas, particularly in China.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had reached an agreement to step back from a trade war and to discuss ways to lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and possibly increase European imports of American soybeans. But the outcome of those talks is far from certain, and trade tensions between the United States and China remain very high.What is driving the president\u2019s apparent eagerness to impose tariffs is a simple and wrongheaded idea that plays to a large part of his base: A trade war will spur job growth in America. He is trying to use tariffs to give a leg up to American industries against countries that manufacture the same products that we do \u2014 whether steel, aluminum or cars \u2014 but more efficiently. And who could be against that if it creates more jobs? In reality, however, creating jobs alone does not make for a strong economy. What we really want is to increase production. And to achieve that, we need to allocate labor as efficiently as possible. One way to do that is to ensure that if other countries can make certain goods more efficiently than we can, we trade with them for these items, rather than manufacture them ourselves. The result is cheaper goods, which is to our advantage. But tariffs do nothing to improve this efficient allocation of labor. They also do not increase or decrease employment. They just shift jobs around, and almost always in a manner that hurts the economy.As an illustration, assume Mr. Trump is the governor of New York. He is devoted to making the Empire State \u201cgreat again.\u201d Right now, both New Yorkers and Iowans raise pigs \u2014 but Iowa produces far more than New York. So Governor Trump sets up a protective tariff against the importation of Iowa-raised pork. Will this make New York great again?Hardly. There is a very good reason the Empire State does not produce a huge amount of this product: economic efficiency, the true path toward economic greatness. Of course, pork product jobs will increase in New York thanks to the Trump tariffs. But this is the way to ruin the state\u2019s economy.There are good reasons the United States is such a prosperous country, one of which is this: The country is a gigantic free-trade zone among the states. Yes, every once in a while a state legislature will get in the way. Wisconsin may try to reduce the importation of wine from California. But this only interferes with the specialization and the division of labor that maximizes output. Happily, the Supreme Court has typically given the back of its collective hand to all such attempted interferences with interstate economic freedom.We would do well to apply the same principles to American trade with other countries. That is why Milton Friedman urged a unilateral declaration of free trade with all nations, regardless of their own restrictions on international trade.The negative consequences of a trade war will soon be felt, if they aren\u2019t already. Even if the United States avoids trade conflict with Europe, tariffs on steel and aluminum from China, Mexico and Canada will raise domestic prices, hurting consumers. And the administration is likely to find itself subsidizing voters who purchase these items or who are hurt when other countries slap tariffs on American goods in retaliation \u2014 mainly farmers, manufacturers and builders. That is one reason Mr. Trump went to Iowa on Thursday: The state\u2019s farm industry could be severely hurt by taxes or tariffs on American farm exports imposed by China and other countries in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. So the president heralded a plan to provide as much as $12 billion in emergency relief to farmers caught in the trade crossfire. That is a $12 billion bailout using taxpayer funds for a problem the president himself created. There are other, longer-term consequences of a trade war. After the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, announced in May that tariffs would be imposed on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union, our European allies embraced greater trade relations with, of all places, Russia. Canada is sidling up to China. This will only hurt American exporters.Maybe we should be happy that the president hasn\u2019t yet kicked Hawaii out of the union and imposed a tariff on pineapples to strengthen the weak pineapple industry in other states. Absurd, yes, but hardly less bizarre than thinking tariffs on foreign goods will make the American economy great again.Walter E.

{"Headline": "Iran Takes U.S. to Court Over Nuclear Deal and Reimposed Sanctions", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIran has sued the United States at the International Court of Justice in a new, if dubious, strategy to nullify the nuclear sanctions reimposed by President Trump, which are starting to inflict pain on Iran\u2019s already troubled economy.The United States vowed to fight what it called a \u201cbaseless\u201d lawsuit.Mr. Trump ordered the nuclear sanctions reimposed on May 8 as part of an announcement withdrawing his government from the 2015 nuclear agreement negotiated by Iran and major powers, including the United States, under the Obama administration.Mr. Trump has assailed that agreement, which lifted the sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s verifiable pledges to use nuclear power peacefully, as \u201cthe worst deal,\u201d despite support for it by the other participants, including Britain, France and Germany, major American allies.The International Atomic Energy Agency, the anti-proliferation monitor of the United Nations, has repeatedly said the nuclear agreement is working.But the accord\u2019s future is in grave doubt over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to abandon it. Iranian officials have said they are preparing to renounce the accord if European participants cannot find a solution.The Iranian lawsuit was filed Monday and asked the International Court of Justice, which is based in The Hague, to order the United States to \u201cterminate the 8 May sanctions without delay.\u201dThe lawsuit also demanded that the United States compensate Iran for financial damage already done by the reimposed sanctions. An amount was not specified.The State Department said in a statement that it was aware of Iran\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cIran\u2019s application is baseless, and we intend to vigorously defend the United States before the I.C.J.,\u201d the department said.It was not immediately clear why Iran chose to invoke the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights between Iran and the United States, signed in Tehran in 1955, as the basis for such a lawsuit. The Iranians did not cite that treaty in attempts to stop the nuclear sanctions when they were first imposed.A date for a hearing on Iran\u2019s complaint was not announced by the court. Although the court\u2019s decisions are binding, it has no power to enforce them.But experts who specialize in sanctions-related laws said the merits of the Iranian lawsuit might be weak, partly because of what they called Iran\u2019s own transgressions of the 1955 treaty.In reimposing the sanctions, the Trump administration has warned other countries that they risk American penalties if they continue to do business with Iran, including purchases of oil, Iran\u2019s most important export.The administration has rejected pleas for exceptions from the reimposed sanctions sought by major international companies. Multibillion-dollar deals envisioned with Western firms have been abandoned or delayed.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, whose support for the nuclear agreement was his signature campaign issue, said on Saturday that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the accord and reimpose sanctions had left the United States more isolated.But fears of the economic impact already have done major damage in Iran. The value of Iran\u2019s currency has plummeted over the past few months, and economic protests have increased, including by merchants in Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Trump Officials Clash Over Plan to Let Cars Pollute More", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior administration officials are clashing over President Trump\u2019s plan to roll back a major environmental rule and let cars emit more tailpipe pollution, according to 11 people familiar with the confrontation, in a dispute over whether the proposal can withstand legal challenge.The rollback, one of the most consequential proposals of the Trump administration, not only would permit more planet-warming pollution from cars, it would also challenge the right of California and other states to set their own, more restrictive state-level pollution standards.On the other side are top officials at the Transportation Department, Jeffrey A. Rosen and Heidi King, two of the proposal\u2019s chief authors.Mr. Rosen, a former George W. Bush administration official known for his zeal to undo federal regulations, is pushing the controversial proposal on the expectation that by the time any challenge makes it to the Supreme Court, the court\u2019s makeup will be more friendly to a conservative, anti-regulatory policy, according to individuals familiar with his thinking.Mr. Rosen and Ms. King have also justified their proposal with a new analysis concluding that the stricter Obama-era pollution rules would lead to thousands of deaths in road accidents. They argue that more fuel-efficient cars are less safe because they are lighter.The plan\u2019s official release has been delayed by what one person familiar with the talks called \u201ca nuclear war\u201d between Mr. Wheeler on one side and Mr. Rosen and Ms. King on the other. Mr. Wheeler has sharply questioned the auto fatality numbers and fears that if they are proven faulty, that will undermine the legal case for the rollback, according to people familiar with his argument.This report is based on interviews with five people who are either former employees of the two agencies or former Trump administration officials, as well as six industry lobbyists and others close to the negotiations.For now, the White House is siding with Mr. Rosen. Mr. Trump is expected to announce the proposal next week.California has a waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act to set its own air pollution regulations, and a dozen other states follow its lead. If the Trump administration loosens federal pollution rules, California has vowed to stick with its own stricter standards and to sue the administration.That fight could, in effect, split the American car market in two and would set up a huge legal battle that is likely to reach the Supreme Court.While the 11 people familiar with the talks described a bitter feud between Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Rosen over how to proceed, Mr. Wheeler described the negotiations between the agencies as \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\u201cThis assertion of a \u2018nuclear war\u2019 is categorically false,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur efforts with DOT have been reflective of a robust and constructive interagency process that the American people expect \u2014 and deserve \u2014 when agencies are proposing rules of such consequence.\u201dA Transportation Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said the staffers \u201chave worked amicably\u201d on a proposal \u201cthat will aim to save lives, preserve consumer choice and improve the economy.\u201dUnder the Obama-era rules, automakers would be required to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles by 2025, achieving an average of about 54 miles per gallon, thus lowering oil consumption and greenhouse-gas pollution and representing the largest-ever move by the United States to combat global warming.The Trump proposal contends that those rules are too costly and would lead to the production of lighter cars more likely to result in deadly accidents. The Trump proposal, according to people who have seen it, lays out several options for weakening the standard.The Trump administration identifies as its \u201cpreferred option\u201d one that would most dramatically weaken the rule: It would allow mileage standards to rise on the schedule laid out in the Obama rule until 2020, at which point the standard would freeze at roughly 35 miles per gallon. The proposal would also challenge the authority of California and other states to set their own, tougher standards.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt, when he led the E.P.A., appeared to relish the prospect of a legal fight with California. Mr. Pruitt, who campaigned against government regulations, was prepared to sign off on the proposal despite the concerns of his staff about its legal vulnerability, according to people familiar with the negotiations.But since Mr. Wheeler, who was Mr. Pruitt\u2019s deputy, stepped in as the acting head of the E.P.A., he has raised concerns about the legality of the proposal as it is written, according to at least four people familiar with the matter. Privately, some auto executives have also asked Mr. Trump not to pursue such an aggressive rollback of regulations, fearing that it could lead to years of regulatory uncertainty.Three people close to Mr. Wheeler said he wanted to avoid rolling out a major policy that could be legally vulnerable. But Mr. Rosen, the deputy secretary of the Transportation Department, is confident that the proposal will stand up to legal challenge in part because of the changing makeup of the Supreme Court, according to a half-dozen people familiar with his thinking.Mr. Rosen, a lawyer whose former clients have included General Motors and Hyundai, served as general counsel for the Transportation Department during the Bush administration, where he was known as an opponent of efforts to combat climate change and regulate auto pollution. People familiar with Mr. Rosen\u2019s thinking say he now sees an opportunity to strip away regulations that he has fought for years.\u201cThe thinking is, whatever they do to relax the standards, California will sue. So why not go for the whole thing?\u201d said Myron Ebell, who led the Trump administration\u2019s E.P.A. transition team.However, Ms. Freeman noted that previous efforts to pre-empt such state-level authority have failed, a fact that also concerns Mr. Wheeler, according to people familiar with his thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a state-level waiver being revoked, and it\u2019s not clear how that would work,\u201d Ms. Freeman said.Along with Mr. Rosen, Ms. King, the deputy administrator of the Transportation Department\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, backs an analysis showing that the Trump proposal would save lives in car accidents. Her analysis shows that the Obama rules would lead to as many as 12,000 more traffic fatalities.By contrast, the Obama administration\u2019s analysis of the same rules concluded that, over the lifetime of the regulations, there would actually be 107 fewer auto fatalities than if the rules had not been implemented.\u201cEvery analysis that we did \u2014 and we spent millions on doing these complex analyses \u2014 showed that, if anything, there could be an improvement in safety in more fuel-efficient vehicles,\u201d said Chet France, a former E.P.A. staffer who worked on the Obama analysis.Advertisement"}

She had never seen a world map. She nearly starved. After she underwent appendix surgery without anesthesia at age 13, Ms. Park recalled, she saw human bodies piled outside the hospital, their eyes eaten by rats.Convinced she would die in North Korea, Ms. Park said, she and her mother fled to China, where human traffickers sold her for $200. Two years later, after escaping by walking across the Gobi Desert into Mongolia, Ms. Park found refuge in South Korea. She has no idea what happened to her North Korean relatives, Ms. Park said.\u201cThe scariest thing for me that night crossing the desert,\u201d she said, \u201cwas being forgotten. No one knows that I existed in this world.\u201dMs. Park, 24, now a student at Columbia University in New York, recalled her ordeal Thursday at a news conference held at the United Nations to publicize a new survey about modern slavery \u2014 a broad term used by rights activists that includes forced labor, forced marriage and sexual exploitation..The 2018 edition of the index estimates that more than 40 million people around the world are trapped in modern slavery \u2014 including what Walk Free called a surprisingly high number in developed nations like the United States, France, Germany and others.\u201cGiven these are also the countries taking the most action to respond to modern slavery, this does not mean these initiatives are in vain,\u201d the survey said. \u201cIt does, however, underscore that even in countries with seemingly strong laws and systems, there are critical gaps in protections for groups such as irregular migrants, the homeless, workers in the shadow or gig economy, and certain minorities.\u201dIn the United States, more than 400,000 people, or one in 800, are living in modern slavery, the report said. The United States is also the largest importer of what the report called \u201cat-risk\u201d products, or those at least partly manufactured by workers engaged in forced labor.These products, estimated to be worth at least $354 billion, include mobile phones, computers, clothing and food like fish and cocoa, the report said.

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Economy Is So Hot That It May Face a Meltdown", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe project is expected to cost nearly $12 billion and carve six runways across a swath of land as big as Manhattan. When completed in a decade, the complex is supposed to transport some 200 million people a year, dwarfing all rivals as the busiest airport on the planet.But the airport has also become a symbol of a less savory aspect of Turkey\u2019s modern-day incarnation: its reckless disregard for arithmetic and the independence of critical government institutions. Together, they have placed the nation at growing risk of sliding into a financial crisis.In a conspicuous sign of unease among global investors, the value of Turkey\u2019s currency, the lira, has plunged by roughly one-fifth this year, raising prices for households and businesses alike. It dropped some more on Monday, as Mr. Erdogan handed the job of economic chief to his son-in-law, in what markets construed as a sign that he does not intend to adopt a more responsible mode of stewardship anytime soon.The airport \u2014 its first phase is to open in October \u2014 has been brought to life with heaps of public money delivered to construction companies closely tied to Mr. Erdogan. The government has bestowed upon them guarantees against any losses. If, as many economists expect, the airport proves grander than the flow of passengers, the public will wind up with the bill.To villagers who have been shoved off their land to make way for the new airport, the project has become a monument to their worst fears. \u201cErdogan is watching out for his own people,\u201d said Bora Dayilar, a farmer whose grazing land was subsumed by the project. \u201cWe are left with nothing.\u201dFears of disaster may seem out of place in an economy that remains one of the fastest growing on earth, expanding by 7.4 percent last year. But that growth has been fed by potentially unsustainable borrowing, both public and private.The government has been subsidizing vast infrastructure projects like the airport and a $13 billion, 28-mile-long canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. And many businesses have borrowed in foreign currencies, which means their debt burdens have risen as the lira surrenders value.Major Turkish companies are now trying to persuade banks and other creditors to extend relief, perhaps portending a wave of bankruptcies that could leave financial institutions and taxpayers staring at untold losses. As of the end of April, Turkish private sector companies owed more than $245 billion in foreign debt, or nearly one-third the size of the country\u2019s overall economy.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge number,\u201d said Selva Demiralp, an economist who previously worked at the Federal Reserve bank in Washington and now teaches at Koc University in Istanbul. \u201cAnd the government is encouraging them to borrow more.\u201dStaying current on that debt requires that foreign investors continue to entrust funds to Turkey \u2014 an increasingly questionable proposition.Turkey can court money by continuing to lift interest rates, already at 17.75 percent. But that would depress economic growth and end the festivities for the real estate and construction industries.Or Turkey can continue the growth party while watching inflation mount as the lira sinks further. That may condemn crucial corporations to insolvency, and perhaps force the government to seek a rescue from the International Monetary Fund, a course that would surely entail painful spending cuts.\u201cTurkey could be the next country to disintegrate,\u201d said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. \u201cIt has all the ingredients of the beginning of a failed state.\u201dSome of Turkey\u2019s problems reflect the troubles assailing emerging markets in general.But Turkey stands out as a uniquely vulnerable economy given its unorthodox financial stewardship.Mr. Erdogan has claimed that inflation is actually the result of high interest rates, which is not unlike asserting that chemotherapy causes cancer. Before the elections, he threatened to assume control of Turkey\u2019s central bank and to abolish high rates. Investors took that as further impetus to flee, pushing the lira down to record lows.The central bank halted the rout by lifting rates yet again. By then, though, its integrity had been severely damaged.\u201cEveryone is in crisis right now,\u201d said Can Oz, owner of a book and magazine publishing house in Istanbul, Can Publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s all around us. Everyone who has the slightest intellect and knowledge of the economy knows this. But the government is hiding it.\u201dCan Publishing\u2019s profits have dropped as the fall in the lira has forced the company to pay more for paper from Finland and glue from Germany. \u201cOur margins have been cut dramatically,\u201d Mr. Oz said.Inside Istanbul\u2019s Grand Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops selling jewelry, carpets and antiques, merchants complain that they must pay rent in dollars or euros even as they collect lira for their sales. Their rent is effectively going up while sales decline, in part because of a severe dip in tourism after a spate of terrorist attacks.\u201cThe Turkish lira is like ice in hot weather,\u201d said Zeki Uckardes, who sells cashmere, pashmina and silk scarves from a stall inside the bazaar. \u201cThe second you take it out, it starts to melt.\u201dThe most vulnerable companies are those that have borrowed in foreign currencies.Four years ago, Makro, a national chain of supermarkets, decided to pursue an aggressive expansion. It borrowed 200 million lira (then worth about $88 million) from seven Turkish banks, agreeing to interest rates of about 18 percent. In a bid to limit its debt burden, it borrowed an additional $12 million in the American currency, taking advantage of dollar loans at only 5 percent interest.The company began opening new stores and hiring more workers. But by the middle of 2017, the lira had lost more than one-third its value and Turkish interest rates were climbing. The company\u2019s monthly debt payments had risen by almost 50 percent, to 6 million lira. At the same time, Makro\u2019s revenue plunged as discount grocery chains entered the market.With its debt payments on track to spike this year to nearly 9 million lira per month, Makro filed for a court-supervised debt restructuring. It recently emerged with an agreement that has it paying off its bank debts by selling real estate assets, while gaining debt forgiveness from suppliers.How business will fare may depend on what they learned the last time Turkey faced such challenges.In 2001, when Turkey absorbed a crisis so severe that it sought help from the International Monetary Fund, Vural Ak nearly lost his company, Intercity, which supplies leased cars. In those days, Mr. Ak, Intercity\u2019s founder and chief executive, paid for European cars in European currencies, while collecting his revenues in lira. When the lira plunged, he was nearly wiped out.The lesson stuck. In recent years, as Mr. Ak has expanded Intercity into a company with a fleet of 50,000 vehicles, he has insisted on pricing his leases in euros to match the loans he takes out to buy new models.His competitors have borrowed in dollars and euros, too, but take in lira. Many have come knocking, he said, in hopes that he will buy them and spare them from their unavoidable fate: liquidation.In an office the size of an airport lounge, the floor-to-ceiling windows lined with toy trucks, Mr. Ak exuded the satisfaction of someone seemingly inoculated against the chaos around him.Still, his company is not unscathed. Some 60 percent of his revenue comes from selling used cars after leases are complete. With inflation rampant and anxiety pervasive, Mr. Ak must discount the vehicles to find buyers. Last year, Intercity lost money.In Yenikoy, a village near the new airport, the sense of crisis has been building since Mr. Erdogan unleashed the project, chasing the dream of turning the city into a global air hub to rival London and Dubai.It is not madness: Istanbul is a city of 15 million people at the crossroads of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Its primary airport, Ataturk, can barely accommodate its current teeming masses.Earth movers now tear at the pale soil alongside the Black Sea, constructing the bigger airport. Mr. Dayilar and the other villagers of Yenikoy sit in the way.Mr. Dayilar\u2019s grandfather farmed this land. So did his father, and so has he, growing peas, watermelons and tomatoes, before shifting in recent years to raising cows.To build the airport, the state appropriated their pasture, paying them modest compensation.On a recent afternoon, Mr. Dayilar, 32, sat waiting for a truck that would take away his last 28 cows. He had sold them to a trader.Inflation has ravaged his livelihood. The village markets have raised prices for food. Hay, imported from Romania and Bulgaria, is 50 percent more expensive than it was a few months ago. Barley has skyrocketed in price, as has the cost of fuel for his tractor.\u201cI can\u2019t make any money,\u201d Mr. Dayilar said. \u201cThe costs are very high. Farming is dead.\u201dHe has no income, leaving him worried about how to support his wife and 2-year-old son.He applied for a security job at the new airport, but was turned down for not having completed middle school. He applied for a cleaning job but had heard nothing.\u201cGod help us,\u201d Mr. Dayilar said. \u201cI\u2019m unemployed. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "High-Skilled White-Collar Work? Machines Can Do That, Too", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the best-selling T-shirts for the Indian e-commerce site Myntra is an olive, blue and yellow colorblocked design. It was conceived not by a human but by a computer algorithm \u2014 or rather two algorithms.The first algorithm generated random images that it tried to pass off as clothing. The second had to distinguish between those images and clothes in Myntra\u2019s inventory. Through a long game of one-upmanship, the first algorithm got better at producing images that resembled clothing, and the second got better at determining whether they were like \u2014 but not identical to \u2014 actual products.This back and forth, an example of artificial intelligence at work, created designs whose sales are now \u201cgrowing at 100 percent,\u201d said Ananth Narayanan, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201dClothing design is only the leading edge of the way algorithms are transforming the fashion and retail industries. Companies now routinely use artificial intelligence to decide which clothes to stock and what to recommend to customers.The fashion industry illustrates how machines can intrude even on workers known more for their creativity than for cold empirical judgments. Among those directly affected will be the buyers and merchandise planners who decide which dresses, tops and pants should populate their stores\u2019 inventory.A key part of a buyer\u2019s job is to anticipate what customers will want using a well-honed sense of where fashion trends are headed. \u201cBased on the fact that you sold 500 pairs of platform shoes last month, maybe you could sell 1,000 next month,\u201d said Kristina Shiroka, who spent several years as a buyer for the Outnet, an online retailer. \u201cBut people might be over it by then, so you cut the buy.\u201dMerchandise planners then use the buyer\u2019s input to figure out what mix of clothing \u2014 say, how many sandals, pumps and flats \u2014 will help the company reach its sales goals.In the small but growing precincts of the industry where high-powered algorithms roam free, however, it is the machine \u2014 and not the buyer\u2019s gut \u2014 that often anticipates what customers will want.That\u2019s the case at Stitch Fix, an online styling service that sends customers boxes of clothing whose contents they can keep or return, and maintains detailed profiles of customers to personalize their shipments.Stitch Fix relies heavily on algorithms to guide its buying decisions \u2014 in fact, its business probably could not exist without them. Those algorithms project how many clients will be in a given situation, or \u201cstate,\u201d several months into the future (like expanding their wardrobe after, say, starting a new job), and what volume of clothes people tend to buy in each situation. The algorithms also know which styles people with different profiles tend to favor \u2014 say, a petite nurse with children who lives in Texas.Myntra, the Indian online retailer, arms its buyers with algorithms that calculate the probability that an item will sell well based on how clothes with similar attributes \u2014 sleeves, colors, fabric \u2014 have sold in the past. (The buyers are free to ignore the projection.)All of this has clouded the future of buyers and merchandise planners, high-status workers whose annual earnings can exceed $100,000.At more conventional retailers, a team of buyers and support workers is assigned to each type of clothing (like designer, contemporary or casual) or each apparel category, like dresses or tops. Some retailers have separate teams for knit tops and woven tops. A parallel merchandise-planning group could employ nearly as many people.Buyers say this specialization helps them intuitively understand trends in styles and colors. \u201cYou\u2019re so immersed in it, you almost get a feeling,\u201d said Helena Levin, a longtime buyer at retailers like Charlotte Russe and ModCloth.Ms. Levin cited mint-green dresses, a top seller earlier this decade. \u201cOne day it just died,\u201d she said. \u201cIt stopped. \u2018O.K., everything mint, get out.\u2019 Right after, it looked old. You could feel it.\u201dBut retailers adept at using algorithms and big data tend to employ fewer buyers and assign each a wider range of categories, partly because they rely less on intuition.At Le Tote, an online rental and retail service for women\u2019s clothing that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business each year, a six-person team handles buying for all branded apparel \u2014 dresses, tops, pants, jackets.Brett Northart, a co-founder, said the company\u2019s algorithms could identify what to add to its stock based on how many customers placed the items on their digital wish lists, along with factors like online ratings and recent purchases.Bombfell, a box service similar to Stitch Fix catering only to men, relies on a single employee, Nathan Cates, to buy all of its tops and accessories.The company has built algorithmic tools and a vast repository of data to help Mr. Cates, who said he could more accurately project demand for clothing than a buyer at a traditional operation.\u201cWe know exactly who our customers are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know exactly where they live, what their jobs are, what their sizing is.\u201dFor now, at least, only a human can do parts of his job. Mr. Cates is obsessive about touching the fabric before purchasing an item and almost always tries it on first.\u201cIf this is a light color, are we going to see your nipples?\u201d he explained. (The verdict on a mint T-shirt he donned at the company\u2019s headquarters in New York? \u201cA little nipply.\u201d)There are other checks on automation. Negotiations with suppliers typically require a human touch. Even if an algorithm can help buyers make decisions more quickly and accurately, there are limits to the number of supplier relationships they can juggle.There is at least one area of the industry where the machines are creating jobs rather than eliminating them, however. Bombfell, Stitch Fix and many competitors in the box-fashion niche employ a growing army of human stylists who receive recommendations from algorithms about clothes that might work for a customer, but decide for themselves what to send.\u201cIf they\u2019re not overly enthusiastic upfront when I ask how do you feel about it, I\u2019m making a note of it,\u201d said Jade Carmosino, a sales manager and stylist at Trunk Club, a Stitch Fix competitor owned by Nordstrom.In this, stylists appear to reflect a broader trend in industries where artificial intelligence is automating white-collar jobs: the hiring of more humans to stand between machines and customers.The downside is that work as a stylist or financial adviser will probably pay less than the lost jobs of buyers and stock pickers. The good news, said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who studies automation, is that these jobs may still pay substantially more than many positions available to low- and middle-skilled workers in recent decades.And these jobs may be hard to automate in the end.\u201cIf I\u2019m the customer explaining what I want, humans need to be involved,\u201d Mr. Khatua said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know what I really want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Twenty-three other people are missing.The second boat, the Serenita, sank Thursday off Koh Mai Thon, a small resort island off the coast of Phuket. There were 42 people aboard, all of whom were rescued, officials said.The boats had gone out to sea despite a severe weather warning.Somjing Boontham, who said he was the captain of the Phoenix, said he had urged passengers to put on life jackets while crew members frantically lowered lifeboats as huge waves slammed and tilted the boat. Pictures from the scene showed lifeboats carrying up to 20 people, some of them children.Wang Xudong, who is with a private search-and-rescue group from China, had been assisting at the cave, but on Friday he was preparing to search for his countrymen lost at sea instead.\u201cI never expected to be here in Phuket for something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had good news at the cave, and I hope we can have some good news in Phuket, too.

Its price must each day rise or fall within a strict range set by the central bank. That range has been steadily lowered.The recent slide, which took the renminbi back to last year\u2019s levels, began as the trade-war talk was heating up.While a weakening currency can soften economic blows, it also comes with costs.But for China, letting the renminbi slide may have advantages over other responses to American tariffs. Since China exports far more to the United States than it imports, it cannot respond with tariffs on anywhere near the same amount of American products.Devaluations carry a legion of risks, though.And a big slide could hurt China.Individuals and companies in China dumped renminbi and bought other currencies, to protect their wealth against further decreases in the value of the Chinese currency. The selling, known as capital flight, suggested that the Chinese had little faith in their own economy, and raised questions about the Chinese central bank\u2019s handling of the devaluation. The other big fear at the time was that the prices of Chinese goods in other countries would fall, forcing producers there to also cut their prices and hurt the wider economy in the process.\u201cCarrying out a controlled depreciation is one of the most difficult maneuvers a central bank can pull off,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cChina, through using capital controls and its reserves, could pull it off again, but there is a risk that a weaker currency is taken as evidence that China can\u2019t assure financial stability.\u201dAnd the factors that perhaps slowed the selling of the renminbi no longer exist. Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, noted that the dollar weakened substantially in 2017, which, he said, helped stabilize the value of the renminbi.\u201cIf the dollar picks up again, it is an open question how well capital account restrictions will work to stem the potential capital flight,\u201d Mr. Brooks wrote in an email.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mining Tycoon, Once Brazil\u2019s Richest Man, Is Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Eike Batista, an oil and mining tycoon who just years ago was on a quest to use his vast fortune to turbocharge Brazil\u2019s growth, was sentenced to 30 years in prison this week on charges of paying more than $16.5 million in bribes.Federal Judge Marcelo Bretas, who is based in Rio de Janeiro, found that Mr. Batista had bribed S\u00e9rgio Cabral, the Rio de Janeiro governor, to secure public contracts.Judge Bretas sentenced Mr. Cabral, who has been convicted in several other corruption cases, to 22 years in prison, pushing his total prison sentence to more than 120 years.In a 119-page order explaining the Batista sentence \u2014 which was signed on Monday and made public on Tuesday \u2014 Judge Bretas said Mr. Batista\u2019s public stature made his crimes all the more egregious.Mr. Batista was \u201ca businessman who was known outside, and exactly because of it, his criminal practices had the potential to contaminate the business environment and the reputation of Brazilian businessmen,\u201d the judge wrote. The crimes, he added, created \u201cdeep scars in the trust of investors and entrepreneurs who, until recently, saw Brazil as a good investment option.\u201dFernando Martins, Mr. Batista\u2019s lawyer, said in a text message that he expected his client would remain free while the conviction was appealed. People convicted of white-collar crimes in Brazil are often allowed to remain free until their conviction and sentence have been reviewed by an appeals court.Mr. Batista got his start in business mining for gold in the Amazon when he was in his 20s. As his wealth multiplied, he became the rare, unabashedly ambitious and ostentatious billionaire in South America, where rich families tend to keep a lower profile.At the time, Mr. Batista, who ran EBX Corporation, told investors that Brazil had exponential growth potential and billed himself as the best vehicle for those who wanted to cash in.\u201cMy racehorse is Brazil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Brazil today has the wealth that America had at the turn of the century.\u201dDuring the peak of his influence, Mr. Batista portrayed himself as a philanthropic executive committed to improving his home city, Rio de Janeiro. He donated cars for the local police force, invested in the renovation of a famous hotel and set out to clean up a lake that was seen as a central site for the 2016 Olympic Games.He vowed publicly to overtake Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim as the world\u2019s richest man by 2015, but his empire began to crumble well before that.Mr. Batista\u2019s oil company filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after his oil fields were producing a fraction of what he had committed, prompting investors to withdraw from several of his ventures.His fortune declined as Brazil\u2019s economy entered into a recession in 2014 and federal investigators began exposing a vast web of kickback schemes that crippled several of the country\u2019s top companies.Mr. Batista was held in an ordinary prison for three months while awaiting trial, but the Supreme Court ruled that he could remain free while the case moved forward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Sudan Forces Killed and Raped Hundreds in Brutal Campaign, U.N. Says", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 One day after the South Sudanese opposition rejected a peace deal in the country\u2019s yearslong civil war, United Nations officials on Tuesday outlined a campaign of brutal killings and rapes carried out by government forces and their allies this spring.At least 232 civilians were killed, and the forces gang-raped at least 120 women and girls, including children as young as 4, according to the report, which was produced by the United Nations mission in South Sudan and the human rights office in Geneva. At least 132 women and girls were abducted, forced to carry loot to the soldiers\u2019 base and kept as sex slaves or porters, according to the report.The attacks underscored the horrific toll on civilians in the civil war that erupted in 2013 between South Sudan\u2019s Dinka ethnic majority, led by President Salva Kiir, and the ethnic Nuer aligned with his former vice president, Riek Machar, just two years after the country gained independence from Sudan.Tens of thousands have died in the nearly five-year conflict, around two and a half million have fled to neighboring countries, and millions more have been left fending off starvation in South Sudan\u2019s devastated economy.As the latest agreement crumbled, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, insisted that \u201cthe perpetrators of these revolting acts\u201d in the springtime offensive \u2014 including those issuing the orders \u2014 \u201cmust not be allowed to get away with it.\u201dInvestigators described how groups of 100 or 200 soldiers and youth militia fighters attacked villages before dawn in operations between April 16 and May 24. Witnesses said that many who were unable to flee \u2014 including sick, older and disabled people, and children \u2014 were burned alive in their homes or had their throats slit, according to the investigators. Women who resisted rape were shot, and villagers who did not comply with demands to hand over money were dragged away and hanged from trees, the United Nations said.The death toll was probably higher than the number reported, investigators said. It was not known how many people were killed in shelling of the swamps and river islands where villagers sought refuge, but at least 10 children drowned as they fled into the swamps.\u201cHow can I forget the sight of an old man whose throat was slit before being set on fire?\u201d a 14-year-old girl from the area told United Nations investigators. \u201cHow can I forget the smell of those decomposed bodies of old men and children pecked and eaten by the birds, those women that were hanged and died up in the tree?\u201dThe attackers\u2019 ruthlessness suggested a \u201cscorched-earth approach\u201d intended to ensure that civilians never returned to the opposition-controlled areas, Ravina Shamdasani, a United Nations human rights spokeswoman in Geneva, told reporters.The United Nations also identified three commanders who may bear the greatest responsibility for the reported atrocities, Ms. Shamdasani said.The African Union and South Sudan\u2019s government have drawn up plans for a court with international judges to prosecute the worst crimes of the conflict, but have yet to reach an agreement to put it into operation.Mr. al-Hussein, the United Nations human rights chief, urged them to move quickly to establish it. \u201cThe government of South Sudan and the international community have the obligation to ensure justice,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Moment, Underdog Croatia Basks in World Cup Joy", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBROVNIK, Croatia \u2014 When Croatia\u2019s national soccer team scored the goal that took it past England and into its first World Cup final, delirious fans lit flares and burned tires outside the towering limestone walls of the old city in Dubrovnik.The euphoria of the moment lifted the spirits of a nation disillusioned on a number of fronts, like the slow transition into the European Union, a stagnant economy, political deadlock and even the source of its current joy \u2014 soccer.\u201cAt this moment, no one is thinking about problems,\u201d said Maroje Burum, a fan. \u201cMan, it\u2019s almost spiritual.\u201dWhen the World Cup began a month ago, some Croats initially hesitated to cheer the national team because it has been marred by a corruption scandal and exploited as a symbol of nationalism by the country\u2019s right-wing politicians.As the 2018 World Cup approached, all of the country\u2019s ills seemed to be encapsulated by Croatian soccer.A court case had exposed endemic corruption involving Croatian soccer\u2019s most influential figure \u2014 Zdravko Mamic, the former president of one of the country\u2019s most prominent teams, Dinamo Zagreb. He was convicted on tax offenses for skimming huge profits off the transfer fees for Croatia\u2019s top players who joined some of the top soccer clubs in Europe, before he fled to neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he is in hiding.When Luka Modric, arguably Croatia\u2019s greatest player ever, took the stand during the trial, he claimed to know nothing about it. He was widely mocked and murals of him were defaced across the country.In May, he was charged with perjury and could face five years in prison. The case turned some Croatians against Mr. Modric and tainted the national team.But as the team advanced in the World Cup, the court case faded into the background. Mr. Modric, who was allowed to play because he has not yet been convicted, has been one of the top performers at this year\u2019s tournament, and his damaged reputation in the country has been largely rehabilitated.\u201cModric is the best player Croatia ever had,\u201d said Mr. Burum. \u201cThe trial will do its job, but most of the people love him. He is a true captain right now.\u201dSoccer in Croatia is so deeply intertwined in the culture, the politics and the war that ravaged the country in the 1990s that the game can be used as a marker for some of the most important moments in recent Croatian history.In 1990, Yugoslavia was unraveling and the ethnic tensions between the country\u2019s Croats and Serbs, which the state had kept tamped down, were on full display during a match of rival clubs Red Star Belgrade and Dinamo Zagreb. Before the first whistle, rioting broke out at the stadium in Zagreb.While the match has often been erroneously cited as the first battle of the Croatian war of independence, Mr. Lalic said it did play an important psychological role.\u201cYugoslavia stopped existing when the Dinamo-Red Star riot took place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t play football anymore and be in the same terraces anymore, it was impossible to live together anymore.\u201dBy the time the war ended, 20,000 Croats were dead.In the postwar era, politicians in Croatia, like many around the world, have sought to exploit the success of sports teams and athletes by taking pictures with them, including on their campaigns, quoting them in their speeches and trying to convert their sport successes into political victories.The national soccer team has been used by politicians as a way to rally voters by posing as nationalist, Croatia-first proponents, even as they cut deals with the same minority parties they rail against.\u201cFootball victories shape a nation\u2019s identity as much as wars do,\u201d he once famously proclaimed.His theory was put to the test at the 1998 World Cup in France, the first time Croatia, wearing the now iconic red-and-white checkered shirt, had qualified for the tournament. Now, that jersey is everywhere, with tourists snapping it up alongside Croats. It adorns cars, balconies and even donkeys.After the 1998 tournament, the glow eventually faded and soon Croatia was faced with confronting the growing pains that any new state faces. For the next decade, it had one goal in mind: membership in the European Union.Since it joined the bloc in 2013, like many of the new member states in East and Central Europe, membership has not brought the economic growth many expected, especially outside the cities and tourist destinations.Anton Masle, one of the nation\u2019s leading journalists and now the editor-in-chief of a local paper in Dubrovnik, said the nation was buffeted by many of the same problems plaguing other European Union countries.But as a small nation, it was different.\u201cYou know what Italians say when you ask them about their financial situation and the chance of bankruptcy: We are too big to fail,\u201d he said over a glass of wine on the cobblestone street outside Libertina, a famous redoubt for Dubrovnik\u2019s artists and writers. \u201cYou know what Croatians say? We are too small to fail.\u201dWhen you are small, you have to punch above your weight to be felt. And in this country of less than 4 million people, sports have long played an outsized role in the nation\u2019s psyche, none more than soccer.But success in sports has not masked other problems, as reflected in the exodus of educated, young people. In 1998, the population here was about 4.6 million. Now it is now less the 4 million.The ruling party holds a fragile majority that needs the support of minority parties, making it exceedingly difficult to govern.\u201cMany younger Croatians faced with unemployment and low salaries are questioning the current political and administrative practices and seeking a better fortune in other European countries,\u201d said Aida Vidan, a Croatian-born scholar of South Slavic languages, literature and film at Harvard University.And the sluggish economy was shaken 17 months ago when Agrokor, a Croatia food and retail concern that had employed 70,000 people and relied on supplies of goods from 240,000 more from across the Balkans, nearly collapsed under huge debts.As the government committee in charge of the Agrokor bailout negotiated with creditors, the health care system was failing and pension funding was running out.The victories for Croatia have not come easily, but that has only made its soccer run that much more powerful. And the cheers across the country have been for more than the soccer itself.\u201cIt\u2019s a convenient escape from reality, of course, and a good dose of optimism for all,\u201d said Boris Vlasic, a newspaper columnist at Jutarnji List in Zagreb.Whatever the final result, Mr. Vlasic said, hard realities can wait.There is a match to be played.Marc Santora reported from Dubrovnik, Barbara Surk from Rijeka, Croatia, and James Montague from Zagreb, Croatia.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia as a competitor after having dismissed Europe as an economic \u201cfoe.\u201d A few thousand miles away, in Beijing, the leaders of the European Union and China held a long-scheduled meeting of their own.In the past, expectations for such meetings were low, given the conflicts on trade and human rights between the Europeans and the Chinese. But while those differences remain, this summit meeting produced an unusual joint declaration and a common commitment to keep the global system strong.The next day, the Europeans traveled to Japan and signed the biggest free-trade agreement in history, just the sort of deal the Trump administration has criticized.Both France and Germany have started study groups on how to deal with the United States under Mr. Trump and how to find areas of leverage, especially on trade. The European Union is preparing whopping tariffs to counter Mr. Trump if he imposes \u201cnational security\u201d tariffs on cars, a big issue for Germany.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, goes to Washington on July 25 to discuss the budding trade war.\u201cThe one thing you could say in Trump\u2019s favor is, he\u2019s brought the world together on trade,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia.\u201cIt\u2019s Trump versus the world,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than all the other countries getting into trade disputes with each other, what\u2019s happening is there is a surprising amount of cooperation and comity.\u201dThere are caveats, of course. The United States remains the world\u2019s leading economic and military power, and the Europeans in particular hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s successor will eventually return to embrace the global system. Europe still harbors considerable ambivalence about getting too close to China, which talks more about open trade than it actually practices.So for now, the Europeans and others are making contingency plans. More than that, the language of pushback against Washington is strong and striking.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the Europeans that both sides should \u201cjoin hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based free-trade system,\u201d echoing comments he made at Davos in January 2017, before Mr. Trump started imposing tariffs.The European Council president, Donald Tusk, said that \u201cit is the common duty of Europe and China, but also America and Russia, not to destroy this order but to improve it.\u201d That duty is not simply to shun trade wars, he said, \u201cbut to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\u201dMr. Tusk added: \u201cThere is still time to prevent conflict and chaos.\u201dBut the absence of American participation has for now set off a scramble for alternative partners.The European Union-Japan trade agreement, for instance, was accelerated last year when Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal President Barack Obama and the Japanese intended as a bulwark against China.The European Union and China are not natural allies on trade. The Europeans, unlike the Trump administration, continue to push China on human rights violations. And in the past two years, in the face of Chinese investment, the Europeans have become much more critical of China\u2019s industrial espionage, its cavalier attitude toward intellectual property and its ambitions to overtake the West in advanced technologies.China has used special summit meetings with European Union members and aspirants, especially those in Central Europe and the Balkans, to push strategic infrastructure investments \u2014 creating obligations and debt that could undermine the bloc\u2019s unity.European businesses have also grown disenchanted with the difficulties of operating in China, particularly rules about data retention and the presence of Communist Party units in workplaces.Still, both the European Union and China have benefited from the rules-based order Mr. Trump has challenged. So, oddly, he has given them reason to bridge their differences. China, in particular, is looking to Europe to help shore up the World Trade Organization so it can fend off a serious trade war with the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats on Chinese exports have alarmed Beijing, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Beijing is making every effort to avoid publicly escalating its trade dispute with America, the council has said, but it is also rediscovering the merits of greater engagement with Europe. Chinese authorities, in particular, have sought to demonstrate to Europe that economic reforms are coming.Simon Fraser, a former top British diplomat now with the management consultancy Flint Global, said that European trade officials remained frustrated with China.\u201cTrump has a point on China trade, and we want to work with the U.S. on this in the W.T.O., but we can\u2019t because Trump is slapping tariffs on us,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is being pushed into a trade war no one wants, and again Trump has a good idea, but is going about it the wrong way.\u201dWith China muting some of the demands of previous summit meetings \u2014 primarily that Europe grant it \u201cmarket economy\u201d status \u2014 the Europeans found more agreement with Beijing than in the past, while carefully keeping a distance.\u201cThe European Union and China found some common ground at their summit, but even with Trump in the White House, the Europeans are mindful of the alliance with the United States of more than 50 years,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, the former head of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cCommon ground was found without changing sides.\u201dThe Europeans and Chinese also agreed to work on a bilateral investment treaty, another European concession.It was a dramatic change from the summit meeting of a year ago, noted Mr. Leonard. \u201cLast year was particularly grotesque,\u201d he said. \u201cXi Jinping told Davos he was a champion of multilateralism and then refused to sign a joint statement with the European Union unless it granted China market economy status. But now that China finds itself under pressure, it is keen to have a common statement.\u201dChina is taking steps to show it is more open to foreign investment, including approving a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany\u2019s BASF that does not require the joint venture structure typical of foreign investment. Ms. Fallon called it a favorable deal \u201csymbolic of the importance to China of Germany,\u201d about which Mr. Trump seems to have a special animus.However unlikely China and the European Union are to form a common front against Washington, both sides showed a willingness to compromise on the communiqu\u00e9 at a time Mr. Trump has waged his attacks.That is also true of the Japan-European Union trade deal, which cuts customs duties on European wine and cheese in exchange for gradually lowered tariffs on Japanese cars.For Japan, the deal represented a clear hedge against Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, but it also gave Europe the kind of access to Japanese agricultural markets that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have granted to the United States if it had joined.For the European Union, a positive summit with China and a clear statement about cooperation to reform the W.T.O. and against unilateralism \u201cis clearly pointed at the United States,\u201d Ms. Fallon said.\u201cThe Europeans want to show that we have other options \u2014 and the trade deal with Japan is another display that we have other options.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Jane Perlez from Beijing. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Carlos Tejada and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The party risks losing control of one or both chambers, and its leaders have made abundantly clear they see no upside to a messy government shutdown in the weeks before voters cast their ballots.\u201cObviously up here, we want to keep the government up and functioning,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where the president is coming from.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest serving Republican in the Senate, chalked the comments up to a negotiating technique \u2014 though perhaps an ill-advised one.\u201cHe knows the game,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to do that again. Nobody wants that.\u201dRepublican leaders in both chambers expect to pass the majority of the 12 appropriations bills necessary to keep the government operating before Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Between those bills and a short-term spending measure to bridge the gap, they believe they can push off any potential fights \u2014 including over border wall funding \u2014 until later in the fall.That, at least, was the plan Republican leaders pitched last week to Mr. Trump at the White House. They left thinking they had reached a mutual understanding.\u201cI was a little surprised that he brought it back up again,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas said. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s really a burr under his saddle.\u201dDemocrats, who have fought against funding for Mr. Trump\u2019s wall at every turn, quickly turned the comments to their advantage, painting Mr. Trump as an erratic and irresponsible negotiator.Another Democrat, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, dismissed the comments as a \u201cred-meat toss.\u201d He said the reactions of Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, who could stand to catch the blame in such a scenario, made clear that Mr. Trump was on his own.\u201cOh, we can\u2019t take him seriously on this,\u201d he said Monday evening. \u201cHis statements on the wall have been unintelligible.\u201dMr. Conte\u2019s visit, coming as those in Mr. Trump\u2019s party grappled with his comments on immigration, appeared to be a welcome one for Mr. Trump. During the visit, Mr. Trump repeatedly emphasized their similarities as populist leaders who rose to victory by promising to crack down on immigration. Mr. Trump praised Mr. Conte\u2019s similarly hard-line stance to tightening his country\u2019s borders, saying at one point that their views on immigration had been a significant factor in both of their election victories.At one point, Mr. Conte was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior at the NATO summit meeting, where the president this month seemed to attack his closest Western allies and strike a conciliatory stance with Russia. As Mr. Trump smiled and listened, the prime minister praised him as someone who brought \u201cfruitful exchanges\u201d to the table with his allies.\u201cHe\u2019s a great negotiator,\u201d Mr. Conte added.As he escorted Mr. Conte away from reporters, cameras and microphones, Mr. Trump ignored multiple shouted questions about Mr. Cohen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Marijuana Goes Mainstream, Investors Rush In", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cannabis industry is growing and, naturally, investors are taking notice.Late last year, the first marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., listed in the United States began trading, making it easier for investors to buy into a swath of companies connected to the industry.While investors are optimistic that companies linked to the marijuana industry will continue to grow, the performance of the Alternative Harvest E.T.F. has been uneven. The E.T.F. hit a high of $39.72 in January, but it has slipped about 25 percent since then. The value of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has barely changed over that same period.But many thematic E.T.F.s invest in stocks that are included in broad-based stock indexes like the S.&.P. 500.\u201cThere are a lot more niche products, but most of the assets are in plain vanilla stock indexes,\u201d said Alex Bryan, who follows E.T.F.s for Morningstar. \u201cYou are making an active bet when you invest in a fund that tracks a subset of that index. Sometimes those bets will pay off, sometimes they won\u2019t. If you\u2019re going to do it, make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201dIn a broad sense, the prospects for the marijuana industry appear to be strong. Growth rates in states like Colorado, which has some of the most permissive laws on marijuana use, have started to slow. But the market nationwide is expected to continue expanding as more states decriminalize marijuana use.Matt Karnes, the founder of GreenWave Advisors, a financial research firm focused on the industry, estimates that legal retail cannabis sales will grow about 35 percent a year, to $35 billion, by 2022, assuming every state legalizes some form of marijuana use.About 70 percent of the companies tracked by the Alternative Harvest fund either focus on the production and sale of medicinal cannabis or are pharmaceutical companies that make cannabis-based products. Some of those companies, like Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis, are growers, while others have licenses to run dispensaries in the United States.Other companies included in the E.T.F. have tangential links to marijuana, like the Altria Group and British American Tobacco, or Scotts Miracle-Gro, the lawn and garden company.The bulk of the companies, though, are small Canadian ventures, which means that investors who buy into the fund are essentially betting on young, riskier companies, only some of which will survive as the market develops.\u201cYou should think about this fund the same way you might think about, say, Chinese internet stocks,\u201d said Dave Nadig, the managing director of ETF.com, a news and analysis website. \u201cThis might be speculative, but it could pay off.\u201dSamuel Masucci, chief executive of the E.T.F. Managers Group, which created the Alternative Harvest fund, said the companies in the fund are poised to grow as the laws regulating the marijuana industry are clarified. Investors, he said, have bought into that concept. E.T.F.s, he said, need about $50 million in assets to break even, a figure the Alternative Harvest raised soon after it was introduced.\u201cThe train left the station on this,\u201d Mr. Masucci said. \u201cI expect the fund to get larger, but a lot will depend on companies coming into the market globally, U.S. regulatory issues and people having a handle on what is going to happen.\u201dThe Alternative Harvest fund began as an E.T.F. focused on real estate in Latin America. Political uncertainty in the region limited the growth of the fund, so Mr. Masucci reconfigured its mission. To do that, he had to notify investors, who had a chance to get their money back. The bulk of them decided to take shares in the Alternative Harvest fund.An earlier version of this article misstated the focus of the Rogers AI Global Macro E.T.F. The fund uses artificial intelligence to spot economic trends. It does not invest in companies investing in artificial intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cement Mixer as Muse", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewBefore 1991, when old enmities savagely resurfaced, these seven countries were part of a single federal republic \u2014 Yugoslavia \u2014 with ethnicities, religions and language groups under a single overarching roof. \u201cToward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980,\u201d an outstanding new exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, brings us back to this vanished Socialist state, whose postwar architecture had all the ambition and invention found in the United States, Brazil, Japan and other centers of building at the time.\u201cToward a Concrete Utopia\u201d is the first major MoMA outing for Martino Stierli, who became the museum\u2019s chief curator of architecture and design in 2015, and who collaborated with the guest curator Vladimir Kulic on both the show and a fine catalog (printed in Slovenia!). Its more than 400 objects, along with specially commissioned films and photographs, cohere into an eloquent array of civic buildings and public monuments, even if in places the show lists a little too far into Yugonostalgia and Socialist chic. Too rarely among architecture shows, it\u2019s also a pleasure to look at, with sketches, blueprints and historical documents, but also newly built models and drone flyover footage of Bosnian mosques and Croatian resorts.The exhibition presents this Skopje building not only with archival plans and drawings, but also with a contemporary model and two large, newly commissioned photographs. They were shot at night by the artist Valentin Jeck, with dramatic lighting accentuating the building\u2019s stained surface and yellowed glass. Mr. Jeck has produced more than three dozen other photographs for the show and its catalog; some have an impressive gravity, such as his stately views of the Pristina library and the sparely elegant White Mosque in Visoko, Bosnia. A few too many, though, fall into Brutalist sentimentality, with graffiti-strewn concrete and ominous cloudy skies that edge into ruin porn.Indeed, for all its brilliance \u201cToward a Concrete Utopia\u201d can get a little rose-colored in places; utopias, after all, don\u2019t really exist. Yugoslavia was the most liberal of Socialist republics, and an easier place to be an independent artist or architect than the Soviet Union, Romania, Albania or even East Germany. In the mid-1960s, Tito dumped the command economy and introduced a market Socialism that birthed affordable household designs, such as the Minirama television, whose rounded edges were clad in orange plastic. A winning montage of \u201960s Yugoslav movies sutures scenes of parties and love affairs in the new towers that arose in cities and at the seaside.But it wasn\u2019t paradise. Tito commanded a fearsome secret police organization. Ethnic, religious, and linguistic tensions never fully disappeared. The books in that glorious Pristina library were censored; so was the work in Belgrade\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, on display as a model here. At MoMA you will see a slide show of mod beach resorts on Croatia\u2019s fashionable coast, by local architects and even by Edward Durell Stone, who designed MoMA\u2019s first building. What you won\u2019t see is the island that housed political prisoners offshore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Strikes Back at Trump\u2019s Tariffs, but Its Consumers Worry", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it has in the past, China used the moment to cast itself as a defender of the global trade order. Beijing officials have portrayed Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods as a threat to global prosperity.\u201cThe wrong actions of the U.S. have brazenly violated the rules of the World Trade Organization, attacked the whole world\u2019s economic sustainability and obstructed the global economy\u2019s recovery,\u201d Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said in a daily news briefing. \u201cIt will bring disaster to multinational corporations, small and medium businesses and normal consumers across the world.\u201dChina\u2019s state-controlled news media echoed the sentiment.But Chinese news outlets have stopped short of language that would suggest appetite for a major escalation, such as a consumer boycott of American brands.Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington.\u201cOf course I want China to fight back,\u201d said Cathy Yuan, 32, who was shopping at an upscale Shanghai supermarket on Friday. \u201cWe are defending our rights as a nation.\u201dOther shoppers sounded warier. Fresh American beef and other high-end imports \u2014 goods that are likely to become more expensive as more tariffs are imposed \u2014 lined the shelves.\u201cHigh-quality fresh food is already quite expensive, and with tariffs, prices will go up even further,\u201d said Wan Yang, a 27-year-old seafood dealer who imports black cod and king crab from Alaska.Health and hygiene concerns have led China\u2019s increasingly well-off shoppers to prefer food imported from the United States or elsewhere.\u201cWe buy imported goods because we feel they are safer to eat,\u201d said Mike Zheng, 30, who was browsing the aisles with his 2-year-old son. \u201cIf there were domestic substitutes, then tariffs would be O.K. But domestic products can\u2019t keep up, so we\u2019ll just have to accept higher prices.\u201dIt may not just be buyers of American steaks who get hurt. Soybeans are the highest-value farm import from the United States that is affected by Friday\u2019s tariffs. American growers supplied one-third of the soy that China shipped in last year, mainly to produce cooking oil and animal feed.\u201cGlobal soybean supply and demand is tightly balanced right now,\u201d said Gong Yanhai, a senior analyst in Shanghai with Huatai Asset Management. Taxing American soy, Mr. Gong said, also means that China will pay more to buy beans from its biggest supplier, Brazil, where premiums per bushel have already risen in anticipation of the tariffs.Around China, the trade war is being watched with a mix of worry, ire at the United States \u2014 and frank curiosity about it all.The trade war could have equally important effects on the $2 trillion worth of goods that the country sells to the rest of the world, said Hua Min, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai. A decade ago, in the wake of the global financial crisis, China\u2019s exports cratered, and consumers and businesses at home could not spend enough to keep factories humming.\u201cThe driving force of the Chinese economy is mainly exports,\u201d Mr. Hua said. \u201cIf there are no exports, there will be manufacturing overcapacity. Manufacturing overcapacity will lead to debt. And debt will affect companies\u2019 balance sheets. Then it will be 2008 all over again.\u201dAt a Tesla dealership in downtown Shanghai on Friday, there was not much love for the idea of paying even more for the premium electric vehicles.\u201cThe trade war won\u2019t last forever,\u201d said Charlie Lin, 25, who works in real estate and was looking at cars. \u201cChina and the U.S. definitely have ways of resolving it. After all, an endless fight would be bad for both countries. These are just temporary measures.\u201dStill, \u201cChina must accept this challenge,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cWe have enough stamina to fight back. We will find out what America is made of.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Hong Kong, Karoline Kan from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Sorry to Bother You,\u2019 but Can I Interest You in a Wild Dystopian Satire?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cStick to the script.\u201d That\u2019s the first rule at the telemarketing firm where Cassius Green, an Oakland striver-slash-stoner, finds a job. Sales reps are supposed to start with \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d which is the title of Boots Riley\u2019s movie about Cassius\u2019s rise, fall and bizarre sideways bounces. Mr. Riley is not sorry at all. If you\u2019re not bothered \u2014 also tickled, irked, mystified and provoked \u2014 then you\u2019ve fallen asleep on the job.The film opens on a note of impish farce, as Cassius (Lakeith Stanfield) shows up for an interview with a counterfeit trophy and a phony employee-of-the-month plaque. He settles into his cubicle with a copy of that must-be-stuck-to script and a list of names and numbers. Mr. Riley adds a touch of loopy surrealism when Cassius pops into the homes of his marks, and drops hints of dystopian satire in the form of advertisements for a company called Worry Free.Worry Free, founded by Steve Lift, a Silicon Valley libertarian tech-bro visionary dirtbag (played by Armie Hammer, perhaps too perfectly for his own good), offers desperate people guaranteed food and shelter in exchange for lifetime servitude. This system of contractual slavery, which combines mass incarceration with the old plantation regime in a context of free consumer choice, doesn\u2019t much worry Cassius, whose upward mobility accelerates at his new job. His existence may be precarious \u2014 he lives in his uncle\u2019s garage and is behind on the rent \u2014 but at least he can work alongside his best friend, Salvador (Jermaine Fowler). And Cassius\u2019s girlfriend, Detroit (Tessa Thompson), an artist with a day job twirling signs in front of businesses, is happy that he\u2019s gainfully employed.Things keep getting better, and also more complicated. A union drive at the telemarketing firm coincides with Cassius\u2019s rise through the ranks. He is transferred from the basement boiler room to the airy upper-floor suites where the big shots make their calls. He is taken under the wing of one such big shot (Omari Hardwick), who introduces Cassius to Steve Lift himself. It\u2019s not all bread and roses, though. Lift makes Cassius a little uncomfortable, and a labor organizer (Steven Yeun) seems to be making a move on Detroit.But she and Cassius have left the garage for a sunny, uncluttered apartment, and all in all the terms of his Faustian bargain look pretty attractive, like an upscale version of the Worry Free deal. Why even have a soul if it can\u2019t be monetized?And the situations get pretty crazy. There may not be method to Mr. Riley\u2019s madness, but there is a measure of coherence, of intellectual discipline, to his wildness. What Cassius wants is what everyone wants: success, security, solidarity, sex. But the movie\u2019s imaginary world forces him to make choices that seem unfair if not impossible \u2014 between political commitment and personal ambition, between love and power, between staying true to his friends and becoming a sellout. Which makes it a lot like the real world.Which is how satire works, of course. And like other works of contemporary satire, \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d sometimes has a strenuously chaotic, all-over-the-place feeling. Mr. Riley misses a few easy targets, and occasionally shows off his skill at shooting oversize fish in tiny barrels. He is after big game, though \u2014 race and class, labor and capital, art and technology \u2014 and his aim, while eccentric, is very often true.A later development is so outlandish that it sets the movie wobbling on the edge of willful silliness. Unless, that is, it resets the premise and raises the stakes, turning a playful, barbed riff on identity politics and political economy into a nightmarish vision of impending human extinction.Or \u2014 you see how the possibilities multiply, how the potential arguments swarm and swirl \u2014 a vision of revolution. Mr. Riley\u2019s futurism is not merely speculative or playful, and while \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d is too nimble to be polemical, it is insistently political. Cassius and his peers belong very much to the present. Like many young people, they drift into adulthood in search of pleasure and meaning, money and sex, navigating their own anxieties and a radically inhumane but somehow also tolerable social order. It\u2019s fun to hang out with them, but you can\u2019t help but be bothered by what might be coming next. Not only in the movie.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Message From a C.E.O.: Tariffs Are Going to Hurt American Companies", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Linebarger is the chief executive of Cummins.In 1976, Cummins began operations at our engine plant in Seymour, a small town of about 20,000 people in southern Indiana. The Seymour Engine Plant now produces engines for equipment like locomotives, large boats and power generators that back up critical infrastructure like data centers and landmarks like Wrigley Field. Nearly 80 percent of the products that Cummins makes in Seymour are exported; in other words, the existence of this plant is a direct result of our company\u2019s ability to access global markets.Cummins employs about 1,000 people in Seymour, and we have invested more than $300 million into the plant in the past seven years, including a technical center that employs hundreds of engineers. In the past year, we have added nearly 50 employees. While other small towns are struggling, Seymour is thriving.International trade has been the single most important contributor to growth and hiring at Cummins for nearly two decades. Half of our business is outside the United States, and more than 20 percent of the 25,000 Cummins jobs in America are directly tied to international business. And when we are growing, it often means our suppliers are also growing.Our supply chain, which has been developed and optimized over decades, cannot be reorganized in short order. We rely on more than 2,500 American companies for components and materials, but for certain components \u2014 such as cylinder blocks, connecting rods and electronic controls \u2014 there are very few suppliers anywhere. Our products are specialized \u2014 we make engines for large tractor-trailer trucks, garbage trucks, trains, construction and mining equipment, among other things \u2014 and our markets are much smaller than the American auto market, so we sometimes look beyond our backyard for suppliers.One model of engine, for example, was developed in the United States but is manufactured in China for the Chinese market. A small number of those engines \u2014 approximately 5,000 \u2014 are exported from our plant in China to the United States, so they are considered subject to tariffs under the administration\u2019s recent actions.So this product \u2014 developed by American engineers and sold by an American company \u2014 faces a 25 percent tariff here at home and must compete against products from European and other Asian engine manufacturers that are not subject to the tariffs. This will make it very difficult for Cummins to compete, putting our ability to sell these engines in the United States in peril.These tariffs put us in a worse position now than when we started these negotiations, and we are concerned there is no end in sight. Because of this uncertainty, companies like ours are standing still, unclear on how and where to invest. Even an imperfect trade deal \u2014 one that gets us a bit closer to a level playing field \u2014 is better than no trade deal, and no trade deal is better than implementing tariffs.Businesses face a real dilemma. Can they absorb the tariffs? Or do they pass the increased costs to consumers?We see no upside in the implementation of tariffs. They are a tax, and the risky proposition of entering a trade war could slow down the economy. Even putting up short-term barriers with trading partners in China and Europe can cause long-term losses in market share, resulting in lost jobs in the United States. The mere threat of tariffs results in significant costs for Cummins that cannot be recovered.As the leader of Cummins, I am charged with providing opportunities for shareholders, customers, employees and our communities and working with policymakers to create a healthy climate for business. What\u2019s at stake is not just the company\u2019s profits, but jobs in Seymour and other communities where we work, such as Rocky Mount, N.C., and Jamestown, N.Y. This is what concerns me most. American workers and their families will be the real casualties of a trade war.Tom Linebarger is the chairman and chief executive of Cummins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wages Are Rising in Europe. But Economists Are Puzzled.", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie \u2014 at least in Europe. Just don\u2019t ask why, or whether it will last.In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track.Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged.The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe.\u201cThis is one of the big economic questions of our time,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London.Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens\u2019 paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth.When official data last month showed that hourly wages in the eurozone rose 2 percent in the first three months of 2018 \u2014 finally \u2014 the central bank got the signal it was looking for. It announced it would end its main stimulus measure at the end of the year. At a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council on Thursday, that plan was reaffirmed.And because officials don\u2019t know for sure why wage growth recovered in the region, they can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s sustainable. Japan has seen surges in wage growth that quickly sputtered.Back in simpler days, falling unemployment usually led to higher wages. Employers had to compete harder for workers, and paychecks rose across the board. Inflation also went up, at least temporarily, as businesses passed on the higher cost of labor to customers.But in recent years the relationship between growth, wages and inflation has become much harder to understand. Economists have devoted enormous energy trying to explain why inflation and wages remained stuck in neutral even as unemployment in countries like Germany fell to record lows.Economists there offered numerous theories to explain the phenomenon. The decline of unions has taken away employees\u2019 bargaining power, some said. Globalization, outsourcing, and the easy flow of money and information across borders have also forced workers in wealthy countries to compete with those in poorer ones.Another suggestion is that the rise of companies like Apple, Google and Amazon has concentrated power in fewer companies and squelched competition. And the so-called sharing economy, exemplified by Uber or Airbnb, has made many people into freelancers with few benefits.Flat wage growth in Germany during the last two decades coincided with reforms that allowed companies to opt out of collective bargaining agreements, weakening union power. In France, where union agreements applied to whole industries and were binding for companies, wages continued to climb and inequality was less pronounced.But France paid a price. While unemployment fell below 4 percent in Germany, it remains above 9 percent in France. The implication is that companies may not hire as much if they are locked into union wage contracts.Professor Sch\u00f6nberg pointed out that pay in Germany has begun rising again, suggesting that the effect of reforms was temporary. At a certain point, low unemployment does still seem to lead to higher wages. It just may take longer than it used to.That is no doubt what the European Central Bank is counting on. Wages are a key issue for the bank because, by law, its job is to keep inflation at or close to 2 percent. It would be hard to believe that inflation is on an upward trend without an accompanying rise in pay.Even after five years of steady economic growth, until recently inflation in the 19-nation euro area remained stubbornly below the official target. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in May and 2 percent in June, but the numbers were not very convincing. The increases were due almost exclusively to a steep rise in energy prices, which fluctuate often.Wage growth \u201cwas the key variable we would look at for convergence of inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in June after a meeting of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council.Still, economists are far away from any consensus on why wages have taken so long to rise even when companies gripe they can\u2019t find the people they need.Mr. Talavera of Oxford Economics argues that unemployment data does not measure large numbers of workers who have given up looking for jobs. When demand for labor recovers, these people join the work force again, acting as a buffer and preventing labor shortages.This hidden reserve of workers is bigger than economists thought, Mr. Talavera said. But in Europe it appears to have finally been exhausted. \u201cThat is one of the reasons you haven\u2019t seen wage growth picking up substantially,\u201d he said.If he\u2019s right, that should mean that wages will continue to rise.The fact that low wage growth has afflicted virtually every wealthy country, though, suggests that there are deeper forces at work that are not yet fully understood.Aviv Nevo, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, summed up the mood of uncertainty about the dynamics of wages and prices by referring to the idea of the streetlight effect, where researchers look for information only where it is easiest to find, rather than probing further.During a discussion in Sintra, Professor Nevo said, \u201cWe\u2019re all drunks looking under the lamppost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Besieged Trump Says He Misspoke on Russian Election Meddling", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Under unrelenting pressure from congressional Republicans, his own advisers and his allies on Fox News, President Trump abruptly reversed course on Tuesday and claimed he had misspoken during a news conference with President Vladimir V. Putin about whether Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election.Mr. Trump, reading from a script, said he believed the assessment of the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the campaign after having seemed to have accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s assertion the day before that Russia was not involved.\u201cMy people came to me,\u201d he said Monday in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cThey said they think it\u2019s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201dOn Tuesday, he said that he had misspoken. \u201cThe sentence should have been, \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia,\u2019 sort of a double negative,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good.\u201dHe also insisted that he has \u201con numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\u201d He did not mention the far greater number of occasions on which he has sown doubt about whether Russia meddled.Mr. Trump said there were \u201ctwo thoughts\u201d on the matter, and, \u201cI have confidence in both parties.\u201dThe news conference on Tuesday was a hastily arranged, somewhat haphazard effort to defuse a sudden political crisis that had eclipsed the president\u2019s trip to Europe and his meetings with Mr. Putin and the leaders of NATO members and threatened to overwhelm the White House. Dozens of Republicans distanced themselves from the president\u2019s remarks; Democrats called for hearings; and some critics even suggested his conduct, on foreign soil, rose to the level of treason.Aides said the episode reflected how the persistent questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia have all but paralyzed the president. Baffled by his solicitous tone toward Mr. Putin, some people close to Mr. Trump have concluded that he feels vulnerable to Mr. Putin, even if it is in his own mind, rather than because of any damaging information possessed by the Russians.Even as he walked back his remarks, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. That line was scribbled in black marker onto a typewritten sheet of remarks on the table before him.And he also seemed to undercut his own assertion that he had accepted the findings of Russian involvement.\u201cCould be other people also,\u201d Mr. Trump said, appearing to ad-lib. \u201cA lot of people out there.\u201dThat echoed his previous musings that the interference could have been carried out by China, a guy from New Jersey or \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201dAs in other times Mr. Trump has ignited a furor \u2014 notably after his equivocal reaction to the violent attacks by white supremacists on left-wing activists in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 his demeanor was at odds with the message he was ostensibly delivering.At one point during his remarks, the TV lights in the Cabinet Room, where Mr. Trump was meeting with lawmakers, switched off, plunging the room into gloomy shadows. \u201cWhoops, they just turned off the lights,\u201d Mr. Trump joked. \u201cThat must be the intelligence agencies.\u201dBarely 24 hours earlier, the president had stood next to Mr. Putin under the glittering chandeliers of a ballroom in Helsinki, telling aides after the news conference wrapped up that he was happy with how it had gone. In an interview afterward with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, the president was upbeat, describing the meeting with Mr. Putin that preceded it as productive and speaking of a new era of cooperation with Russia.As he flew home on Air Force One, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s mood darkened, according to aides. He watched coverage of himself on a flat-screen television hung above the leather sofas in his office. He read briefing papers, then looked back at the TV. He snapped at aides, complaining that the coverage was \u201cso negative.\u201dThe criticism came not just from Democrats or frequent Republican antagonists like Senator John McCain of Arizona. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a staunch defender of the president, urged Mr. Trump to clarify his statements, which he described as \u201cthe most serious mistake of his presidency.\u201dSeveral Republicans who normally defend him on television were silent. Among them was Michael Anton, the former communications director for the National Security Council, who called off a long-planned appearance on CNN because he could not \u201cdefend\u201d how Mr. Trump had conducted himself with Mr. Putin, according to the host, Erin Burnett.Mr. Trump\u2019s mood on Air Force One eventually got better, and he watched some of the Home Run Derby staged in Washington as part of the All-Star Game, according to another person briefed on what took place.But by Tuesday morning, it was clear Mr. Trump could not rely on support from even his most die-hard allies. On \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d his favorite morning TV program, the host, Brian Kilmeade, spoke directly into the camera, as if assuming Mr. Trump was watching.\u201cFrom the day you came down the escalator, you shocked the world,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said. \u201cFrom November, when everyone had you losing, you shocked the world. It wasn\u2019t because of Russia, but Russia\u2019s goal was to upend the electoral process. They hate democracy.\u201dHe referred to President John F. Kennedy, saying, \u201cKennedy would love to have undone his first meeting with Khrushchev,\u201d before delivering his pitch: \u201cThis is something that needs to be corrected.\u201dMr. Trump tweeted his gratitude to one of his only advocates, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. But he was uncharacteristically subdued, tweeting only three other times in the morning \u2014 one of them an anodyne comment about the health of the economy.He insisted his meeting with Mr. Putin had gone \u201ceven better\u201d than that with NATO leaders, at which he claimed, erroneously, to have raised billions of dollars in additional funds for the alliance.Meanwhile, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, showed the pressure Republicans were under to respond to Mr. Trump. After curtly telling reporters on Monday that Russia was not a friend of the United States, Mr. McConnell went further, warning that Congress would take measures against Russia if it continued to meddle.\u201cThe Russians need to know there are a lot of us who fully understand what happened in 2016,\u201d he said, \u201cand it better not happen in 2018.\u201dAt the White House, aides added their voices to the chorus of outsiders. The new communications director, Bill Shine, whose last job was running Fox News, has a particular ability to connect with the president. Aides said he was able to help persuade Mr. Trump that a change had to be made soon.The chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was frustrated and urged people to talk to the president, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The more outside voices that Mr. Trump heard, his aides believed, the greater chance that he would agree to shift course.Later in the morning, Mr. Trump told aides he realized he needed to make a correction, according to the person who was briefed. His team met briefly to discuss what to say, and the speechwriter, Stephen Miller, drafted something that was rewritten several times. The vice president weighed in on it at one point before the president read his statement to reporters.For days before his meeting in Helsinki, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides had cautioned him to be measured and careful in his exchanges with Mr. Putin. He and his advisers played down expectations for the meeting in conversations with Europeans. Aides said the donnybrook in Helsinki was less evidence of a plan by Mr. Trump to create chaos than a continuation of his missteps earlier in the trip.In Britain, Mr. Trump gave an interview to a British tabloid, The Sun, as a favor to its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch. Speaking on the eve of his meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May, he praised Mrs. May\u2019s political nemesis, Boris Johnson, and condemned how she had handled the process of separating Britain from the European Union.Mr. Trump appeared not to understand how explosive his words were until after he spoke to the newspaper. He was contrite when he saw Mrs. May, several people who witnessed their exchanges said. He had not planned to cause damage, but had done so, and it was hard to unwind it.Now, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides fear the worst is still to come. If the past is any guide, they said privately, Mr. Trump will spend the coming days digesting the continuing fallout from his encounter with Mr. Putin, and he will look for someone other than himself to blame.Emily Cochrane and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Takes a Rare Presidential Swipe at the Fed", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve on Thursday for raising interest rates, a rare rebuke by a sitting president that upends longstanding White House protocol to avoid commenting on monetary policy.\u201cI don\u2019t like all of this work that we\u2019re putting into the economy and then I see rates going up,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to excerpts released by CNBC. \u201cI am not happy about it.\u201dThe highly unusual comments come as Mr. Trump and Republicans try to make a booming economy a big issue in the midterm elections this year. At a White House event on Thursday, Mr. Trump \u2014 flanked by executives from some of the biggest companies in the country \u2014 announced a worker retraining program that he said would further goose employment. On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are trying to pass a second round of tax cuts that would make permanent many of the individual cuts in last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion package.But as the economy finally gains steam after years of sluggish growth in the wake of the Great Recession, the Fed is facing a delicate political and economic balance. Unemployment is at an 18-year low. Inflation is running above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. Gross domestic product growth could hit 3 percent this year, which would be the best rate in more than a decade, and growth for the second quarter is estimated to be as high as 5 percent when the numbers are released on Friday morning.Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were not unusual in historical context.\u201cLots of people talk about the Fed. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re jawboning them,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, adding that the president was not \u201cin any way, shape or form trying to influence the Fed or undermine its independence.\u201dFormer White House officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s words could backfire by building pressure on Fed officials to demonstrate political independence.Mr. Trump also seemed to suggest he would not try to meddle in the Fed\u2019s affairs, saying \u201cI\u2019m letting them do what they feel is best.\u201d He also called Mr. Powell, whom he nominated as Fed chairman last year, \u201ca very good man.\u201dMr. Trump said that he understood he was breaking with that protocol, but that he did not care.\u201cNow I\u2019m just saying the same thing that I would have said as a private citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo somebody would say, \u2018Oh, maybe you shouldn\u2019t say that as president.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t care less what they say, because my views haven\u2019t changed.\u201dPresidents have no direct authority over interest rate decisions, only the power to appoint some of the Fed members that set those rates.While there have been some instances in the past of presidents weighing in on monetary policy, those have been rare. Independence from presidential criticism has long been a hallmark of the Fed\u2019s existence, and a contributor to its ability to maintain monetary policy that aims to keep inflation stable and the economy running at maximum employment.A Fed spokesman declined to comment on Thursday. The two most recent past leaders of the Fed, Ms. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke, also declined to comment.Mr. Powell has said repeatedly that the president has not attempted to interfere with the Fed\u2019s policy decisions and would have no success if he tried.Mr. Trump has nominated five members to the Fed board, including Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist who is awaiting confirmation by the Senate on his appointment as vice chairman, and Michelle W. Bowman, the Kansas banking commissioner, who has been nominated for a seat reserved for community bankers. Both pledged to carry out their jobs free of political interference during their confirmation hearings, and Mr. Clarida said that the president had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d indicated a preference for how he should vote on interest rate decisions.\u201cIf you think it was a subject upon which he delicately danced around, then you\u2019d be mistaken. It was certainly top of mind to the president,\u201d Mr. Warsh said. Later, he added: \u201cIn some sense the broader notion of an independent agency, that\u2019s probably not an obvious feature to the president.\u201dMr. Warsh said on Thursday that he was too busy to discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s CNBC comments.\u201cI respect his independence,\u201d Mr. Nixon said of the chairman at the time, Arthur F. Burns, at his swearing-in at the White House in 1970. \u201cHowever I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.\u201d Mr. Nixon continued, \u201cThat\u2019s a vote of confidence for lower interest rates and more money.\u201dHis aides would later seek to undermine Mr. Burns, including by spreading a story that he had sought a big pay increase at a time he was urging lower pay hikes. Mr. Burns later wrote in his diary of Mr. Nixon, \u201cI knew that I would be accepted in the future only if I suppressed my will and yielded completely \u2014 even though it was wrong at law and morally \u2014 to his authority.\u201dIn the administrations of Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush, there were efforts to influence the Fed chairmen Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, though those tended to be more subtle.\u201cI reappointed him, and he disappointed me,\u201d Mr. Bush said in a television interview in 1998.Neil Irwin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Housing Costs Rival New York\u2019s, but Boom May Be Ending", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY \u2014 The home wasn\u2019t perfect. The two-bedroom townhouse lacked parking and a backyard. Its proximity to a major road and a train station made for noisy evenings.But like many young Australians, Georgia Blackie felt she needed to buy it or rent for the rest of her life.Lately it has cooled off, though, and people like Ms. Blackie may pay the price.She and her partner closed on the townhouse last August for 720,000 Australian dollars, or about $533,000. But since the market\u2019s peak in November, neighborhood home values have slipped about 6 percent.\u201cIf property prices do go backward,\u201d said Ms. Blackie, a 31-year-old lawyer, \u201cwhere does that leave you?\u201dNobody is predicting an American-style housing crisis just yet. In fact, many economists predict that housing prices will soon rebound.If many households are forced to sell, \u201cto me that\u2019s the biggest match that could ignite things,\u201d said Richard Holden, a professor of economics at the University of New South Wales.While price increases elsewhere in recent years have been more modest, Sydney and Melbourne account for the lion\u2019s share of Australian real estate. They make up about 40 percent of the population and a majority of the property market value. Home values in both cities dropped last year, in some places in Sydney by more than 10 percent, according to Corelogic, a property data provider. So far this year they have dropped more than 2 percent in Sydney and almost 2 percent in Melbourne.The decline has a number of causes, including new restrictions on foreign buyers, which hindered wealthy \u00e9migr\u00e9s and investors from China. But a major factor is that Australians probably could not take much more. Prices, many experts say, simply rose too high too quickly.\u201cWe are on the edge of a precipice,\u201d said Martin North, principal analyst for Digital Finance Analytics, an independent research and advisory firm. \u201cAll of the forces that have driven the home sector and the debt sector higher in the last 20 years are all coming to a critical inflection point.\u201dAll of this has taken some air out of what some experts describe as a bubble, as a recent Saturday-morning auction in the Sydney suburb of Ryde showed.When the auctioneer asked for an opening bid, he received only tight-lipped smiles and an awkward silence. A kookaburra cackled. No sale was made that day.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit nerve-racking,\u201d said Chris Jabbour, a young real estate agent who welcomed people through the door before the auction. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019ll happen next.\u201dSo far, the economic damage has been minimal. Mortgage delinquency rates were largely stable last year, according to S & P Global, a ratings firm, though they are expected to rise this year. Moody Analytics, a financial intelligence firm, forecasts that home prices will resume rising by year\u2019s end.Still, signs of stress are showing. Mr. North, the analyst from Digital Financial Analytics, estimates that of 3.5 million mortgages where the owner lives in the home, almost a third of the households have incomes close to or less than their expenditures. He predicts that at least 50,000 homeowners may default in the next 12 months.The long run-up in housing prices mirrors Australia\u2019s boomtime economy, which has not seen a recession in more than a quarter-century. Demographics helped Sydney and Melbourne in particular, as the cities attracted both Australians and immigrants.Domain, an Australian real estate website, found in June that the average Sydney couple would take nearly nine years to save for a 20 percent deposit on an entry-level home near the city\u2019s central districts.\u201cAlmost everywhere you look, you can see icebergs,\u201d Mr. North said.Australian officials have taken notice. Last year, financial regulators announced new lending restrictions aimed at mortgages that allow borrowers to pay only interest and put off repaying the loan itself. A government-backed banking commission this year has unearthed questions about mortgage vetting practices at some banks, prompting a few to review their policies.That has helped tame prices. Some middle-class suburbs in Sydney have seen declines of more than 10 percent and in Melbourne more than 6 percent since the market\u2019s peak late last year, according to CoreLogic. According to data from the R.E.A. Group, which operates Australia\u2019s largest real estate website, the average number of people looking per listing has dropped by nearly a quarter over the last year.\u201cI think it\u2019s just hit a price point that people were uncomfortable with,\u201d said Nerida Conisbee, the chief economist of the R.E.A. Group.\u201cThe air comes out of the bubble slowly,\u201d said Terry Rawnsley, an economist for SGS Economics and Planning, an urban planning firm.Real estate agents are preparing for a tough road ahead. \u201cIt used to be a cash and dash,\u201d said Charles Baynie, a real estate coach, referring to the ease at which properties were snapped up. \u201cNow it\u2019s not.\u201dMeanwhile, some first-time buyers are wondering whether housing will become affordable again.\u201cI guess I\u2019ve just taken that thought of eventually having my property and put that in a box in my mind that says \u2018unattainable,\u2019\u201d said Siobhan Kranz, 30, who lives in Melbourne.\u201cThere\u2019s a level of resentment that\u2019s grown with that,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I find hard to shake.\u201dIsabella Kwai reported from Sydney, and Adam Baidawi from Melbourne.

{"Headline": "In Beijing, Doors Shut on a Bastion of Independent Ideas", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 An independent think tank that was one of China\u2019s few remaining bastions for liberal-democratic ideas was shut out of its Beijing offices on Wednesday, throwing its survival into doubt.Some workers at the think tank, the Unirule Institute of Economics, found themselves briefly trapped inside when the company that manages the lease on the institute\u2019s offices locked and welded its door shut.Unirule was founded 25 years ago to promote liberalizing China\u2019s economy and democratizing its government. Those ideas have become officially unwelcome under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader who has driven China to re-embrace staunchly socialist values, and the group has come under increased government pressure.\u201cWe\u2019re very pessimistic because we clearly understand that there are more senior people behind this, although we don\u2019t have the evidence to prove it,\u201d Mr. Sheng, an economist, said in an interview. \u201cThe leasing company is out to make money, and there\u2019s no reason that they\u2019d make trouble on their own. That would be illogical.\u201dClosing Unirule would represent a major blow to independent intellectual life under Mr. Xi. For years the institute was tolerated, sometimes even consulted, by government officials, and it gained a prominence beyond its small size.\u201cIt\u2019s been very significant,\u201d said Zhu Xueqin, a historian in Beijing who gave a talk late last month at the institute. \u201cIt\u2019s been an important platform for Chinese intellectuals to publish their independent views.\u201dBut Unirule has become increasingly isolated as other outposts of liberal opinion have gone silent.So far, Unirule has escaped that fate. But its survival has become increasingly tenuous.\u201cOur survival is a testament to China\u2019s development of rule of law,\u201d said Jiang Hao, a law and public policy researcher who works for Unirule. \u201cChina is making a transition from arbitrary rule to rule of law, and we\u2019re an example of that.\u201dMr. Mao and other scholars founded the Unirule Institute in 1993 as a vehicle for promoting market reforms, stronger private property rights, rule of law and other liberal ideas.But it and other outposts of liberal democracy in China came under deepening pressure even before Mr. Xi rose to power.In 2004, the institute lost government sponsorship that had given it some protection, and since then it has operated as a consulting company. It has relied on consultancy fees, grants and donations from private donors and foreign foundations. As those sources have also shrunk, Unirule has kept going by charging for courses offered to Chinese entrepreneurs who often admire Mr. Mao as an enlightened advocate of their interests.Since October, Unirule has used a rented apartment in a residential compound in western Beijing for its activities. There it regularly holds seminars that have become a rare public venue for heterodox views in the Chinese capital.In recent weeks, dozens of people crowded into the office to hear Zhang Ming, a prominent historian, discuss why the Nationalist government fell to Communist forces in 1949. More recently, Professor Zhu, the historian from Shanghai, gave a speech there arguing that China\u2019s course of reform and opening up had stalled after 1989.On Tuesday, five staff members of the institute were trapped in the office for an hour or so after the leasing company locked and welded shut the office doors, said Mr. Jiang, the researcher, who was among them. They were freed after the police arrived, but the institute\u2019s doors were locked again on Wednesday, he said.Li Peiqing, a manager for the Aijiaying leasing company, said it had locked Unirule out after the police and a residential committee told it to end the lease, citing complaints from residents.\u201cThis matter has been fully under the guidance of the government and the police station,\u201d Mr. Li said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe residential committee and the police station contacted us yesterday and told us to terminate contractual relations with Unirule.\u201dMr. Sheng, the institute\u2019s executive director, said Unirule had not received complaints from residents, and he argued that the dispute should be settled through the courts.China\u2019s judges seem unlikely to back the institute. But Mr. Sheng said that if Unirule was forced out, it would try to go on by renting temporary spaces for meetings.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly going to be an impact, but it won\u2019t be fatal,\u201d he said. \u201cWith modern technology you don\u2019t necessarily need a physical office.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated when the historian Zhu Xueqin spoke at the Unirule Institute of Economics. He gave a talk there last month, not this month.Karoline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Go Home, South Korea Tells Workers, as Stress Takes Its Toll", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Lee Han-bit helped produce a television series called \u201cDrinking Solo,\u201d in which young adults cramming for a high-stakes civil service exam often drink to relieve anxiety. But working weeks without a break and asking his own employees to work 20-hour days, Mr. Lee was consumed by pressures of his own.\u201cI too was nothing but a laborer,\u201d Mr. Lee wrote. But to them, he added, \u201cI was nothing more or less than a manager who squeezed the laborers.\u201dMr. Lee\u2019s message reverberated across South Korea, a country that has long worked too hard.South Korea\u2019s leaders are trying to change that. A new law that went into effect this month caps workweeks for many employees at 52 hours. The government is pushing companies to let employees go home for the night and to free up their weekends. A call to the Ministry of Labor is greeted with a recorded voice message that says, \u201cOur society is breaking away from overwork.\u201dThe extra time off is especially liberating for young workers, who often don\u2019t share the work-at-all-cost ethos of their parents.\u201cMy colleagues and I say that we would rather go home earlier than work long hours, even if we were paid for working overtime,\u201d Ms. Woo said.South Korea\u2019s feelings about work are complex. Pride in hard work helped propel the once-rural country out of the ashes of war and transform it into an economic power, producing brands like Samsung and Hyundai that are known all over the world.Working long hours also used to be seen as a badge of honor, especially for the male breadwinner in a patriarchal society. But even then, some workers called attention to difficult conditions. The self-immolation of a factory worker at the start of the 1970s labor movement is still evoked by activists today.The incident and workplace deaths \u2014 including the suicide of Mr. Lee, the television producer \u2014 have given new urgency to South Korea\u2019s efforts to change its workplace culture.When a government employee, a new mother, died last year after collapsing at her office on a Sunday morning, President Moon Jae-in, who was still a candidate at the time, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe can no longer be a society where overwork and working until late is a given.\u201dNor are long work hours good for the economy. Labor productivity has slowed considerably, while unemployment among young people has reached 10 percent despite a much lower national rate over all.Mr. Moon, who was elected last year, and labor experts blame outdated workplace practices, including those in government, that allow managers to keep employees on call to complete tasks as they come up. Though that system gives managers more flexibility to assign work, it does not necessarily benefit the organization as a whole.\u201cIt worked in the past when Koreans were hungry,\u201d said Yu Gyu-chang, a professor of human resources management at Hanyang University. \u201cBut times have changed now.\u201d\u201cHabitual long-extended work has been the culprit behind Korea\u2019s low labor productivity,\u201d he said this month after the workweek cap took effect.That message has found a sympathetic audience among the young in South Korea, who have learned to prize their leisure time as old attitudes have loosened. Until a five-day workweek was introduced in 2004, many South Koreans did not experience free Saturdays.Many companies are enacting new policies to comply. More than 700 of South Korea\u2019s 3,672 large companies and public sector organizations have either hired new employees or have plans to do so, the Ministry of Labor said, although it did not track whether these new hires would be working full time.Other organizations have introduced policies to limit routine overtime work. Seoul\u2019s city government began in May to enforce mandatory lights out and computer shutdowns on Fridays at 7 p.m.At the insurance company where Park Jung-min, 46, works, computers are automatically shut off at 6 p.m. Employees are also encouraged to request advance permission to work overtime.\u201cIf we don\u2019t know in advance that we might have to work after 6 p.m., then we have to turn on the computer again after 6 and provide reasons for doing so,\u201d said Mr. Park, who described it as an occasional nuisance. \u201cBut all in all, I think this new 52-hour workweek is good for our work-life balance that Koreans now want more of.\u201dLoopholes still abound, critics say. It isn\u2019t clear whether business trips or entertaining clients would count toward the 52-hour cap. Some industries, like health care and transportation, have received exemptions. Companies could also find other ways to avoid hiring more people.\u201cEmployees would take their work home, which would be an unspoken agreement between bosses and underlings,\u201d said Kim Yu-kyong, a public labor attorney at the Organization for the Human Rights of Workers.The Union for Broadcast Workers, which was formed by freelance employees in the television industry after the new law went into effect earlier this month, said it received more than 30 complaints within the first two days. One employee, it said, worked from 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. and was asked to report to work at 7 a.m. the following day.Though it will be another two years before the maximum work hours are enforced for smaller companies, many see the mandate for reduced work hours as long overdue.\u201cIt has to work,\u201d Mr. Kim of the Union for Broadcast Workers said. \u201cSo far, the existing practice had been too inhumane.\u201dSu-Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and Tiffany May from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Troubled Cameroon, U.S. Envoy Is Accused of Election Meddling", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 When the American ambassador took up his post in Cameroon late last year, he stepped into an increasingly troubled nation, locked in battle against Islamist militants in one part of the country and armed separatists in another.And then there is the matter of its leader.Cameroon has not had a new president since Michael Jackson released \u201cThriller\u201d in 1982.The remarks caused an uproar among officials in Cameroon and in the local media, which accused him of trying to influence a foreign election. The minister of foreign affairs summoned the ambassador for a scolding. Mr. Barlerin even received death threats.The ambassador, a career diplomat, noted that his comments were made following a discussion with the president about the need to stop the violence in areas where the military is battling a bloody separatist uprising.\u201cWe do not have a preferred outcome for the election,\u201d Mr. Barlerin said in a recent interview, emphasizing that he has stressed that to government officials. \u201cWe want a strong and stable Cameroon.\u201dThe matter seemed to quiet down, temporarily, until late last month when Mr. Barlerin\u2019s photo was plastered across the covers of at least three local newspapers, which accused him of paying nearly $5 million to opposition candidates in the presidential race.The United States Embassy strongly disputed the claim, releasing a statement that described the story as \u201centirely false.\u201dOpposition members also denied the reports and speculated they had been planted by the president\u2019s supporters, who know that the population would be appalled at any foreign attempt to influence elections.\u201cAll this agitation is simply that the officials are looking for the sympathy of the people,\u201d said Hilaire Kamga, one of the candidates running against Mr. Biya.The controversy stirred by the American ambassador is a sign of just how deeply entrenched Cameroon\u2019s current government is. Critics say his loyalists operate with impunity, creating nothing more than a charade of a democracy.The storm caused by Mr. Barlerin\u2019s remarks about Mr. Biya\u2019s legacy is not the first time American diplomats have become entangled in election controversy on the continent.Cameroon\u2019s opposition is fractured, and, like in past elections, no candidate with a mass following has emerged. Analysts fear that many voters who most likely would cast a ballot for someone other than the incumbent probably will not be able to vote because of violence that will keep polls from opening.Some Cameroonians are so fed up with the government that they may withhold their vote in protest, said Hans De Marie Heungoup, a Central Africa senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Some protests could turn violent, he said, and the military has a record of firing on unarmed protesters.Past elections won by Mr. Biya have been called flawed and full of irregularities.Even though victory for Mr. Biya seems likely if he formally joins the race, his supporters were still miffed at what they interpreted as an attempt at a foreign government to urge him to step down.\u201cThe American ambassador is not an enemy of Cameroon,\u201d said Saint-Eloi Bidoung, a first deputy mayor in Yaound\u00e9, the capital, and a member of the governing party. \u201cBut he should know that the departure of President Biya from power depends solely on the will of Cameroonians, and not from a foreign power, even the United States of America.\u201dEmmanuel Simh, a founding member of the opposition Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon, called the ambassador\u2019s remarks \u201cnormal diplomacy\u201d and said they caused a stir only because Mr. Biya\u2019s supporters are panicked about losing power.Mr. Biya was absent in 2016 when a train overloaded with passengers derailed, killing dozens. And last year when protests by separatists turned violent, the president was in Switzerland.Critics call him the President of the Hotel Intercontinental, for his preferred accommodation in Geneva.That Mr. Biya can spend so much time abroad with few implications at home demonstrates his grasp on power.Government officials have benefited from Mr. Biya\u2019s long tenure. Like many nations in the region, Cameroon is a place of haves and have-nots. Outside Yaound\u00e9, golden painted homes sit atop lush hillsides while beaten-down shacks line the roads at the bottom.\u201cMinisters,\u201d locals sigh and shrug when asked who lives on the hilltops.Any plans for a post-Biya nation are murky. If he wins the presidency again, Mr. Biya would be in his 90s by the end of his seven-year term. If he were to die in office, the Senate president would take over until an election is held two months later. But analysts question whether Mr. Biya\u2019s powerful loyalists would stand by idly.\u201cThe institutions there are so weak,\u201d Mr. De Marie Heungoup said.Unlike other countries in the region that rely on oil revenues to finance most of their budgets, Cameroon has a more diverse economy that includes agriculture and manufacturing, which allowed it to weather a drop in oil prices better than neighboring Nigeria.Cameroon is in the middle of an unstable region. Conflicts abound in nearby Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the region\u2019s war with Boko Haram has spilled across borders. Cameroon has welcomed tens of thousands of refugees from those conflicts and has been a key partner with foreign militaries in fighting Boko Haram.Mr. Barlerin said his office recently had emphasized, as a precaution, to the Cameroon government that the military equipment Americans have provided for the fight against Boko Haram must not be used to fight separatists.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful country and we\u2019ve had a lot of good cooperation from the government,\u201d Mr. Barlerin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it go up in smoke.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe only thing we want is for elections to be free, fair and credible and that the will of the Cameroonian people be heard.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Francois Essomba from Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in Local Business to Get an Even Break", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMs. Martin is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Better Off: Reinventing the American Dream.\u201dRodney Foxworth, the executive director of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (known popularly as Balle), explains it this way: \u201cBy localism, we don\u2019t mean parochialism. We mean creating direct relationships within the context of capital. In other words, when Wall Street bankers in New York or London can make important decisions that deeply affect the lives of people in Jackson, Miss., or rural Oklahoma, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t be alone if you associate localism with white hippies of the 1970s who liked their granola homemade and their T-shirts tie-dyed. Mr. Foxworth\u2019s entry point is anything but them.The son of a court clerk from Baltimore, Mr. Foxworth remembers his mother reading Langston Hughes\u2019s \u201cMother to Son\u201d \u2014 \u201clife for me ain\u2019t been no crystal stair\u201d\u2014 to him almost every night and exposing him early on to the criminal justice system and all the havoc it was wreaking in black communities. After graduating from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, he worked as a journalist before finding himself pulled into the world of community-minded black entrepreneurs in his hometown \u2014 people who created jobs for formerly incarcerated citizens and incubated new businesses started by local residents.Now 34, Mr. Foxworth explains: \u201cI didn\u2019t think about being part of a localism movement, but I was completely enmeshed in the place where I grew up and valued the set of relationships that I knew were required to move anything forward.\u201dWhen some of the most interesting leaders he knew became Balle Fellows, he became intrigued by the organization. Founded by a Philadelphia business owner, Judy Wicks, it began as a membership organization in 2001 \u2014 a 21st-century sort of chamber of commerce for people trying to raise public awareness of the power of buying locally. But by 2010, the members began to think more deeply about how capitalism in the United States had evolved in a way that discriminated against people like the Foxworth family, people of color in urban centers, indigenous folk and poor rural Americans when they tried to buy homes or create small businesses.Any attempt to encourage local economies, they reasoned, would have to acknowledge that history and embrace the under-resourced talent across the country. The Balle Local Economies Fellowship program, created in 2011, focused on bringing the \u201cunofficial mayors of their towns\u201d together to share best practices on building local, more equitable economies and gaining knowledge of alternative economic models like worker-ownership, land trusts and community-driven investment.Mr. Foxworth became the executive director of Balle last year. To date the organization has had 101 fellows from 43 states and provinces, collectively serving 121,650 small businesses. People of color now make up a majority of both the board and the staff.Balle is working on many of the United States\u2019 most excruciating pain points \u2014 economic inequality, racial animosity, partisanship and rural vs. urban divides. They don\u2019t do it by just making unusual allies of people like Mr. Foxworth and Ms. Smith, who have historically been excluded from the mechanisms that build wealth (like mortgages and business loans); they also seek to raise the awareness and change the practices of those with a disproportionate amount of privilege.The other level is tactical \u2014 by systematically analyzing where their investments are held and how they are giving away money, leaders learn how to get ruthlessly honest about where their foundations are failing to live up to their values. Sarah Kinser, the chief program officer of the Arkansas Community Foundation, was surprised by the process: \u201cI expected to find a step-by-step recipe for transitioning our portfolio, but the Foundation Circle helped me realize that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach.\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean the Circle\u2019s members can\u2019t be helpful to one another; to the contrary, they create a support group as they go back to their home institutions and try to change them. This, not the accounting, is often the hardest work. It often involves a lot of pushback from boards, attorneys and others who are accustomed to the old ways. Ms. Kinser explains: \u201cThe members of my cohort are supporting one another in discovering ways forward that are specific to the needs of the communities we serve and the organizations we represent. It\u2019s more difficult, but it\u2019s more authentic and, I believe, will be more effective in the long run.\u201dMany of the leaders go back to their institutions and do an audit of where their endowments are invested, then disinvest from companies that don\u2019t align with their values and invest instead in local efforts like affordable housing developments, work force development programs and small businesses. To date, foundations involved in the program have committed to reallocating over $100 million into their communities and mission-aligned investing.Typically, foundations have operated with a sort of church-and-state mentality about their money and how it is handled \u2014 one set of people (finance guys) manages the money according to one set of values (creating profit), while a different set of people (do-gooders) donates the money according to another set of values (an equal start for everyone). Foundation leaders are evaluated, in large part, on the growth of their assets. But members of the Local Economy Foundation Circle are questioning whether growing, or even maintaining, wealth is even ethical.The Heron Foundation has gone on to fund Balle\u2019s Local Economy Foundation Circle because they are intent on helping other foundations take these same steps. If even a fraction of the $865 billion that foundations currently invest in Wall Street were reallocated to Main Street, the country would look and feel profoundly different \u2014 particularly to those who have been left out.\u201cThe people and communities most adversely impacted by economic extraction and wealth inequality are resilient and have long innovated solutions to enduring systemic challenges,\u201d Mr. Foxworth explains. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the hard work. Now it\u2019s time for policymakers, philanthropists and investors to follow their lead.\u201dCourtney E.

{"Headline": "Tired of Being Crammed Into an Airline Seat? You Have Options", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "Passengers are increasingly willing to pay more for premium economy seats on long airplane trips that come with a host of other perks.Supported byTired of being squeezed into smaller seats with inadequate legroom, more and more passengers are opting for the more expensive and expansive seating option known as premium economy.This year, experts agree, will see the ongoing growth of this class of service \u2014 generally available on wide-body aircraft \u2014 most notably at United Airlines.Although the meaning of premium economy can vary from airline to airline, typically the tickets are priced above economy class and below business class and often feature amenities such as more comfortable seats in a better location on the airplane, better dining and drinking and a more generous checked baggage allowance than economy class.Airlines based in the United States have been the slowest to catch up to the trend, which has long been offered by competitors based in other countries.American Airlines was the first carrier in the United States to offer premium economy service, introducing it in late 2016; Delta Air Lines did the same the following fall. United is the last of the three to follow suit, and is expected to roll out its premium economy product on select routes later this year.These carriers have been late to the game in part because of financial constraints that prevented investment in a premium economy product, according to Jamie Baker, a New York-based airline analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities. The mergers of American with US Airways and United with Continental also took a large amount of attention, he said.One advantage American carriers have by being late with their offerings is that they can learn from the longer-standing premium economy experience of their partners in other countries \u2014 such as Delta\u2019s ties with Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic, and American\u2019s with British Airways.Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, said it was vital that all partner airlines\u2019 products eventually were harmonized, so that passengers flying to the United States in British Airways\u2019 World Traveller Plus class, for example, received similar service on their flight back to the United Kingdom in American\u2019s premium economy class.Peter Harbison, executive chairman of CAPA-Centre for Aviation, a research consulting company based in Sydney, Australia, suggested in the organization\u2019s daily newsletter earlier this month that \u201cairlines can be cavalier in describing their product as \u2018premium economy.\u2019 Depending on the airline, there\u2019s a range of descriptions and inclusions,\u201d with the \u201cgenuine\u201d premium economy featuring \u201cdistinctly separate cabin, seats and service.\u201dBut the premium economy product can sometimes be relatively bare bones. KLM\u2019s \u201cEconomy Comfort\u201d service, introduced in 2009, features a seat with more legroom and reclining space, and a nine-inch in-flight entertainment screen, smaller than some other carriers\u2019, for example. Or it can be quite elaborate, such as that of Virgin Atlantic. The British carrier offered two earlier versions of its current \u201cPremium\u201d class of service, the first introduced in 1992 and the second in 1994.Today\u2019s product features dedicated check-in and baggage drop-off facilities; free check-in for two pieces of baggage; priority boarding; leather seats with up to a 38-inch pitch, footrest and headrest; an amenity kit on some flights; choice of three meals, including a vegetarian option; unlimited snacks and drinks in-flight; and a \u201csocial snack space\u201d on 787 aircraft where passengers can gather.Carriers competing in certain markets offer other amenities to premium economy passengers: Japanese airline JAL provides airport lounge access, while ANA does at certain airports, including at its upcoming new lounges at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, where it will begin flying A380 aircraft nonstop from Tokyo next spring.Low-cost new entrant Norwegian Air offers its premium travelers access to lounges at Gatwick Airport in London, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Oakland International Airport.Air New Zealand, Qantas and Norwegian Air offer yet another type of benefit to premium economy passengers: All let them bid for tickets, though payment methods differ by carrier.According to an analysis by Mr. Harteveldt of different classes of fares, for travel in September, from J.F.K., Miami International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport to various overseas cities, premium economy fares were generally, on average, 76 percent more expensive than standard economy fares. However, he found some relatively reasonable premium economy fares, such as a $1,253 round-trip fare between J.F.K. and Heathrow Airport near London.His analysis also found that \u201cthe gap between premium economy and business class was generally far greater than that between the two economy class services. However, a round-trip business-class ticket from J.F.K.to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was actually far less expensive than premium economy.\u201dPremium economy service gives carriers \u201can opportunity to create a product for passengers who are ready and willing to pay for it, generating more revenue and profit for them,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. One danger it could pose, however, is the possibility of business-class passengers downgrading to premium economy, thus robbing airlines of lucrative business-class revenues.So far this downgrading does not appear to be happening, Mr. Baker said. \u201cWe believe there is significantly more buying up from economy class than buying down from business class. It\u2019s likely to be an area where airlines will experiment to get the right balance between the two products,\u201d he said.Similarly, a report released last month, by Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a travel management company, and Travelport, a travel commerce platform, on air travel originating in Singapore from 2015 through 2017 found that \u201cthe increase in premium economy bookings seems to have come largely at the expense of economy class, and not business class.\u201dPremium economy passengers are not necessarily business travelers, however. Air New Zealand estimates that 75 percent of its premium economy passengers are leisure travelers, while American Airlines says its premium economy passengers are primarily leisure travelers who previously flew in economy class. Thomas Cook Airlines finds its premium economy service is more popular with leisure travelers than business travelers, particularly those over the age of 45.Looking ahead, Mr. Baker sees American, Delta and United continuing to improve their premium economy service. Other carriers are expected to roll out brand-new services, such as Emirates, which plans to launch its premium economy product on A380 aircraft slated to be delivered in about 2020. Other airlines also are expected to continuously upgrade their product. Qantas, which introduced a new premium economy seat on its 787-9 aircraft late last year, is already speaking with airplane seat manufacturers and its frequent fliers about new premium economy seating in the next generation of its ultra-long-haul aircraft, which it hopes to fly nonstop from the east coast of Australia to both London and New York by 2022.And Helane Becker, airline analyst for Cowen and Company, said she believed that as low-cost carriers offering premium economy service \u2014 which also include WOW air and Condor \u2014 continued to expand their long-haul operations, \u201call airlines will have to rethink how they compete with them. One way will be to offer cheap seats, in premium economy, for business and leisure travelers to buy.\u201dPremium economy could also appeal to millennial leisure travelers and baby boomers, as well as to travelers from rapidly growing markets such as China, Brazil and India, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s about airlines trying to figure out a way to shift the mix, from fewer, low-yield passengers to more high-yielding passengers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Meets Gravity", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThese days I\u2019m writing a lot about trade policy. I know there are more crucial topics, like Alan Dershowitz. Maybe a few other things? But getting and spending go on; and to be honest, in a way I\u2019m doing trade issues as a form of therapy and/or escapism, focusing on stuff I know as a break from the grim political news.Anyway, as Britain\u2019s self-inflicted Brexit crisis (self-inflicted with some help from Putin, it seems) comes to a head, it seems to me worth trying to explain some aspects of the economics involved that should be obvious \u2013 surely are obvious to many British economists \u2013 but aren\u2019t, apparently, as obvious either to Brexiteers or to the general public.These aspects explain why Theresa May is trying to do a soft Brexit or even, as some say, BINO \u2013 Brexit In Name Only; and why the favored alternative of Brexiteers, trade agreements with the United States and perhaps others to replace the EU, won\u2019t fly.Now, many of the arguments for Brexit were lies pure and simple. But their claims about trade, both before and after the vote, may arguably be seen as misunderstandings rather than sheer dishonesty.In the world according to Brexiteers, Britain needn\u2019t lose much by leaving the EU, because it can still negotiate a free trade agreement with the rest of Europe, or, at worst, face the low tariffs the EU imposes on other non-EU economies. Meanwhile, Britain can negotiate better trade deals elsewhere, especially the US, that will make up for any losses on the EU side.What\u2019s wrong with this story? The first thing to understand is that the EU is not a free trade agreement like NAFTA; it\u2019s a customs union, which is substantially stronger and more favorable to trade.What\u2019s the difference? In NAFTA, most Mexican products can enter the U.S. tariff-free. But Mexico and the U.S. don\u2019t charge the same tariffs on imports from third parties. This means that Mexican goods entering the U.S. still have to face a customs inspection, to make sure that they\u2019re actually Mexican, not, say, Chinese goods unloaded in Mexico and trucked across the border to bypass U.S. tariffs.And actually it\u2019s worse than that, because what is a Mexican good, anyway? NAFTA has elaborate rules about how much Mexican content is required to qualify for zero tariffs, and this adds a lot of paperwork and frictions to intra-NAFTA trade.By contrast, the EU sets common external tariffs, which means that once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in: once goods are unloaded at Rotterdam they can be shipped on to France or Germany without further customs checks. So there\u2019s much less friction.Still, even if leaving the customs union would be costly, couldn\u2019t Britain make up for that by getting a really good deal with Donald Trump\u2019s America? No.Certainly the U.S. couldn\u2019t offer hugely valuable tariff reductions, for the simple reason that our tariffs on EU products \u2013 like EU tariffs on our products \u2013 are already quite low. You can find examples of high tariffs, like our 25 percent tariff on light trucks, but overall there just isn\u2019t much to give.What about a Britain-U.S. customs union? That would be hugely problematic, among other things because given the asymmetry in size Britain would effectively be giving Washington complete control over its policy. Beyond that, no deal with the U.S. could be worth as much as Britain\u2019s customs union with its neighbors, because of gravity.The point is that while America offers a market comparable in size to that of the EU, it\u2019s much further away, so that even if the UK could make an incredible deal with us, it wouldn\u2019t be worth nearly as much as the customs union they have.All of this explains why May is trying to negotiate a deal that keeps the customs union intact. But that, of course, ain\u2019t much of an exit: Brussels will still set UK trade policy, except that Britain will no longer have a vote. So what was the point of Brexit in the first place?Good question. Too bad more people didn\u2019t ask it before the referendum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Blasts Fed, China and Europe for Putting U.S. Economy at a Disadvantage", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump accused China and the European Union on Friday of manipulating their currencies to gain an edge in global trade and escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying those moves were putting the United States at a disadvantage.Mr. Trump appears ready to blame the Fed for trying to slow down a booming economy that he wants to make a centerpiece of the midterm elections. The president\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut, along with federal spending increases, have injected new stimulus into an economy that is finally shaking off the last vestiges of the recession.He also doubled down on his trade fight with China, vowing in an interview with CNBC that aired Friday that he was ready to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese imports \u2014 roughly all the goods China sends to the United States each year.But behind Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism is an economic paradox of his own making: The very policies he has pushed, like tax cuts, increased government spending or protectionist tariffs, are fueling many of the global changes that he finds so troubling.A booming United States economy is strengthening the dollar against other currencies, and Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are prompting some countries, like China, to take steps to protect their exporters. The Fed, concerned about too rapid an expansion that is fueled in part by the enormous fiscal stimulus ushered in by the White House, is slowly raising rates to keep the economy from overheating.White House aides said that Mr. Trump was not trying to influence the Fed, the nation\u2019s central bank, but added that he would prefer if officials paused their plans for rate increases to avoid dampening economic growth. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is on track to raise them twice more by the end of the year, officials indicated after the Fed\u2019s meeting in June.Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the president\u2019s tweets displayed \u201ca breezy ignorance of facts and limited understanding of basic principles of economics.\u201d\u201cThe dollar is strengthening against other currencies because the U.S. economy is doing well and is implementing a fiscal expansion through a massive tax cut, both of which Mr. Trump has claimed credit for,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. He added that condemning rate increases as \u201cimplicitly aiding the enemy in U.S. trade wars is a dangerous and destructive strike against the Fed\u2019s independence.\u201dThe dollar, as measured by the United States dollar index, fell sharply. Prices of 30-year United States Treasury bonds, which are highly sensitive to changes in inflation expectations, also dropped, pushing yields \u2014 which move in the opposite direction \u2014 higher. Prices for gold, a traditional hedge against inflation risk, rose.\u201cTrump clearly doesn\u2019t accept that a strong dollar and a widening trade deficit are the natural result of his own fiscal expansion,\u201d said Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said in an interview that the president strongly believed that his policies would increase investment and draw workers into the labor force.\u201cThe United States is the hottest economy and investment destination in the world right now,\u201d thanks largely to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cMoney is flowing in from everywhere, and that\u2019s terrific.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s sharp words come ahead of a gathering in Argentina this weekend of finance ministers of the Group of 20 countries, where Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is expected to participate in a dozen bilateral meetings and broader multilateral meetings. The chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, will also be in attendance and will participate in a discussion on global economic risk, the Treasury Department said.In a slew of trade actions, the president has already imposed tariffs on about 4 percent of American imports, including foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar-power products, and a variety of goods from China. But he has threatened to greatly escalate those measures, expanding tariffs to cover about a quarter of all United States imports.A senior Treasury official who previewed the event said that Mr. Mnuchin does not have a meeting scheduled with Chinese officials in Buenos Aires. They are expected to interact during the multilateral discussions, but one-on-one negotiations are currently stalled.The Treasury secretary will meet separately this weekend with counterparts from Group of 7 countries to discuss ways to coordinate \u201cconcrete action with regard to China and its economic aggression,\u201d the official said.In the interview with CNBC, the president described the tit-for-tat threats on China as a poker game, saying the trade conflict was \u201cthe right thing to do for our country.\u201d\u201cI raised 50, and they matched us,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t match us. You can\u2019t match us because otherwise we\u2019re always going to be behind the 8-ball.\u2019\u201dDerek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that China would be able to offset the effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs through changes to its currency. However, any changes would have to be made gradually to avoid alarming investors and prompting capital flight, which could destabilize Chinese markets.\u201cFarmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers.\u201dFarmers have been struggling with lower commodity prices in recent years, but the price of soybeans has plummeted sharply since the beginning of May, as China, the United States\u2019 biggest foreign buyer, threatened to curtail its purchases.Though Mr. Trump has a strong base of support among American farmers, many insist that exporting is vital for their livelihoods and that trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president has heavily criticized, have benefited them. American agricultural exports have nearly tripled since Nafta went into force in 1994, reaching $140.47 billion in 2017. They continue to outpace agricultural imports, which have also risen.\u201cTrade has been the one bright spot for farmers,\u201d said Joseph W. Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cUntil the tariffs were put on, farm exports have been near record highs in value.\u201dRon Moore, the chairman of the American Soybean Association and a farmer in Illinois, said that tariff threats had appeared to have caused the market to collapse in recent months. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme amount of volatility in the marketplace right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really makes farmers nervous. We\u2019ve all got bills to pay.\u201dAna Swanson and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Alan Rappeport from Buenos Aires. Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paychecks Lag as Profits Soar, and Prices Erode Wage Gains", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in the background, the nation\u2019s central bankers stand poised to raise interest rates and deliberately rein in growth if wages climb too rapidly.Workers, understandably, are asking whether they are getting a raw deal.\u201cSure, you can get a job slinging hamburgers somewhere or working in a warehouse,\u201d said Christina Jones, 53, of Mobile, Ala. Ms. Jones spent eight months searching for a job with living wages and benefits, after being laid off from a paper company where she had worked for nearly 13 years.

The thinking goes like this: Better to inflict some pain now, in the form of higher joblessness and sluggish wage growth, than to allow more pain later.After keeping benchmark interest rates at near-zero levels during the recession, the Fed has been gradually nudging them up. So far this year, it has raised rates twice.Discomfort with a tight labor market and growing worker bargaining power is to some degree baked into the Fed\u2019s makeup. Pressure to raise wages during expansions will inevitably be seen as precursors to insidious inflationary pressure.The conventional wisdom that higher wages inevitably lead to higher prices, however, is flimsy, some economists argue.Regardless, there is plenty of evidence that workers have yet to receive their fair share of this most recent expansion \u2014 or even the previous one.If workers\u2019 share had not shrunk, they would have had an additional $532 billion, or about $3,400 each, said Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And at this point in the recovery, shifting some of those corporate profits to workers would have no effect on inflation, he noted.In the tug of war between workers and investors, Americans living on a paycheck have seldom been left with a shorter end of the rope.Fredy Amador has spent years working for various temporary help agencies, packing boxes of baby clothes, quality-checking packages of popcorn and doing other work at warehouses across the Chicago area. Despite what he says are frequent promises of permanent work, he has never been able to escape temp status.Recently, his situation got worse. He used to receive holidays and paid vacations, he said, but the agency that offered them lost its contract to another firm that did not. \u201cThey want to avoid all the benefits,\u201d said Mr. Amador.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Mr. Amador, 34, said he earns $12 an hour, far less than the $20 an hour or more earned by permanent employees doing similar work. For extra money, he drives for the ride-hailing service Lyft on the weekends. \u201cEven if you have really good skills, you have to start as a temp,\u201d said Mr. Amador, who moved to the United States from Honduras 12 years ago. \u201cThey never give you an opportunity to move on.\u201dThe recent tax overhaul has further pumped up corporate earnings. Promises that lower tax bills for businesses would translate into higher wages have yet to materialize. Higher gas and medical care costs have eaten away at whatever gains most workers have made.Nor are those extra profits going into business expansion. Since the first of the year, American companies including Apple, Wells Fargo and McDonald\u2019s have announced nearly $680 billion in buybacks of their own stock, according to the research firm TrimTabs. In essence, they are directing a majority of the windfall to investors and chief executives, who tend to have large stock-based compensation packages.Profits are also financing foreign mergers and acquisitions. \u201cA lot of U.S. businesses are looking abroad to see what they can buy,\u201d said Jason Gerlis, managing director of TMF Group U.S.A., a global consulting firm, \u201cbecause it\u2019s easier to finance or capitalize offshore.\u201dWhen the economy was struggling, employers became accustomed to inboxes flooded with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and snaking lines of eager applicants. Many may have forgotten, or never learned how, to compete for workers.When it comes to complaints of a labor shortage, as Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, has said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not raising wages, then it just sounds like whining.\u201dBen Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Delivers Another Defeat to the Status Quo in Latin America", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which has brought the party that governed the country for more than 70 years to the point of ruin, was the latest in a string of blistering defeats for incumbent parties across Latin America.Recent elections in the region have delivered decisive losses to governing parties of all political stripes.But while corruption, violence and inequality have been major issues in each country, no single ideology or issue explains the rejection of establishment politics. Voters, analysts said, are simply looking for new options, or at least different ones.Some countries, like Mexico, have tacked left; others, like Colombia and Chile, right. Often the move is in the opposite direction of the governing party, but not always, as was the case in Costa Rica and Ecuador.What the voters appear to have in common are higher expectations and more pressing demands for good government. Latin American nations, whose middle class has grown over the past two decades, are demanding more from their leaders.\u201cI just think there\u2019s this tendency to view Latin America in terms of a left-right divide,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cI think the sharper cleavage is over good governance.\u201dA widespread sense of frustration with governing parties was evident in recent elections in Chile and Colombia, where voters picked more conservative candidates to replace Presidents Michelle Bachelet and Juan Manuel Santos.A similar rejection of the status quo is making Brazil\u2019s coming presidential contest the most unpredictable and splintered in recent history.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador claimed a resounding victory on Sunday night with more than 50 percent of the vote, and his party, Morena, made a remarkably strong showing in congressional and state elections. The defeat was especially acute for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, which finished a distant third in the presidential vote and in congressional races.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador was able to capitalize on voter anger over corruption and inequality, which some attributed to market policies that failed to lift the incomes of the vast majority of people.\u201cThey have tried to keep the left out for 30 years to apply a technocratic model and they didn\u2019t respond to social demands,\u201d said Daniel Zovatto, the director for Latin America and the Caribbean for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. \u201cYesterday was a real earthquake to release that pressure.\u201dThe election elated the old-guard leftist leaders in the region.President Evo Morales of Bolivia said in a statement that he was certain that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201cdecisive victory will write a new page in the history of dignity and sovereignty in Latin America.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s autocratic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, called the election a \u201ctriumph of truth over lies\u201d that would bring Mexico and Venezuela closer.But viewing Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador as a standard Latin American leftist in the mold of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, or Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s former president, may be a misreading of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. As mayor of Mexico City in the early 2000s, he worked closely with the private sector and left office with an 80 percent approval rating. And while his policies are focused on social welfare, he has promised to respect the market economy.Daniel Lansberg-Rodr\u00edguez, an adjunct lecturer at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory represented a rejection of bad government and a repudiation of the status quo.\u201cThis was an outrage election,\u201d Mr. Lansberg-Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cIt was the rejection of a government model, and L\u00f3pez Obrador was able to harness that outrage in a way that he hadn\u2019t managed to successfully do before by making that pitch: that you\u2019ve had five or six administrations of U.S.-educated technocrats that have utterly failed to curb corruption and make your life better, and I\u2019m here not just to reform that status quo but to shatter it outright.\u201dFor some in the region, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador represents a new, pragmatic left, one that remains grounded in social programs but sees a role for private enterprise in his broader bid to end poverty.\u201cIn some of these electoral processes across the region we are witnessing the redefinition of left-leaning projects,\u201d said Rafael Rojas, a Cuban historian and professor at CIDE, a university in Mexico City.Indeed, Marta Lagos, the director of the polling organization Latinobar\u00f3metro, said it would be a mistake to see Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s victory as an endorsement of leftist policies.Rather, she said, it is a stark illustration of the tumbling faith Latin Americans have in democracy, establishment parties and institutions.\u201cIn Latin America, democracy hasn\u2019t been consolidated,\u201d said Ms. Lagos, who is based in Santiago, Chile. \u201cThere is a desperate search for someone who vows to do the right thing, and people are electing leaders who show up waving a magic wand.\u201dLatinobar\u00f3metro\u2019s most recent yearly survey, published in October, found that faith in democracy across Latin America had dropped to 53 percent in 2017 from 61 percent in 2010. The report called the gradual decline of support for democracy akin to \u201cdiabetes that does not generate alarm, and advances slowly and gradually across multiple indicators in various countries.\u201dThe number fell dramatically in Mexico. In 2017, only 18 percent of Mexicans interviewed by Latinobar\u00f3metro said they were satisfied with democracy, putting Mexico behind Venezuela, where 22 percent expressed satisfaction.The company admitted to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to officials up and down Latin America to secure lucrative infrastructure contracts. As prosecutors unraveled the scheme, presidents were forced to resign, and even placed in jail.\u201cOdebrecht gave corruption fantastic visibility, it\u2019s the pornography of corruption,\u201d Mr. Zovatto said. \u201cImpunity combined with mediocre growth and unsatisfied demands generates anti-establishment sentiment.\u201dA similar rejection of the status quo is making Brazil\u2019s presidential contest the most unpredictable and splintered in decades.The incumbent, President Michel Temer, whose popularity has oscillated in the single digits for much of his tenure, has decided not to run. At the same time, the parties that have competed for the presidency in previous years find themselves without viable standard bearers ahead of the October election.This has made the far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who just months ago was regarded as a fringe provocateur, a highly competitive candidate.While on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mr. Bolsonaro has also surged in the polls by vowing to take decisive action to curb corruption and violence. Like Mexico\u2019s president-elect, Mr. Bolsonaro has offered little in the way of specific policy proposals.Azam Ahmed reported from Mexico City, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.

The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab.

Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vulnerable Species in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Roman is a conservation biologist and author of a book on endangered species. Mr. Li is director of biodiversity at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center.The administration\u2019s proposal joins legislative efforts to retool the law. In examining them, we should ask two questions: Will these changes increase populations of endangered species, or at least slow their decline? And will they advance cooperation and reduce conflicts between the federal government and states, industries and landowners? Almost none of these recent proposals pass this test.But under the Barrasso plan, the agency would be required to give more weight to state-produced data \u2014 regardless of whether it is the best science. The federal government would also have to consult with every governor, state agency and county across the butterfly\u2019s 49-state range in developing a recovery plan. It would be the death of the monarch\u2019s recovery by a thousand bureaucratic cuts. This is not to say that the law should not be updated, or that its critics don\u2019t have legitimate complaints. Congress last revised it 30 years ago, and there are many ways to improve the law to reduce the compliance costs to industries like mining and logging, as well as developers and landowners. But specific answers to these concerns are largely unaddressed in this push to weaken the law.So what should be done?Some positive things are already happening. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service developed a plan to manage its program that lists species for protection, the most litigated part of the law. It specifies dates for the agency to make listing decisions for more than 350 species through 2023. Support for this is broad, ranging from environmental groups to ranchers to energy developers because it adds certainty to the process. The Barrasso bill would codify it, creating a listing program that is less controversial and more science-based. This is common sense.In addition, Congress should give states and landowners financial and legal incentives to help species recover. It should also direct federal agencies to develop clear standards for listing species, with objective and legally defensible criteria, such as population size and rate of decline. Incentives could be created to attract private capital to finance large-scale restoration projects and engage pharmaceutical companies to develop cures for diseases that threaten species, like white-nose syndrome in bats. We should celebrate these successes, as well as the economic benefits that can result from saving species. When the law was passed in 1973, few whales were left along the East Coast after centuries of whaling. Humpbacks have since returned to the waters off New York City, and whale-watching cruises leave Rockaway almost every summer day. In Massachusetts, the whale-watching industry contributes about $111 million to local economies each year, more than the commercial catch of finfish in the state. Saving rare species was never going to be easy, but it doesn\u2019t need to be as hard as Congress and others have made it. Protecting vulnerable plants and animals should always be the priority. But we also need to develop incentives to encourage the law\u2019s critics to become supporters. If that were to happen, innovation would follow, benefiting both the public and the species the law is intended to protect.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Billionaire Raj\u2019 Offers Reasons for Optimism in India\u2019s Gilded Age", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryFor close to a century leading up to its independence in 1947, India operated under a system of British governance known as the Raj, taken from a Sanskrit word meaning \u201ckingdom\u201d or \u201crule.\u201d Then, more or less until the introduction of economic liberalization in 1991, the country stagnated under a planned economy whose overwhelming regulatory demands were described as the License Raj.The title of the new book by James Crabtree, \u201cThe Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India\u2019s New Gilded Age,\u201d suggests that India has now come under the grip of a new but no less troublesome regime. In a nation no longer at the mercy of imperial administrators and maharajahs or petty bureaucrats, \u201ca new system has grown up,\u201d and the emerging superrich are firmly in charge.Mr. Crabtree, a former Mumbai bureau chief for The Financial Times, makes a compelling case for focusing on billionaires. In the mid-1990s, only two Indians made Forbes\u2019s annual list of the world\u2019s wealthiest. Twenty years later, there are over 100, behind only the United States, China and Russia. A World Bank economist recently found that the growth in wealth had been surpassed only by how quickly income inequality had increased. India now ranks above the United States, Brazil and even Russia. Only South Africa is less egalitarian.Unfortunately, Mr. Crabtree does not fully profile the diverse community of Indian billionaires, who collectively own close to half a trillion dollars in assets. In fact, he devotes only the shortest of the book\u2019s three sections to descriptions of individual billionaires. The more detailed and most entertaining of these are of the anachronistic Trump-like moguls who crave the spotlight, or the fallen moguls looking to redeem themselves and to settle scores.Mr. Crabtree seems to have had limited direct access to more mainstream billionaires like India\u2019s riches man, the Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose story frames the overall narrative of the book. A firsthand description of the 2015 Reliance public shareholder meeting is not particularly revealing.The failure of \u201cThe Billionaire Raj\u201d to deliver on the promise of a comprehensive portrait of a newly minted cluster of billionaires who rule the world\u2019s second most populous country does not mean the book is without interest. On the contrary, the book is chock-full of profoundly revealing vignettes from various corners of India\u2019s endlessly diverse society and economy. Mr. Crabtree introduces us to local political fixers, national anticorruption crusaders and even India\u2019s equivalent of Bill O\u2019Reilly (complete with a demagogic catchphrase: \u201dThe Nation Wants to Know!\u201d). The chaotic and complex nation that emerges does not appear to be under the rule of billionaires or anyone else.Two pervasive themes touch most of the assorted observations that fill \u201cThe Billionaire Raj\u201d: the influence on the country of corruption and of Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister since 2014. On both of these topics, Mr. Crabtree seems deeply conflicted.With respect to corruption, a distinction is made between the fleecing of public resources that underpinned the fortunes of many of the earliest Indian billionaires and an equally \u201cgrand but more orderly\u201d form of corruption in which the spoils are used to fund social progress and encourage growth. The latter is treated sympathetically, although the lines between the many forms of corruption described are far from clear.Mr. Modi has done much to reduce some of the most flagrant forms of corruption, but at the price of a disturbing increase in nationalism and a Trumpian authoritarian streak. Although Mr. Crabtree credits Mr. Modi with having \u201creset the balance of power between politics and business,\u201d he concedes that \u201ckickbacks still dominate swaths of public life.\u201d Despite these and a variety of other concerns about the current regime, he concludes that Mr. Modi\u2019s victory \u201crebuffed the notion that India itself had grown ungovernable, as if its turbulent democracy had become such a drag on its economy that it could not follow China\u2019s rapid process of development.\u201dAlthough there may be cause for such optimism, I could not find it in the pages of \u201cThe Billionaire Raj.\u201d Only 30 years ago, the economies of China and India were roughly the same size. China\u2019s economy is now almost five times as large, and at India\u2019s current growth rate, it would take decades for India to reach China\u2019s current size.As Mr. Crabtree\u2019s narrative makes plain, the primary source of financial corruption \u2014 the immovable rot at the base of the Indian economy \u2014 is \u201cthe exorbitant and rapidly rising election costs for political parties, which has pushed them to raise huge quantities of illicit funds.\u201d A candidate in a close parliamentary race must raise at least $1 million, a monumental sum that is largely unachievable without some illicit quid pro quo. It is hard not to conclude that India\u2019s turbulent democracy poses a serious threat to its future development. If you want to feel better about our own problems in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United, read \u201cThe Billionaire Raj.\u201dMr. Crabtree believes \u201cthere is no reason\u201d that India\u2019s current Gilded Age cannot \u201cblossom into a Progressive Era of its own, in which the perils of inequality and crony capitalism are left decisively behind.\u201d The nuanced portrait of contemporary India that he has provided may not support this level of confidence, but I can\u2019t help but agree with Mr. Crabtree that \u201cthe world\u2019s hopes for a more democratic, liberal future\u201d very much depend on India\u2019s \u201cgetting this transition right.\u201dJonathan A.

{"Headline": "The Water Wars of Arizona", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "FeatureAttracted by lax regulations, industrial agriculture has descended on a remote valley, depleting its aquifer \u2014 leaving many residents with no water at all.Supported byA small woman with a tight smile and a bright orange streak in her hair, Lori was immediately unnerved by the sight. Like all homes in the valley, where there are no reservoirs or rivers, the Paups\u2019 house drew its water from a private well drilled into the underlying aquifer. According to the real estate listing, the well reached a depth of more than 300 feet. Lori, who is 51 and a mother of five, reminded herself of this when, a few moments later, the sand appeared to clear and the water again looked normal. Busy with other projects, she scribbled a note to call the previous owners, figuring there was dirt clogged in the kitchen pipes. Soon enough, she forgot about it.A few days later, Lori and her daughter Amy were doing laundry when the washing machine stopped filling with water. Then, a few hours later, the dishwasher conked out, too. Craig, who had serviced his own diesel truck for some 20 years, inspected both machines but couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with either. It was the pipes feeding them that seemed to be the issue; they merely trickled, then sputtered out sand. Having lived in the rural mountains of Pennsylvania, Craig and Lori were both familiar with wells; they picked the house on East Hopi for its sweeping views eastward to the Chiricahua Mountains but also for the solitude that came with owning a remote piece of property, which was only possible so long as they had their own source of water. But as worrisome as the incidents seemed, they didn\u2019t yet form any recognizable pattern. One evening sometime later, Lori drew a bath and left the room. When she returned a while later, she found the tub stood only half full, the water murky with silt. She watched, over the next few moments, as a thin layer of sand settled along the bottom.A local driller arrived for an inspection a short while later. Visible from most rooms in the house, the well consisted of a five-horsepower pump, an eight-inch-wide borehole and a screen that filtered dirt and rock from the aquifer\u2019s water. Although the well was somewhat old, it appeared to be in good working order, the driller explained, capable of pumping 25 gallons a minute, enough to supply a home many times larger than the Paups\u2019. The stoppages and intrusions of sand, he went on, in all likelihood signaled that the water level had begun dipping below the mouth of the pipe, causing the pump to act as a vacuum for sand. The problem wasn\u2019t the well, in other words; it was the aquifer, which had retreated below where the well could reach it.\u201cYou\u2019re running out of water,\u201d Lori recalls the driller telling them. There was no way of knowing how long the remaining water might last.Over the next few weeks, as the Paups asked around, they heard from one neighbor, then a half-dozen more, who had begun finding sand in their water. Soon, at least 100 families from all across the valley had failing or dry wells. On Sept. 24, after scores of angry families demanded action, a regularly scheduled visit from state representatives turned into a de facto emergency water meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. Word of the dry wells had traveled quickly around the state, and Michael J. Lacey, who was then the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (A.D.W.R.), made the three-hour drive from Phoenix for the standing-room-only meeting. The politicians had hardly begun to speak when men and women in cowboy hats grew impatient and cut them off, shouting, \u201cWater!\u201d For the next two hours, Lacey tried to retain control as panicked families rose one after another and told their stories.The Paups didn\u2019t attend the meeting, but they needed only to drive a few miles in any direction to see where their water was going. Stretching outward from downtown Willcox, the hub of the valley, lay a sprawling latticework of recently cultivated farms and nut orchards. Local farmers had watched over the last decade and a half as waves of industrial farms arrived, tilling so much land that dust storms began darkening the sky. These enormous corporations were descending on the valley for the same reason homesteaders had a century ago: the year-round growing season and the lax regulation. Compared with those for rivers and lakes, few laws govern the extraction of groundwater today. Aquifers across the globe are beginning to quietly dry up under the compounded strain of increased food production and a two-decade stretch that now includes the 10 warmest years in recorded history, sending farmers plumbing deeper for deposits of water.At the meeting, residents accused farmers of sucking the water out from under them and the state of shirking its responsibilities. Lacey, the A.D.W.R. official, argued that the state couldn\u2019t put water back into their wells. The only solution for homeowners, the officials explained, was to chase the water downward, by deepening their wells a few hundred feet. The cost of this, residents knew, was $15,000 to $30,000 \u2014 as much as half the value of some homes in the valley.With most of their life savings invested in the home, the Paups couldn\u2019t afford to move or drill deeper, so in early October Lori and Craig held a family meeting, talking with their children about a system of water rationing, as they watched the well\u2019s output dwindle from 100 gallons a day to 50. (The average household in Phoenix uses more than 540.) Showers, they explained, would have to be fewer and faster. They set up buckets to catch runoff and poured leftover dishwater in the toilet. By the end of their fourth month in Arizona, it wasn\u2019t unusual for the Paups to go two or three days without running water. Unthinkable just a few months before, a single thought began to occupy Lori\u2019s waking hours: \u201cWhat happens when we run out?\u201dMost North American aquifers lie beneath the Western United States and date back to the beginning of the continent as we know it. Six million years ago, as the Rocky Mountains thrust upward, rivers gashed deep channels in the crust, separating ranges with basins that gradually filled with eroded rock, trapping water beneath it. One of the largest aquifers in the world, the Ogallala, which runs through eight Plains states, is not a vast subterranean lake, as one might imagine, but a 174,000-square-mile layer of waterlogged earth, moving and twisting through strata of dry rock like a wet article of clothing in the laundry bin. Subject to eons of pressure, every aquifer arranges itself differently, forming vast networks of coves and seams of water, some a thousand feet thick but others just a thin vein. Aquifers are unimaginably complex and incredibly fragile; once tapped, they can take more than 6,000 years to replenish.Among the most vulnerable aquifers are those underlying the desert basins of the American Southwest. The Sulphur Springs Valley, in Arizona\u2019s far southeastern corner, is one such basin. Surrounded on three sides by steep mountain ranges, the valley is an unusually flat and level 1,900-square-mile expanse of sagebrush and tanglegrass, which acts as a massive natural vessel for rain and snowmelt. In geological terms, it is a \u201cclosed basin,\u201d as none of its water rejoins a river. Instead, it pools at the center, percolating into the ground. Centuries of evaporation have transformed this ancient lake bed into a dry alkali flat, inhabited today by a migratory roost of 30,000 sandhill cranes. Beneath it, buried in layers of sediment, lies all the water that never flowed to the ocean. Some of it is more than 20,000 years old.Around the turn of the 20th century, when sulfurous water was discovered bubbling out of the ground, cattle ranches and homesteads began to proliferate across the valley. One of the first deep water wells was drilled around 1915, when Texas farmers began adopting the oil industry\u2019s turbine pump. Overnight, this innovation allowed agriculture to stray deep into arid climates, and in the span of a generation, the valley became home to a thriving agricultural economy. In the late 1990s, during the first few years of what would eventually turn out to be a 19-year-and-counting Arizona drought, only about 15,000 acre-feet of water were estimated to have percolated into the aquifer each year, while 100,000 were being pumped out; as the valley continued to warm throughout the 2000s and 2010s, with rainfall and snowmelt plummeting, estimates for recharge went unrecorded, as annual pumping soared to 200,000 acre feet. Once, it had been possible for ranchers to develop natural springs into watering holes using only a shovel. Now, after watching water levels drop 100 to 300 feet in 35 years, some farmers wondered how long they could go on.Until the last three decades, the technology to make detailed maps of these underground waterways did not readily exist. It wasn\u2019t until 2015, in fact, that NASA published its first comprehensive study of global groundwater reserves. The mission began in 2002, with the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace), two satellites that follow each other in orbit, measuring changes in gravitational pull. The mission\u2019s primary purpose was to look at ice-sheet depletion, but over the next several years Dr. Jay Famiglietti, the senior water scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and his team noticed that many of the most significant sites of water loss were actually below ground. Of the planet\u2019s 37 major aquifer systems, they discovered, 21 were on the verge of collapse. In the Great Plains, farmers had exhausted a third of Ogallala\u2019s potable water in just 30 years. In California, the Central Valley aquifer was showing signs that it could drop beyond human reach by the middle of this century. But the worst declines were in Asia and the Middle East, where some of the planet\u2019s oldest aquifers were already running out of water. \u201cWhile we are so busy worrying about the water that we can see,\u201d Famiglietti told me, \u201cthe water that we can\u2019t see, the groundwater, is quietly disappearing.\u201dIn the United States, it is disappearing most rapidly in the rural agricultural belt extending from Kansas to California. Without ready access to more traditional stores of water, many farmers have been forced to rely even more heavily on groundwater, pitting them against local residents watching their wells go dry. In 2014, in Tulare County, Calif., 7,000 people ran out of drinking water. The next year, wells hit a record low, as 64 percent recorded declines nationwide and one in 30 failed in Western states. Squeezed by drought and tightening regulations, large farms started to seek out lesser-known pockets of cheap water. In rural Arizona, where there are essentially no groundwater regulations governing irrigation, they found an ideal destination. \u201cWhat the smart money is doing is looking around and saying, \u2018Where else can we go where there is no regulation?\u2019\u2009\u201d Robert Glennon, a professor of water law and policy at the University of Arizona and the author of \u201cWater Follies,\u201d told NPR in an interview. \u201cAnd that is Arizona.\u201dArizona was particularly attractive to Middle Eastern farmers. A policy of unregulated pumping on the Arabian Peninsula had, in 40 years, drained aquifers that had taken 20,000 years to form, leaving thousands of acres fallow and forcing Saudi Arabia and others to outsource much of their agricultural production. In 2014, a Saudi Arabian-owned company, the Almarai Corporation, bought 10,000 acres in the town of Vicksburg, northwest of Sulphur Springs Valley, planting alfalfa to ship halfway around the world to feed Saudi cattle. Then, a United Arab Emirates farming corporation, Al Dahra, bought several thousand-acre farms along both sides of the Arizona-California border. These purchases were perfectly legal, but many residents felt these newcomers were essentially \u201cexporting water.\u201d At least once, the Sheriff\u2019s Department in Vicksburg deployed five deputies to stand guard at a town-hall meeting.With less rain and snow reaching the desert floor, overpumping has rendered a semi-renewable resource finite, touching off the kind of resource war perhaps more familiar to coal camps and oil boomtowns. Hydrogeologists use the phrase \u201cgroundwater mining\u201d to describe situations in which the rate of water withdrawal exceeds the rate of replenishment. For some, the metaphor offers a stark lesson. \u201cIf we know we\u2019re mining the water, let\u2019s just say it,\u201d said Richard Searle, when I visited at his ranch outside Willcox. At 63, Searle still cuts a frontiersman\u2019s profile; a cutting-horse competitor and former bank manager, he is descended from a prominent ranching family and formerly served as county supervisor. Part of the reason groundwater mining in the valley hadn\u2019t forced a reckoning earlier, he said, was that water was ubiquitous to the point of being invisible. Local farmers were never required to put meters on their wells, he pointed out, which meant that nobody knew exactly how much water was being pumped, much less how much was left. \u201cLong term, people say we should search for a solution,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t want to be the ones to suffer.\u201dSeated at his desk, Searle reached and opened a glass cabinet, lifting out arrowheads and a stone ax blade that he dug out of his ranch over the last 50 years. \u201cYou know, we weren\u2019t the first ones here in this valley, and we weren\u2019t the first ones struggling with water,\u201d he said. His face turned pensive, and he spoke for a time about the ancient Hohokam and Tohono O\u2019odham tribes, which traversed this part of the Sonoran Desert for thousands of years without digging deep wells. \u201cBut the mining industry isn\u2019t a long-term industry,\u201d he continued. \u201cName me a long-term mining community. Ajo, Pearce \u2014 those are ghost towns. Pecos was like this: a natural resource mined until the town fell apart around it. If we die, it\u2019ll be a slow one. If the whole county dries up, it\u2019ll be just a blip on the radar.\u201dOver the previous decade, the price per pound for pecans and pistachios has roughly doubled, driven largely by demand from China. But those nuts, like almonds, require an exorbitant amount of both water and capital to farm. An average orchard can cost more than $20,000 an acre to clear and raise, in part because the trees don\u2019t bear nuts for five to 12 years. In the valley, where land is a fraction of the price of California\u2019s, the principal cost for nut farmers is water. During sapling years, trees consume only about two acre-feet of water a year but grow to require as much as six acre-feet when mature, among the highest of any crop. To ensure a consistent supply of water from an aquifer already plummeting deeper every year, farmers often drill a well every 160 acres, each to a depth of at least 1,000 or 1,500 feet. One farming conglomerate, expanding from Minnesota, bought or drilled 293 wells, some pumping more than 2,000 gallons a minute.Suddenly, the very qualities of the valley that had nurtured generations of family agriculture \u2014 its cheap ground, its lack of groundwater regulation \u2014 seemed to threaten its existence. In the span of a few months, Intent to Drill notices increased almost fivefold, as Chase Farms and the National Pecan Company, two of the largest pecan growers in the world, bought and consolidated several thousand-acre farms. Soon, tree-nut orchards blanketed about 20,000 acres, forcing the state to put a six-month moratorium on new farms. (Today, there are 35,000 acres of tree nuts in the valley.) The groundwater had created, as local farmer Ted Haas put it, \u201ca gold-rush mentality,\u201d which in the next five years yielded a dozen new vineyards, as well as 20,000 acres of corn and wheat and 16 greenhouses for NatureSweet Tomatoes, the country\u2019s largest producer. As yearly water consumption doubled, the sands and gravels within the aquifer began to shift and collapse, causing the elevation to sink more than 15 feet in places. About 50 miles of earth fissures ruptured the surface of the valley, even splitting a major highway in half.To Seitz, the farmers\u2019 arrival seemed like a blessing at first. \u201cThere\u2019s more outside money moving in, and it\u2019s great for the area,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for the John Deere dealership. I\u2019m in the crop-consulting business \u2014 if I sell product, it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s good for irrigation companies.\u201d But a few weeks after the community meeting, Seitz sent a concerned email to 15 of his clients and business partners. \u201cWe need to get together and figure this water thing out,\u201d he wrote. As more farms arrived and more families lost water, Seitz had come to realize that the boom was \u201cgood for the area on one hand, but we\u2019re still shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d Most of the recipients were, like Seitz, prominent local farmers who owned modest, family-run acreages with long legacies in the valley.Seitz knew the responsibility of preventing further groundwater loss would in all likelihood fall to its greatest perpetrators: farmers. He also knew that to do so they would in all likelihood have to accept what their ancestors had come to this corner of the desert to avoid: regulation. Seitz figured that placing some sort of limit on groundwater use was the only way to stabilize the aquifer. It was also the only way to protect farmers who had been in the valley for generations against industrial-scale operations that could simply pick up and move to other untapped seams of water once the valley\u2019s aquifer was too deep, salty or expensive to draw from. But imposing regulations on corporate farms also meant imposing regulations on friends and neighbors \u2014 and on themselves. If they were going to save the aquifer, the farmers would have to administer policies harming their own livelihoods.When the group first met at the Elks Lodge, pushing card tables together, the mood was somber. Coverage of the valley\u2019s dry wells had fed months of bad press, strengthening the growing perception that agriculture was stealing water from impoverished homeowners. A local petition was circulating, with 500 signatures, demanding a moratorium on agriculture drilling. With the U.S.D.A.\u2019s recent designation of the county as a natural disaster area because of drought and the A.D.W.R. conducting a survey of dry wells in the valley, government action felt imminent. It seemed to Seitz and the others that if they didn\u2019t come up with a solution, one might be imposed on them.Most groundwater rights in Arizona are still based on the frontier legal doctrine of \u201creasonable use,\u201d which holds that a landowner retains the right to pump as much water as he or she pleases, so long as it\u2019s put to a \u201creasonable use\u201d such as farming. In 1980, Arizona became the first state to pass groundwater reform, effectively deeming groundwater a public rather than a private resource. But in the years since, few regulatory safeguards have extended beyond the boundaries of Tucson and Phoenix. Outside those places, little has changed since statehood in 1912: A farmer needed only to file an Intent to Drill notice and pay a $150 permitting fee and was then free to pump as much as desired. For valley farmers, growing high-water crops like alfalfa and nuts, this often meant about 2,000 gallons, roughly the capacity of a tanker truck, every minute, 24 hours a day, with only intermittent breaks for several months. In 2017 alone, one farm pumped 22 billion gallons, nearly double the volume of bottled water sold in the United States annually.For nearly all the men in the room \u2014 white and weather-beaten, in late middle age, having spent several decades on horseback \u2014 the \u201claw of the largest pump\u201d was the only one they had ever known. But no one in the room needed to be reminded of the challenges they faced: a rapidly warming climate, bottomed-out commodity prices and out-of-state funding that could afford to drill more and deeper than they could. Pinned between corporate farms draining the water out from under them and a community blaming them for it, the men began to speak openly of a future where their children could not live in the valley.For the next year, the farmers met monthly for four hours, ironing out a proposal for a \u201cwithdrawal fee\u201d on agricultural wells \u2014 the word \u201ctax,\u201d Seitz says, was carefully avoided \u2014 plus a freeze on large-scale irrigation and a limit on high-water-use crops. In effect, they would create a management zone, protecting the aquifer, and by extension their own farms, from deep water exploration by new and corporate competitors. They had only just begun to finalize the proposal in the early spring of 2015 when word of the closed-door meetings began to spread. Many felt any restriction on water would devalue property and, worse, deal yet another blow to the declining self-rule of rural culture. Townspeople arrived at committee members\u2019 homes at all hours, accusing them of theft.By the spring of 2015, Seitz feared that the longer they deliberated, the more bad blood would be stirred up. In nearby towns, similar disputes over water turned violent. Already, Seitz had lost several customers, and neighbors had begun turning away from him at the grocery store. One morning he awoke to an op-ed in The Arizona Range News accusing another committee member, Mark Cook, of being an outside operator. \u201cI have dug graves, helped bury some 100 old-timers that were homesteaders,\u201d an elderly resident wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t recall any of Mr. Mark Cook\u2019s people in the valley.\u201d (Cook, in response, supplied the newspaper with a list of farms in his family dating back to the 1880s.) In nearby San Simon, calls for a drilling ban provoked several fist fights, some among longtime friends. Farmers felt betrayed to see other farmers, sometimes people they went to high school with, take sides against them. There were even rumors of death threats against those pushing the water proposal.But by late May, the start of the summer growing season, it began to take half a day to eke out five gallons, barely enough to flush the toilet twice. Unable to rely on the well\u2019s outflow, Lori began each morning by filling a bucket for dishes, then placing glasses and bowls under each faucet with the tap open, hoping to catch any residual water. She put stoppers in each drain and set up a gray-water station in the kitchen. \u201cWe don\u2019t use any water until we need it,\u201d Craig told his kids, who were frustrated mainly by the short showers. It had become commonplace by then for some in the family to bathe only once every four or five days and for scarcely long enough to wash their hair. Trying to see how far they could stretch each gallon, Lori and Craig gave their children incentives to come up with novel ways to conserve. At one point, David rigged up an outdoor shower that used bottled water, warming it up by laying a black PVC pipe across a piece of sheet metal in the sun.For Seitz and the farmers, watching families like the Paups suffer was by turns exasperating and motivating. Some felt that embracing the desert lifestyle meant learning its tough lessons \u2014 one of which, as Seitz says, is \u201cyou either drill deeper or you don\u2019t survive.\u201d But others acknowledged that families didn\u2019t have access to the sort of loans and Department of Agriculture support that farmers did. And as summer came to a close, the committee began to think about ways their proposal might assist local families.A few months later, shortly before the next legislative session, Seitz and five other farmers gathered in a basement conference room at the capital, in Phoenix, to present their proposal. Seven of the original 14 committee members decided against making the trip. After weathering months of phone and email attacks, a few of them had bowed out of the committee completely. One of them later told his brother that he would never serve on a board again. \u201cWould you rather arbitrate water use in the Sulphur Springs Valley or peace in Israel?\u201d his brother asked me. Others simply felt there were too many forces already marshaled against them, including the state\u2019s strong agriculture and ranching lobbies.Dressed in jeans and cowboy boots, Seitz explained to several state representatives and lawyers that there was clear evidence the aquifer was at serious risk of failure. Given that climate models offered little hope of restoring the aquifer to \u201csafe yield\u201d \u2014 in which percolated water and withdrawals are roughly even \u2014 the committee instead proposed stabilizing it by limiting water-intensive crops and charging fees for irrigation-related extraction. \u201cIf nothing else, we need to slow the decline,\u201d Seitz said. The fees generated by their proposal would be used to fund aquifer recharge, a process by which water is returned to the aquifer through a vast network of soaking pools. But the fund would also go a step further, Seitz continued, by supplying aid to those families who had lost their water supply, like the Paups.\u201cWe felt sympathy for them,\u201d Seitz later told me. \u201cOn some level, we know we\u2019re responsible.\u201dLeaving the capital, Seitz allowed himself to feel, as he put it, only \u201ccautiously hopeful.\u201d Watching the water war unfold seemed to have made some of the state representatives nervous to intervene, and the cattle and ranching lobbies had each voiced vehement opposition to any change in regulation, however regionally focused. Sensing the bill\u2019s probable failure, the farmers stopped at Texas Roadhouse and over rounds of beers took solace in having tried to remedy things democratically. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a lot of government involvement,\u201d Seitz told me, \u201cbut something like this, on water issues, the government really needs to be involved.\u201d It was the only way to keep neighbors from being pitted against neighbors. A few months later, after the end of the legislative session, Seitz learned the proposal was never drafted into bill form.For the last few years, Bales\u2019s deliveries have been the sole measure of water security for many families in the valley, including the Paups. The 525 gallons that he delivered to them every week or so still required rationing, but the tank\u2019s presence brought the Paups their first semblance of normalcy in years. When we arrived at their house, just past 8 a.m., Bales and David Paup went about filling the tank, along with a new thousand-gallon auxiliary one, with the studied efficiency of routine. As the fear of losing water has subsided for the Paups, a sense of fatalism has settled in its place. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all gone, they\u2019re going to leave,\u201d Craig said, referring to the farmers. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all going to be stuck here with what? Nothing.\u201dAs the Paups entered their fourth year without running water, they were left with a single inescapable problem: their home. Expenses related to hauling water to their house cost them nearly $200 a month, effectively increasing their mortgage payment by 50 percent. Little outlays \u2014 laundromat, bottled water, air-conditioners \u2014 had begun to add up, and Craig had been forced to take monthlong trucking routes on the East Coast. Unable to recoup the four years of equity they had put into the home and unable to move on without it, they felt trapped. With little possibility of selling the house or seeking redress, Lori and Craig had begun talking about abandoning it. They saw dozens of their neighbors walk off their property over the last few years, including a close friend, Billy Frisbee, whose camper caught fire after his well pump combusted from filling with sand. Many of the empty homes lay just a few blocks away, piles of furniture and clothes still visible inside.In March, the Paups received an offer to become the caretakers of a ranch one mile away. The ranch consisted of 11 acres, a mobile home similar to their own and a newly deepened well. All the same, Lori was hesitant. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to go,\u201d she told me. \u201cBecause there\u2019s farming everywhere.\u201d Earlier that month, the largest water user in the valley, Riverview, announced plans to double its local dairy operation, adding another 8,000 cows to its 20,000 acres, some of which nearly bordered the Paups\u2019 potential new home. Looking at the property on Google Earth, hemmed in by bright green crop circles, Lori felt the move might be a gamble. But so, too, was staying. After discussing it as a family, the Paups left the house on East Hopi Drive in late April and moved to the ranch.Before moving, the first thing Lori did was walk into the kitchen to test the water pressure. \u201cIt was nerve-racking,\u201d she told me, when we talked over the phone a few weeks later. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering what might happen when you turn on the sink. What it could mean.\u201d She had been dreading this moment for days. The thought of it paralyzed her. After taking a few moments to collect herself, she opened the tap. Water poured out, crystal clear.For now, the ranch has running water. But the Paups continue to practice much of the same conservation routine as before: using gray water, taking quick showers. As Lori pointed out, their situation remains, at heart, unchanged: awaiting safeguards, as the aquifer retreats quietly beneath them. \u201cI\u2019d like to be somewhere permanent,\u201d Lori said the last time we spoke. \u201cEventually.\u201dIn the midst of the tensions in Willcox, the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, announced the creation of a water-conservation committee, aimed at groundwater security and reform. Even so, this year only two rural groundwater bills have been introduced in the State House. Each proposed, among other things, to lift regulations, in order to make way for a 7,000-home and a 28,000-home development, respectively, just outside the Sulphur Springs Valley. In a promotional video for one, which boasts vineyards and at least one golf course, the developer calls southeastern Arizona \u201cthe best kept secret in the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariffs? Time for a Plan B: \u2018Gobble Up Every Bit of Material That I Can\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith tariffs driving up the price of stainless steel, the precision-part manufacturer Accu-Swiss in Oakdale, Calif., came up with a plan to save money: turn off the lights but keep the machines on.\u201cWe are being hurt because of the cost increase,\u201d said Sohel Sareshwala, the company\u2019s owner and president. To squeeze more output from existing equipment, he is \u201crunning the machines in a lights-out operation.\u201d After his regular 10-person staff leaves for the day at 6 p.m., Mr. Sareshwala said, the plant is experimenting with slowing down the machines and letting them run unattended for four more hours.For large and small businesses around the nation, the impact of tariffs is expected to grow on Friday, after the Trump administration placed additional duties on $34 billion of Chinese products, many used in American manufacturing. China had said it would respond immediately with sanctions of its own.Mr. Sareshwala is among a growing number of importers and exporters departing from business as usual because of the gathering storm of trade sanctions.For Mr. Sareshwala at Accu-Swiss, Plan B is already the new normal.In his 19 years at the company, which produces parts for devices and machines used in the biomedical, food and semiconductor industries, he has dealt with a few unanticipated events, from the dot-com bust to the Great Recession. But until recently, it probably would have made more sense for him to plan for an earthquake at his San Joaquin Valley plant than a hefty tariff on his primary raw material.\u201cIt is very ironic to prepare for this kind of contingency in the United States,\u201d he said.Accu-Swiss doesn\u2019t use imported steel, but the tariffs have ratcheted up the demand for domestic steel, making it harder to find and afford. So far, Mr. Sareshwala said, his priority is delivering orders on time, regardless of the cost.\u201cI use a lot of stainless steel, so I\u2019m still trying to gobble up every bit of material that I can and not worry about the dollars and cents,\u201d he said. That strategy may wipe out his single-digit profit margin or even bring on a loss, he said, but in the short term he would rather lose money than customers.At the plant, in addition to the lights-out operation, Mr. Sareshwala has begun to stagger the starts of daytime shifts to stretch out the time in which operators are tending the machines.Since the 2016 election, the president\u2019s declarations about his readiness to wage a trade war have prompted heavy users of steel \u2014 foreign and domestic \u2014 to look into alternative supply lines. But some businesses said their contingency plans had not anticipated the extent of the shortages and rapidity of price increases, which started months ago.\u201cIn a few days, domestic companies raised prices on stainless steel anywhere from 15 to 25 percent,\u201d said Joe Carlson, president of Lakeside Manufacturing, a medical and food service equipment maker in Milwaukee with 175 employees. He is also president of the North American Association of Food Equipment Manufacturers, which represents more than 550 companies.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business 24 years, and I\u2019ve seen price increases and tariffs,\u201d Mr. Carlson said, \u201cbut haven\u2019t seen this combination before.\u201dEdward Farrer, director of purchasing at Principal Manufacturing in Broadview, Ill., which produces automobile parts, has felt the same effect. His company, which employs 330 people and has $50 million in annual sales, is a purchaser of imported steel and has not been able to find a domestic alternative.Even if one emerges, he said, \u201cthe tariffs have been a springboard for domestic producers to increase their price\u201d \u2014 and those higher costs will put American companies like his at a disadvantage compared with foreign manufacturers. Moreover, he said, any change in Principal\u2019s suppliers would require customer approval, an exhaustive process that would cause significant delays.Principal \u2014 whose customers include automotive suppliers and other major companies in the United States and abroad \u2014 accounts for contingencies like unexpected price swings in its contracts. \u201cWe have agreement for the ups and downs of markets,\u201d Mr. Farrer said, \u201cbut the increases are so significant now, customers are pushing back. Some discussions are contentious.\u201d\u201cDelivery dates are not changing, and product must be on time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are caught in the middle between politics, customers and steel producers.\u201dJohn Ferriola, president of Nucor, the largest American steel maker, said growing demand \u2014 driven by tax cuts and a rollback in federal regulation \u2014 was primarily responsible for the price increases.\u201cTariffs will result in some long-term price increases as excess, artificially low-cost foreign material is taken out of the market,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as steel buyers adjust to new supply chains and new domestic production comes online, we expect prices will normalize.\u201dSeveral manufacturers, however, said they were skeptical that domestic steel and aluminum makers had the capacity to meet the increased demand any time soon, and worried that prices would continue to rise \u2014 and even threaten jobs at their own companies. Mr. Farrer has halted all hiring, leaving about 30 positions unfilled, and has canceled, at least for now, a major capital purchase, two large machine tools.Mark Vaughn has similarly put a brake on hiring at his metal stamping plant in Nashville. As the year started, he planned to add five or six new machinists in $28-an-hour jobs. His tax bill was going down, he had a fat backlog of orders, and one of his biggest clients, the Swedish appliance manufacturer Electrolux, was planning to invest $250 million to modernize its nearby Springfield plant.Vaughn Manufacturing\u2019s backlog has dwindled, and Mr. Vaughn said he would probably have to revise price quotes he promised six months ago. Instead of expanding his work force, which he described as \u201cvery highly skilled,\u201d he is thinking of cutting five to 10 jobs out of his 50-person staff.The first rule in his contingency plan, he said, is to \u201ctake care of what you got and not overexpand.\u201d\u201cWe were probably in line for $2 million to $3 million worth of work\u201d making cooktops for Electrolux, he explained. And as for the new tax cuts, he pointed out, \u201cTariffs are a tax, so they took that advantage right back out of there.\u201dIn Milwaukee, Mr. Carlson of Lakeside Manufacturing said he had contracts to get steel through the summer, but was worried about the fall. All the steel distributors, including his own, want to take care of their biggest customers first, he said. At the same time, the largest companies are hoarding as much steel as they can, making it tougher for smaller businesses to find alternatives.Before the tariff threats, steel orders took six to eight weeks. Once the announcement was made in March, the wait time grew to eight to 12 weeks. \u201cNow we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to get our orders filled,\u201d Mr. Carlson said. \u201cWe\u2019re hand-to-mouth.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the corporate title of Edward Farrer of Principal Manufacturing. He is director of purchasing, not president.Claire Ballentine contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity.Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J.Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I\u2019m not the only young conservative here. It\u2019s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism.What does \u201cconservative\u201d mean to you?I\u2019m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you\u2019re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves.Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier?A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I\u2019m in a class and I share my political opinion, I\u2019m basically the bigot, that\u2019s what I\u2019m called. In my literature class we were reading \u201c1984,\u201d and my teacher compared \u201c1984\u201d to President Trump\u2019s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down.Where do you get your information from?I watch a lot of Fox News. I try to get a lot of news from sources that aren\u2019t controlled by big corporations. Sometimes I get news from the internet. I like Rebel Media \u2014 it\u2019s not controlled by a big company.What have you learned from the summit?It\u2019s making me more confident to go back to school. There are lots of liberals at my school, and I\u2019ll feel less embarrassed about saying what I believe and really standing for it. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, I like that he can\u2019t be controlled. Trump communicates directly with the people. He tells the people exactly what they want, he hears their concerns, and he\u2019ll deal with it.Mason Scioneaux, 18, is from Vacherie, La., and will be a freshman this fall at the University of Mississippi.Why did you come here?A friend and I started a political science group during our junior year of high school. We saw a lack of political interest on both sides. It was the 2016 election, a huge time to voice your political opinions. We\u2019ve been very active in south Louisiana, making connections with local politicians. We saw the opportunity to attend the summit, and the slate of speakers was very impressive.It\u2019s important to be politically open-minded, not necessarily to subscribe to a certain person, whether it\u2019s President Trump or Hillary Clinton. For me, it\u2019s important to listen and decide for myself what I believe to be right and true.What were the political beliefs of your classmates? Our high school was kind of split between conservatives and liberals. Our community was like that, too. The parish my high school is in is very liberal, and the parish I live in is split. It\u2019s an area you can\u2019t really define, between conservative Baton Rouge and more liberal New Orleans. My high school is about 70 percent white. The friend I\u2019m here with is a conservative Latino.I think this generation is now getting more opinionated than any generation before. We\u2019re more politically aware, and it\u2019s definitely because of social media. People go on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and have access to so much direct information, like what President Trump tweeted. They\u2019re not just voting as their parents vote. Young people are being fed information, they don\u2019t have to seek it. On one hand, it\u2019s an era of conservatism aligned with Trump. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, but I\u2019m going to criticize him. You get more moderate conservatives who are more open-minded than others, fiscally conservative but more socially liberal. Blindly following any person is what gets us into trouble.What is your vision for America?The biggest problem in America is polarization. It would be refreshing to see people on both sides come together to discuss how to fix our problems. Today it seems everyone is either on the deep right or deep left, with just name-calling and personal attacks. We need less politics and more problem-solving. We have to be willing to compromise, both sides have to give and take. One thing I\u2019d like to see is term limits on members of Congress. It would put pressure on them not to be complacent and to work for the people\u2019s interests, rather than political lobbyists.Where do you get your information?I\u2019ll go on Google News and open articles from Fox News, CNN, Politico and The New York Times. If you\u2019re always getting news from CNN, that\u2019s going to make you a liberal. If it\u2019s from Fox News, that\u2019s going to make you conservative. I try to stay aware. Writing off climate change, that it\u2019s a hoax, is over the top. Ignoring the problem and denying it isn\u2019t going to do anything.Grace Klassen 18, will be a freshman this fall at North Dakota State University.

{"Headline": "Have a Cryptocurrency Company? Bermuda, Malta or Gibraltar Wants You", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hedge funds go to the Cayman Islands to incorporate. Big companies are generally domiciled in Delaware. And online poker companies often set up their bases in Gibraltar and Malta.Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia.In small countries and territories including Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, officials have recently passed laws, or have legislation in the works, to make themselves more welcoming to cryptocurrency companies and projects. In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval.\u201cWe are 65,000 people, and 20 square miles, but we have a very advanced economy,\u201d the premier of Bermuda, E. David Burt, said in an interview at a cryptocurrency conference in May in New York, where he was trying to pitch companies on the island\u2019s charms. \u201cWe want to position Bermuda as the incubator for this industry.\u201dVolatility and uncertainty have deterred some countries and caused others to hesitate in embracing crypto companies. In China, the government banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings after many of its citizens were swept up in the frenzy and bet their savings on digital tokens. And the Japanese authorities halted the operations of several crypto exchanges this year after one of the biggest licensed exchanges was hacked.Bermuda has been a leading player. Apart from passing the law to allow for fast approval of initial coin offerings, the British territory has a law in the works to open the doors to cryptocurrency exchanges and related services. Mr. Burt said his government was modeling its approach on one it had taken with the insurance industry, in which Bermuda has become a major player.Bermuda\u2019s measures have attracted Will McDonough, the founder of a new cryptocurrency called iCash. He said he had decided to base his company there because of the island\u2019s experience in international finance and the government\u2019s willingness to listen to the company\u2019s input.\u201cThe largest issue blockchain companies have is not knowing how they\u2019ll be governed or regulated,\u201d said Mr. McDonough, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThose markets that have made the rules clear have found many companies coming to play by the rules.\u201dMr. McDonough is planning to raise $35 million by selling iCash tokens to investors around the world, including some in the United States. The iCash tokens are initially designed to be the method of payment for an online gambling site. He said he would still be based in Florida, but would have an office and a head of operations in Bermuda, which the island requires of all companies.That prompted Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to post a congratulatory tweet and proclaim the island\u2019s intention to be the \u201cglobal trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses.\u201dMr. Zhao did not respond to requests for comment.Many of the countries passing the new laws have said they are not interested in becoming a home for illicit activity. Albert Isola, Gibraltar\u2019s finance minister, said his government was accustomed to making hard decisions after regulating online gambling companies for the last 25 years.\u201cFor every one license we\u2019ve issued, we\u2019ve probably said no to 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re considering a new sector, to bring in big names is extremely attractive, but they\u2019ve got to be good names.

{"Headline": "George Soros Bet Big on Liberal Democracy. Now He Fears He Is Losing.", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "FeatureHis enemies paint him as all-powerful, but the billionaire philanthropist believes that his political legacy has never been in greater jeopardy.Supported byWearing a dark suit, tieless and with the collar of his blue shirt outside the lapel of his jacket, Soros took the stage with the determined stride of an 87-year-old who still plays tennis a few times a week. But there were some concessions to age. He gave his speech sitting down and used a desk lamp to illuminate the text. (In fairness, the hotel conference room hosting the event was morosely dark.) He turned the pages with his right hand while keeping his left hand on his left knee, as if propping himself up. There were moments when he seemed on the verge of losing his place, although he never did.In person, Soros is quite charming, with a wry sense of humor. But his writings \u2014 he has published 14 books \u2014 and speeches can be a little wooden, and this occasion was no exception. He barely acknowledged the audience, which included the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Albania, except to say, \u201cI think this is the right place to discuss how to save Europe.\u201d But apart from urging the European Union to direct more aid to Africa, which he said would ameliorate the refugee crisis that has led to so much of the recent political upheaval in Europe, his remarks were more descriptive than prescriptive. The European Union, he said, faced an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201dBriefly touching on Europe\u2019s economic outlook, he said, \u201cWe may be heading for another major financial crisis.\u201d Partly in response to his warning, the Dow fell nearly 400 points that day. Soros is generally considered the greatest speculator Wall Street has known, and though he stopped managing other people\u2019s money years ago, the reaction was a real-time display of his continued ability to move markets. The attention given to that comment also underscored, in a subtle way, an enduring frustration of his life: His financial thoughts still tend to carry more weight than his political reflections.Yet the political realm is where Soros has made his most audacious wager. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, he poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the former Soviet-bloc countries to promote civil society and liberal democracy. It was a one-man Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, a private initiative without historical precedent. It was also a gamble that a part of the world that had mostly known tyranny would embrace ideas like government accountability and ethnic tolerance. In London in the 1950s, Soros was a student of the expatriated Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, who championed the notion of an \u201copen society,\u201d in which individual liberty, pluralism and free inquiry prevailed. Popper\u2019s concept became Soros\u2019s cause.It is an embattled cause these days. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has reverted to autocracy, and Poland and Hungary are moving in the same direction. With the rise of Donald Trump in the United States, where Soros is a major donor to Democratic candidates and progressive groups, and the growing strength of right-wing populist parties in Western Europe, Soros\u2019s vision of liberal democracy is under threat in its longtime strongholds. Nationalism and tribalism are resurgent, barriers are being raised and borders reinforced and Soros is confronting the possibility that the goal to which he has devoted most of his wealth and the last chapter of his life will end in failure. Not only that: He also finds himself in the unsettling position of being the designated villain of this anti-globalization backlash, his Judaism and career in finance rendering him a made-to-order phantasm for reactionaries worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m standing for principles whether I win or lose,\u201d Soros told me this spring. But, he went on, \u201cunfortunately, I\u2019m losing too much in too many places right now.\u201dParis was the first stop for Soros on a monthlong spring trip to Europe. He normally would have visited Budapest, but not this time. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a former Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was re-elected in April after running a campaign in which he effectively made Soros his opponent. Orban accused Soros, who is an American citizen, of plotting to overwhelm Hungary with Muslim immigrants in order to undermine its Christian heritage. He attacked Soros during campaign rallies, and his government plastered the country with anti-Soros billboards. In the aftermath of the election, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office because of concerns for the safety of its employees. The fate of the Soros-founded Central European University, based in Budapest, was also in doubt.Soros said he couldn\u2019t visit Hungary under present circumstances: \u201cIt would be toxic,\u201d he said. He told me that Orban\u2019s campaign was \u201ca big disappointment,\u201d but quickly added, \u201cI think I must be doing something right to look at who my enemies are.\u201d Last autumn, he signaled that same sense of defiance when he announced that he was in the process of transferring the bulk of his remaining wealth, $18 billion in total at the time, to the O.S.F. That will potentially make it the second-largest philanthropic organization in the United States, in assets, after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is already a sprawling entity, with some 1,800 employees in 35 countries, a global advisory board, eight regional boards and 17 issue-oriented boards. Its annual budget of around $1 billion finances projects in education, public health, independent media, immigration and criminal-justice reform and other areas. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood are among its grantees.Soros originally planned to close the O.S.F. in 2010. He didn\u2019t want it to outlive him, because he feared it might then lose its dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit. But he changed his mind when he realized that, as he put it, \u201cI had more money than I can realistically or usefully spend in my lifetime.\u201d He also saw that, with liberal values and civil society fragile in so many places, the O.S.F.\u2019s work was becoming ever more essential. \u201cI found a mission, a niche, that I felt could be carried on,\u201d he said as we finished dinner.A few minutes later came an unexpected reminder of what he and the O.S.F. are up against. A Soros aide and I took the elevator back down together, and when we stepped into the Bristol\u2019s lobby, we found ourselves in the middle of a reception line that stretched the length of the room. It had formed there to greet one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving autocrats, Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of Congo. The next day, a few hours after Soros spoke to the European Council on Foreign Relations, Roseanne Barr went on a Twitter rant that served as a vivid demonstration of what he is up against personally. Soros was maneuvering to bring about \u201cthe overthrow of us constitutional republic,\u201d Barr tweeted. She also claimed that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, had actually been a Nazi. Among those who retweeted the Nazi gibe was Donald Trump Jr.In 1946, as Communists were rising to power in Hungary, Soros fled to England. He earned a degree from the London School of Economics, where Karl Popper was a professor. In 1945, Popper published a political treatise, \u201cThe Open Society and Its Enemies,\u201d a fierce assault on totalitarianism, in both its fascist and Marxist forms, and a ringing defense of liberal democracy. Soros left Popper\u2019s classroom with not only the idea that would later animate his philanthropy but also the desire to live a life of the mind. He had to make money first, though. When he moved to New York in 1956 to take a job on Wall Street, his goal, he told me, was to sock away $100,000 in five years, which would allow him to quit finance and turn to scholarly pursuits. But instead, he quipped during our dinner, \u201cI overperformed.\u201dIn 1969, Soros formed what would become the Quantum Fund. It was one of a new breed of investment vehicles known as hedge funds, which catered to institutional investors and wealthy individuals and which used leverage \u2014 borrowed money \u2014 to make huge bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Quantum was wildly successful from its start, delivering 40 percent annual returns. Soros would later attribute his knack for playing the markets to what he called his \u201ctheory of reflexivity\u201d \u2014 basically, the idea that people\u2019s biases and perceptions can move prices in directions that don\u2019t accord with the underlying reality. Soros claimed his strength as an investor was in recognizing and acting on what he referred to as \u201cfar from equilibrium\u201d moments. (His oldest son, Robert, once claimed the \u201creflexivity\u201d explanation was bunk; he said the tip-off for his father that the market was nearing a major move was when his bad back flared up.)By the late 1970s, Soros had become a very wealthy man. Now he had the means to make himself an agent of history. He was frank about his ambition, though also self-deprecating. As he wrote in his 1991 book, \u201cUnderwriting Democracy\u201d: \u201cI was a confirmed egoist but I considered the pursuit of self-interest as too narrow a base for my rather inflated self. If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me into trouble. But when I had made my way in the world I wanted to indulge my fantasies to the extent that I could afford.\u201dHe decided that his goal would be opening closed societies. He created a philanthropic organization, then called the Open Society Fund, in 1979 and began sponsoring college scholarships for black South African students. But he soon turned his attention to Eastern Europe, where he started financing dissident groups. He funneled money to the Solidarity strikers in Poland in 1981 and to Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia. In one especially ingenious move, he sent hundreds of Xerox copiers to Hungary to make it easier for underground publications to disseminate their newsletters. In the late 1980s, he provided dozens of Eastern European students with scholarships to study in the West, with the aim of fostering a generation of liberal democratic leaders. One of those students was Viktor Orban, who studied civil society at Oxford. From his Manhattan trading desk, Soros became a strange sort of expat anticommunist revolutionary.In the meantime, Quantum grew into a multibillion-dollar colossus. Soros made his most famous trade in 1992, when he bet against the British pound. The currency was vulnerable because it had been pegged at what seemed an unsustainably high rate against the German mark; with Britain in recession, Soros reasoned, the British government would ultimately choose to see the pound devalued rather than maintain the high interest rates needed to defend it from speculative investors. Soros\u2019s terse command to his head trader, Stanley Druckenmiller, was to \u201cgo for the jugular.\u201d Druckenmiller did, and on Wednesday, Sept. 16 \u2014 Black Wednesday, as it came to be known \u2014 the Bank of England stopped trying to prop up the pound\u2019s value. It promptly sank against the mark, falling out of Europe\u2019s Exchange Rate Mechanism and dealing a setback to the push for greater European integration. The sterling crisis turned hedge funds into the glamorous rogues of finance and demonstrated the punitive power that they could wield against policymakers in a world of free-flowing capital. The trade made $1.5 billion for Quantum, and Soros, whom the British tabloids dubbed \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England,\u201d became a household name.By then, the Soviet empire had collapsed, and Soros was devoting huge sums of his own money to try to smooth its transition from Communist rule. For example, he donated $100 million to support Russian scientists and keep them from selling their services to countries hostile to the West; he spent $250 million on a program to revise Russian textbooks and train teachers to promote critical thinking. While the era was one of Western triumphalism, when it was widely assumed that Russia and other newly freed countries would inevitably embrace liberal democracy \u2014 a view most famously expressed in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1989 essay, \u201cThe End of History\u201d \u2014 Soros did not share that certitude. This part of the world had little tradition of civil society and liberal democracy, and in his view these needed to be nurtured if the region was to avoid backsliding into autocracy. \u201cI generally have a bias to see the darkest potential,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is something that I have practiced in the financial markets to very good effect, and I have transferred it to politics.\u201dDuring the 1990s, Soros toggled between his day job and his philanthropy, and it was not always easy to disentangle his dual roles. For a time, Quantum and O.S.F. were run out of the same offices. In December 1992, three months after his bet against the British pound, Soros announced a $50 million donation to build a water-treatment facility in war-ravaged Sarajevo, and it was hard not to see that money as having been sucked straight from the British treasury. Soros once described his bifurcated existence rather graphically, writing that he \u201cfelt like a giant digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other.\u201dIf that was the case, indigestion was inevitable, and it came in 1997, when Quantum was at the center of a speculative attack on the Thai baht. The episode was a nearly identical reprise of what happened to the British pound. (Quantum made roughly $750 million this time.) There was one critical difference, however: While Britain was a major industrialized country that ultimately had little trouble absorbing the blow to its currency, Thailand was an emerging economy for which the consequences were devastating. Economic output plunged, banks and businesses folded and huge numbers of people were thrown out of work. The baht crisis rippled into other Asian economies. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, called Soros and other speculators \u201cunscrupulous profiteers\u201d whose immoral work served no social value. Soros publicly rejected the criticism, but when investors took aim at the Indonesian rupiah in the fall of 1997, Quantum was not among them. Nor did it join other hedge funds when they targeted the Russian ruble the following year. Having already invested hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stabilize Russia, Soros would have been undercutting his own work by betting against the Russian currency. He ended up taking a $400 million loss.\u201cThat was where the crossroads between the philanthropist and the investor became difficult,\u201d says Rob Johnson, a longtime Soros associate who worked as a portfolio manager at Quantum in the 1990s. But by then, according to Johnson, the only reason that Soros was still running a hedge fund was to generate more money for his causes.During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soros also cultivated a number of young activists he believed could advance his dream of remaking Hungary as a place he would never again feel compelled to leave. Among them was Viktor Orban, a bright, charismatic student who was ardently pro-democracy, or so it seemed. In addition to providing Orban with a scholarship at Oxford, Soros donated money to Fidesz (the Alliance of Young Democrats), a student organization that Orban helped found and that evolved into his political party.But during the 1990s, Orban drifted to the right. Elected prime minister in 1998, he governed as a mainstream conservative, emphasizing patriotism and traditional values. Outwardly, he remained pro-Western. Under his leadership, Hungary entered NATO, and he also laid the groundwork for its admission to the European Union. But a shock defeat in the 2002 election seemed to radicalize Orban. When he reclaimed the prime minister\u2019s office in 2010, he began ruthlessly consolidating power. He packed the courts with Fidesz loyalists, and various independent media were bought out by Orban supporters. At the same time, he turned away from the West and drew close to Vladimir Putin. Orban was re-elected in 2014. The following year, the European refugee crisis hit. Tens of thousands of refugees passed through the Balkans and arrived on Hungary\u2019s border. Orban\u2019s government erected a 109-mile fence in order to keep them out, and it later refused to comply with a European Union quota plan that would have required it to take in asylum-seekers.Groups that received financial support from the O.S.F. were providing assistance to the refugees massed along Hungary\u2019s border, and this became a pretext for Orban\u2019s war on Soros. The Hungarian Parliament enacted legislation requiring NGOs to register with the government and disclose foreign sources of income above a certain threshold; it passed a bill that would have stripped Central European University of the right to award diplomas in Hungary. Orban\u2019s government introduced what it called the \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill making it a crime to assist illegal immigrants. (Parliament passed the bill last month.)In one campaign rally in Budapest, Orban referred to Soros as \u201cUncle George,\u201d telling tens of thousands of supporters that \u201cwe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the world.\u201d Along with the fiery speeches, there were the billboards, which featured a picture of a smiling Soros and the message, \u201cLet\u2019s not let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d The laughing Jew had been a trope of Nazi propaganda, but Orban denied that the billboards were anti-Semitic.Orban\u2019s coalition won 49 percent of the vote, enough to give it a supermajority in Parliament. But the anti-Soros campaign didn\u2019t end with the election. Days after the vote, a magazine owned by a pro-Orban businesswoman published the names of more than 200 people in Hungary that it claimed were Soros \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The list included representatives of human rights groups, anticorruption watchdogs and Central European University faculty members and administrators. In mid-May, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office, which was responsible for almost half its international grants. Patrick Gaspard, the O.S.F.\u2019s president, says that the language and imagery Orban used to go after Soros was \u201cnothing short of violent\u201d and that the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s threat to turn the country\u2019s intelligence services on the O.S.F. made it impossible to remain in Budapest. \u201cI have the habit of taking autocrats at their word,\u201d Gaspard says. \u201cWe have to protect the security of our staff and of our data.\u201d The office is relocating to Berlin.In recent years, governments throughout Eastern Europe have attacked Soros. But why Orban, personally popular and facing hopelessly divided opponents, chose to make Soros-bashing the centerpiece of his campaign puzzled many observers. Orban \u201cis extremely successful,\u201d Michael Ignatieff, the president of Central European University and the former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party, told me in London in April. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better politician than any of his opposition. He has intelligence and charm. He\u2019s funny and reads a room well. What\u2019s crazy is that he feels he needs to delegitimize Soros in order to win an election.\u201d Some observers offered a psychological explanation: Noting that Orban had had a turbulent relationship with his own father and a tendency to chafe under authority, they suggested that bludgeoning Soros was a form of patricide, a way of slaying his political godfather. But Thomas Carothers, a senior vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes that Soros was simply a useful cudgel for Orban. Civic groups were the last source of potential opposition, he says, and because some of them were backed by the O.S.F., going after Soros was a way to undermine their credibility. \u201cStrongman leaders want to de-universalize human rights and civic liberties,\u201d says Carothers, who has served on various O.S.F. advisory boards. \u201cIt is much harder for Orban to say that he rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is much easier to say, \u2018I push back against this intrusive man sitting in New York.\u2019 Soros is a very convenient bogeyman.\u201dBut Fukuyama went on to say that it takes events and skillful manipulators to rouse the forces of intolerance. In Hungary, the global financial crisis and the refugee crisis were the fuses, and Orban proved very adept at providing the spark. Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., made a similar observation. He said resentment of the European Union, which came to be seen as an \u201cemasculating force of Hungarian identity,\u201d as he put it, coupled with economic anxiety, left Hungarians receptive to Orban\u2019s appeal. \u201cHungarians are not irredeemably racist,\u201d Benardo said. \u201cEthnic entrepreneurs like Orban play upon the darkest fears of people to produce political support and an us-versus-them mentality.\u201dIn contrast to Benardo, my grandfather was not a social scientist. But like Soros, he was a Hungarian-born Jew who ended up in the United States, and he believed that anti-Semitism was a habit of mind that Hungarians would never kick. He admired Soros, but thought he was wasting his money in Hungary. When I told Soros about my grandfather, he smiled and shook his head knowingly. He said that his brother, a shipping magnate, had felt the same way. Soros did not.\u201cI don\u2019t blame the Hungarian people at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I admire them for their willingness to stand up to oppression and to fight for their freedom.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to distinguish between the people and the government.\u201dHe then told me a story from 1944, about a Nazi officer his father met in a cafe. During the course of the conversation, the officer quietly admitted to misgivings about the orders he was obliged to carry out. His father, a Jew in hiding and virulently opposed to the Nazis, tried to comfort the officer, telling him that it was a difficult situation. Throughout his life, the elder Soros shared this story to make the point that circumstances matter and that how people act isn\u2019t necessarily how they feel, a lesson that his son was now applying to Orban\u2019s Hungary. I asked him if he expected to visit Hungary again in his lifetime. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, but without much conviction.Two weeks later, President Trump called Orban to congratulate him on his re-election.Soros was an early backer of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. In Paris, Soros told me that Obama was \u201cactually my greatest disappointment.\u201d Prompted by an aide, he immediately qualified himself, saying that he hadn\u2019t been disappointed by Obama\u2019s presidency but felt let down on a professional level. While he had no desire for a formal role in the administration, he had hoped that Obama would seek his counsel, especially on financial and economic matters. Instead, he was frozen out.After Obama was elected, \u201che closed the door on me,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.\u201d He suggested that he had fallen victim to an Obama personality trait. \u201cHe was someone who was known from the time when he was competing for the editorship of The Harvard Law Review to take his supporters for granted and to woo his opponents,\u201d Soros said.During the 2016 election cycle, Soros contributed more than $25 million to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates and causes. While he had foreseen the possibility of a Trump-like figure emerging (\u201cThe American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth, which increasingly dominates the country\u2019s political discourse,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian in 2007), he was as surprised as everyone else that the Trump-like figure turned out to be Donald Trump. Soros told me that he had known Trump casually and had even socialized with him (about 30 years ago, a friend of Soros\u2019s dated one of Trump\u2019s senior people, and they all went out for dinner a few times). \u201cI had no idea he had any political ambition,\u201d Soros said. Trump had tried to coax him into becoming the lead tenant in one of his commercial buildings, he said. \u201cI told him I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Soros recalled with a chuckle.He said that he had been \u201cvery afraid\u201d that Trump would \u201cblow up the world rather than suffer a setback to his narcissism\u201d but was pleased that the president\u2019s ego had instead led him to reach out to North Korea. \u201cI think the danger of nuclear war has been greatly reduced, and that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d In his annual state-of-the-world speech in Davos this year, Soros said Trump \u201cwould like to establish a mafia state, but he can\u2019t, because the Constitution, other institutions and a vibrant civil society won\u2019t allow it.\u201d He also characterized Trump as a \u201cpurely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020, or even sooner,\u201d and predicted a Democratic landslide in the 2018 midterm elections. Five months on, he was sticking by those predictions. \u201cFor every Trump follower who follows Trump through thick and thin, there is more than one Trump enemy who will be more intent, more determined,\u201d Soros told me. He is doing his part to shorten the Trump era: In advance of the midterm elections, Soros has so far contributed at least $15 million to support Democratic candidates and causes.Asked if he would support Bernie Sanders if the Vermont senator won the Democratic nomination in 2020, Soros said it was too soon to say. He expressed displeasure with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, another possible candidate, over her role in ousting Al Franken from Congress: \u201cShe was using #MeToo to promote herself.\u201d He said his main goal as a political activist was to see a return to bipartisanship, a surprising claim in light of his lavish support for the Democrats. It was the extremism of the Republican Party that had prompted him to become a major Democratic donor, he said; he wanted the Republican Party to reform itself into a more moderate party. He said he was not especially partisan himself: \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be a Democrat.\u201d He spoke of his respect for John McCain. He even said he would be inclined to give financial support to moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, although he quickly walked back that comment: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that. That would hurt them.\u201d And while the Republicans had made bipartisanship impossible, he didn\u2019t want to see the Democrats become more ideologically rigid and confrontational.If Soros views his relationship with the Democratic Party as mostly transactional, for some Democrats the feeling appears to be mutual. While his money is welcome and needed, there seems to be a certain ambivalence about Soros within Democratic circles. It is partly because of his outspokenness. As Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Democratic strategist, puts it, \u201cThe best donors are silent donors; not talking is good.\u201d A bigger issue is that the Democratic Party remains committed to campaign-finance reform and abhors the effect that the Citizens United decision has had on American politics. That 2010 Supreme Court ruling gave billionaires like Soros the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns. Kamarck says that in the post-Citizens United world, Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t unilaterally disarm\u201d and spurn donations from plutocrats like Soros, but they are conflicted about billionaire donors in a way that the Republicans are not.Although Soros is squarely on the left on many issues \u2014 he supports a single-payer health care system and is a longtime advocate of criminal-justice reform \u2014 some on the left have long been dubious of him. In the 1990s, he was portrayed by the far left as an agent of American imperialism, helping to foist the so-called neoliberal agenda (mass privatization, for example) on Eastern Europe. For some critics, Soros\u2019s Wall Street background has always been a mark against him. There is also discomfort with his philanthropy \u2014 not its goals, certainly, but what it is seen to represent. Soros is at the vanguard of what has come to be known as \u201cphilanthrocapitalism,\u201d essentially large-scale social investing by billionaires like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Soros. (Last year Forbes magazine ranked Soros the 20th-richest American.) To those who object, this represents the privatization of social policy and, through the substantial tax benefits that charitable donations receive, it deprives the public sector of money that could be used to promote social welfare.When I asked Soros to describe himself ideologically, he laughed. \u201cMy ideology is nonideological,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the club of nonclubs.\u201d When I suggested that \u201ccenter-left\u201d might characterize his views, he demurred; he said it wasn\u2019t clear where he stood now because the left had moved further left, a development that did not please him. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to the extreme left,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should stop trying to keep up with the extremists on the right.\u201dBut Soros\u2019s Jewish identity, coupled with his status as a Wall Street billionaire, gave those disinclined to support his agenda an easy means to foment suspicion and resentment, and from the moment that he became involved in Eastern Europe, he was confronted with anti-Semitism. The dog-whistling has not abated with time; some would argue that anti-Semitism directed at Soros has become, at least under Orban, a state-sponsored contagion. But it has also lately taken some bizarre twists. Last year, a son of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon of Soros on his Facebook page. (Netanyahu has frequently disparaged Soros because of his financial support for groups critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.) And, of course, Soros is also routinely accused of having been a Nazi.Anti-Soros sentiment is a more recent phenomenon in the United States. Soros became a focal point of right-wing vitriol when he started contributing to the Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News in 2004, Dennis Hastert, who was at the time the speaker of the House, suggested that Soros was involved with drug cartels, telling Chris Wallace that \u201cI don\u2019t know where George Soros gets his money. I don\u2019t know where \u2014 if it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes from.\u201d The effort to demonize Soros has been unrelenting and quite successful. In suggesting that Soros was plotting a coup against the American government, Roseanne Barr was repeating a claim made by, among others, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had posted a meme on her Facebook page suggesting that Soros was conspiring to topple President Trump and \u201cour constitutional republic.\u201dSoros is regularly portrayed as the deus ex machina of American politics, a vast left-wing conspiracy unto himself. His wily hand \u2014 and wallet \u2014 have been blamed for the national-anthem protests in the N.F.L.; the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.; and the violence in Charlottesville. On Twitter, Soros haters trace virtually every national trauma, as well as every setback for conservatives, to him, or anything with the flimsiest connection to him. This stuff isn\u2019t confined to the digital fringes either. The claim about Charlottesville, for instance, was leveled by Paul Gosar, a Republican member of Congress. After news broke of a sex scandal involving the former governor of Missouri, Eric Greitens, that state\u2019s Republican Party issued a statement claiming that he had fallen victim to a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d orchestrated by Soros.At this point, it is fair to say that \u201cSoros\u201d has eclipsed even \u201cHillary\u201d as a trigger for a certain large subset of Republicans and conservatives. In April, conservative media outlets reported that Kimba Wood, the judge presiding over the case of President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had officiated at Soros\u2019s third wedding, in 2013. None of them attempted to explain why this was a problem; it was apparently self-evident. In 2014, Mark Malloch-Brown, a former United Nations deputy secretary general and a longtime Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, became head of a company called Smartmatic, which specializes in electronic voting technology. Soros obsessives eventually seized on this as proof that he was now intent on manipulating election outcomes. In response, the company felt obliged to post a disclaimer on its website stating that Soros had no stake in Smartmatic and that its technology was not used during the 2016 United States presidential election. When I spoke with Malloch-Brown, he told me that this was the price of being associated in any way with Soros. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge I wear with honor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it attaches to everything I do.\u201dMuch of what is said about Soros on Facebook, Twitter and in right-wing media outlets is not overtly anti-Semitic, and it is possible that some of the people pushing these views are not even aware that he is Jewish. But the echoes are there. Glenn Beck used his show on Fox to peddle wild conspiracy theories about Soros. In 2010, he aired a multipart special called \u201cGeorge Soros: The Puppet Master,\u201d which was widely condemned for its anti-Semitic overtones, beginning with its title (the Jew as puppet master, pulling the strings of humanity, is another age-old anti-Semitic trope). In recent years, the so-called alt-right has become a key driver of Soros paranoia. Breitbart portrays him as an arch-\u201cglobalist\u201d who backs unrestricted immigration and a border-free world. (Neither claim is true.) Soros was one of the prominent Jews featured in the last ad of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, which many regarded as anti-Semitic. Steve Bannon, formerly the head of Breitbart, led Trump\u2019s campaign at the time. On a trip to Europe in March, Bannon lauded Viktor Orban as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cthe most significant guy on the scene today.\u201dAlthough the broadsides at Soros are often highly suggestive, the people behind them are usually careful to maintain a degree of deniability when it comes to the question of anti-Semitism. But not always. On his radio show last year, Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy website Infowars, told listeners, \u201cthere is undoubtedly a Jewish mafia\u201d and that it was headed by Soros. Offering the same twist that would later appear in Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet, Jones said that \u201cone of the biggest enemies of Jews was the Jewish mafia\u201d and that Soros was \u201cout to get Jews.\u201dIn April, I met with Lamont. Now a member of the House of Lords and an ardent Brexit supporter, he insisted that he bore no ill will toward Soros because of Black Wednesday. But he regarded Brexit as a domestic political matter in which foreign money should play no part. That Soros had a home and office in London was irrelevant. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote here,\u201d Lamont said. In his view, Soros\u2019s effort to get a do-over vote was undermining British democracy. \u201cI think there would be incredible disillusionment with the political process if this vote was annulled,\u201d he said.During my dinner with Soros, I pointed out that some political observers drew a straight line from Black Wednesday to Brexit, in that the 1992 crisis strengthened the position of the Euroskeptics in Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, the faction that ultimately pushed for and prevailed on the vote to leave the European Union. I asked Soros what he would say to a Brexit supporter puzzled by his seemingly contradictory roles in Black Wednesday and Brexit. His reply suggested he thought the answer was obvious. \u201cThis is the difference between my engagement in the markets, where my only interest is to get it right and make money, and my political engagement, where I stand for what I really believe in,\u201d he said.It is a comment that gets to the heart of the Soros conundrum. Even if you concede that policymakers are ultimately to blame for the income inequality that has fueled so much of the current backlash against globalization, the financial sector has had a major role in worsening it, and hedge-fund titans like Soros are powerful symbols of that inequality. And while Soros has written very candidly and persuasively about the pitfalls of casino capitalism \u2014 most notably in a 1997 Atlantic essay, subsequently expanded into a book called \u201cThe Crisis of Global Capitalism,\u201d in which he acknowledged the destabilizing effect of financial markets \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make him any less of a symbol. When pressed, Soros has said that if he hadn\u2019t gone after the British pound or the Thai baht, someone else would have. That is unquestionably true (and in fact, Quantum was not the only hedge fund targeting those currencies). But that is not a particularly satisfying answer, and certainly not after the Great Recession, in which investment banks and hedge funds played such a destructive role. The industry that made him a billionaire contributed significantly to the circumstances that now imperil what Soros the philanthropist has tried to achieve.On the other hand, if Soros\u2019s riches had gone to someone else, would that person have put the money to the same use? It might have gone to a noble cause, but almost certainly not to something as ambitious and quixotic \u2014 or as dangerous \u2014 as the promotion of liberal values and democracy. (As Putin and Orban have shown, independent civil society is inevitably regarded as oppositional by governments that don\u2019t want their powers checked.) Most plutocrats measure progress in numbers, but the kind of work that Soros, through the O.S.F., has done generally defies quantification. And as Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., noted when we spoke a few months ago, that work can be unpopular in the countries where it is done.Soros\u2019s efforts on behalf of one group in particular, the Roma, seem especially germane right now. In June, the new Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League party, commissioned a census of the country\u2019s Roma. As an \u201canswer to the Roma question,\u201d as he menacingly phrased it, Salvini vowed to expel all non-Italian Roma and added, \u201cUnfortunately, we will have to keep the Italian Roma.\u201d Even in the age of Trump, his words were shocking, but he has refused to disavow them or back down. Improving the status of Europe\u2019s estimated 10 to 12 million Roma has been a major priority for Soros and the O.S.F. since the early 1990s. The organization has contributed more than $300 million to projects combating discrimination against the Roma and providing them with greater education, employment and civic opportunities. It is a struggle because anti-Roma sentiment remains a potent force, a reality underscored by Salvini\u2019s actions and statements. Given the political currents in Europe, this is another battle that Soros may well be losing. Salvini\u2019s popularity has soared.But it is also a clarifying battle. Setting aside all of the complications that come with being George Soros, would you rather live in the world that he has tried to create, or in the world that Salvini and Orban (and, for that matter, Trump) seem to be pushing us toward? In the aftermath of the Great Recession, it can certainly be argued that how Soros earned his money, and the fact that he accumulated such wealth, ought to carry more moral opprobrium in 2018 than maybe it did in 2008. But there is also a case to be made that in the present moment, with its echoes of the 1930s, how he amassed his fortune matters a lot less than what he has chosen to do with it.There have been mistakes; by his own admission, Soros erred in championing Mikheil Saakashvili, the mercurial former president of Georgia, and also became too directly involved in the country\u2019s politics in the early 2000s. He clearly misjudged Orban. But as Victoria Nuland, a former American diplomat who worked for both Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, put it when I spoke to her recently, \u201cGeorge is a freedom fighter.\u201dA household employee showed me to a table in the dining room and offered me some ginger tea: \u201ca specialty of the house.\u201d A few minutes later, Soros walked in. He was dressed in a white linen shirt, dark trousers and sandals. He hadn\u2019t been on the tennis court that morning; he was busy with phone calls instead.In the five weeks since I had seen Soros in Paris, the Trump administration had slapped new trade sanctions on China and imposed tariffs on goods from Canada and the European Union. I asked why the markets and the broader economy were holding up so well in the face of a possible global trade war, the breakdown of the trans-Atlantic alliance and the political turmoil in Washington. Soros said these developments would eventually drag down the market, but he couldn\u2019t say when. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my capacity to anticipate the markets,\u201d he said, adding with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m an amateur now.\u201d It was like hearing Roger Federer saying he had lost his touch around the net. Soros claimed that because the financial world was no longer his main focus, he was unable to time the markets the way that he used to. Politics now commanded his attention.Soros was in a reflective mood. He said democracy was in trouble because in many countries it had become sclerotic, insufficiently responsive to the public\u2019s needs. \u201cIt\u2019s losing out,\u201d he said. Illiberal democracy, of the sort that Orban had fashioned in Hungary, was proving to be \u201cmore effective,\u201d for the time being at least. The new-age autocrats had shown themselves to be particularly cunning in going after civil society as a means of consolidating their power. \u201cIt\u2019s a less abrasive way of exercising control than actually killing people who disagree with you,\u201d he said.It had become clear to him that his mentor and inspiration, Karl Popper, had been wrong in one critical respect. In a democratic society, politics wasn\u2019t ultimately a quest to arrive at the truth; it was about gaining and holding power and manipulating public sentiment in order to do that. \u201cHe was a philosopher of science, and science is a search for reality,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe did not understand politics. In politics, you are spinning the truth, not discovering it.\u201d I asked what Popper, who died in 1994, had thought of his political philanthropy. \u201cHe was very supportive, which means he didn\u2019t take me seriously,\u201d Soros said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Popper would be so happy with my current position, because I\u2019m critical of him.\u201dSoros acknowledged that he had said things in the past that he now regretted \u2014 not necessarily the sentiments, but the way he had expressed them. Referring to the Nazi comments that he made during the Bush years, he said, \u201cThat was probably a mistake.\u201d He told me that he was now choosing his words more cautiously, eschewing comparisons to the Third Reich and the use of the word \u201cfascism\u201d to describe political conditions in the United States and Europe.In Paris, Alex Soros had told me that his father, while an excellent parent, had been emotionally distant. It was, he said, a defense mechanism born of his wartime experience: \u201cTo be emotional, to give off emotion, could be a sign of vulnerability.\u201d But he said his father had started to open up in recent years.As my conversation with Soros in Southampton drew to a close, I thought I picked up a little vulnerability. He was talking about his wealth and the opportunities it had given him. \u201cFor me, money represents freedom and not power,\u201d he said. For a long time, money had given him the freedom to do and say what he pleased, and also the freedom not to care what other people said and thought about him. But he conceded that he had started to care. \u201cI have become a bit more concerned about my image, because it is disturbing to have those lies out there,\u201d he said, citing Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet as an example. He also admitted that being the anointed villain for so many people around the world was unpleasant. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to have that many enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I had more friends.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Viktor Orban was elected to a second term as prime minister of Hungary. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another \u2018Brexit\u2019 Bullet Dodged: Theresa May Survives Parliamentary Test", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, it was the turn of the softer, pro-European conservatives in her ranks who put her to the test, as she narrowly averted defeat in a parliamentary vote that signaled the potential for months of gridlock over the country\u2019s tortured efforts to extract itself from the bloc.It was the second consecutive day of close votes for Mrs. May, who faced a similar challenge on Monday from hard-liners, a measure of the tightening course she must navigate between the competing camps within her Conservative Party.Mrs. May secured victory by just six votes on Tuesday, scraping home in the highly charged aftermath of two cabinet resignations and amid persistent speculation about a challenge to her leadership.The wafer-thin margin suggested that Parliament is close to an impasse over Britain\u2019s withdrawal, or Brexit.The mounting deadlock leaves no certainty that any outcome to Brexit negotiations this fall could command enough support for approval from Parliament later this year, something that could yet put the process on an unpredictable and perilous path.That is anathema to Brexit hard-liners, who want to break free from the bloc\u2019s rule book. Mrs. May\u2019s approach provoked the resignation of several ministers and Conservative Party officials, including Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary.The tension over Brexit spiked again on Tuesday, when Britain\u2019s election watchdog, the Electoral Commission, ruled that the official pro-Brexit campaign group Vote Leave had broken the law on political spending during the 2016 referendum campaign over membership in the bloc.The commission said that Vote Leave had exceeded its spending limit of seven million pounds, or over $9 million, by funneling \u00a3675,315 through a pro-Brexit youth group called BeLeave. The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, was fined \u00a320,000 and referred to the police, along with a Vote Leave official, David Halsall.The findings prompted some lawmakers to call for the referendum to be declared invalid, an outcome that is unlikely.The conclusions are nevertheless embarrassing for senior Conservative figures who fronted the pro-Brexit campaign, including Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Vote Leave disputed the findings and characterized them as politically motivated.But the biggest domestic problems for Mrs. May lie in Parliament, where her Chequers Brexit proposal has enraged her hard-liners, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a right-wing Conservative lawmaker.On Monday, he was among those supporting amendments to a customs bill designed to toughen the Chequers deal and reduce Mrs. May\u2019s scope to make concessions when she negotiates with the European Union. Mrs. May gave way, accepting the amendments even though some critics think they render her Chequers plan unworkable.In doing so, Mrs. May angered her more pro-European lawmakers, some of whom believe that hard-line Brexiteers want to sabotage the Chequers agreement, ensuring that the European Union rejects it and that Britain quits the bloc with no deal at all.On Tuesday, the pro-Europeans hit back with an amendment that would have obliged the government to seek a customs union with the European Union if there is no agreement in January on a common free trade area for goods.Mrs. May has ruled out a customs union because membership would prevent Britain from striking free-trade deals with nations outside Europe, and her victory on Tuesday will be a big relief for her.Mrs. May lost another, less symbolic, parliamentary vote called by pro-Europeans to ensure that British pharmaceutical companies would be regulated by the European Medicines Agency.But Mrs. May will face a severe test later this year, assuming she survives that long in power, both in trying to negotiate a deal on future ties with the European Union and then in getting approval in Parliament for any agreement she can make.On Monday Mrs. May\u2019s office ruled out the prospect of holding a referendum on the terms of any Brexit deal, but that may not be the final word.If a Brexit deal is blocked in Parliament, Mrs. May\u2019s options would be limited, since she does not want Britain to leave the European Union without a deal, with all of the economic damage that would entail.Mrs. May could consider another general election, an appeal to the European Union to extend negotiations or another referendum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Soybean Surge Makes Trump\u2019s Trade War Look Deceptively Good", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s trade war is expected to temporarily bolster United States economic growth, in part because Beijing tried to beat the clock on Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs by stocking up on American soybeans, crude oil and other exports.Economists are predicting that the gross domestic product for the second quarter could reach 5 percent when the preliminary numbers are released on July 27. The United States trade gap with China has narrowed, as more American products were shipped to Beijing ahead of the tariffs, which went into effect on July 6.But both effects are expected to be fleeting, and the short-term economic improvement could turn into a long-term loss if both countries follow through with their threats to continue escalating tariffs against each other.\u201cThey will dance, they will sing, they will say, look at the plunge in the trade deficit in the second quarter,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThat is of course complete drivel.\u201dGrowth in the United States has remained strong throughout Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff threats. But they have rattled global markets and scrambled purchasing patterns between the countries, in a way that has temporarily helped growth in the United States.The soybean surge alone is projected by Mr. Shepherdson to add 0.6 percent to America\u2019s annualized economic growth rate for the second quarter.Soybean farmers, and economists, say it\u2019s hard to see anything but tariff anticipation driving the increase in soybean purchases.\u201cThey were expecting that the tariffs would be put in place by the United States, and then they would retaliate,\u201d said Ron Moore, an Illinois farmer who is the chairman of the American Soybean Association. \u201cMy assumption is they were trying to get as many beans as they could into storage before those tariffs went on to imports from the United States.\u201dMr. Trump attempted to address soybean farmers\u2019 concerns in a pair of tweets on Wednesday from Brussels, where he is participating in a NATO summit. He appeared to reference a 40 percent drop in soybean prices from $615 per metric ton in 2012 \u2014 a brief spike \u2014 to $368 in November 2016.Chinese buyers have been stockpiling other products marked for tariffs as well. In May, American crude oil exports to China more than tripled from a year ago. Exports of certain auto parts, for use in vehicles manufactured in China, also surged, according to an analysis of the census data by Panjiva, a firm that tracks global trade.America\u2019s steel exports have also risen this year, by 4 percent from a year ago, according to Census Bureau statistics.Economic growth has accelerated since Mr. Trump took office, and he delights in predicting that it will only grow more in the years to come. Some of his economic advisers have latched on to the projections for high second-quarter growth as a sign that administration policies, such as tax cuts, deregulation and the trade strategy, are supercharging growth.\u201cWatch those G.D.P. numbers,\u201d the president said in Wisconsin late last month. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be seeing 4s. And I think we\u2019re going to be seeing 5s too.\u201dChris Rogers, the research director at Panjiva, said that \u201cthe overhang of tariffs being applied by China against U.S. exports is inevitably going to act as a drag\u201d on growth going forward, as Chinese buyers find new suppliers, particularly for commodities.\u201cFrom July 6, why would you pay more for crude oil, when you could get it from Saudi Arabia or Iran?\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cWhy would you pay more for soybeans, when you could get them from Brazil?\u201dCarl Weinberg, the chief international economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note this week that oil and petroleum products are the largest category of American exports affected by Chinese tariffs thus far, and that China will have no problem replacing them: \"There is plenty of supply out there at much less than a 25 percent premium over U.S. prices,\u201d he wrote. \u201cU.S. producers will have to scramble to find new customers.\u201dMr. Moore, the soybean farmer, said the Chinese were \u201cpretty shrewd buyers of commodities\u201d and that he expected purchases to fall now that the tariffs were in place. The mere anticipation of those tariffs had pushed down the cost of soybeans on the global market, costing his farm more than $100,000 for this year\u2019s harvest, he said.He and other members of the soybean association flew to Washington for meetings this week, and they planned to fan out on Capitol Hill, imploring lawmakers to work to stop the tariff escalation.\u201cThis is our No. 1 topic that we\u2019re worried about,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s even put the Farm Bill on the back burner.

Just because I\u2019m running on the PML-N ticket?\u201dThe most likely beneficiary of the military\u2019s manipulation is the party led by the former cricket star Imran Khan, who has called the Taliban\u2019s war against the United States military in Afghanistan justified, and is seen as the military\u2019s favored candidate \u2014 a notion he denies. Mr. Khan has positioned himself as a fighter against corruption, taking aim at the dynastic politics and nepotism of parties like the PML-N while maintaining a good relationship with the military, which he credits with protecting the country.The military has ruled Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country, through various coups for nearly half the country\u2019s history since it gained independence in 1947. Even during civilian rule, the country\u2019s generals have wielded enormous power, setting the agenda for the country\u2019s foreign and security policies and tolerance of extremist groups \u2014 including the Afghan Taliban in its fight against the United States-backed government in Afghanistan next door.As prime minister, Mr. Sharif ran afoul of the military early on by trying to assert control over foreign and defense policy, which is seen as the army\u2019s domain. He also tried to improve ties with India, Pakistan\u2019s archrival, and opposed the military\u2019s embrace of terrorist groups, members of his party say.In Wednesday\u2019s election, voters will choose provincial legislatures and the country\u2019s Parliament, which will appoint the next prime minister. Officially, it will be only the second democratic transition between civilian governments in the Pakistan\u2019s history, after the last election in 2013.The main Pakistani Army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, denied at a news conference this month that Mr. Siraj was targeted because he belonged to the PML-N, saying that he had been the subject of a government investigation for a year and a half. General Ghafoor would not specify the nature of the investigation, and he denied that intelligence agencies had been involved in the raid on Mr. Siraj\u2019s warehouse.Other high-profile PML-N candidates have defected to Mr. Khan\u2019s party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or P.T.I.Mr. Khan said that while he has a productive relationship with the military, he is not receiving any help from it. Candidates are joining his centrist party because they are fed up with traditional parties that have failed to deliver, he said.\u201cWhen you have poor-quality leadership without the moral standing, you have a void and someone will always fill it,\u201d Mr. Khan said in an interview at his home in Islamabad, referring to the military\u2019s track record of coups and political interference.The P.T.I. is popular with voters under 35 who are hungry for change and make up 43 percent of the electorate.But the military\u2019s influence over Pakistan\u2019s courts and its muzzling of the news media have cast a shadow over Mr. Khan\u2019s party and its rallying cries for change and transparency.The Sharifs say those rulings were politicized, with the courts pressed by the military to bar them from politics.On Saturday, a judge of the Islamabad High Court accused the military\u2019s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, of meddling in the judiciary and forcing the justices to rule against Mr. Sharif and his relatives.The speech by Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui to lawyers in Rawalpindi was the latest public indictment of the military\u2019s interference in politics. The parts of the speech that were critical of the ISI were not aired by local television news networks but short video clips went viral on social media.The judge accused the ISI of influencing and pressuring the court that convicted and sentenced Mr. Sharif and his relatives. On July 17, the Islamabad High Court deferred the hearings of the appeals by Mr. Sharif against the court verdict until after elections.\u201cIn this election, what\u2019s at stake is the fate of Pakistan,\u201d said Hina Rabbani, a former foreign minister who is running with the Pakistan Peoples Party, a rival of the PML-N. \u201cI may hate Nawaz Sharif for his political choices, but I believe the system needs to self-correct, and we can no longer allow external forces to correct it. The only thing that can correct the system is elections.\u201dThe 2013 election was important because it was the first time power had been transferred from one civilian government to another, Ms. Rabbani said. \u201cBut for the next 10 years, we\u2019ll be holding our breath with every election.\u201dMr. Khan, who made Mr. Sharif\u2019s removal from office almost a personal mission, sees the situation differently.\u201cTo say the army castrated Nawaz Sharif \u2014 Nawaz Sharif was castrated by his own corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unlevel playing field you see is that they have minted this country,\u201d he said, referring to the endemic corruption among Pakistan\u2019s top political parties.Although Mr. Khan has a good chance of becoming prime minister, the military is likely to insist on curbing the next government\u2019s ability to shape defense and foreign policy, risking Pakistan\u2019s further international isolation.\u201cThe military finds itself in a tight corner,\u201d said Raza Rumi, the editor of The Daily Times, an influential newspaper based in Lahore. \u201cThey want a hung Parliament that doesn\u2019t focus on cutting the military\u2019s budget or curtailing its foreign policy. Instead, they want a government that focuses on cleaning the streets and planting trees.\u201dWhichever party forms the government will inherit a raft of problems: domestic terrorism; terrible relationships with neighboring India and Afghanistan; deteriorating ties with the United States, once a major ally; and a sputtering economy.The military believes it can weather the storm by turning to China, which is spending some $65 billion on infrastructure and other projects in Pakistan, as well as doling out billions in loans.\u201cThe question the whole nation is asking is what does the army want and why this level of interference?\u201d said Ahmed Rasheed, a foreign-policy analyst and author.Like others interviewed, Mr. Rasheed said he believed the military wanted a weak government, with the P.T.I. at the helm of an unwieldy alliance in Parliament.While the PML-N, which held a supermajority in the last Parliament, may win the most votes, it will struggle to form a government if the military pressures potential coalition partners. Analysts say Mr. Khan\u2019s party is likely to be able to form the next government by cobbling together a coalition with smaller parties and independents.But the military risks a severe backlash, Mr. Rasheed said, in part because social media has increased scrutiny of an institution once seen as sacrosanct.\u201cFor the first time, not just the elite, but the public is now aware of the army\u2019s major role,\u201d Mr. Rasheed said. \u201cIt\u2019s now talked about at the village level.\u201dWhen Gul Bukhari, a journalist and vocal critic of the military, was abducted in an army-controlled area of Lahore last month by unknown assailants, including men in military uniform, the news spread quickly online. Pakistanis took to social media, including Twitter, to demand that Ms. Bukhari be freed, and within hours she was returned home.Ms. Bukhari said the public outcry had played a large role in her quick release.\u201cIt was a demonstration of the immense power of social media in our times,\u201d she said in an interview.The traditional news media have also stood up to the military, as happened this spring when the newspaper Dawn and the TV channel Geo News complained that their distribution was being disrupted in parts of the country that the military administers.Many candidates are nervous about the military\u2019s unusual decision to deploy some 371,000 soldiers to monitor the election, including inside polling stations. But Khurram Dastgir Khan, a PML-N candidate who was defense minister in the last government, said social media had made the military and its allies more careful about overt interference.\u201cThings come out \u2014 they can\u2019t be kept hidden anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfeasible to use the draconian measures of two decades ago. Society has moved forward and technology has moved forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Cuba Constitution, Recognizing Private Property, Approved by Lawmakers", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Cuban lawmakers on Sunday approved a draft of a new Constitution that would seek to modernize the nation by recognizing the right to own private property and opening the door to the possible legalization of same-sex marriage, among other economic, political and social changes.The document would also encourage foreign investment and strengthen the judicial system, including recognizing the presumption of innocence.The draft Constitution would significantly reorganize the government. It calls for creating the position of a prime minister, who would share power with the president, and governorships for the nation\u2019s provinces.Before it can become official, the document, which would replace the current 1976 Soviet-era Constitution, will be put before the public in a series of meetings around the country and then be voted on in a national referendum, a process expected to take months.President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, who replaced Ra\u00fal Castro in April, said the approval process would unify the Cuban people and underscore the \u201cgenuine democracy\u201d of the nation.\u201cThis exercise of direct participation of the people acquires political relevance and will be a further reflection that the revolution is based on the most genuine democracy,\u201d he said Sunday, according to Granma, Cuba\u2019s state newspaper.The economic reforms envisioned in the charter would provide a degree of constitutional recognition for market changes that have already been underway, including the private enterprise that has sprung up.During his two terms as president, Mr. Castro took steps to loosen the state\u2019s grip on the economy and open up the nation to a small but vital private sector and to more foreign investment.\u201cEssentially, they\u2019ve changed so many things in the last two years that a lot of things that are happening are technically unconstitutional,\u201d said Ted Henken, professor of sociology and Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York.While the draft omits a clause from the current, 42-year-old Constitution laying out the goal of building a \u201ccommunist society,\u201d it still reinforces the one-party system with the Communist Party as the guiding force in society.Indeed, the Cuban leadership has insisted that the proposed changes do not represent a move toward the adoption of a capitalist system. Socialism, Granma declared, \u201cis irrevocable, and Cuba will never return to capitalism.\u201dThe president of Cuba\u2019s National Assembly, Esteban Lazo Hern\u00e1ndez, said the deletion of the reference to communism did not suggest that the nation\u2019s political leadership was \u201crenouncing our ideas.\u201d Their vision, he said, remained one of \u201ca socialist, independent, prosperous and sustainable country.\u201dAndy S. Gomez, the retired director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, called the draft Constitution a \u201creally big\u201d development.\u201cThis is the first time that they\u2019re trying to give some domestic order to how their government functions,\u201d he said.Mr. Gomez said the vote Sunday followed days of legitimate debate within the National Assembly, perhaps for the first time ever, with scores of legislators weighing in.While Cuba under the proposed Constitution \u201cis far from a democracy,\u201d Mr. Gomez said, the reforms seemed to point toward \u201ca very different government than we have seen in the last almost-60 years.\u201dSome of the changes contained in the draft Constitution \u2014 which has not been publicly circulated, but has been described in some detail by Granma \u2014 would also modernize the law to catch up with changing social attitudes throughout Cuba and Latin America.Homero Acosta, the secretary of Cuba\u2019s council of state, told lawmakers on Saturday that the draft defines marriage as a union between two individuals, not exclusively between a man and a woman, Reuters reported.\u201cThe possibility of marriage between two people strengthens our project\u2019s principles of equality and justice,\u201d Mr. Acosta said, according to Reuters.He said, though, that legal recognition of same-sex marriage would require more legal changes. Even the proposed constitutional change redefining marriage will probably meet strong opposition from religious conservatives in Cuba, who have been lobbying against it.Sunday\u2019s vote, which was unanimous, according to Cuban state media, came a day after lawmakers in Havana approved a new cabinet appointed by Mr. Diaz-Canel. Most of the ministers from Mr. Castro\u2019s government will continue in their posts.Analysts also said that many details of the proposed Constitution remained to be publicized, leaving many Cubans and observers wondering whether the document will include certain reforms that would probably find widespread support in Cuba. These include more freedom for nonstate media and greater liberties of association and expression.\u201cIf they allow these rights to be exercised, it is a great step forward,\u201d said Rafael Rojas, a Cuban historian and professor at CIDE, a university in Mexico City. \u201cBut we must see the final text of the Constitution to know.\u201dAlbinson Linares contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How E.U. Is Getting Ready for Chaos in a Worst-Case Brexit", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dutch government is hiring nearly 1,000 customs officials. Britain\u2019s health agency is mulling how to ensure medicine supplies. Ireland is preparing border inspections for food shipments and even racehorses.Call it contingency planning. Call it preparedness. Just try not to call it panic.But countries that conduct a lot of trade with Europe\u2019s second-largest economy face a particular challenge: How to manage the massive flow of TVs, car parts, drugs and every other product that cross their borders to get to and from Britain.Many have been preparing for a nightmare scenario in which Britain fails to negotiate an orderly departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, while assuming that a rosier outcome will prevail. That would involve keeping Britain tied to European regulations and customs arrangements, allowing goods to continue traveling easily across borders and safeguarding critical supply chains and jobs.Britain\u2019s neighbors are taking no chances.The government had been hoping for an outcome along the lines presented by Mrs. May, which would let the Netherlands and other European countries keep moving goods across borders with only slightly more red tape than now.A so-called hard Brexit, in which no such arrangement is made, would instead require strict new customs controls and a tangle of tariffs for each chocolate bar, computer or car part that passes through the Rotterdam port to and from Britain.The Dutch are bracing for the worst.\u201cAs far as we know, Brexit is happening,\u201d said Erik Jeene, a spokesman for the Dutch finance ministry, which oversees spending for the customs authority. \u201cHard Brexit is still a possibility, so we are preparing.\u201dIn addition to customs agents, the government is recruiting up to 90 veterinarians for animal and food inspection. New agents will have to have uniforms and other equipment. Warehouses to hold goods for inspection may be needed, adding to the nearly 35 million euro, or around $40 million, expense.In the event of a hard Brexit, ships sailing to Rotterdam from Britain could no longer pass through a type of express lane for customs clearance. Instead, Mr. Jeene said, they would be diverted into a different lane reserved for vessels from so-called third countries, which are not part of the European Union and undergo more extensive inspections to ensure cargo meets strict regional standards.\u201cIf we import apples from Germany, they can just cross the border,\u201d Mr. Jeene said. \u201cIn a new situation for Britain, that wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d The customs inspection load could be enormous. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of containers a day,\u201d he said.With Mrs. May\u2019s plan rapidly careening off course, a clear answer looks increasingly out of reach.\u201cIt\u2019s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly,\u201d the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday.As part of its contingency plans, Ireland is also considering whether to relocate part of the emergency oil stocks that it stores at British refineries back to Ireland or to other countries in the union, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported. A government spokesman said such stocks may be held only in European Union countries.Brexit, even in its tidiest form, could create paralysis at the Channel Tunnel crossing between France and Britain. In the French city of Calais, the deputy mayor, Philippe Mignonet, has warned that Brexit could result in round-the-clock traffic jams, and an increased risk of migrants trying to smuggle themselves into waiting payloads.France is accelerating the recruitment of up to 700 customs officers before Brexit. \u201cThe more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it\u2019s not impossible it could eventually happen,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said last week.Companies worried about supply chain disruptions are scrambling to cope. The European aerospace giant Airbus employs over 14,000 people in Britain making massive wings for its planes. Some parts must go back and forth between Britain and the European Union before final assembly. So any transport holdup could wreak havoc with production.Other firms have been stockpiling goods to prepare for an Armageddon scenario. Warehouse space in Britain has been filling up at record rates as companies from electronics producers to appliance makers stock inventories to meet demand in case they cannot get supplies quickly, according to KPMG, the professional services firm.Even Britain\u2019s own Department of Health is examining how to ensure continuity in the supply chain for medicines, vaccines, radioisotope products and medical devices under different Brexit outcomes \u2014 including if the country comes crashing out, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the National Health Service, told a parliamentary committee.\u201cNobody,\u201d Mr. Stevens said, \u201cis suggesting that this is a desirable situation in which to find ourselves.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of France\u2019s prime minister. He is \u00c9douard Philippe, not Phillippe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Spain\u2019s Smartest Streets, a Property Boom Made in Venezuela", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut as millions of Venezuelans wage a daily fight for survival at home, others have found a safe haven for their money across the Atlantic: Madrid\u2019s real estate market.During a walk around Salamanca, an upmarket district of the Spanish capital, Luis Valls-Taberner, a real-estate investment adviser, pointed out on almost every street a building that he said a wealthy Venezuelan had recently acquired.Mr. Valls-Taberner would not identify the buyers. Some properties, he said, were purchased through investment companies based in Miami or elsewhere \u2014 but the money always came from Venezuela.In Salamanca alone, by the estimates of some Madrid real-estate companies, over 7,000 luxury apartments are now owned by Venezuelans.While some of this Venezuelan investment money comes from associates of Mr. Maduro\u2019s regime, the bulk is from families who became rich decades ago, in an economy whose main asset, oil, was nationalized in the 1970s.\u201cThe big fortunes in Venezuela have always been connected among themselves and dependent on having a good relationship with the state,\u201d said Rolando Seijas, the Venezuelan founder of SNB Capital, a Madrid-based investment firm whose activities range from insurance services to an electronics component factory in southern Spain.Unlike Mexicans and other Latin Americans now investing in Spain, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re here as survivors who know that the bridges to our home country have probably been burned.\u201dIn fact, some Venezuelans have become successful entrepreneurs in Spain, starting delivery services, opening restaurants and shops or taking over franchises, like that of the American fast-food chain Subway.To escape Venezuela\u2019s crisis, Andoni Goicoechea left his medical studies and moved to Madrid, where he founded Goiko Grill, which now operates 44 burger restaurants across Spain. In June, a private equity firm controlled by LVMH, the French luxury group, acquired a majority stake in the business, valuing it at 150 million euros, or about $175 million.\u201cThe priority for Venezuelans was to get a home here, but they\u2019re now feeling comfortable in Spain and branching out into all sorts of other businesses,\u201d said Mr. Valls-Taberner.In turn, self-exiled Venezuelan businessmen say they are encouraging their countrymen to join them in Spain.\u201cIf we have to hire anybody here, we\u2019re always looking to add a Venezuelan,\u201d said Jorge Neri, whose assets in Spain include Cambio 16, a news publication. \u201cEven if we weren\u2019t all close friends in Caracas, we now share this feeling of having suffered the same tragedy.\u201dThis year, the Coh\u00e9n group also bought a building in Salamanca that will be turned into a dozen luxury apartments. Among Salamanca\u2019s other investors is Miguel \u00c1ngel Capriles, a relative of Henrique Capriles, a politician and leader of the opposition in Venezuela.Amid mounting international pressure on Mr. Maduro, the Spanish authorities have been stepping up their efforts to monitor the inflow of Venezuelan money. It\u2019s a difficult task, according to some lawyers, given that wealthy Venezuelans have always kept money overseas to offset capital controls and currency fluctuations.\u201cSpain has the obligation to control money inflows, but rich Venezuelans have long learnt that their savings should be in a strong currency, preferably in an overseas account,\u201d said Juan Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez, a Venezuelan lawyer who moved to Madrid last December.Venezuelans are also among the main applicants to Spain\u2019s \u201cgolden visa\u201d program, which grants residency to foreigners buying a property worth \u20ac500,000 or more, or about $582,000, a measure instituted in 2013 to help revive the crisis-hit economy.On the other hand, members of the Venezuelan opposition have used social media to keep track in Spain of the \u201cbolochicos,\u201d a derogatory nickname given to the younger heirs of the Bolivarian republic of Venezuela started by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who became president in 1999.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about government officials and their families who reside in Spain, but whose salaries could never normally allow them to buy an apartment of \u20ac500,000 here,\u201d said Mr. Cremades, the lawyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E-Waste Offers an Economic Opportunity as Well as Toxicity", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThe police raid on a junkyard on the outskirts of Bangkok had all the trappings of a drug bust. Swarming onto the open-air property in late May, officers from the Royal Thai Police found undocumented workers from Laos and Myanmar engaged in dangerous work that exposed them to blasts of toxic fumes and dust \u2014 a common hazard on the lowest rung of their illegal and booming international trade. The products these workers handled, however, were not heroin or methamphetamines but vast piles of discarded computers, electrical wires and circuit boards. And it\u2019s very likely that much of this electronic waste came from one of the world\u2019s biggest producers: the United States.E-waste has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing trash stream. For all of us who have discarded a phone or computer for a newer, sleeker model, the reasons are hardly a mystery. Still, the growth is staggering: The worldwide accumulation of e-waste has more than doubled in the last nine years. In 2016, according to the United Nations University, a global think tank that tracks the problem, the yearly accumulation reached 49.3 million tons \u2014 enough to fill more than a million 18-wheel trucks stretching from New York to Bangkok and back. By 2021, the annual total is predicted to surpass 57 million tons.The explosion of e-waste highlights its dual (and dueling) identities as both environmental scourge and potential economic resource. Though often laced with lead, mercury or other toxic substances, laptops and phones also contain valuable elements like gold, silver and copper. Yet barely 20 percent of the world\u2019s e-waste is collected and delivered to formal recyclers. The fate of the rest is largely unknown. Only 41 nations compile e-waste statistics, and their partial data can\u2019t keep up with the expansion of electronic devices into so many consumer categories \u2014 toys and toilets, watches and refrigerators. In the United States, which generated an estimated 6.9 million tons of e-waste in 2016 (42 pounds per person), most e-waste probably goes straight into the trash. By one account, e-waste makes up just 2 percent of the total volume in American landfills \u2014 but more than two-thirds of heavy metals.A significant but ultimately unquantified portion of American e-waste is quietly exported, mostly to Asia. Until last year, China was handling an estimated 70 percent of the world\u2019s processed e-waste. In January, Beijing imposed a sweeping ban on the import of e-waste as part of its \u201cNational Sword\u201d campaign to slash the levels of what it calls \u201cforeign garbage.\u201d Though spurred by environmental concerns \u2014 rivers choked with toxic chemicals, local children with high levels of lead in their blood \u2014 Beijing\u2019s move also seems emblematic of its increasing self-sufficiency and growing rejection of the West. The ban has caused upheaval in the global trade in e-waste, diverting huge amounts to smaller nations ill equipped to handle the overflow.Even before the ban came into full effect, Chinese waste traders were setting up shop in Thailand. Days after the May raid outside Bangkok, the Thai police displayed seven containers at a local port, each packed with 24 tons of mostly broken electronics. So far, the Thai police have suspended the operations of five illegal e-waste processing facilities and found evidence of dozens of smaller high-polluting operations that risk contaminating the countryside. \u201cThailand is getting hit by a tidal wave of electronic waste,\u201d says Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based nonprofit that has used GPS devices to track illegal exports of e-waste to Asia. \u201cThe rest of Asia better get ready, because they are next.\u201dThe precious metals in e-waste, found especially in circuit boards, are more concentrated than in the most productive mines. In 2016, the gold in the world\u2019s e-waste equaled more than a tenth of the gold mined globally that year. And yet much of this treasure is simply reburied in landfills. Based on e-waste disposal rates, Americans alone throw out phones worth $60 million in gold and silver every year.The idea of \u201cmining\u201d e-waste has tantalized the recycling and electronics industries for decades. Until recently, most methods to extract value have been costly, inefficient and hazardous. Backyard recyclers in places like India and Indonesia recover gold by bathing circuit boards in nitric and hydrochloric acid, thus poisoning waterways and communities. Others, like the migrant workers in Thailand, break down used electronics with cooking stoves and shredders and wear no protection against the emissions.Over the last few years, however, innovators have devised safer techniques in the lab that would wrest value from e-waste. One isolates rare-earth elements with carbon nanotube technology; another recovers key minerals by bombarding them with underwater sound waves. Josh Lepawsky, a Canadian geographer and the author of \u201cReassembling Rubbish,\u201d finds hope in a curious phenomenon: the growing re-export of e-waste from the developing world back to advanced countries that have greater recycling capacity. An \u201ce-waste offset\u201d by which countries importing high-quality used electronics send back an equal volume of e-waste \u201cis very promising,\u201d Lepawsky says.As the extraction of metals becomes more efficient and eco-friendly, tech manufacturers may feel compelled to get raw materials from their own end-of-life products rather than from the earth. Apple, for instance, has pledged to make all of its future laptops and iPhones out of renewable resources or recycled materials. The idea goes beyond business to national security. \u201cGovernments are starting to take a more strategic view of e-waste, too,\u201d Khetriwal says. \u201cThey ask, \u2018How can we secure the raw materials we need for the future?\u2019\u2009\u201d Some of these metals and rare-earth elements are scarce, and some, like cobalt, are found mostly in conflict zones. By mining the ever-expanding mountains of e-waste, countries could steel themselves against the volatility in prices and supplies of the global market.Some e-waste optimists envision a \u201ccircular economy\u201d in which refurbished, reused and recycled raw materials help fuel a sustainable future. Japan was an early leader of this movement, pushing e-waste recycling with tough laws and, more recently, appealing gimmicks. At the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, athletes will receive gold, silver and bronze medals forged from recycled e-waste \u2014 emblems of a world in which e-waste can take on the sheen of immortality.The utopian vision of a circular economy is a long way off, though. E-waste recycling remains stubbornly low in most parts of the world. Even the extraction of precious metals has proved hard for companies to capitalize on. And the remaining mass of e-waste \u2014 mainly plastics laced with metals, chemicals and flame retardant \u2014 pose a more intractable problem. The recycling of these complex plastics would probably need to be subsidized or enforced through legislation \u2014 and few countries outside Europe or Japan have shown the commitment to make that happen.To move toward a circular economy, manufacturers would also need to embrace a \u201cgreen design\u201d that minimizes the generation of e-waste in the first place. Companies like Apple and Dell, though, have not taken enough measures to make their products easier to use longer. \u201cPlanned obsolescence,\u201d the intentional creation of products that rapidly become outdated so customers must replace them with ever-newer models, remains the modus operandi of the tech industry. Manufacturers argue that the approach stimulates not only profits but also the very innovation that drives the global economy. And it has produced a Pavlovian response in consumers, for whom the temptation to buy a slightly cooler phone every couple of years has hardened into a seeming necessity. Not long ago, one tech manufacturer introduced a cheaper, longer-lasting phone \u2014 the perfect antidote to planned obsolescence. It was not a hit \u2014 but it was a reminder that we all share some responsibility for the explosion of e-waste in scrap yards across the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Are Having Fewer Babies. They Told Us Why. ", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen have more options, for one. But a new poll also shows that financial insecurity is altering a generation\u2019s choices. Because the fertility rate subtly shapes many major issues of the day \u2014 including immigration, education, housing, the labor supply, the social safety net and support for working families \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of concern about why today\u2019s young adults aren\u2019t having as many children. So we asked them. The survey, one of the most comprehensive explorations of the reasons that adults are having fewer children, tells a story that is partly about greater gender equality. Women have more agency over their lives, and many feel that motherhood has become more of a choice. At the same time, he said, \u201cThere is no getting around the fact that the relationship between gender equality and fertility is very strong: There are no high-fertility countries that are gender equal.\u201d In the Morning Consult and Times survey, more than half of the 1,858 respondents \u2014 a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 20 to 45 \u2014 said they planned to have fewer children than their parents. About half were already parents. Of those who weren\u2019t, 42 percent said they wanted children, 24 percent said they did not and 34 percent said they weren\u2019t sure. Jessica Boer, 26, has a long list of things she\u2019d rather spend time doing than raising children: being with her family and her fianc\u00e9; traveling; focusing on her job as a nurse; getting a master\u2019s degree; playing with her cats. \u201cMy parents got married right out of high school and had me and they were miserable,\u201d said Ms. Boer, who lives in Portage, Mich. \u201cBut now we know we have a choice.\u201d Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave. She admits being \u201ca little nervous\u201d that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighborhood. \u201cA lot of people, especially communities of color, can\u2019t really afford that now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just apprehensive about going back to poverty. I know how it goes, I know the effects of it, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Can I ever break this curse?\u2019 I would just like to change the narrative around.\u201d David Carlson, 29, graduated from college in 2010, when the job market was still rough. He and his wife had $100,000 in undergraduate debt between them. They both work full time \u2014 he in corporate finance and she in counseling \u2014 but they don\u2019t yet feel they can take time away from their careers. High employment among women and high fertility don\u2019t have to be in conflict, but they will be without such policies, said Olivier Thevenon, an economist studying child and family policies at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cWhether the young generation will catch up later is not certain,\u201d he said, \u201cbut will depend on their capacity to combine work and family.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Her Husband Was a Princeton Graduate Student. Then He Was Taken Prisoner in Iran.", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "FeatureHua Qu is fighting to save her husband \u2014 one of at least seven U.S. captives in the Islamic Republic being used as pawns in a nearly 40-year secret history of hostage taking.Supported byHe wasn\u2019t looking for an adventure \u2014 he had a 2-year-old son and a wife who had only just arrived in the United States from China. Compared with Turkmenistan, Iran was an open book, and compared with Afghanistan, which he also considered, it was safe. Moreover, Iran\u2019s archives had a wealth of material useful to his research. He would need to learn Persian and at least survey the literature on Iran. But this sort of thing came easily to him: He was a voracious reader with a gift for languages.He left for Tehran in late January 2016, the same month that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.), better known as the Iran nuclear deal, took full effect. Wang, a Chinese-born, naturalized American citizen, set out for Iran without a worry. The Dehkhoda language institute in Tehran sponsored his visa, and an Iranian consular authority stamped its approval on Princeton\u2019s letter of introduction, which indicated that the purpose of Wang\u2019s travel was archival research. He would be using two collections: the diplomatic archive housed at the country\u2019s foreign ministry and the National Archives of Iran.He rented a room in a Chinese couple\u2019s apartment near Vanak Square, in a lively middle-class neighborhood in the north of Tehran. He got up at 6 each morning for a video chat with his wife and son, had cookies and milk for breakfast and then took a taxi to the diplomatic archives, just south of the city\u2019s center, arriving by 8 a.m. and staying until closing time. Because many of the documents he needed were handwritten in an antiquated Persian script, Wang engaged a local scholar to help him decode them. He waxed \u201cexuberant\u201d about his research, his Princeton adviser, the historian Stephen Kotkin, recalls. Four days a week, he studied Persian at the Dehkhoda institute.The days were long and often frustrating. First there was Nowruz, the Persian new year, which shut down the archives for weeks. Then there was the traffic. In Tehran, taxis are cheap, air is poisonous and you can get exactly nowhere inside of an hour. Before he knew it, in June, came Ramadan, when, in deference to local regulation and custom, he would pass 14-hour days without food or drink, only gulping down porridge and instant noodles in his apartment after 9 at night. To one close friend, Wang sounded peevish. He just needed to access the National Archives before he could come home. But unlike the diplomatic archive, the National Archives were holding him at bay.The National Archives of Iran are indexed in a database. Scholars sit at terminals to pore through the index, then submit lists of documents they wish to see. Only if you have an archive \u201cmembership\u201d can the archivists then burn a selection of these documents to a disk for you, at a fee of six cents a page. This step is crucial: When historians work in archives far from home, they routinely collect thousands of pages of documents for later study. Wang had applied for his membership early on, and every week, he stopped by the sprawling, tiered brick complex to check on the status of his request. He never got an answer.The local scholar working with Wang proposed that they peruse the index together, and then the scholar, a former employee of the National Archives, would submit the request for the documents under his own name. Wang was eager to get home. Having the scholar take the copies was a workaround, and as Wang understood it, not an uncommon one. The archivists gave the scholar half the documents. But when he went back for the second half, they objected, and the next day, the scholar was interrogated by the police.Wang wrote to Kotkin and explained what he had gathered and what was still outstanding. Kotkin gave him his blessing to leave Iran and return for the remaining documents another time. Wang told his wife he was coming home.That was when the calls started coming \u2014 strangers with unknown numbers, summoning Wang to a police station for questioning. Interrogators took his passport and his laptop. There was a problem with his visa, they told him. He couldn\u2019t do this kind of research with that visa. Anyway, why had the local scholar requested his documents? He called his adviser. He called the Swiss Embassy, which represents American interests in Iran. Everyone told him not to worry. This sort of thing happened often enough: Iranian authorities harassed or intimidated scholars, particularly those from the United States or Britain, telling them their visas were out of order and eventually sending them on their way. But until they gave back Wang\u2019s passport, he was stuck. Days passed, and his panic mounted.On Aug. 7, an unknown caller told him to report to a hotel. He phoned his wife, Hua Qu, back in New Jersey: If she didn\u2019t hear from him after this meeting, she should notify Princeton right away. A few hours later, he called back with good news. He was at his apartment, packing and paying his rent. The Iranians were sending him home. A man waiting downstairs would take him to the airport. She should have someone from the Swiss Embassy meet him there with a plane ticket.For five hours, the Swiss diplomat waited for Wang at the airport. The ticketed flight came and went. The next time Qu heard from her husband, she was at Princeton\u2019s Firestone Library, and August was at an end. She got a call from an unknown number. It was Wang, in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison, crying so hard he couldn\u2019t speak.For Washington, the hostage crisis that unfolded in November 1979, when revolutionary students stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats and staff members captive for 444 days, would become a primal scene in U.S.-Iran relations. Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency foundered as his administration lurched from diplomacy with a changing cast of disempowered actors to a rescue mission that literally ran aground in a desert sandstorm. In its wake, the hostage crisis left billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in the United States. It also left an entrenched rhetoric of mutual demonization, and a diplomatic rupture that would become a logic unto itself.The loss of its embassy did not stop the United States from doing business with Iran in the 1980s, so long as the subject was hostages: Iranian-backed militias in Lebanon held 25 Americans captive. Violating a weapons embargo, Ronald Reagan\u2019s White House secretly shipped Tehran missiles in exchange for assurances that some hostages would be released. President George H.W. Bush came into office promising Iran \u201cgood will\u201d gestures related to the captives \u2014 one of which involved expediting the release of $567 million in Iranian frozen assets just before the last hostages came home in the early 1990s. Bush was criticized as having offered a kind of ransom.Today, extrapolating from survey data, 100,000 to 400,000 Americans travel to Iran every year. A vast majority pass through unmolested. Most are Iranian-American dual nationals, many with family in the old country. Because of reciprocal visa restrictions, very few travelers are like Wang: American sole-passport bearers traveling as researchers, journalists or even tourists. For decades the conventional wisdom has held that such travelers, if they are lucky enough to get in, are unlikely to be detained. Since Wang\u2019s imprisonment, a State Department travel advisory has warned otherwise. But travel advisories rarely succeed in deterring dual nationals from seeing their families.Iranian-Americans who visit Iran have been distinctly at risk at least since 2007, when they became targets of hard-liners who were consolidating power in Tehran. The ruling faction viewed links to the United States with particular suspicion because of the Western-supported color revolutions in the former Soviet bloc and the George W. Bush administration\u2019s rhetoric about democracy promotion and regime change. From prison in 2007, two Iranian-American scholars were forced to appear on state television, apparently confessing to fomenting \u201cvelvet revolution\u201d against the Islamic Republic on behalf of the United States. They were freed within nine months, without any known concession from the American government. Other dual-national arrests would follow, apparently to the beat of Iranian domestic politics.When Barack Obama took office in 2009 \u2014 determined both to open a serious diplomatic channel to Iran over its nuclear program and to impose draconian sanctions that would significantly increase American bargaining power \u2014 the detention of American citizens was drawn into the dance of approach and retreat that defined the new bilateral relationship. Whether Iranian hard-liners meant for the arrests to build their country\u2019s leverage or to undermine diplomacy was a matter for speculation. But by the end of 2015, Iran held at least seven American prisoners, and the Obama administration\u2019s effort to free them would follow a diplomatic track of its own, involving first-ever direct talks with Iran\u2019s secretive security establishment.The United States has long negotiated with Iran for hostages and has long argued over the unwinnable dilemmas such negotiations entail. Is it ransom to hold back frozen Iranian assets pending a prisoner release? What about trading convicted arms smugglers for American prisoners whom the U.S. government believes to be innocent? No American administration, Republican or Democratic, has found a compromise that doesn\u2019t risk rewarding bad behavior or endangering Americans traveling to Iran. But no past or present American official I talked to could countenance, for even a minute, drawing a line and refusing to help the next prisoner get out of Iran.When Donald Trump was running for president, he described the problem with characteristic bravado, like nothing he couldn\u2019t scare straight: \u201cWell, Iran has done it again,\u201d he tweeted, regarding the arrest of the retired Unicef official Baquer Namazi in February 2016. \u201cTaken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn\u2019t happen if I\u2019m president!\u201dBut sometimes the U.S.-Iran relationship feels like a Chinese finger trap: The harder either side pulls away, the more fiercely both are joined. Under Trump\u2019s administration, Washington has whiplashed from cautious d\u00e9tente to ferocious retrenchment on Iran, doing away with the nuclear deal and showing Iran the back of its hand with renewed sanctions and an immigration ban that disproportionately punishes Iranians. Still, Trump has not escaped the hostage conundrum. At least five citizens and two permanent residents of the United States remain in Iranian prisons, years of their lives unspooling into a cruel stasis. One way or another, getting them out is going to mean making a deal.The horizon of his incarceration stretched indefinitely into the future, his life in Princeton a place he visited only in dreams, from which he woke disoriented. There was no furniture in his cell, and prisoners sat cross-legged on the floor. Wang had stocky thighs that pressed his knees until arthritis hobbled him. The boredom was excruciating, the separation from his son unspeakable. He was allowed to talk to Qu weekly, and he told her he had eyed a drinking glass and thought about using it to end his life. The prison put him on antidepressants. He had pains, mainly headaches, for which the prison doctor once administered eight shots of painkiller in a single day.\u201cFor me this case is actually in two parts,\u201d Qu told me when I met her last fall. \u201cOne is to bring him back. The other is to make sure that he survives.\u201dWhen she and Wang first met in late 2009, they were each passing through jobs at a Hong Kong law firm, hers as a lawyer working inhuman hours, his as a research assistant. He was on his way to Afghanistan to work as a translator for the International Committee of the Red Cross and perfect his Pashto. Before he left for Kandahar, they had a date in Beijing, where they strolled the old lanes of the Forbidden City for hours, talking with a comfort Qu had never known.She was reserved and serious. He was outgoing, with a vast, unquenchable curiosity about the world. Because his grandfather was a political cartoonist and editor of the French edition of a state-run magazine, Wang grew up in a Beijing compound where diplomats and official translators lived. That was how he discovered his yen for languages. Now Wang spoke Russian, Uzbek, Manchu, Pashto, Hindi and Urdu. His dream was to study at Princeton with Kotkin, one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent scholars of modern Eurasian politics.He applied around the time they married in 2012, and in March 2013, three months after he was accepted, Qu gave birth to their son, Shaofan. Wang was already an American citizen: His mother married an American when he was a teenager, and Wang lived in the United States as an undergraduate at the University of Washington and a master\u2019s student at Harvard. Arrangements for Qu\u2019s visa and employment would take time, so Wang went ahead of her, returning to see her and the baby in China as often as he could.He built a community in her absence: study partners, colleagues, fellow speakers of little-known languages. Later, some of Wang\u2019s Princeton friends would marvel at all they hadn\u2019t yet known about him. There was always one more language he knew than you expected, one more place he had lived. He was the kind of friend who made you a Chinese feast if he saw you lonely on your birthday and bought you an espresso maker if he caught you drinking unworthy swill. He was the student who emailed the professor questions after class and requested outside reading no matter how heavy the required load. He was also a foodie who attacked a recipe the way he did a foreign grammar, spending whole days in the painstaking production of a lavish meal from one of his regions of study.When Wang\u2019s family arrived in the fall of 2014, remembers Janet Chen, his Chinese history professor, \u201cHe just walked differently. There was light to him.\u201d Qu worked long days, commuting to the Manhattan office of her Chinese law firm, so for a while, Wang was the primary parent. Fatherhood delighted him. Chen remembers his showing up to class dripping wet and beaming after carrying Shaofan a mile to day care in the pouring rain.After Wang disappeared, Qu and Shaofan remained in graduate-student housing, their tidy apartment papered with the delicate watercolors Qu painted in her spare time. She had become a one-woman lobbying operation: lawyer, wife, investigator, advocate. Driven and fiercely intelligent, she spoke a clipped, Chinese-accented English with a seemingly limitless vocabulary.From the time of Wang\u2019s first call from Evin, Qu says, she was in frequent contact with an Iran-desk officer at the State Department. The Obama administration was in its final year, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in its first one. The detainee issue, Qu\u2019s contact assured her, would be raised at the quarterly J.C.P.O.A. meetings in Vienna. Other than that, the State Department promised only to send diplomatic notes urging Wang\u2019s release.And so in 2016, Qu, a Chinese national, focused her efforts on her own embassy. She thought she had made progress when Wang\u2019s interrogator had him sign a document stating that he wished to be released to China. (Neither the Chinese nor the Iranian diplomatic representatives in the United States responded to requests for comment.) The Chinese had agreed to accept him, she recalls, even though he had relinquished his Chinese passport by becoming an American citizen. But then, Qu says, the Iranians reneged: They told the Chinese they wanted nothing short of an exchange of interest with the U.S. government.As Washington pursued a landmark nuclear deal with Iran in 2014 and 2015, negotiators understood that the discussions had to include some prospect of repatriating American detainees. At the time these included the Christian pastor Saeed Abedini; the former United States Marine Amir Hekmati; and The Washington Post\u2019s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi (Salehi would be released on bail). \u201cIt was clear from Obama on down, every policy decision had to think about how we get our people back,\u201d recalls James O\u2019Brien, Obama\u2019s special envoy for hostage affairs. And yet as Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert on the American negotiating team, puts it, \u201cWe did not want to create the impression we were trading centrifuges for Americans.\u201dStarting in late 2014, American negotiators met regularly with representatives of the Iranian security establishment, hashing out the terms of a prisoner exchange. They kept the talks separate from the simultaneous nuclear negotiation and another frozen-assets arbitration. To address misgivings within the administration \u2014 particularly from the Department of Justice \u2014 the negotiators determined that the United States would not release terrorists, violent criminals or anyone who posed a threat to national security. The swap\u2019s timing would also make it a \u201cone-off,\u201d rather than a dangerous precedent, because the nuclear deal presented a unique opportunity for a breakthrough on all fronts.There would still be painful trade-offs. The first involved Robert Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent and private investigator who occasionally did work for the C.I.A. Levinson disappeared in 2007 when he went to the island of Kish, an Iranian free-trade zone, hoping to recruit an intelligence source. No matter what the Americans offered, the Iranians stonewalled, claiming to know nothing about Levinson\u2019s whereabouts or suggesting he was spirited to Pakistan by nonstate actors. The swap went forward without Levinson, but the Americans stipulated that movement on his case would be the threshold condition for any future prisoner deal. This, too, was a safeguard against precedent-setting, they reasoned: His case was singular, and his U.S. government connection conferred a certain plausibility, as well as a moral imperative, to trading for him.The Iranians seized three more Americans in the fall of 2015, even as they negotiated. One of these, in mid-October, was an Iranian-American businessman named Siamak Namazi. The American team put Namazi\u2019s name on the table in November. But by then, according to one negotiator, the deal was \u201ccooked\u201d: The two sides had hammered out their lists, twisted the arms of their own judiciaries and secured each other\u2019s grudging approval. The Iranians insisted that if Namazi was to be included in the prisoner swap, so should some of the prisoners the Americans nixed at the outset. It would be back to the drawing board.\u201cI think we then made the assessment, right or wrong, but we didn\u2019t have much time, that it could\u2019ve queered the whole thing, and perhaps delayed, and then who knows what would\u2019ve happened,\u201d an Obama administration official involved in the negotiations told me. \u201cWe would\u2019ve been faced with the other families saying, \u2018What just happened to our people?\u2019\u2009\u201dOn implementation day, a Swiss plane left Iran with Hekmati, Abedini and Rezaian. A fourth American, Nosratollah Khosravi, followed. And two other American detainees, Kian Tajbakhsh and Matthew Trevithick, quietly left on commercial flights, in an arrangement officially classed as separate from the larger package.In return, the United States released seven Iranians who had been convicted or were awaiting trial, mainly on charges related to the transfer to Iran of technology with military applications. None of them elected to go back to Iran. The United States also dropped charges and Interpol arrest warrants against 14 Iranians it deemed unlikely to be extradited. And it cleared for takeoff a plane carrying a portion of a $1.7 billion claims settlement, which had been held back as collateral pending the prisoner release.There was a heady symbolism to the return of American prisoners as the page turned on U.S.-Iran relations. But not for everyone. Siamak Namazi\u2019s brother, Babak, recalls feeling unthinkably betrayed when he learned from the television news that his brother wasn\u2019t on the plane: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a war zone, and a soldier\u2019s running toward a helicopter, and the helicopter is still down, but you say, \u2018You know what? We were really committed to taking off, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and take off.\u2019\u2009\u201dBabak should be patient, his State Department contacts told him. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif of Iran had given Secretary of State John Kerry his personal assurance that Siamak would be out within weeks. But that didn\u2019t happen. Worse, Babak\u2019s 81-year-old father, Baquer, was arrested at the Tehran airport on Feb. 22 and taken to Evin as a prisoner.One provision of the swap agreement was a channel for the continuing discussion of the Levinson case \u2014 and, as it turned out, others. By the end of February, there were Levinson and the two Namazis. Then, over the summer, the Iranians picked up at least four others, including Xiyue Wang.The advice ran counter to that of many experts with whom I spoke: Iranian human rights specialists, a former Iranian official and at least one State Department official. But as Durkee explained to me, Princeton had determined that publicity and pressure would neither change the Iranians\u2019 minds nor do more than distract the people in Washington who were already on the case.For a year, Qu kept her husband\u2019s arrest a secret. When friends and colleagues asked about Wang, she told them his research abroad was taking longer than expected. Much of his graduate-student cohort was gone anyway, having dispersed to conduct fieldwork.Qu didn\u2019t know about the prisoner channel built into the 2016 swap, and she didn\u2019t know that it was failing. The Iranians weren\u2019t serious about negotiating. They hemmed and hawed about meeting, pushing it off for months and then showing up unprepared. It was like dealing with Columbo, an official who worked the channel told me: An Iranian interlocutor pulled crumpled papers from his pockets and struggled to read from them names of more than 40 people whose cases were supposedly of deep concern. The Obama administration understood that the Iranians were stalling. They were waiting out the American election. And then they were waiting for Trump.In January 2017, the Trump administration came in without an Iran policy, other than the eventual ambition to dismantle the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Crucial positions at the National Security Council and the State Department remained vacant into the fall, and high-level foreign policy officials cycled through a revolving door. The office of special presidential envoy for hostage affairs sat conspicuously empty until about two months ago. One detainee\u2019s family was bounced to seven different officials in search of someone in charge.About six months into the Trump presidency, the Iranians requested direct talks on the prisoner issue. They received no response.That was when the Iranians went public with Wang\u2019s case. On July 16, 2017, Mizan, the news agency associated with the Iranian judiciary, reported that Xiyue Wang had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage. He had stolen thousands of pages of sensitive documents, the article claimed, at the behest of the State Department, in order to infiltrate and overthrow the Islamic Republic. The article did not mention that the documents in question dated from the Qajar dynasty, long before the Islamic Republic was even a gleam in Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s eye. If Wang was a spy, Janet Chen wryly observed, \u201che was spying on the dead.\u201dThe American press picked up the story, and a day later, on July 17, Zarif was asked about Wang\u2019s case when he spoke in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations. Zarif reminded listeners that he had no authority over judicial matters. But the United States and allied countries did have Iranians in detention on sanctions-related charges, he noted: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s tit for tat. ...\u201d On July 24, a news agency associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps followed up with a list of 12 Iranians facing what Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, called \u201cbaseless\u201d American sanctions charges.Qu saw something more than a change of subject in these remarks. \u201cThe signal is very clear,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey want to do a swap. So what I want is, I want Xiyue back. So can you do a swap with the Iranians? Or if not a swap, can you talk to them, at least?\u201dOnly in late November did Washington signal its openness to the dialogue on prisoners that the Iranians requested months earlier. Now the Iranian interlocutors hedged: The invitation had expired, they replied, and they had to await new instructions from Tehran.Academic exchange, the video explained, was a Trojan horse for regime change. The film spliced together footage of Wang during the interrogations that preceded his arrest, and then in prison pajamas, flanked by blurred-out men in suits. There was a clip of Wang detailing which archives he had used, one of him stating that better American understanding of Iran would surely lead to better policy and one of him sitting at a desk with his head in his hands, as though miserable or in pain. A voice-over explained that Princeton and Harvard were suborganizations of the C.I.A. and the National Security Council. They assigned their students\u2019 thesis topics in accordance with the information the United States government wished to collect.The video seemed designed to make a case for Wang\u2019s value as a prisoner. Its release coincided with his being shuffled around: One day, he was taken to court and told he would have another trial, which could mean anything, but he doubted it was good. He waited all day and was returned to his cell. Then, in December, again without being told why, he was transferred to a different ward, where he met Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and permanent resident of the United States arrested in September 2015 and also sentenced to 10 years for espionage. At least he had someone to talk to in English. He had a kitchenette, now, too. And in profusion, he had bedbugs.What Wang did not have, to his grief, were books. Qu tried every means she could think of to get them to him. So did his friends. He would teach himself Albanian, classical Mongolian and ancient Tibetan, if he could only receive the care packages he was sent. He certainly had the time. But books took months to get through, and the ones he requested were sometimes replaced by others his captors preferred.Wang was now allowed frequent phone calls, which he mostly made to Qu. Once he called Janet Chen, who chitchatted with him about his research ideas but found the experience \u201cjust shattering,\u201d she told me hours afterward. \u201cLiterally, if they said, \u2018We want your arm,\u2019 I\u2019d give it. I really would.\u201dWhen Wang\u2019s case went public, the parents at Shaofan\u2019s preschool had spontaneously organized around Qu. Whatever she needed done, they were ready to do, whether it was picking Shaofan up from school, circulating petitions, organizing rallies on campus or acting as her publicists and advocates with everyone from Fox News to Amnesty International. They held increasingly formal meetings after their children went to bed, brainstorming campaigns and mulling over the details of the latest news from Evin, Washington and Princeton\u2019s Nassau Hall. The day care parents had no previous experience with any of this. They were admittedly inept at social media and at building websites a search engine could locate. But they had no higher commitment than Qu\u2019s family\u2019s well-being, and they were indefatigable.Qu had become an Iran expert in her own right by the end of 2017. She was also depleted, having been charged with the impossible task of sustaining both Wang\u2019s spirits and her own. Shaofan spoke less and less often about his father and grew impatient with the distant, echoey voice on speaker phone that asked him to speak up and repeat himself, and then took his mother away to a world of dark and endless grown-up talk he couldn\u2019t follow. Qu took Shaofan to China at the end of November for what would be a three-month reprieve from the scene of a life gone horribly awry.For policymakers, however, the problem of perverse incentives is an agonizing one, and it runs in both directions. Iranian officials have made no secret of their suspicion that the United States has started taking Iranian prisoners for the purpose of trading them. American foreign-policy officials with whom I spoke were skeptical that any such systemic effort existed. But prisoner-swapping raises the question for an Iranian-American population that feels itself exposed to legal jeopardy by the complexity of the sanctions regime. If prisoners convicted of crimes by American courts could be released for essentially political reasons \u2014 as part of a diplomatic bargain \u2014 why shouldn\u2019t Iranian-Americans fear that they could be imprisoned for political reasons as well?Zarif and other Iranian spokesmen had a troubling avatar for this concern in Ahmad Sheikhzadeh, a consultant for the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York. On March 3, 2016, federal agents arrested Sheikhzadeh as he was leaving work. They took him to a Manhattan hotel room and kept him there for questioning all night long. He had broken the law, the agents told him. He had underreported his income to the I.R.S. in the amount of $171,355 over a period of five years. And he had violated U.S. sanctions by moving approximately $187,200 to recipients in Iran over roughly the same period. According to Sheikhzadeh, the agents told him he was facing 40 years in prison but suggested he could improve his situation by becoming an informant for the F.B.I. He learned that he was practically an unwitting informant already: For about 10 years, law enforcement had monitored his every phone call and collected his every email, sweeping up the communications of journalists and scholars, among others, in the process.The wiretap must have kept somebody very busy, because Sheikhzadeh, who lived alone in a West Village apartment furnished mainly with books, was the sort of person who liked to talk on the phone. His friends puzzled over his Spartan existence and his acceptance of a part-time job aggregating news reports for the Iranian mission. He had a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University. He grew up wealthy, the son of an industrial magnate in Iran, and many of his childhood acquaintances went on to become famous politicians and intellectuals. But Sheikhzadeh preferred a simple life, and his friends benefited from his availability. He was funny, irreverent, erudite and kind, the sort of person who called your elderly mother, visiting from Iran, to entertain her in her native language while you were at work. He had a receding hairline, an aquiline nose and an air of good health from practicing yoga and swimming.Sheikhzadeh refused the F.B.I.\u2019s offer. The suggestion that he spy on his colleagues was an affront, he felt, to his honor and integrity. Instead he appeared before a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York. Even after his brother put up $3 million in bail, the prosecutor argued that Sheikhzadeh was a flight risk. He was fitted with an ankle bracelet that essentially confined him to a swath of Manhattan below 34th Street and west of Fifth Avenue, and which mortified him no end. He couldn\u2019t swim, and he felt himself a marked, degraded man. Friends stopped calling, maybe because they feared the wiretaps, or maybe because they saw the headlines from his case and couldn\u2019t be sure he wasn\u2019t a dangerous criminal. He developed bags under his eyes and an edge in his voice.He didn\u2019t contest that he had cut some corners. When his roommate moved out and his rent jumped to $1,700 a month from $600, Sheikhzadeh stopped reporting his income, which amounted to something like $28,000 in a typical year. He had inherited money that was sitting in a bank account in Iran. Accessing it was a puzzle under the sanctions regime, and so he did what he understood a lot of Iranians did. A friend or relative in the United States would ask for help getting money to a loved one in Iran for, say, a down payment or a medical treatment. The friend would give Sheikhzadeh the cash, and then Sheikhzadeh would have an equivalent amount disbursed from his Iranian account to the recipient in Iran. He did it only for people he was close to \u2014 he wasn\u2019t running a business \u2014 but legally he should have had a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Not that OFAC licenses were all that useful. Even when you had one, American banks would often decline Iranian transactions as too risky, or worse, close your account.Sanctions cases like Sheikhzadeh\u2019s, involving neither banned goods nor profits, are often resolved without going to court. But for some reason, Sheikhzadeh faced criminal charges, and the government seemed determined to put him away. On Nov. 21, 2016, he entered a guilty plea, thinking that would be the end of it. But seven months later, the government declassified some of its wiretaps and insinuated that Sheikhzadeh just might be an undeclared foreign agent who recruited people to do the bidding of the Iranian government and had introduced Zarif to an Iranian nuclear scientist living in the United States. There was no corresponding charge, just a request for an above-guidelines sentence of more than five years for the crimes to which he had pleaded guilty.When Sheikhzadeh testified at his own sentencing hearing in February 2018, the Brooklyn courtroom buzzed with federal agents, a phalanx of dark suits and ties occupying at least one full row of the gallery. He answered questions about his work for the United Nations mission, which involved culling public material about Iran into reports that he presented at weekly meetings. True, he rubbed shoulders with Iranian intelligence operatives at the mission. He never asked these people what they did, he protested. That was their business. And it was also true that he knew some Iranian dignitaries from his high school. The nuclear scientist, he explained, was an acquaintance who helped him make sense of the technical reporting around the negotiations. \u201cAnd do you think that people in Iran who work on this issue \u2014 that I helped them to advance how to develop a nuclear enrichment capability?\u201d he asked incredulously. \u201cReally makes me laugh.\u201dThe prosecution had described \u201ca defendant whose life appears to have been devoted to furthering the interests of the government of Iran,\u201d someone who pursued these goals \u201cwhile operating in the shadows and failing to report the true nature and scope of his work to U.S. authorities.\u201d And yet, even with all their intercepts, the government came up with no evidence to suggest that Sheikhzadeh had done anything illegal beyond the charges under plea. The defense retorted that Sheikhzadeh was not only the target of F.B.I. retaliation but possible \u201ctrade bait,\u201d calling him \u201ca pawn to be used in a theoretical prisoner exchange between Iran and the United States.\u201dIf this were true, perhaps the judge would have sentenced Sheikhzadeh to more than the three months she gave him on the sanctions charge. Still, Sheikhzadeh\u2019s life was a shambles. He had already paid in fines and forfeiture, to say nothing of nearly two years with the ankle bracelet. He was 62, and he was to serve starting April 10 at a federal facility called Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, which is being sued by former inmates for the abuse and mistreatment of Muslim detainees.Over coffee in the West Village in February, Sheikhzadeh told me about his time at the mission and his experiences with the American legal system. The Iranians paid him, he told me, roughly what they paid the mission\u2019s driver. They didn\u2019t particularly value his expertise as a political scientist or his diligence in compiling his exhaustive reports. He might have become a diplomat, like his peers who passed through the mission in the stratosphere above him. But he could not have borne answering for Iran\u2019s human rights record. Those who did it got used to it. But it wasn\u2019t good for the soul.The F.B.I. had many reasons to pursue him as an informant, he surmised. Surely it wanted, as his lawyer had said in court, \u201ceyes and ears\u201d inside the mission. Sheikhzadeh also imagined that having lost so many targets with the prisoner swap, the feds wanted swiftly to attract new informants. Once he was in the criminal-justice system, Sheikhzadeh felt, the prosecution had come under heavy pressure from Washington, particularly after the change in presidential administration, to incarcerate him. Whether this made him \u201ctrade bait\u201d he couldn\u2019t say.I asked him if he had considered moving back to Iran. Freedom of expression was too hard a thing to give up, said the man who had been wiretapped for a decade: \u201cI know I would have a much better life there. But as a friend of mine said, you appreciate your freedom more than anything else.\u201dBut the benefits aren\u2019t all, or even primarily, transactional. Back in 1979, holding the American Embassy hostages served a threefold purpose that seemed to justify the adventure\u2019s extraordinary price: It expiated the real paranoia of Iran\u2019s revolutionary state, cemented a particular faction\u2019s hold on power and gave the Iranians leverage over the United States. A similar logic is discernible today.As Gary Sick, Jimmy Carter\u2019s principal aide on Iran, pointed out to me, at least some Iranian hard-liners most likely really do believe the detainees pose a danger to Iran\u2019s national security. They just happen to perceive as dangerous any activity that connects Iranian citizens to the outside world, particularly the United States. Others may see the prisoners as useful instruments in Iran\u2019s factional competition. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which was behind the detentions of most of the prisoners in 2015, opposed the nuclear deal and saw the administration of President Hassan Rouhani as its rival. Taking American prisoners could have been one way to embarrass Rouhani and sour the diplomacy that was the president\u2019s signature project.\u201cThis is not about us,\u201d says John Limbert, who was himself a hostage in the American Embassy in 1979 and who worked on Iran policy at the State Department during Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cIt\u2019s about Iran\u2019s internal politics, and it\u2019s about undermining any chance of having any normal relationship.\u201dIn the long run, former Obama administration officials told me, the only way to stop the cycle is to improve relations between the United States and Iran. How else can we mitigate the paranoia that surrounds American travelers, or persuade the Iranians that they don\u2019t need this sort of brutal leverage? But like so much in U.S.-Iran relations, the hostage problem and the bilateral relationship are tied in a Gordian knot: Mutual hostility serves the interests of Iran\u2019s hard-liners, who are the ones holding the prisoners. But to mitigate that hostility is to inflame those hard-liners, who then take prisoners in order to perpetuate it.Moderates like Rouhani and Zarif may not have a lot of power over Iran\u2019s judiciary, but they have a political investment in improving the country\u2019s human rights record and its relations with the outside world. A backward turn in U.S.-Iran relations undermines this faction\u2019s leverage most of all. As Richard Nephew told me, \u201cIt gives people in a position to help fewer cards to play.\u201dUnsurprisingly, the Trump administration does not see long-term resolution to the hostage standoff coming from improved relations with Iran. In May 2018, Washington unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, over the objections of its European allies, and announced renewed sanctions on Iran, including third-party sanctions that aim to make it impossible for Iran to export oil, on which its economy depends.The Trump administration does not believe that its withdrawal from the J.C.P.O.A. and its quarrels with Europe necessitate a change of strategy on the detainee issue. A State Department official I spoke with, who requested anonymity because of the extreme sensitivity of the issue, said that the United States retains a \u201crobust\u201d ability to communicate with the Iranians about the detainees, and that it continually does so through the Swiss and third parties. He was oddly sanguine that in spite of everything, the Europeans would cooperate in crucial efforts to internationalize the detainee problem and remove it from the twisted matrix of U.S.-Iran relations.The proffered dialogue on prisoners is still not on the calendar, despite repeated American requests. If it gets there, the Trump administration will face a conundrum. The Iranians habitually insist on dozens of prisoners in exchange for the handful of ours they hold. To talk them down, Washington will need to come up with sweeteners. Given how strenuously Republican politicians and pundits objected to the Obama administration\u2019s use of frozen assets in the 2016 swap, the $2 billion we still hold is most likely off the table. The State Department declined to answer questions about its negotiating strategy.North Korea released three American prisoners on May 9, and Qu wept with happiness for the prisoners\u2019 families. She told Wang, and he wept, too. For the first time in months, she felt hopeful. The Trump administration had shown that it could retrieve American citizens from arbitrary detention abroad. Never mind that the United States was at that very moment sitting down to negotiate with North Korea while turning its back on Iran.In fact, when President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal the previous day, Qu felt little more than relief \u2014 not because of the outcome, but because at least the uncertainty around the issue had come to an end. Wang\u2019s case was in no way tied to the \u201cpolitical chaos\u201d around the deal, she insisted when we spoke the week of the American withdrawal. His was a humanitarian issue. But a month later, when we spoke again, she\u2019d been ruminating over her husband\u2019s case and its links to Iran\u2019s internal politics. \u201cThe J.C.P.O.A. is at the core of everything in this,\u201d she concluded.Qu\u2019s mind churned endlessly through everything she knew and didn\u2019t know. In both categories the load was considerable. Princeton\u2019s faculty links to Iran had not helped her husband. Could they have counted against him somehow? Into what web had he flown?She studied the trail of foreign prisoners. According to Reuters, Iran has seized at least 30 dual nationals since 2015, two-thirds of them Europeans. Today Iran holds 14 known foreign nationals apart from Levinson, among whom her husband was one of only two without Iranian dual citizenship. Why, Qu wondered, were so many prisoners released, while her husband was not?\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking \u2014\u201d I began.\u201cMy thinking,\u201d she replied, \u201cis just a burden to me.\u201dOne warm evening as the semester drew to a close, Qu and the day care parents held a rally on the lawn behind Princeton\u2019s Frist Campus Center. A pack of 5-year-olds lolled in the grass, played tag or stood transfixed in front of the lectern, listening to Wang\u2019s friends, Mayor Liz Lempert of Princeton, New Jersey Representative Chris Smith and an aide to Senator Robert Menendez as the sun sank behind the brick complex.\u201cPlease, Mr. President,\u201d Qu said in closing remarks addressed to the White House. \u201cYou are our hope, and we are counting on you.\u201dWang\u2019s friends encircled her as she gathered up Shaofan and her belongings. Another academic year was coming to an end, the second in this limbo. Princeton had been Wang\u2019s dream, not Qu\u2019s, but here she stood in his aperture, holding fast to all he could no longer touch. She would bring him home this summer, she resolved. Was that too much to hope?A long time ago, Wang shared with her a Sanskrit poem in which the hero sends his distant beloved a cloud as his messenger. Look up, Wang told her once, from Kandahar, and again later, from Evin. See that cloud? It\u2019s from me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Nominee Is Mastermind of Anti-Union Legal Campaign", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven before the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union fees for government workers last month, the next phase of the conservative legal campaign against public-sector unions was underway.In March, with the decision looming, lawyers representing government workers in Washington State asked a federal court to order one of the state\u2019s largest public-employee unions \u201cto disgorge and refund\u201d fees that nonmembers had already paid. Similar lawsuits were filed in California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Ohio.The complaints could upend the legal system by arguing that states and private parties like unions face liability even though they followed the law as it existed at the time. They could also cost unions hundreds of millions of dollars.Beyond their legal claims, the cases share another striking detail: The lead counsel in each is a conservative lawyer named Jonathan F. Mitchell.Mr. Mitchell, 41, has a formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He was a Supreme Court clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia; worked at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush; taught at several law schools, including Stanford; and spent more than four years as the solicitor general of Texas.After the 2016 election, he served as a volunteer attorney on the Trump transition team, where he helped review future executive orders. In September, the president nominated him to head the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small federal agency that advises the government on improving its inner workings. His nomination awaits action by the Senate after the Judiciary Committee approved him on a party-line vote in March.In the meantime, Mr. Mitchell appears to be a driving force behind the anti-union litigation, suggesting a well-coordinated effort. In an email, he declined to discuss the matter, citing \u201cmy pending nomination and my desire not to draw attention to the lawsuits.\u201d It is unclear who funds the work of the firm cited on most of the cases, Mitchell Law.Mr. Mitchell\u2019s co-counsel in the Washington State case, Hannah Sells, a lawyer for the free-market Freedom Foundation, said she met Mr. Mitchell less than one year ago at an event put on by the Federalist Society, the conservative legal organization. He expressed interest in working on litigation related to union membership and mandatory union fees, Ms. Sells said.\u201cJonathan is a brilliant legal mind; I\u2019m a first-year attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionary, I think, is the right way to put it.\u201dKermit Roosevelt, an expert on retroactive constitutional claims at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said Mr. Mitchell\u2019s legal reasoning \u201cwould be very destabilizing\u201d beyond union matters if it gained significant traction in the court system.For instance, he said, if a future Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, applicants denied admission under the previous policy would be able to win damage awards retroactively tied their rejection.In all three cases, the judges found that the unions could claim a good-faith defense because they had followed \u201cseemingly valid state laws\u201d requiring the fees, as one judge put it, that were only later deemed to be unconstitutional. No appeals court has overturned any of these rulings.Even so, Mr. Mitchell and his allies may get a favorable reception in the one court that really matters: the Supreme Court.\u201cThis court has shown itself to be so hostile to workers\u2019 rights that they will find a way,\u201d said Sharon Block of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, who is a former senior Labor Department official and National Labor Relations Board member.Will Baude, a libertarian-minded professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, said the Supreme Court had proved less sympathetic than some lower courts to good-faith defenses for private parties like unions.Amid this possibility, Mr. Mitchell\u2019s central role, and his ties to the Trump administration, loom large.On one level, Mr. Mitchell appears well suited to head the administrative conference. It weighs in on such technical questions as how to make the process of creating regulations more efficient and democratic, and how to reduce the backlogs facing immigration judges and administrative judges, like those who preside over Social Security hearings.The agency\u2019s most recent chairman, Paul Verkuil, a law professor and dean who was appointed by President Barack Obama and served until 2015, said he had spoken with Mr. Mitchell and had come away impressed. \u201cHe knows the administrative law field very well,\u201d Mr. Verkuil said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy.\u201d (The agency has been run by acting chairmen since Mr. Verkuil left.)But in other ways, Mr. Mitchell is a curious choice, albeit one that may reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s impatience with the norms that have historically constrained the federal government.While presidents nominate members of their own parties as agency chiefs, the conference tends to be studiously bipartisan in its approach. Prominent former government officials serve on the agency\u2019s board, like Ronald Klain, a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Theodore B. Olson, who was solicitor general under Mr. Bush. A young Antonin Scalia once ran the agency.(In written responses to senators\u2019 questions, Mr. Mitchell said that he did not believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s gay-marriage decision allowed governments to deny same-sex spouses benefits that opposite-sex spouses received, and that he was not out to destroy the \u201cadministrative state,\u201d a goal some Trump advisers have espoused.)And then there are the union cases, which Mr. Mitchell filed after his nomination to head the conference, and which could also suggest a free-market worldview hostile to regulation.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who opposed the nomination in the Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Mitchell\u2019s role in the cases raised questions about his suitability for the federal position.\u201cMr. Mitchell has given us no information about how he got involved in these cases and who is backing them financially,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he is a clandestine operative of the same powerful ultraconservative special interests out to cripple unions, he is not fit to serve in this post.\u201dMr. Mitchell said he disclosed his involvement in the cases to the Judiciary Committee and the administrative conference this week, although he declined to explain how he had gotten involved. He denied that conservative groups were financing the cases.Mr. Verkuil said a chairman would have to stop representing clients in any litigation. Regardless, he said, an ideological agenda is inconsistent with the conference\u2019s mission.\u201cYou can\u2019t bring those into the agency \u2014 that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first job of the chairman is to make sure its credibility is maintained and enhanced.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

With help from his friends, Martin supplies the appropriate answers to the first two questions, but the guise is ruined when Cole (Carl Anthony Payne II) snatches the phone and responds to the third query in his \u201cblack\u201d voice, with a \u201cblack\u201d answer. The operator promptly hangs up.Martin\u2019s attempt to sound white and the operator\u2019s reaction shrewdly emphasize how the perception of whiteness grants a measure of access often closed to people of color. The episode also slyly suggests that while cultural differences do exist, black people, by virtue of being in a minority group in America, should understand white people as much as possible; their comfort and livelihood depend on it.Unlike \u201cMartin,\u201d these characters mostly manage to pull off the ruse, and when they do, it is simultaneously gratifying and mortifying. The black characters make fools of the racist whites without selling out: They are disguised not because they are ashamed of themselves, but because they\u2019re out on a mission. Yet the treatment they receive when perceived to be white only further emphasizes the systemic disparities they regularly encounter because they are black.In it, she subverted expectations of the kinds of characters a black actress could portray, morphing into 13 different personalities, including \u201cthe surfer chick\u201d who talks in an exaggerated California teenager style \u2014 an abundance of \u201clikes,\u201d \u201cO.K.s\u201d and upspeak. As Mr. McAllister points out in \u201cWhiting Up,\u201d there was nothing about the recorded stage performance that explicitly renders Ms. Goldberg\u2019s surfer chick white \u2014 viewing her as such arises from the audience\u2019s assumptions about the limitations of blackness.Ms. Ramsey\u2019s video and \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d are critiquing the dominant value system. Ms. Ramsey imitates a white person attempting black slang (\u201cHoller!\u201d) while claiming to appreciate those who aren\u2019t \u201cstereotypical, like, black\u201d; Ms. Dorsey-Rivas\u2019s narration precedes Sir-Mix-a-Lot\u2019s ode to the derri\u00e8re her character loves to hate. Both deftly unpack the absurdity of a white culture that simultaneously fetishizes, and is repulsed by, blackness.In his 2000 comedy special \u201cKillin\u2019 Them Softly,\u201d Dave Chappelle uses observational humor to point out how whiteness translates to an exclusive version of freedom. He describes how his friend Chip manages to get out of a speeding ticket \u2014 or potentially worse fate \u2014 because he is white. Mr. Chappelle has two distinct voices for Chip and the police officer who pulls them over: The officer gets a high-pitched, nasal Southern drawl reminiscent of cinematic small-town sheriffs. Chip, on the other hand, evinces a calm, if slightly nerdy, demeanor when he tells the officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201dChip embodies Langston\u2019s definition of the white voice in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201d That voice, he explains to Cassius, isn\u2019t so much about timbre as it is about a feeling \u2014 a carefree nature that comes with having your bills paid. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been fired,\u201d Langston says. \u201cJust laid off.\u201dOnce Cassius taps into his inner \u201cwhite voice,\u201d he quickly becomes a power caller, negotiating deals with the world\u2019s wealthiest people. At the office, power callers must use their white voices at all times. But this begins to take a toll on Cassius as he becomes privy to the company\u2019s evils. The affectation becomes a symbol of conformity, and worse, a betrayal of self.Advertisement"}

One country makes cars; the other grows bananas. People in CarNation want bananas, so they buy $1 million worth from people in BananaLand. Residents of BananaLand want cars, so they buy $2 million of them from CarNation. That difference is the trade deficit: BananaLand has a $1 million trade deficit; CarNation has a $1 million trade surplus. But this does not mean that BananaLand is \u2018losing\u2019 to CarNation. Cars are really useful, and BananaLanders got a lot of them in exchange for their money.\u201d Extending Mr. Irwin\u2019s example, if BananaLand did not trade with CarNation, its citizens wouldn\u2019t be spending money on cars \u2014 \u201csaving money\u201d in a narrow sense \u2014 but they wouldn\u2019t have cars either.In that same narrow sense, Mr. Trump is right that \u201cwithout trade, we could have piles of money,\u201d Mr. Lincicome said. \u201cBut we\u2019d have no food, clothing, housing, etc. So the money would be worthless, unless you swam in it like Scrooge McDuck or something. Throughout history, autarky means poverty, not wealth.\u201d Moreover, \u201cwhen a country runs a trade deficit, there is a countervailing force,\u201d Mr. Irwin noted. The money that other countries gain through trade surpluses with the United States tends to return to this country, in the form of investment. \u201cIn effect, the flow of capital is the reverse of the flow of goods,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion of suspending trade with other countries to \u201csave money\u201d also contradicts statements his economic advisers and he himself have made extolling its virtues.Expanding trade \u201chas played an important role in the development of American prosperity\u201d in the last century, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which adds, \u201cTrade remains an engine of growth for America.\u201dOther claimsMr. Trump also made several other inaccurate or misleading claims: Sources: Scott Lincicome, The New York Times, the White House Economic Report, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, YouTubeAdvertisement"}

These supplier companies in turn have invested over $275 million in Tennessee and, in so doing, created an additional 1,100 jobs. VWGoA\u2019s manufacturing operations likewise have increased local and state tax revenues by $53.5 million annually.Tariffs placed on imported materials used to build vehicles in Alabama could dramatically increase the cost of those vehicles. Tariffs placed on vehicles exported from Alabama would increase the cost, hurting the competitiveness of those vehicles in foreign markets. The inability to remain competitive will drive down automotive production, destroying Alabama jobs. We fully understand the motive for encouraging the displacement of foreign-made automobiles with American-made automobiles. That\u2019s why we welcome the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant to our community; that\u2019s why we are also glad to have Nissan\u2019s operations located in the State of Tennessee, and that\u2019s why were glad that both of them use the F.T.Z. [Free Trade Zone] program to lower their costs of producing American-made motor vehicles. A decision to impose a significant customs duty on imported cars and parts, for our port, would effectively turn back 30 years of planning, five years of construction, and millions of dollars of infrastructure improvements at marine terminals beyond those expended for the deepening itself. My husband and I both work for Southeast Bumpers and Collision Parts. We are parents of five children ranging from 23 to 4. We also have a granddaughter. The company we work for is a small business. Our entire family\u2019s future rests on these taxes not being implemented. If these were implemented the business that we work for would not be able to continue, resulting in not losing just one of our incomes but both of them. Please consider all of the families that this will affect if this passes.We are a small $2 million per year business that operates in Sanford, Fla. We import automobile steel stampings from Taiwan and assemble reproduction car bodies for classic cars. We also sell parts wholesale and retail. If we are taxed at 25 percent for the items we import (or even 5 percent), our business quickly becomes obsolete, as our wholesale and retail prices will become too high for our customers. Myself and all of our employees voted Republican/Trump in the 2016 election and we have great faith in him. Our business and suppliers pose zero threat to our national security. Instead, we employ American workers, building products that Americans and foreigners wish to buy. Our products do not compete with anything currently produced in the U.S.A. Don\u2019t ruin our American dream!These tariffs and the resulting retaliation \u2014 which will be on top of the existing steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliation against the U.S. chemical sector \u2014 will cause damaging direct and indirect effects on the U.S. chemicals industry, its $194 billion of planned investments in job-creating chemical plants in the United States, and its increasing export competitiveness. My business started with the purchase of one car which, incidentally, I sold to an overseas buyer and exported. Nearly 30 years and thousands of transactions later, I have built one of the largest businesses of its kind in the United States. At times, as much as 70 percent of our business has taken place on an international level in the buying/importing and selling/exporting of vintage vehicles. If these 25 percent tariffs are allowed to proceed, the resulting slowdown of trade and fall of vintage automobile values will have a lasting negative effect on our economy. Please do not move forward with this regulation! I run a nonprofit car-repair charity that helps impoverished single moms in the Brazos Valley in Texas near Texas A&M. We need car repair parts for vehicles, both foreign and domestic, at the lowest possible price to get these moms back on the road. Any regulation that increases the price of these repair parts hurts our ability to help the needy. Please reject this regulation. Thank you.Advertisement"}

Powell, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the economy is humming and the financial system is safe, but cautioned that trade policy has cast an uncertain shadow over the United States.Pressed repeatedly by Democrats about what the Fed could do to accelerate wage growth, Mr. Powell said a strong economy and low unemployment would ultimately lift wages. He said a range of factors outside the Fed\u2019s control have contributed to middle-class wage stagnation over the past three decades, including a slowdown in advancements in educational attainment in the American work force.He offered a mixed assessment of whether the new tax law has stimulated the American economy, agreeing with a Republican senator\u2019s assessment that the mere anticipation of tax cuts increased growth last year but telling a Democratic senator that it was too soon to say if the law had begun to lift wages.\u201cI think it would be early to look for a bill that was signed into law less than a year ago to be affecting much of anything,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell said it was possible Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy would end up liberalizing trade, by forcing other nations to reduce tariffs levied on American exports. He also said the opposite was possible, and that growth and wages could be dampened by an escalating trade war.\u201cWe don\u2019t see it in the numbers yet,\u201d Mr. Powell said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve seen a rising chorus of concern.\u201d\u201cThe Fed looked the other way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed let these banks off with a conditional non-objection.

His party, Movement for Justice, appeared to have taken 107 seats to the next party, which had 68 seats.Mr. Khan\u2019s supporters said he was less corrupt than other candidates and that he would work to alleviate poverty and bolster Pakistan\u2019s image on the world stage. But they also praised his embrace of pious Islam.\u201cI voted for him because I voted for the prophet,\u201d said Ghulam Sarwar Fardee, a retired revenue officer. \u201cKhan stands behind the blasphemy laws, and there\u2019s nothing more important than God.\u201dMr. Khan\u2019s face was everywhere \u2014 on banners, lampposts and torn flags flying from rickshaws. His supporters seemed the most enthused and confident as they awaited the initial results, expected to be announced Wednesday evening.More Pakistani women than ever were registered to vote in this election. But in one village near Peshawar, in the north, tribal elders were blocking hundreds of women from voting and representatives from the major political parties were trying to negotiate a way for the women to cast ballots.The election comes at a critical moment for a country of 200 million people and for a region stressed by war. Pakistan is a nuclear state, an antipathetic but important American ally, and one of the largest Muslim-majority countries in the world.Pakistan\u2019s politics have always been messy: The country has routinely toggled between elected governments and military dictatorships, and a prime minister has never completed his or her entire five-year term. But this year\u2019s campaign has been particularly fraught, given the military\u2019s efforts to push the former governing party out of the running.ChinaKhyber-PakhtunkhwaJammuandKashmirAfghanistanFederallyadministeredTribal AreasIslamabadLahorePUNJABQuettaPakistanBALUCHISTANIndiaIndusSINDHKarachiArabian Sea200 milesBy The New York TimesWedged between Afghanistan, where an American-led war has stretched on for 17 years, and its historical rival India, Pakistan is always at risk of a conflagration. It has served both as a crucial base for American forces fighting in Afghanistan and as a powerful obstacle to those same troops, secretly offering aid and safe harbor to militant groups, including the Taliban and Al Qaeda.But Pakistan\u2019s problems are not just about regional security \u2014 they are also about its ability to provide opportunity for its own people, including a growing class of young and educated Pakistanis. Despite its size and potential, the country\u2019s economy has lagged, and it faces persistent problems with corruption and environmental stress.As tensions with the United States and other Western countries have intensified \u2014 particularly over accusations that Pakistan is not doing enough to curb the Afghan Taliban and other militant groups \u2014 Pakistan has increasingly turned to China for aid and support. But that pivot has come with its own problems, including concern over the quickly increasing amount of debt Pakistan is racking up with China.Mr. Khan, whose success on the cricket pitch made him a household name, has held a seat in the National Assembly for five years but has never run a government. A large number of independent candidates are expected to join his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or P.T.I., if it wins.But his family remains politically powerful. His younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, 66, is the current president of the P.M.L.-N. and hopes to lead the country. Until recently, he was the chief minister of Punjab, the most populous and prosperous of the country\u2019s four provinces and the party\u2019s biggest source of support.The younger Mr. Zardari is not expected to win, but he could potentially play kingmaker if neither Mr. Khan nor Mr. Sharif receives enough votes to form a government.Among the parties seeking seats on Wednesday are Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek, the reconstituted version of a party that officials had previously banned, and Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan, which backs the country\u2019s contentious blasphemy laws.Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Lahore, Pakistan; Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan; and Russell Goldman from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor and Technology Reporting: Two Concentric Circles", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI moved from Washington to Chicago in 2016 because I thought it would improve my reporting on workers. I joked to bewildered colleagues and sources that covering labor from Washington was a bit like covering technology from Washington: By the time the political class gets wind of a story, it\u2019s been percolating in the economy for years.In May, I was at Bombfell, a fashion start-up in New York, getting styled by Will Noguchi, who selects clothing for customers. Mr. Noguchi and his algorithms immediately pegged me for what I am \u2014 a schlub with deeply conservative fashion sensibilities \u2014 and gently eased me toward the 21st-century part of my comfort zone. (\u201cSo this is definitely one that I would go with the algorithm here,\u201d he said, pointing to a johnnie-O T-shirt that the software had recommended.)Still, in my more than three years on the beat, I\u2019ve found that a lot of what we think of as shiny and new has familiar roots.There\u2019s perhaps no better example than the so-called gig economy, in which workers perform tasks on demand \u2014 not just ferrying around people and food, but also assembling furniture, tagging photos, rewriting blog content \u2014 and generally get paid by the task, or for a few hours at a time, rather than earn a steady wage. Admirers hail it as a job market in which workers are, finally, in control of their own destinies. But the gig economy can also be thought of as an elaborate way around an age-old problem: how to control workers without the expense of making them employees \u2014 and without breaking the law.In 2013, about two years after it started, an on-demand food preparation and delivery service called Munchery converted its drivers from contractors to employees. While the move cost about 20 to 30 percent more upfront, the benefits of being able to summon forth enough drivers during periods of high demand made it a better deal for the company in the end. (So did the lower turnover and increased quality control.)The essential facts of the gig economy, though, can be hard to see through the hype that often clouds tech reporting.When I stepped off the elevator into Lyft\u2019s headquarters in the fall of 2016, the techno music was throbbing. There were vast concrete floors and some de rigueur ductwork, and the lobby was painted in striking shades of pink and purple, the company\u2019s signature colors. That was where I had to sign in.As it happened, \u201csigning in\u201d meant entering information on a tablet screen that gradually morphed into a nondisclosure agreement, a fixture of office visits across the Bay Area in recent years. I precipitated a minor uproar by refusing to sign but was eventually waved in nonetheless. (Lyft says it doesn\u2019t require reporters to sign; my Times colleagues don\u2019t sign either.)You can see how this might be subtly corrupting. You begin to think: If they want me to sign a nondisclosure agreement, there must be something transcendent going on here. (Only later do you suspect it\u2019s as much a status symbol as a security precaution \u2014 the Silicon Valley equivalent of a line outside a club.)\u201cImagine Mr. Burns sitting across the table,\u201d one of the doctors, Rajeev Alexander, told me, comparing the experience to negotiating with the notorious \u201cSimpsons\u201d character.\u201cIt was the absolute right thing \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t be here today\u201d without unionizing, Brittany Ellison, one of the doctors, told me at the time.These were highly paid professionals almost universally esteemed in the eyes of the public. And yet they still felt as powerless as people at the other end of the economic spectrum. \u201cWe were trained to be leaders,\u201d Ms. Ellison said. \u201cBut they treat us like assembly line workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Replace Yield Curve as a Recession Predictor? The Fed Considers an Alternative", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow good are the yields on government bonds at predicting recessions?If history is any indicator, the answer is very good. But with the economy strengthening, not weakening, some question whether looking at the yields on an array of government bonds is an effective forecasting tool. That includes the Federal Reserve. Minutes of the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting, released on Thursday, revealed that the central bank considered an alternative approach to avoid some of the shortcomings of using bond yields.But the most alarming signal is sent when the yield curve \u201cinverts.\u201d That is when the yields on two-year Treasuries are higher than those on 10-year Treasuries. When that has happened in the past, recessions have soon followed.But changes in the bond market and economy may have made the yield curve a less useful predictor. The Fed and other central banks bought huge amounts of government securities after the financial crisis, which raised their prices and reduced their yields. Those purchases may still be holding down yields. In addition, investors appear to believe that there is less risk of inflation in the global economy these days, which makes Treasuries more appealing. At the same time, the Fed has been raising short-term interest rates, and is expected to keep doing so through at least next year.Fed policymakers can\u2019t ignore the yield curve when setting monetary policy because of its past predictive power. At the same time, they don\u2019t want to overreact to something that may have less relevance. So it should come as little surprise that the potential limitations of the yield curve were a topic at the Fed\u2019s meeting last month.Members of the central bank\u2019s staff gave a presentation in which they used readings from another market to predict the likelihood of a recession, according to the minutes. They looked at the current interest rate in the federal funds market, in which banks borrow from and lend to each other overnight, and compared that with the fed funds rates predicted in the futures markets. The minutes said: \u201cThe staff noted that this measure may be less affected by many of the factors that have contributed to the flattening of the yield curve.\u201dBut this exercise may be flawed, one analyst said. The futures market\u2019s forecast for fed funds rates may be strongly influenced by the Fed\u2019s own guidance for that rate. \u201cThe Fed is analyzing its own footprints,\u201d said Jim Vogel, a debt markets strategist at FTN Financial.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Summit Meetings, Kremlin Often Tried to Steamroller U.S. Presidents", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether in Helsinki or elsewhere, a summit meeting held by any American president with a Kremlin counterpart has proved to be a momentous occasion, particularly during the Cold War when such talks held the promise of staving off Armageddon.Not that they always went well.In June 1961, newly elected President John F. Kennedy brushed off the need for a preset agenda during two days of meetings in Vienna with Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet premier. Kennedy\u2019s secretary of state, Dean Rusk, said he had worried that the president was ill-prepared for the steamrollering he received from Mr. Khrushchev on issues ranging from control over a divided Berlin to nuclear arms.Barely two months later, the Soviets constructed the Berlin Wall.Relations warmed in the 1970s, leading to a series of agreements that slackened the nuclear arms race.As Mr. Ford was departing after their first meeting in the city of Vladivostok in November 1974, he noticed Mr. Brezhnev eyeing his Alaskan wolf coat and in a spontaneous gesture, handed it to the Soviet leader.That set the stage for the first Soviet-American summit ever held in Helsinki, in 1975. The two made progress toward limiting their nuclear weapon stockpiles, but Mr. Ford left disappointed that the lack of an overall agreement had denied him a foreign-policy success.Instead he was criticized at home for having joined the 35 leaders, most Europeans, who signed the Helsinki Accords. Even if the human rights clauses later helped to undermine the Soviet Union, at the time the overall agreement was seen as a concession to Moscow, which wanted its expanded, post-World War II borders declared inviolable.The domestic outcry, especially among Republicans, inhibited Mr. Ford from inviting his Soviet counterpart to visit the United States.By having seized Crimea in March 2014, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who is meeting President Trump in Helsinki on Monday, breached the very accords Moscow pushed for in 1975 to cement Europe\u2019s borders.The Russian transcript of the conversation, recovered from Mr. Brezhnev\u2019s ashtray, indicated that Mr. Ford demurred.One of the most successful summit meetings occurred in Washington in December 1987, when President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed an accord banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a landmark treaty that both sides now accuse the other of violating.President George H.W. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev established a good rapport before their September 1990 summit meeting in Helsinki. Photos from their previous meeting in Camp David that June showed the Soviet leader chauffeuring his grinning American counterpart around in a careening golf cart.Their Helsinki meeting came weeks after Saddam Hussein, the Iraq leader who was a friend if not an ally of Moscow, had occupied and plundered neighboring Kuwait.Mr. Bush, fashioning an international coalition to expel the Iraqis, needed assurances that the Soviets would not bolster Baghdad. The meeting produced an agreement that called on Iraq to respect United Nations resolutions to withdraw.The fanfare surrounding summit meetings began to fade after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 the fate of the world no longer seemed to hang on face-to-face encounters between the superpower leaders.In March 1997 in Helsinki, President Bill Clinton met President Boris N. Yeltsin, who had suffered a heart attack during his re-election campaign.Mr. Yeltsin chose to minimize Russia\u2019s anger and humiliation over NATO\u2019s eastward expansion, instead accepting promises of a closer strategic partnership and agreeing to guidelines for a further reduction in nuclear arms.Mr. Clinton, hoping to bolster Mr. Yeltsin as a democratic leader, pledged to welcome Russia into international institutions like the World Trade Organization and the club of main industrialized countries, the Group of 7, despite its anemic economy. (Russia was expelled from the club over the Crimea annexation, although Mr. Trump has said Russia\u2019s membership should be restored.)Relations decayed steadily after Mr. Putin became president in 2000. Every American president since has tried a \u201creset.\u201d President George W. Bush infamously declared in 2001 that he found Mr. Putin \u201ctrustworthy\u201d because after looking the Russian leader in the eye, the American \u201cwas able to get a sense of his soul.\u201dIn March 2009, President Barack Obama dispatched Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov in Geneva with a symbolic red button labeled with a Russian word that the Americans thought mean \u201creset,\u201d but turned out to mean \u201coverloaded\u201d or \u201covercharged.\u201dAn oracle could not have stated it better.For the summit meeting to be held in Helsinki, Mr. Trump seeks yet another reset.Despite Russia\u2019s election meddling in the United States and Mr. Putin\u2019s open attempts to curb American influence elsewhere, Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of him and animus directed at traditional American allies have raised the question of whether this summit meeting will help push a Putin-Trump version of the world order.In Helsinki in 1990, Mr. Gorbachev presented Mr. Bush with a framed cartoon showing both men dressed as boxers and the globe serving as referee. A melting figure labeled \u201cCold War\u201d lies at their feet as the referee holds both their hands aloft. \u201cKnockout\u201d was the Russian caption for the work.With the Cold War showing signs of revival, one question going into this summit meeting is whether some other version of \u201cKnockout\u201d might emerge.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquharAdvertisement"}

A recent widely reported poll found that only 29 percent considered his policies \u201cfair.\u201d Just 32 percent of respondents expressed confidence in him, a drop of 6 percentage points in one month, and there has been a sharp decrease in support from left-leaning voters who helped propel him into office in the spring of 2017.The warning signs have come not only from polls measuring esteem, or absence of it, for Mr. Macron.Opposition politicians, largely invisible in his first year, have become increasingly bold. The French are indicating that they do not agree with the president\u2019s oft-repeated assertion that the left-right split is outmoded, and that he occupies the ideal center.A recent poll of voting intentions for next year\u2019s European Parliament elections found the far-right Rassemblement National (which until recently was called the National Front) at 19 percent.Mr. Macron\u2019s political movement, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, stood at 23 percent.In Monday\u2019s speech at Versailles, Mr. Macron cited his \u201chumility\u201d up front and pleaded for more time for his \u201ctransformations to take hold in the country.\u201d But he then proceeded to stick to the guiding philosophy of his presidency: a rejection of welfare-state redistribution, an insistence that generalized prosperity is the key to lifting disadvantaged people out of poverty, and an American-style emphasis on equality of opportunity rather than outcome.\u201cThe key to a strong economy is investments,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cThese are reforms not to favor the rich, but to favor business. It\u2019s a policy for business, and for the whole country. Investment is for the whole country.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like castes, rents or privileges,\u201d he added. \u201cThe creation of riches is the foundation stone of equity.\u201d\u201cA strong economy is the foundation of our social project, a plan for improving the life of everybody,\u201d Mr. Macron said, again breaking with the dogma of France\u2019s leftist governments, in one of which he was once a member.\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have increasing inequality. But what we have is an inequality of destiny, according to where you were born, how you were raised. This is what obsesses me. We need to attack the deep roots of inequality of destiny.\u201dIt was not the first time Mr. Macron, a former banker, has unsettled some in France with American-style rhetoric extolling capitalism. In one speech, he spoke derisively of passing by \u201cpeople who are nothing\u201d in train stations. In 2016, when a union activist told Mr. Macron, then the economy minister, that he had \u201cnot a penny to pay for a suit\u201d like the ones Mr. Macron likes to wear, he responded, \u201cThe best way to pay for a suit is to work.\u201dOne of the most anticipated, and feared, of Mr. Macron\u2019s promised overhauls are cuts to France\u2019s vast government expenditures, which at 56 percent of economic output are one of the highest in the West. Mr. Macron said on Monday that his prime minister would present \u201cstrong and courageous choices,\u201d but said nothing concrete.Reaction from analysts was mixed. \u201cIt was very rich and dense, in the sense that Emmanuel Macron touched on his main themes, like the \u2018society of emancipation,\u2019\u201d Bruno Cautr\u00e8s of Sciences Po said in an interview.\u201cHe explained that his project was to redefine the role of the state, and that the French model has created a society of status,\u201d Mr. Cautr\u00e8s said.\u201cHe wants to preserve the role of the state, but on a new foundation,\u201d the political scientist said. \u201cTo give back to individuals the possibility of affirming their life project,\u201d he said, to \u201cthose without status in the society.\u201dOpposition politicians found little to like.\u201cIt was not marked by the seal of justice and equality,\u201d a spokesman for the Socialists, Boris Vallaud, told French television.\u201cAs far as social injustice,\u201d she said, \u201cthe French are going to have their fill of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Can\u2019t Quit Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBecause his other populist promises are broken, he has to keep this one.Opinion ColumnistWith the possible exception of his pas de deux with Vladimir Putin, nothing about the Trump presidency inspires so much public resistance from his fellow Republicans as the president\u2019s zest for tariffs and trade wars. That resistance only goes so far, taking the form of nonbinding resolutions and verbal scoldings and sighs of relief when, as he did this week with the European Union, Trump temporarily chooses jaw-jaw over war-war. But in a party so otherwise beholden to its leader, anything that gets conservative senators accusing their president of running \u201ca Soviet type of economy\u201d (as Ron Johnson of Wisconsin put it this week, attacking the president\u2019s jury-rigged bailout for farmers hurt by his tariffs) counts as a dramatic fissure in the facade of MAGA unity.The answer gets at the dilemma of the Republican establishment in the age of Trump. The party\u2019s senators generally have a better grasp of facts than the occupant of the White House, but the president often has a better grasp of politics. And the political truth is that Trump probably needs his tariffs, needs his trade war, to have any chance of re-election \u2014 precisely because it\u2019s the only remaining economic issue where he\u2019s stuck to his campaign promises and hasn\u2019t just deferred to traditional Republican priorities.Those campaign promises, as everyone is well aware, were generally more populist than the official G.O.P. agenda: Trump promised middle-class tax cuts and a generous Obamacare alternative, he stiff-armed the entitlement reformers and talked up infrastructure spending, and he railed against free trade deals with every other breath. And that populist branding was crucial to the electoral trade he made, which ceded a share of business-friendly suburbanites to the Democrats but reaped a crucial group of erstwhile Obama voters, mostly white and working class and concentrated in the Rust Belt and upper Midwest states, who ultimately handed Trump the presidency.So the fact that Trump\u2019s tariffs are generally unpopular, even in Midwestern states, doesn\u2019t matter politically nearly as much as their potential appeal to the narrow slice of blue-collar swing voters that he needs if he\u2019s going to be re-elected. And their potential cost, for now, can be swallowed up by general economic growth or dealt with via cynical payoffs; if the general economic growth itself goes away, well, then Trump isn\u2019t getting re-elected anyway.Free-trade Republicans have every right to reject the Trumpian alternative to that consensus. But their whingeing would be easier to take if they hadn\u2019t discouraged Trump from every other attempt to make good on his populist pledges. He knows better than they do how he got elected; if protectionism is the only promise he can keep, it's no surprise he's keeping it.

There are few amenities down at the end of this dirt road: just 35 full-size fields, endless parking, dozens of portable toilets and a cluster of food trucks. But there are no bleachers, no scoreboards, no public-address systems for the matches. Here, the soccer dreams of the young players, under the watchful eyes of soccer moms and dads, and dozens of college scouts, are contained only by the sidelines.Once it is ready, Tuckahoe\u2019s blend of cool-season sod is trucked to Heinz Field in Pittsburgh; to Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia; to Red Bull Arena, in Harrison, N.J.; FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland; and Fenway Park in Boston. \u201cWe could put 100 perfect and pristine fields down and not use half the facility,\u201d he said.Allen Carter, a farm employee who was drafted into a public-relations position, said the size of the farm has given Tuckahoe a \u201chuge marketing opportunity.\u201d A decade ago, things were not nearly as optimistic.\u201cEDP approached us when the economy was going bad for us, the housing market took a dive and sod production was cut more than half,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe rented the facility to try to stay alive.

It is consuming Parliament, threatening the future of at least one close associate and, for now at least, derailing Mr. Macron\u2019s reformist agenda.On Monday, an unusual parliamentary investigative commission hastily convened to interrogate Mr. Macron\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, a close ally, about his handling of the matter. Some lawmakers called for his resignation, even as Mr. Collomb sought to deflect blame from himself, saying that he had informed the president\u2019s office and the police about Mr. Benalla\u2019s behavior but that it was up to them to respond. He was followed by the Paris police chief, who called Mr. Benalla\u2019s behavior \u201creprehensible.\u201dOn the trip, Mr. Macron kept up with his bland \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d as he greeted well-wishers, kissed babies and was fussed over by grandmothers, even as the reporters kept up their questioning.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Benalla and the \u2018Black Blocs?\u2019 \u201d a journalist shouted, referring to the anarchist protesters who stir up trouble at French street demonstrations. Mr. Macron ignored the question.The video of Mr. Benalla\u2019s thrashing of the protester last May Day has shocked France \u2014 almost as much as subsequent videos showing him close by Mr. Macron\u2019s side on numerous outings. The president\u2019s \u201cMr. Security\u201d accompanied him on biking trips, went skiing with him and was with him at tennis matches.In the video, Mr. Benalla can be seen, in unauthorized police gear, violently dragging a protester on the ground even as the prostrate man pleads with him. Mr. Benalla grabs him by the neck then hits him several times for no apparent reason. Another video revealed by the newspaper Le Monde, which broke the story, shows him wrestling a young female protester.A favored member of Mr. Macron\u2019s inner circle, the bearded and burly Mr. Benalla had a presidential apartment on the fashionable Quai Branly in Paris, a chauffeured car and a special legislative floor pass granted to few. It was all part of \u201can unwholesome old-boy network,\u201d the Paris police chief, Michel Delpuech, told Parliament on Monday.Mr. Benalla and a colleague were charged with assault on Sunday. He has been fired from his job at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, the presidential palace, where he had an office. But especially given that Mr. Macron and his associates were aware of Mr. Benalla\u2019s violent behavior immediately, the questions have not gone away:Why was Mr. Benalla allowed to keep his position and given a mere 15-day suspension? Why was he riding in the bus with the victorious French national soccer team as recently as a week ago? Why weren\u2019t judicial authorities immediately informed of his violent acts? Why did the Macron government shield Mr. Benalla, until Le Monde\u2019s scoop last week made it impossible for officials to do so?To the critics of the president, the Benalla affair \u2014 and his silence about it \u2014 says much about Mr. Macron\u2019s distant style, which had never been put to the test of an election until he unexpectedly gained the presidency last year.\u201cHe\u2019s surrounded by people who sing his praises day and night, and he\u2019s never been confronted with the essence of what it is to manage power,\u201d said Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the opposition to Mr. Macron in Parliament and head of the left-wing La France Insoumise party, or France Unbowed, in a telephone interview on Monday.\u201cWhy was he incapable of understanding this situation?\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon asked. \u201cHis only method is the crossing of the Bridge at Arcole,\u201d he said, referring to a famous bold Napoleonic victory. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t understand the reality of it.\u201d\u201cEssentially his style is monarchic, that of an absolute president,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon added. \u201cHe\u2019s a man who said he gained power by force and surprise, and he\u2019s surrounded by people who have no experience of the state, who think of the state as a sort of corporation, a business.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t resist lecturing a middle-aged woman in the crowded receiving line in the provincial capital, P\u00e9rigueux. She was distraught over her shaky financial situation. For 10 minutes the woman engaged stubbornly with the president, pleading for help, as hundreds watched.\u201cListen to me well, Mr. Macron,\u201d she said. \u201cI work but I no longer have the means to live. My life was better before. I work and I have a diploma. I work every day. I have children, and I can\u2019t even pay for their vacations. We\u2019re just not making it.\u201d\u201cYou say you are lightening up taxes on the one hand, but on the other you are loading us up,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we are just not making it.\u201dMr. Macron responded fluently but with abstractions and little empathy, describing a series of government programs and plans he insisted confidently were going to make life better.\u201cNo, no,\u201d the president said. \u201cFirst of all what you are saying isn\u2019t strictly speaking true. And then, when you pay your phone bill and your gas bill, it\u2019s not the state that\u2019s setting the rates. You can blame the state for everything, this or that is going up, but, it\u2019s not all the state\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t change the tires on my car,\u201d the woman responded. \u201cI can\u2019t afford the inspection. I can\u2019t even maintain my car. We\u2019re really in the hole. This is not the life I dreamed of.\u201dLater, Mr. Macron made a speech in this rural village, promising more attention from the state, a \u201creinvention\u201d of state services. The crowd listened politely but the applause was light.\u201cThat was absolutely nothing, nothing, it\u2019s the usual promises,\u201d said Thierry Krevisan, a salesman who had stood for hours in the hot sun waiting for the president to show up. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same speech.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Court Orders Big Payouts to Families of Ferry Victims", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government has already apologized for failing to prevent the sinking of the ferry and botching the rescue operation, offering a compensation package for bereaved families that averaged 470 million won, or about $415,000, per victim. But the families of 118 victims have rejected that offer, and in 2015, they sued the government and Chonghaejin Marine Company, the ferry\u2019s operator, seeking court-ordered compensation.In its ruling on Thursday, a three-judge panel ordered that the government and the shipping company pay the families compensation averaging 600 million won, or about $530,000, per victim.Chonghaejin Marine routinely overloaded the structurally imbalanced ship with poorly secured cargo, as it did on the ferry\u2019s final voyage, according to government investigators. Inspectors gave the Sewol and other ships just a cursory check from the pier, or none at all.When the Sewol capsized, its crew members were among the first to flee, after repeatedly telling passengers to stay in their cabins. The first Coast Guard boat that arrived at the scene did little more than pick up the fleeing crew members, while passengers trapped inside the ferry banged on the windows as the ship slowly disappeared beneath the waves.As a result, \u201cthe victims died while waiting for help,\u201d the court ruling said on Thursday. \u201cThey must have suffered the extreme fear and anxiety during the long hours from the time the ship began tilting to the time when it completely sank.\u201dWhen the Constitutional Court removed Ms. Park from office in March last year after her parliamentary impeachment, it faulted her handling of the disaster, saying she stayed in her residence, not in her office, for seven hours after she first heard of the sinking. But the court said that was not grounds to impeach her. Instead, the court ousted Ms. Park on other charges, including corruption and abuse of power.But her government\u2019s mishandling of the catastrophe fueled popular grievances that drove millions of people to the streets in large protest rallies that preceded her impeachment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Isn\u2019t Much the Fed Can Do to Ease the Pain of a Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the top policymakers at the Federal Reserve met three weeks ago to set the course for monetary policy in the United States, they spent substantial time discussing the risks that a trade war posed to the economy, according to minutes of the meeting released Thursday.Most Fed officials at the table \u201cnoted that uncertainty and risks had intensified,\u201d and that tariffs and other trade measures \u201ccould have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.\u201d They reported that some of their business contacts \u201cindicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy.\u201d What they didn\u2019t discuss, at least as far as one can tell from the newly published minutes, was any strategy for the Fed to come to the rescue if trade wars began to act as a meaningful drag on the overall economy. Indeed, at that meeting, Fed officials \u201cgenerally judged that, with the economy already very strong\u201d and inflation running at about 2 percent, \u201cit would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising\u201d interest rates.There was no hint in the minutes that the Fed intended to use its power over interest rates in reaction to rising economic risks from trade wars.That reflects a particular economic challenge as the United States imposes tariffs on major trading partners and as those partners retaliate with tariffs of their own \u2014 a cycle set to escalate with $34 billion of Chinese imports to go into effect at midnight.It\u2019s not just that a multi-front trade war could slow economic growth. It\u2019s that it would do so in a way the Fed would not be able to easily offset. The usual economic shock absorber is particularly ill-suited to a trade-induced slump.That\u2019s because a trade war simultaneously risks pulling growth rates down while pushing prices up. Anything the Fed seeks to do to cushion the blow on one side of that equation would tend to make things worse on the other side. So if, for example, the Fed held off on further interest rate increases to cushion a slump in investment spending, it would be doing so just as inflation was accelerating above the 2 percent the Fed aims for.\u201cI think of this as a standard supply shock,\u201d said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon. \u201cTariffs are going to constrict the productive capacity of the United States, which means lower growth and higher prices. The Fed operates on the demand side. They don\u2019t have the right tools for dealing with it.\u201dFor the Fed, the nearest parallel may be an oil price shock caused by some geopolitical event, such as those that took place in the 1970s, or a food price spike caused by a drought. What those events have in common is that they are caused not by economic fundamentals \u2014 such as when oil prices rise because the global economy is booming \u2014 but by some external shock. They are bad for growth, yet inflationary.Now, though, the Fed is pretty much achieving its inflation goal already, and with the unemployment rate at a very low level by historical standards, there\u2019s reason to think higher prices may be on the way soon even before the impact of tariffs. In projections released at the mid-June policy meeting, the median Fed official expected that inflation would be 2.1 percent this year and next.That calculus could change if a trade war starts doing major damage to the financial system, such as by causing steep losses in stock and bond markets or by causing financial stress for banks. But while the stock market is down a bit in recent weeks as the war of words over trade has escalated, so far the pain from trade wars has been limited to specific companies and their workers and customers. It has not been a systemic crisis.For the last 11 years, from the housing downturn in 2007 that turned into the global financial crisis in 2008 and a prolonged, sluggish expansion after that, the Fed\u2019s tools were reasonably well suited to the challenges that presented themselves. The central bank became even more central than usual to every economic discussion.But this time, the economic risks are different, and if conflict over trade practices starts to cause damage to the broader economy, we shouldn\u2019t count on the Fed to bail us out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kudlow Overstates American, Chinese and European Tariffs ", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact Check of the DayLarry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, cherry-picked and exaggerated statistics about Chinese and European tariffs and claimed that the United States is the world\u2019s \u201clowest-tariff country.\u201d what was said\u201cAmerica is the lowest-tariff country in the world. I mean, there may be New Zealand or something, smaller countries, not to demean them. But of the major, we have the lowest-tariff country in the world. Our average tariff, I think, is about 2.5 percent. Now, China\u2019s average tariff is about 14 percent. It was worse, but they haven\u2019t made any progress lately. By the way, Europe\u2019s is also rising.\u201dthe factsEven among major economies, the United States does not have the lowest tariffs in the world, though they are among the lowest. According to the report, the United States charged most-favored nations an average tariff of 2.4 percent on manufacturing products \u2014 which is similar to the 2.5 percent Mr. Kudlow cited. But Australia\u2019s and Japan\u2019s tariffs were even lower, at 1.3 percent and 1.2 percent. Tariffs on all products imposed by the United States against most-favored nations ranked second lowest, at 3.5 percent. Again, Australia\u2019s were lower, at 2.5 percent. (These figures do not take into account countervailing or anti-dumping duties \u2014 tariffs that countries impose on what they deem unfair trade.) Beyond imports from most-favored nations, several other countries charge lower tariffs than the United States. For Mr. Kudlow\u2019s claims about trade barriers imposed by China and the European Union to be accurate, he would need to selectively apply different metrics in each case. The 14 percent figure that he cited for Chinese tariffs is close to the 15.5 percent that, according to the 2018 White House report, Beijing imposes on average against agricultural products. But over all, China imposed a tariff of 9.9 percent, according to both the White House report and the World Trade Organization. Since the 1990s, the United States, the European Union and China have all lowered their tariffs. Whether their tariffs have declined or increased in recent years depends on which metric is used. The Trump administration has not released updated tariff statistics since the White House economists\u2019 report earlier this year. Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.

Auntie Anne\u2019s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Cinnabon also agreed to drop the clauses.In addition to stripping the clauses from existing franchise contracts in Washington, the seven chains have also vowed not to enforce them nationwide. The clauses cannot be included in new and renewed contracts either.No-poach clauses have drawn scrutiny over whether they hold down pay for restaurant employees \u2014 one of the largest segments of the United States work force \u2014 and also contribute to a broader wage stagnation that continues to plague the economy long after the end of the recession.Many types of franchise businesses impose the clauses, but they may be most prevalent in the restaurant industry.

She needed more hours than she was being scheduled for, so she found a job at a nearby McDonald\u2019s that offered more shifts.She said she had made it as far as orientation when a manager told her the store had learned that it could not hire her.\u201cI cried all the way until I got home,\u201d Ms. Sanchez, who is originally from Mexico, said through a translator provided by the advocacy group Fight for 15. \u201cI can\u2019t survive with 25 hours a week.\u201dMs. Sanchez, 50, said she eventually got a job at a different McDonald\u2019s.\u201cI never told them that I worked for another McDonald\u2019s,\u201d she said, adding that she recently left the new job after hurting her back. \u201cI was scared to mention that I was working in another McDonald\u2019s, because I need my job.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s said on Thursday that it was unaware of Ms. Sanchez\u2019s situation and was looking into it.Unlike noncompete clauses, which job-seekers can review before signing hiring documents, no-poach provisions are buried in contracts between restaurant chains and franchisees, which independently own and operate the majority of stores. Workers at these stores may not even know they are bound by the restrictions until they try to land new jobs.Franchise owners say the clauses help protect their investments of time and money in training employees. But a job offer from a prospective employer is often the best leverage with a current boss, and some economists worry that the provisions hinder people\u2019s ability to exercise that leverage.Last year, two Princeton economists, Alan Krueger and Orley Ashenfelter, published a study in which they estimated that no-poach clauses affected about 70,000 individual restaurants in the United States, or more than a quarter of fast-food outlets.After examining the franchise deals of 40 of the country\u2019s largest chains, Professor Krueger and Professor Ashenfelter concluded that no-poach restrictions appeared to exist mainly to limit competition and turnover, possibly depressing wages in the process.\u201cI\u2019m pleased that the research that Professor Ashenfelter and I did has shined attention on this issue,\u201d Professor Krueger said this week. \u201cI hope that either through judicial action or legislation or voluntary decision by the franchise chains, that these noncompetitive practices are dropped.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s, the largest fast-food chain in the country by revenue, removed the clause in its franchise contracts last year, and said that it would not enforce them in existing contracts.But some workers\u2019 rights advocates have said McDonald\u2019s did not always keep that promise. The company\u2019s agreement with Mr. Ferguson\u2019s office makes it legally binding.In separate statements, McDonald\u2019s and Arby\u2019s said they were \u201cpleased\u201d to have resolved the issue with Mr. Ferguson\u2019s office. Jimmy John\u2019s declined to comment. The other four companies did not respond to requests for comment.On Thursday, a spokeswoman for Massachusetts\u2019s attorney general, Maura Healey, said her office would continue to look into Arby\u2019s practices.Mr. Ferguson is not involved in that investigation, he said, because his was already well underway. He said his office was still examining hiring at other fast-food companies that operate in Washington.\u201cNot all are as cooperative as these seven have been,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo announced his bold vision for New York\u2019s second largest and perhaps longest-suffering city.Sure enough, the money soon started to flow to Buffalo, leading to new waterfront parks, gleaming modern factories and a cluster of medical and technology facilities.But an examination of the plans and progress of projects included in the Buffalo Billion reveals a far more uneven return on investment to date: a mix of street-level successes, expensive brick-and-mortar gambles and ill-conceived misfires.While some projects have bloomed, others have been delayed by years or show no sign of progress, beyond their initial news release. And Mr. Cuomo\u2019s promises of well-paying, permanent jobs at the most costly projects have repeatedly fallen well short.The governor\u2019s strategy and spending have come into sharp relief as the man who spearheaded the Buffalo effort, Alain E. Kaloyeros, went on trial last month in Federal District Court in Manhattan along with three co-defendants \u2014 executives with two companies who generously donated to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s past election campaigns. Mr. Cuomo, 60, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and prosecutors have said the donations to him were legal.Mr. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University Polytechnic Institute who was once called \u201cNew York\u2019s secret weapon\u201d by the governor, stands accused of bid-rigging several upstate development projects, including Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest: a $750 million solar-panel plant on the banks of the Buffalo River.\u201cI think the Buffalo Billion sounds better than it probably turned out to be,\u201d said Isaac Ehrlich, a SUNY distinguished professor of economics at the University at Buffalo.\u201cJob growth in Buffalo during the expansion had been buoyed by a surge in construction jobs associated with major projects\u201d such as the solar plant, according an October report from Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, two Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists. \u201cAs these projects have wound down, so, too, has construction-related employment.\u201d\u201cThe last seven years have undoubtedly been the best in Buffalo for a very long time,\u201d said Howard Zemsky, the president of Empire State Development, the state\u2019s primary economic development agency. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that the way the governor transformed economic development has had a very positive impact.\u201dMr. Zemsky noted some 25,000 new private sector jobs have come to the city during the Cuomo administration, and added that many of the Buffalo Billion projects \u2014 both past and future \u2014 were not exclusively about jobs, per se, but support for long-term solutions like downtown revitalization, smart growth, opening up the waterfront and keeping younger generations from fleeing.The project, however, hasn\u2019t even broken ground; an empty former mall and a parking garage remain on the site, though state and company officials said it is still in the works.But only a handful of students ever found full-time jobs with the company, which no longer has offices in Buffalo and \u201cfailed to meet the partnership goals,\u201d according to the college. Calls and emails to the company were not returned.In remarks about the trial, Mr. Cuomo said recently that he would let the legal process work, and said he\u2019d not really even paid attention to the case.\u201cI haven\u2019t been following it all that closely,\u201d he said, in an interview on NY1. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we have a trial.\u201dThus far, the Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest money projects have gone to just a select group of well-connected developers, and have been limited to a small number of locations, including several blocks known as the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, where several multimillion projects have been based.All told, the state has spent more than $135 million at the medical campus, including support for a genomics institute, a children\u2019s hospital and expanding class sizes and faculty at the University at Buffalo\u2019s medical school.George Palumbo, an economics professor at Canisius College in Buffalo, said that the gleaming new buildings at the medical campus \u201ctake nice pictures,\u201d but said the development was also illusory.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go very far from that neighborhood to see Buffalo blight,\u201d he said, \u201cnot Buffalo billion.\u201dStill, as the Buffalo Billion has grown over the last six years, it has come to include grant programs, entrepreneurial competitions and beautification projects, and many of those seem popular.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many industries around here,\u201d said Kathy Miner, a retired nurse, as she watched a steady stream of dump trucks come and go. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dEconomists say that the theory of flooding a single area with money is not a bad one, and that it may be years before a final verdict can be made about the Buffalo Billion. But for now, the governor\u2019s declarations that the city has been saved seem premature.\u201cAt best, it has stopped declining,\u201d Professor Palumbo said. \u201cBut not dying anymore is not a rebirth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Did Talking About the Weather Become Political?", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:Even trusting your local weather announcer is political these days.Take the battle in Congress over the renewal of a grant to help television meteorologists incorporate climate change into their weather reporting. Four Republican senators have called for an investigation, calling it indoctrination. Democrats last week moved to protect the funding, which is administered through the National Science Foundation.\u201cResearch designed to sway individuals of a various group, be they meteorologists or engineers, to a politically contentious viewpoint is not science \u2014 it\u2019s propagandizing,\u201d the senators wrote to the foundation\u2019s inspector general.The four Republicans \u2014 James Inhofe and James Lankford of Oklahoma, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 requested an investigation into whether the grants, which have been in place for almost ten years, violated federal law.The amount of funding at stake, $4 million, is tiny by government standards. But the results, according to Mr. Maibach, have been dramatic: In 2012 there were only 55 on-air mentions of climate change in weather reports across the country. Last year, there were 879.Robert Margett, a spokesman for the National Science Foundation, noted that all awards the agency approves are evaluated by at least three independent reviewers. A spokeswoman for the inspector general said the investigation request was under consideration.Ultimately, there is more than a little political posturing. There may not be an investigation at all. Meanwhile, the resolution offered by 18 Democrats to protect the grants, which notes that scientists \u201cagree that climate change is real,\u201d is unlikely to get a vote in the Republican-led Senate.But one result climate scientists say they do expect to see is more highly politicized rancor about their work, despite the facts.\u201cClimate science is really well established, like gravity,\u201d said Benjamin Strauss, president of Climate Central, a nonprofit science and news organization that has received National Science Foundation funding.So what\u2019s the catch? It\u2019s this: Things get much, much harder from here on out. California will now have to cut emissions an additional 40 percent by 2030 to keep meeting its climate goals, and that next phase will hurl the state into uncharted territory.But greening the electricity sector only gets you so far. Power plants now account for just 16 percent of California\u2019s total emissions (compared with about one-third nationwide). The state will now have to look beyond power plants and address other hard-to-decarbonize parts of the economy.Transportation, which accounts for 39 percent of the state\u2019s emissions and rising, is going to be the biggest challenge. Californians are driving more with each passing year and stricter fuel economy standards haven\u2019t done enough to offset that. Gov. Jerry Brown has set a goal of putting 5 million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2030, but only about 205,000 battery electric and fuel cell vehicles have been sold statewide so far, along with 189,000 plug-in hybrids. As a reporter who sometimes writes about water, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in California, where most of the time there doesn\u2019t seem to be enough of it.So California is looking for solutions to protect communities from major floods. As I saw during a visit to Modesto in the Central Valley, one idea is to create more floodplains by taking riverfront land (usually farmland) that had been protected by levees and berms and allowing that land to flood, which can lower river flood levels at communities along the river.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Virtues of a Summer Job", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserThe share of teenagers working summer jobs had dwindled for years, but the numbers have come back a bit in the last couple of years. It\u2019s a change applauded by educators and financial advisers alike.\u201cSummer jobs are a great idea,\u201d said Laura Levine, chief executive of the JumpStart Coalition, a nonprofit group that promotes financial literacy. \u201cMoney management begins with how to get that money in the first place.\u201dThis year, hiring of teenagers got off to a strong start in May, although the pace slowed slightly in June compared with last year. Still, the combined total of about 1.08 million jobs added for those two months is above average for the past decade, according to an analysis of federal data by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Andrew Challenger, the firm\u2019s vice president, said the longer-term trend away from summer jobs doesn\u2019t mean young people are lazy. \u201cTeens are still busy,\u201d he said. They\u2019re doing things like volunteering in hurricane-stricken areas, taking extra classes or honing their sports skills to burnish their college applications. They may be making a calculation, he said, that such experiences make more of an impression on college admissions staff than a summer job scooping ice cream.Whether they\u2019re working to help support their families, saving for college or building a fund for some other goal, young workers should have a plan for the money they earn, Ms. Levine said. Earning a steady paycheck for the first time can make teenagers feel \u201ccash rich\u201d and lead to overspending, she said. \u201cIt can disappear quickly.\u201dDeciding ahead of time to put a certain amount into savings and spend a small amount on entertainment makes teenagers less likely to squander their earnings, she said.Even though the overall unemployment rate has fallen amid a stronger economy, teenagers can have a hard time finding temporary summer jobs. The retail industry, for instance, a traditional place for teenagers to land summer work, is shifting away from brick and mortar stores and toward online sales, Mr. Challenger said.Ms. Levine said, \u201cEven when the job market is good, it does take diligence, and a willingness to be flexible.\u201d That may mean taking a job that\u2019s not a first choice. But a job means money and offers experience dealing with bosses, co-workers and customers.In parts of the country where students will return to school in mid-August, much of the summer is already gone and employers may not be as eager to hire as they were in the spring. But often, entry-level jobs suitable for teenagers have high turnover, so it\u2019s worth checking again, even if you didn\u2019t find a job earlier in the summer, Mr. Challenger said.Here are some questions and answers about summer jobs:Why did my summer employer give me a tax form?When you\u2019re hired, your employer gives you a Form W-4, also known as a withholding allowance certificate, which tells the employer how much tax to deduct from your paycheck. The amount withheld is based on the number of so-called allowances you claim; the more allowances claimed, the less money withheld for taxes and the more cash you\u2019ll see in your paycheck, said April Walker, lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. (The form is being revised because of last year\u2019s tax bill, but the new version isn\u2019t yet ready for official use.)The W-4 form has a work sheet to help you decide how many allowances to claim, but it can get complicated. So even if you expect to earn relatively little income, you should consider claiming one allowance, or even zero allowances, to help cover any tax bill, tax experts say.If you end up having too much withheld, you can get a refund by filing a tax return next year.Can I put money earned from a summer job into a Roth I.R.A.?Why not just take the summer off and work during the school year?Having a job during the school year can be fine, as long as you don\u2019t overdo it. There\u2019s a link between intense school-year employment \u2014 20 or more hours a week \u2014 and the risk of dropping out, said Jeremy Staff, a professor of sociology and criminology at Penn State University. So it\u2019s wise to limit your hours, if you can afford to.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Violence Flares, Kushner Threatens to Abandon a Plan B for the Mideast: Rebuilding Gaza", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Five months ago, Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, began quietly shifting his focus from brokering a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians to tackling the dire humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.Now, with Israel and the Hamas militants who control Gaza in a fresh cycle of violence that analysts fear could escalate into a full-blown war, Mr. Kushner and his partner in Middle East peacemaking, Jason D. Greenblatt, are threatening to pull the plug on Plan B.Declaring that no foreign investors are willing to pour money into Gaza during what they label a Hamas-driven conflict, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, the president\u2019s special representative for international negotiations, are rethinking their efforts to rebuild Gaza\u2019s economy as a way of opening the door to a broader peace accord.\u201cHamas has driven Gaza to a state of desperation,\u201d Mr. Kushner said on Sunday. \"Provocations will not be rewarded with aid.\u201dHamas leaders, he said, needed to demonstrate \u201ca clear intent for a peaceful relationship with their neighbors\u201d in order for aid and investment money to flow.The Trump officials laid the blame for the violence on the Hamas leaders, whom they condemned as \u201ccorrupt and hateful\u201d and accused of attacking Israel relentlessly over the past few months with \u201crockets, mortars, terror tunnels, kite bombs and other weapons of aggression.\u201d Palestinians say Israel set the tragedy in motion by imposing a blockade on Gaza intended to turn the people against their leaders.Still, the talk of a new Gaza war is another setback for Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, two diplomatic newcomers whom Mr. Trump charged with negotiating what he has called the \u201cdeal of the century.\u201d After nearly 18 months of work, and more than a dozen trips to the Middle East, the timing for the rollout of their peace plan remains uncertain.\u201cWe have the plan ready \u2014 mostly ready \u2014 and when the time is right, we\u2019ll bring it out,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in an interview before the latest spike in tensions.Their effort has been stymied by the Palestinian refusal to talk to them since Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December. Arab diplomats say their leaders could never publicly embrace the Trump plan now, given the domestic blowback they would face because of the Jerusalem move.While Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt wait for a better moment to release their plan, they have turned Gaza into a side project. Focusing on Gaza, Mr. Kushner said, made sense because no peace accord could succeed without resolving the status of the strip and because improving the fortunes of the two million Palestinians who live there could offer a path to an elusive broader deal with the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank.\u201cYou have to figure out which cards to play at which time,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cGetting a positive outcome there could set the momentum for the rest of the process.\u201dIn March, he and Mr. Greenblatt convened a White House conference to galvanize international efforts to rebuild Gaza\u2019s economy. Though the Palestinian Authority boycotted the session, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt talked about scheduling another one.But days after that first meeting, Palestinians began protesting, often violently, in Hamas-orchestrated demonstrations along the fence that divides Gaza from Israel. Since then, Israeli snipers have killed more than 140 mostly unarmed Palestinians, according to officials in Gaza. Adding to the tensions, Hamas is floating flaming kites and balloons into southern Israel, where they ignite wildfires and terrorize the people living there.\u201cRather than looking for opportunities to weaponize everything from kites to mirrors in order to attack Israel, Hamas should focus its ingenuity on improving the Gazan economy,\u201d Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Friedman wrote in their Post article, published last week.The White House, officials said, is consulting with Egypt and Qatar, which act as mediators in Gaza, to try to head off a broader war. But the United States firmly backs Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. And the op-ed articles suggest that the officials\u2019 emphasis is on making a case against Hamas.In the article published on CNN\u2019s website, the four officials gave the United Nations General Assembly credit for not reflexively approving a resolution that condemned only Israel for the violence in Gaza (the United States won support for an amendment holding Hamas responsible for its role in inciting the violence). They expressed hope that the United Nations would show a similarly open mind when they roll out the peace plan.Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt still favor talks between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas that could result in a unity government in Gaza under the control of the West Bank Palestinians. Hamas, they said, could take part in such a government, provided it agrees to give up violence, recognize Israel and engage in peaceful negotiations.But diplomats involved in previous \u2014 and equally fruitless \u2014 Middle East negotiations said those hopes were far-fetched, since Hamas would never give up its weapons. And they warned that getting bogged down in Gaza could actually make it harder, not easier, to strike a broader deal.\u201cNot only is it not necessary to solve Gaza first, but the interminable delay only makes it that much harder by further entrenching the one-state reality on the ground in the West Bank,\u201d said Frank G. Lowenstein, who served as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations at the end of the Obama administration.Mr. Lowenstein\u2019s predecessor, Martin S. Indyk, said the United States should play a role in easing the suffering in Gaza. But he said the lack of Palestinian unity would make a breakthrough there as elusive as in the West Bank.\u201cEighteen months of effort have led them to Gaza, but Gaza is a whole heap of complexities,\u201d Mr. Indyk said. \u201cThe prospects for progress there are about as promising as the much-diminished chances for the \u2018deal of the century.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambodia Re-Elects Its Leader, a Result Predetermined by One", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTRAPAING CHOUR, Cambodia \u2014 Prime Minister Hun Sen, the only leader that two-thirds of Cambodians have ever known, is not prone to leaving things to chance.Over the past year, scrappy independent news media outlets that once reported on government corruption and crony impunity have been silenced. Websites that carried negative portrayals of Mr. Hun Sen and his Cambodian People\u2019s Party were blocked on the eve of Sunday\u2019s vote.Western nongovernmental organizations, which had pumped money into Cambodia as it was emerging from decades of conflict and genocide, have been kicked out. Mr. Hun Sen, 65, says they, too, were trying to topple his administration, which critics have called increasingly authoritarian.With all of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s machinations to control the vote, the question that faced Cambodians on Election Day was not who would win; there is, after all, only one answer, and it is the man whose name graces thousands of schools across the country.Instead, the real mystery was whether Cambodians were so deeply disenchanted with a rigged election that they would stay away from the polls or cast spoiled ballots.On Sunday evening, Cambodia\u2019s National Election Committee said that turnout had reached 82.17 percent, a figure that in the capital, Phnom Penh, at least, did not correspond with the sight of empty polling stations and residents walking around with fingers untouched by the ink used to denote those who had voted.In commune elections last year, in which the opposition gained seats from the governing party, roughly 90 percent of voters cast ballots, a record turnout.\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to vote,\u201d Bun Chea, a 26-year-old technician, said on Sunday as he passed by his polling station in Phnom Penh. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference to our lives.\u201dIn a speech on Friday, Mr. Hun Sen warned against a boycott of Sunday\u2019s balloting. \u201cThose who do not go to vote, and who are incited by the national traitors, are the ones who destroy democracy,\u201d he said.But that did not stop the governing party from claiming in a statement on Sunday evening that its victory \u201cclearly illustrated the enthusiasm and political rights of the Cambodian people in strengthening a multiparty democracy.\u201dSok Eysan, the party\u2019s spokesman, projected that it had won at least 100 seats out of 125 in Parliament, a significant increase over the last polls.\u201cA victory without a contest is a hollow one,\u201d Sam Rainsy, the exiled co-founder of the Cambodia National Rescue Party \u2014 the now-dissolved main opposition party \u2014 said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThis senseless victory does nothing to resolve the political crisis that Cambodia faces as a result of the regime\u2019s totalitarian drift over the last 12 months.\u201dOn Saturday, El Sitha, a former district councilor from the Cambodia National Rescue Party, got a taste of what even humorous opposition to Mr. Hun Sen can catalyze. After posting a group picture on Facebook of fingers devoid of the ink that shows who has voted, Mr. El Sitha was summoned to his local police station.\u201cThey dissolved my party, so what can I do?\u201d Mr. El Sitha asked, adding, \u201cThe way to win is to sleep at home.\u201dFlush with foreign aid money, Cambodia was supposed to prove that democracy could be fostered by a concerned global community. After the fall in 1979 of the Khmer Rouge, the communist radicals who oversaw the deaths of at least one-fifth of the population, Cambodia was administered first by the Vietnamese and then by the United Nations.While Western aid workers lectured on the superiority of a multiparty democracy, Mr. Hun Sen, who entered the leadership ranks during the Vietnamese regime, subverted that plan. Even as he has maintained the illusion of electoral politics, he outfoxed one co-prime minister and purged those who challenged his power.And as American influence in the region wanes, Mr. Hun Sen has the backing of the Chinese, whose financial assistance is unburdened by admonitions that Cambodia improve its record on human rights.During campaigning, Chinese diplomats appeared at events supporting Mr. Hun Sen. The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia spoke disparagingly of the European Union\u2019s mulling of further sanctions on the country.Mr. Hun Sen has returned the love, calling China a steadfast friend and accusing the West of trying to foment a color revolution in Cambodia.Sok Eysan, the spokesman for the governing party, dismissed some of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s most incendiary talk.\u201cThat\u2019s just politics,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Cambodian foreign policy is to be friends with everyone who respects us.\u201dBut Mr. Sok Eysan quickly shifted gears. \u201cWe don\u2019t like any country that interferes in our country or tries to control us,\u201d he said. \u201cU.S. assistance to Cambodia has strings attached, but China doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dOn Wednesday in Washington, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would pave the way for sanctions against Cambodians who have undermined the country\u2019s democracy. If it is approved by the Senate, offenders\u2019 assets in the United States could be blocked, and they could be barred from entering the country.On Sunday evening, the White House press office released a statement criticizing the voting. \u201cThe United States regrets that Cambodia\u2019s July 29 parliamentary elections were neither free nor fair and failed to represent the will of the Cambodian people. The flawed elections, which excluded the country\u2019s principal opposition party, represent the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia\u2019s Constitution.\u201dGiven the widely held sense that Sunday\u2019s vote was a sham, American, European and Japanese election monitors refused to observe the process. Instead, one of the largest groups charged with inspecting the polls was overseen by one of Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s sons. The Chinese and Russians also sent delegations of observers.Unlike in 2013, when a surge of youth voters almost propelled the opposition to victory, this election season was devoid of the energy that galvanized the last one.At a sleepy polling station in Ariksat commune, outside Phnom Penh, a villager who gave only his first name, Heng, said he had deliberately spoiled his ballot.\u201cI didn\u2019t write or tick anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not satisfied with this election because of the opposition\u2019s absence.\u201dOthers, though, said they admired Mr. Hun Sen for delivering more than 30 years of peace and stability, allowing for the development of Cambodia\u2019s export-led economy. The nation\u2019s city skylines are being transformed with high-rise projects that are often funded by foreign investment.\u201cHun Sen grew up poor in the provinces, so he understands what our problems are,\u201d said Sok Dorn, a noodle seller. \u201cI hope his sons take over from him one day.\u201dThe prime minister\u2019s children are scattered in top military, government and business posts. At least two have been considered for a possible future American sanctions list.Amid the rice paddies and lowland farms two hours outside Phnom Penh, a group of villagers from Trapaing Chour commune said their years of protest had brought no relief. They said their land had been seized by two companies, which have been linked by international rights campaigners to either governing party lawmakers or to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s sister.Land grabs by well-connected politicians and businessmen are the biggest problem afflicting this predominantly rural nation.Peung Thy served the nation as part of an elite bodyguard unit formed to protect Mr. Hun Sen. He fought during a brief border conflict with Thailand. But when his 10 hectares of land were taken from him to make way for a sugar plantation owned by Ly Yong Phat, a Cambodian tycoon, Mr. Peung Thy began to lose his sense of patriotism.\u201cI thought I was serving my country, but I was only serving the rich and powerful people who stole my land,\u201d he said.Back in Phnom Penh, Perk Chrep, a 30-year-old worker in Cambodia\u2019s important garment industry, fretted that she had little choice in the electoral exercise. The line manager at her Chinese-owned factory, she said, had warned the seamstresses several times that if they did not come back to work with ink on their fingers, they need not return at all.Ever since garment workers flocked to the opposition in the 2013 elections, Mr. Hun Sen has courted this demographic, regularly holding rallies where he handed out envelopes of cash.But Ms. Perk Chrep, who makes $300 a month with overtime pay, said she did not want to sell her vote. She mourned the dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, which she said had worked to guarantee basic rights for garment workers.Sitting in a single room devoid of furniture, Ms. Perk Chrep said that all she wanted to do was send a message to Mr. Hun Sen.\u201cI want him to reflect on what he has promised the people in Cambodia,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes he really think he has achieved that much except for adding more years to his rule?\u201dSun Narin and Len Leng contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Julia Wallace from Siem Pang, Cambodia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Candidates for Connecticut Governor Agree It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGROTON, Conn. \u2014 In the race for governor of Connecticut, there is one thing every candidate seems to agree on: The state\u2019s economy is in serious disrepair.\u201cMost folks on both sides don\u2019t think Connecticut is working,\u201d said Ned Lamont, who has the Democratic endorsement for governor. The Republican designee, Mark D. Boughton, echoed that assessment: \u201cIt\u2019s puzzling as to how and why and where we lost our way, but we lost our way.\u201dFor a state that is still viewed \u2014 in the popular imagination, anyway \u2014 as a prosperous bedroom community, Connecticut has its share of serious problems. There\u2019s negative economic growth, urban poverty, multibillion-dollar budget deficits and the flight of corporations to other states.Which party, and which candidate, will be chosen by voters to try to solve those problems will not be known until November, when the midterm elections are expected to see a \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democrats eager to register their anger at President Trump. The potentially high turnout \u2014 coupled with the fact that registered Democrats in Connecticut outnumber Republicans 5 to 3 \u2014 could catapult a Democrat into the governor\u2019s office.Indeed, Connecticut is perceived as a reliably blue state; its governor, both United States senators and all five House members are all Democrats. And yet, the last time a governor\u2019s race in the state was captured by a candidate of the same party as the exiting governor was in 1924, according to Ballotpedia.It is with this set of conflicting trends that voters will head to the polls on Aug. 14 for the primaries to decide who will be on the ballot for governor in November.Earlier this year, the race had enticed more than two dozen prospective candidates, thanks in large part to the open seat: Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a two-term Democrat, is not running for re-election.But the nominating conventions in May greatly narrowed the field.Because Mr. Lamont has the party nomination, he will appear first on the ballot.Mr. Lamont, a successful businessman, wants to attract business by investing in transportation and training workers. The state, he said, can ill afford a massive tax cut as it faces a yawning deficit next year.\u201cWe are at one of those moments where you need someone who is willing to take the slings and arrows of all the lousy choices we have to make,\u201d he said after an event at a union hall here.\u201cI have a $2 billion deficit as far as the eye can see, and flat or declining revenues,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m running against people who say they\u2019re going to eliminate the income tax. They will tell you what you want to hear. I\u2019ll tell you the truth, but you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201dMr. Lamont is likely the most known candidate for governor; he engineered a stunning upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary, before losing in the general election to Mr. Lieberman, who ran as an independent. He then ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Mr. Malloy in the primary.On the Republican side, voters will decide among five candidates, including Mr. Boughton, who also earned the top spot on the ballot by winning the nomination.His challengers are Tim Herbst, former first selectman in Trumbull and perhaps the most conservative on the group; Steve Obsitnik, of Westport, a Navy veteran and technology entrepreneur; Bob Stefanowski, of Madison, a former chief executive of DFC Global, a payday lending firm; and David Stemerman, of Greenwich, who founded a multibillion-dollar hedge fund.Mr. Boughton, the nine-term mayor of Danbury, wants to phase out the income tax all together as a way to jump-start growth. He points to the state\u2019s introduction of the income tax in the early 1990s as the beginning of Connecticut\u2019s downward slide. To make up the lost revenue, he said he would shrink state government.\u201cPrior to 1991, people knew, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a place without income taxes; I\u2019m going to go there,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat was our marketing niche. That was our thing. We got rid of that and became like the rest of the states and we lost growth.\u201dBolstering Republican optimism is Mr. Malloy\u2019s status as the least popular governor in the nation, based on a recent survey by Morning Consult, a polling company.\u201cConnecticut has voted Democratic in every presidential race since 1992,\u201d noted Ronald Schurin, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. \u201cBut the Republicans have made a lot of gains in past cycles at the state level.\u201dBut as someone who likes to tout his workingman credentials \u2014 he lives in an apartment off Danbury\u2019s Main Street and drives a pickup \u2014 Mr. Boughton, 54, said he found it \u201cintriguing\u201d to oppose Mr. Lamont.\u201cWe are just completely different people,\u201d he said over a root beer float at a 1950s-style diner near Danbury. \u201cNed is a plutocrat from Greenwich. I\u2019d love to have a conversation about who\u2019s more connected to voters.\u201dPolitics is in Mr. Boughton\u2019s DNA. His father was mayor of Danbury before becoming a state legislator. Mr. Boughton followed the same path, though in reverse. After teaching social studies in Danbury, he successfully ran for state representative before running for mayor in 2001.Despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans in Danbury by 3 to 2, Mr. Boughton was elected eight more times. Under his watch, Danbury launched a 311 complaint hotline, introduced a discount prescription drug card for residents, cut the homeless population by half and streamlined the permitting process for new businesses.\u201cIn the last six months,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have cut the ribbon on about 40 new businesses, from a new brewery to clothing boutiques and everything in between.\u201d\u201cI would be the first governor who started a business and created jobs,\u201d he said in an interview here, after receiving an endorsement from Representative Joe Courtney. (Mr. Lamont served one term as selectman in Greenwich.)Talking to business leaders around the state, Mr. Lamont, 64, said he hears the same laments. The state\u2019s transportation network makes commuting difficult, and thousands of jobs go begging because firms cannot find employees with the requisite skills.The next governor, he said, must address both issues. \u201cI will quickly make investments in community colleges so we can train people for the next generation of jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to fix our roads and we really have to fix our bridges.\u201dLike Mr. Boughton, Mr. Lamont said he wanted to see a return of Connecticut\u2019s economic eminence. In recent years, the drumbeat of corporate departures has grown deafening, with General Electric, Aetna and Alexion Pharmaceuticals all announcing plans to decamp for nearby states.\u201cI\u2019m not going to solve it in a year and I\u2019m not going to solve it in four years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to give people a sense of direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strong Economic Growth Figures Belie Signs of Weakness", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 On the surface, China\u2019s economy is humming along smoothly. It\u2019s the numbers behind the numbers that point to mounting challenges for the world\u2019s other economic superpower.The Chinese government on Monday reported that the economy grew 6.7 percent in the three months that ended in June compared with a year ago. That is pretty close to the rate that China has reported quarter after quarter over the past two and a half years. The pace puts it comfortably within its target of achieving growth of around 6.5 percent for the full year.It may just get tougher from here.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced on Monday that it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization about the possible additional American tariffs; Beijing had already filed a complaint in early April about a batch of American levies in a dispute over alleged violations of intellectual property.China has options, but they have drawbacks. It could put more money into its banking system, which would juice growth. It could also ramp up spending on big projects like highways and airports. But both could undermine its efforts to break the country\u2019s addiction to borrowing.Now that investment has begun to falter.China\u2019s annual infrastructure investment growth, which has consistently risen about 20 percent in recent years, has slowed to less than half that rate so far this year. That slowdown has coincided with renewed pledges by Beijing to tackle its debt problems, which stem from heavy spending by local governments and big Chinese state-controlled companies.Signs of a deliberate slowdown were apparent during the second quarter. In China\u2019s sparsely populated Xinjiang region in the far west, local and regional agencies halted or ordered immediate reviews of the viability of many projects.Several other inland provinces, plus coastal Shandong Province, ordered halts or financial reviews of infrastructure projects at about the same time. Particularly targeted for suspension have been projects that were being built by so-called public-private partnerships.Beijing has encouraged local and regional governments to engage in partnerships with private investors over the last several years as an alternative to heavy borrowing by government agencies. But evidence has mounted that many such agencies promised fixed rates of return to their private sector partners. That has fostered concern that it is essentially more borrowing in disguise.China now appears to be splitting the difference. In a complex edict on Friday, it forbade cities below a certain size from building subways systems, even as it indicated that delayed projects in larger cities could go forward with some limits.That boom may be easing. Retail sales growth slowed earlier in the quarter, official data showed, though it picked up a bit in June.The slowdown may have a number of underlying reasons, like a decline in consumer lending for cars and a flattening of the market for smartphones. But China\u2019s bean counters may also be missing some vibrant activity. They may not, for example, capture the full scope of online shopping.Consumer pessimism over China\u2019s economy may be overstated, according to the China Beige Book, a quarterly survey of big businesses across China. The Beige Book survey suggested that the government\u2019s statisticians might have overestimated retail sales growth in previous years, and are now compensating with low estimates of current sales.\u201cThe current weakness in official data is better understood as a lagged reflection of past softness,\u201d the Beige Book\u2019s second-quarter report said in late June. \u201cThe retail sector may be seeing a turn higher, with profit and investment growth improving.\u201dOne new analysis suggests that the Chinese economy grew even faster last year than official data showed. The analysis, by professors at Cambridge University in Britain and two Dutch universities, was based on sales and gross margin data from 150 of China\u2019s biggest companies.How is it possible that China understated its own growth last year? The analysis also indicates that China was over-reporting growth in 2015 and 2016, when China suffered a stock market crash and a disorderly currency devaluation. So some of the growth last year may have been catch-up \u2014 and that has now faded.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Says Greece Is a Comeback Story. The I.M.F. Isn\u2019t Convinced.", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Aug. 20, Greece will become the last country to exit financial bailouts extended by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The rescues were intended to prevent the 19-country euro area from breaking apart when Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis started in 2010.The I.M.F. praised Athens for racking up a number of economic \u201csuccesses\u201d since it was placed on the first of three international financial lifelines ultimately totaling 320 billion euros, or about $375 billion. Greece reduced an enormous budget deficit and eventually created a surplus, it said. Successive governments forged legal tool kits to deal with a mountain of bad loans at the nation\u2019s banks. They also moved to reduce the outsize public sector, and curbed collective bargaining to make wages \u201cmore competitive.\u201dYet Greece is the problem that never quite goes away for Europe, and the risks to the country\u2019s post-bailout future read like a laundry list of adversities.It still has weak banks and private sector balance sheets, the fund pointed out. Some capital controls remain in place, and the government has large arrears. A significant part of the population is considered \u201cat risk\u201d of poverty, weighing on prospects for a sustained recovery. And Greece still hasn\u2019t made enough progress on key fiscal and market reforms.It hit the point home again on Tuesday. The fund said that despite recent debt relief efforts, which include extending the payback time for Greece\u2019s bailout loans, reducing the country\u2019s debt \u201ccan only be sustained over the long run under what appear to be very ambitious assumptions about G.D.P. growth and Greece\u2019s ability to run large primary fiscal surpluses, suggesting that it could be difficult to sustain market access over the longer run without further debt relief.\u201dThough Greece\u2019s economy is growing, it is still only three-quarters of its precrisis size. Gross domestic product has expanded since the middle of last year, buoyed by an apparent renewal in exports. But much of the export growth comes from refining imported oil and exporting the final product \u2014 an activity that sustains tens of thousands of jobs, but does not filter through to the broader economy.Even as it proposed pulling back on some of the harshest austerity, though, the fund recommended maintaining elements that have created hardship for large numbers of average Greeks.Among other things, it urged the government to stick with a plan to cut pensions further next year, and to resist restoring collective bargaining agreements, which cut the iron power of unions but also led to a drop in wages. Allowing the return of such deals would reverse a nascent recovery in employment and competitiveness, the fund said.\u201cGreece has reached this point thanks to enormous efforts,\u201d the fund added. \u201cGreece should now consolidate and extend its success by addressing, with determination, its remaining challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Google $5.1 Billion in Android Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities fined Google a record $5.1 billion on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices, in one of the most aggressive regulatory actions against American technology giants and one that may force lasting changes to smartphones.The fine was coupled with remedies that would effectively loosen Google\u2019s grip over its Android software, which is used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones and is a key part of the Silicon Valley company\u2019s business. Those changes, which European regulators ordered to take effect in 90 days, undercut Google\u2019s ability to automatically include its own search and other apps in mobile devices, opening it to more competition in a market that it has dominated.\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. \u201cThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\u201dThe size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects the seriousness and the sustained nature\u201d of Google\u2019s actions.Regardless of an appeal, if Google does not start altering its mobile phone practices in 90 days, it faces penalties of up to 5 percent of the worldwide average daily revenue of its parent company, Alphabet.\u201cAndroid has enabled this and created more choice for everyone, not less,\u201d he added.Yet the ultimate effect of Wednesday\u2019s ruling may be muted given that Europe has largely acted alone in its regulatory actions against Silicon Valley titans, though there have been signs recently of shifting attitudes and a tougher stance by officials in the United States.At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said that the mobile-software market was concentrated and that he spoke with Ms. Vestager on Tuesday.\u201cLet me just say we\u2019re going to read what the E.U. put out very closely,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe European Commission left Google to come up with its own ways to comply with the decision, an approach that critics said gave the company room to soften the blow. Competitors said that after Google was fined \u20ac2.4 billion, or $2.7 billion, in an antitrust case last year for favoring its comparison-shopping service in search results, the company sidestepped the rules. Google has appealed that decision.\u201cGetting a good headline and a big fine is one thing. Fixing the market is quite another,\u201d said Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo, a comparison-shopping site that has filed complaints against Google to regulators.Google\u2019s services remain immensely popular, and its stock price, profits and revenue continue to soar. Since the European Commission began investigating Android three years ago, annual revenue for Alphabet has grown to $111 billion from $75 billion. Google has also strengthened its dominance in the mobile phone market, with more than 1.25 billion Android handsets sold globally last year, according to the research firm IDC.The case underscores the broader challenge regulators face in overseeing the digital economy. By the time the authorities home in on an area deserving of scrutiny, the market may have moved on.\u201cFast-moving markets are where competition law is most important,\u201d said Jonathan Kanter, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss and a former antitrust investigator for the Federal Trade Commission, who has worked for Google competitors including Yelp. But \u201cwhen you have cases that are many years old, you\u2019re fighting old battles instead of the next one.\u201dAt the heart of the European Commission\u2019s case was the question of whether Google had abused its power by forcing handset makers like Samsung, Huawei and HTC to make its Google Search and Chrome browser the default services on Android-based devices in order to gain access to other Google apps.While Google gives Android away to handset makers, those companies must effectively pre-install 11 Google apps on their devices, giving Google\u2019s products far greater reach and more users to click on its ads. The strategy has enabled Google to reach more than a billion monthly users for six products: search, maps, Gmail, YouTube, the Chrome internet browser, and the Google Play app and media store.Now the European authorities are ordering Google to stop tying Google Search and Chrome to the Google Play store. In addition, antitrust officials said Google must stop providing financial incentives to handset makers and wireless carriers to favor its services, a practice the company stopped in 2014.In another remedy, European officials ordered that Google must allow handset manufacturers to create their own versions of Android software, otherwise known as \u201cforks.\u201d Google had previously discouraged the rise of competing smartphone software based on Android by blocking manufacturers\u2019 access to Google apps if they built devices using any alternative versions.The case has parallels to a similarly significant action against Microsoft in the 2000s, when it was heavily penalized in Europe and the United States for using its power in the personal computer market to bundle in its own internet browser, boxing out its rivals. At the time, Google, a young upstart, was among those to complain about Microsoft\u2019s practices.Some Google rivals cheered Wednesday\u2019s decision. Locking handset makers into deals with Google made it \u201cvery challenging to compete,\u201d Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine, said in an interview. \u201cWe would hope the U.S. would ultimately follow suit and take another look at this.\u201dBut handset makers may continue to pre-install Google\u2019s Chrome and Search because consumers like them \u2014 or because Google pays them to do it.\u201cThe reality is there are not that many other players that can compete, so in some ways, I think the E.U. is fighting a battle that\u2019s already over,\u201d said Ben Schachter, a technology analyst at Macquarie Securities.Google could ultimately decide to charge handset makers for using Android in Europe, a policy shift that could drive up the prices of some handsets.Google argued that the European decision was an attack on its ad-based business model. The company said it required handset makers to use its suite of apps as a way of recouping the billions of dollars it spends to make Android. The arrangement, the company said, lets manufacturers compete with Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, by making phones and tablets of various designs and prices, while Google makes money through its services.Mr. Kanter, the lawyer, said that although Google had largely won the battle to embed Android into smartphones, Wednesday\u2019s ruling could limit how the company approached new areas where the software was being used, including automobiles and internet-connected home electronics.The regulatory push in Europe might also influence others around the world to take a tougher look at Silicon Valley, he added.\u201cTo say that any single action by the European Commission is going to stop them is probably na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Kanter said. \u201cBut movements have to start somewhere, and good, strong, persistent, decisive action can over time have an effect.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from Brussels, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Trump Starts a Trade War, but the Path to Success Remains Unclear", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has said that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win.\u201d Now, as he opens a global skirmish with allies and adversaries alike, the question is whether he has a plan to achieve the results he wants or whether he is heading into a costly and futile clash without resolution.The president appears to be betting that threatening trading partners like China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada with tariffs will eventually force them to bend to the United States.His strategy is being buoyed by a strong economy that is giving Mr. Trump more latitude to impose tariffs that might otherwise pose too much risk. Job growth was strong in June, according to a new government report, as employers added 213,000 net new jobs and the unemployment rate rose as more people entered the labor market and began looking for work. Manufacturing job growth was particularly robust.Those numbers are backward-looking, but there is little reason to think that the initial batch of tariffs will knock the entire economy off course. The $34 billion worth of Chinese goods subject to tariffs, and an equivalent retaliation by China, is tiny compared to the $20 trillion United States economy. Global stock markets largely shrugged off the trade war on Friday.But the tariffs are still inflicting pain on some industries in particular, including farmers and small manufacturers who have long supported Mr. Trump. And with little sign of a negotiated resolution between the United States and China \u2014 or any other trading partner \u2014 the conflict threatens to escalate, eventually affecting hundreds of billions of dollars of additional products.On Friday, the Trump administration took its most aggressive step yet as it imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, including medical devices and airplane parts, and threatened billions of dollars more in the coming months. The Chinese immediately responded with tariffs on an equal volume of American soybeans, pork, automobiles and other products.Mexico, Canada and the European Union have similarly retaliated against Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs and have threatened to push back if the president moves ahead with his threat to place a 20 percent tariff on imported cars and car parts.The president and his advisers insist that history is on their side and that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach will yield better results than years of diplomatic niceties, including bilateral talks with the Chinese, that have produced bad deals for the United States.\u201cWe have the worst trade deals in the world. We lose money with everybody,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week. \u201cEvery country is calling every day, saying, let\u2019s make a deal, let\u2019s make a deal. It\u2019s going to all work out.\u201dHis approach has garnered support from certain corners of American industry, particularly sectors that have seen significant job losses connected to China\u2019s rise.But many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say they are unsure, exactly, how the trade war will work out, given the escalating threats emanating from the White House and the lack of a clear strategy toward resolving the president\u2019s differences with the United States\u2019 trading partners.Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs had barely gone into effect before he upped the ante and threatened auto tariffs on those same allies, pushing trade relations with Europe and Canada to their rockiest point in decades. With China, the president\u2019s advisers have vacillated between asking Beijing to purchase more American products to lower the United States\u2019 trade deficit and pushing for more substantive economic reforms. And talks to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico remain stalled over deep differences with the United States.If the conflict with China is not resolved soon, Mr. Trump has threatened to place tariffs on nearly everything China exports to the United States, in addition to tightening Chinese investments in the United States and limiting visas for Chinese citizens. While many supporters describe the president\u2019s bold statements as a negotiating tactic, talks between the Chinese and the United States have faltered for now, with no additional discussions in sight.\u201cThere is no apparent plan,\u201d said Daniel Price, a managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors, an advisory firm, and a former trade official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe administration has given no indication what the off-ramp is or what their objectives are.\u201d\u201cTrump is treating trade policy as though it were a real estate deal, where the goal is to beat your opponent, step on his throat and humiliate him,\u201d said Daniel Ikenson, the director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute.Even if it works and nations like China blink, Mr. Ikenson said, \u201cthe cost to that will be trust in the U.S., and it will encourage other governments to behave this way when their backs are against the wall.\u201dMany farmers and manufacturers remain staunch supporters of Mr. Trump. But their faith is starting to waver as tariffs take effect and they feel the impact of reduced market access and higher costs.\u201cI would just like the administration to be clear, at least with us, on the goal,\u201d said Jay Hollowell, the mayor of Helena-West Helena, Ark., an area that produces soybeans, which are now being heavily taxed by China. \u201cIs it to lower trade deficits with other countries like China, or is it to protect American industries?\u201d\u201cPeople\u2019s livelihoods are on the line here,\u201d Mr. Hollowell added.For now, the current trade measures affect a small portion of the economy and come at a time of economic strength, giving Mr. Trump more latitude to take the type of aggressive measures that, in weaker economic times, would provide a drag on the economy much more quickly.Businesses have been warning for months that tariffs will cause them to scale back on hiring and investment, and pass higher prices on to consumers. But those effects are not evident in the data, so far.Oxford Economics, for example, calculated that the tariffs with China would shave only 0.1 percent off both American and Chinese gross domestic product in the next two years, though that would rise to 0.3 percent if the Trump administration follows through on threats to expand the tariffs to $200 billion worth of goods.But tariffs could still cause plenty of trouble in specific sectors and industries, even if the levies do not provide a significant drag on overall economic growth.For example, soybean futures prices have fallen 15 percent since May 25 in anticipation of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs. With a stiff tax on soybean imports, American farmers will face lower demand from overseas and a hit to their incomes. Those farmers, in turn, would spend less on equipment and materials, which could eventually trickle through to the broader economy.John Heisdorffer, a soybean grower from Keota, Iowa, and the president of the American Soybean Association, said he and others in the industry had spent years trying to develop markets in China that were now being closed with the stroke of a pen. \u201cMy son, who farms with me, is going to spend the rest of his lifetime trying to get that back, and that scares the hell out of me,\u201d Mr. Heisdorffer said.The United States trade representative said Friday that it would allow American companies to apply for exclusions to the tariffs if the product they need to import is not available outside China, or if the tariffs on it would cause \u201csevere economic harm.\u201dSome of the products involved in earlier phases of the Trump administration\u2019s trade battles offer evidence of how American consumers may eventually be affected.In January, the president announced new tariffs on imported washing machines. Since then, the price of laundry equipment is up 10 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.And the administration has either entered or threatened to enter trade wars on multiple fronts at the same time, compounding the risks. A tariff on automobile imports that is in the works, for example, could expand the dollar value of goods the United States places tariffs on by tenfold and set off a new wave of retaliation that endangers companies that export to Europe, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere.Leaders of the Federal Reserve appear concerned that this overlay of risk in the economy could dampen investment spending, according to minutes of a June policy meeting released Thursday. Fed officials \u201cnoted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.\u201dThe economy appears strong enough to withstand the relatively moderate tariffs that have already been put in place. The question is what will happen if things continue to escalate to eventually encompass hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars worth of goods.\u201cIf we get up to a trillion dollars in the cross hairs, then that means we\u2019re talking about 25 percent of trade in goods,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said. \u201cPeople will begin to notice that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $100 Billion Train: The Future of California or a Boondoggle?", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "In the face of sharp opposition and questions about how to pay for it, construction of California\u2019s high-speed rail line is roaring ahead.Supported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 It is vigorously opposed by Republicans, including President Trump. It has been plagued by escalating costs and delays. Californians are mostly against it. And a central question \u2014 how is it going to be paid for \u2014 remains unresolved.But here in the Central Valley, far from the debates in Washington and Sacramento, the $100 billion Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train has moved off the drawing board and onto 21 construction sites spread across five Central California counties.Work began two weeks ago on one of the more ambitious pieces of the project \u2014 an overpass that will carry trains over a major highway in Fresno \u2014 and ground will be broken on three more viaducts in the next few months. Nearly 2,000 workers are on the job, starting as early as 5 a.m. to avoid the 110-degree afternoon heat. \u201cSimply put, dirt is flying in the Central Valley,\u201d the High-Speed Rail Authority declared in a recent business plan.Yet for all the cranes, crews in orange vests, beeping trucks and fresh concrete, it remains far from certain that this project will ever be completed. In addition to the lack of funding, it faces opposition from both Mr. Trump and Kevin McCarthy, the Bakersfield Republican who is the House majority leader.The continued delays and rising costs have fueled criticism that California, perhaps the most prosperous state in the nation, is squandering money on a transportation project that critics describe as a prime example of big government waste in a state controlled by Democrats.\u201cThis is going to be the most expensive and slowest form of fast rail imaginable,\u201d said Jim Patterson, a former Fresno mayor who is now a Republican member of the Assembly and a critic of the project.For all the construction, the project faces the ever-present threat that a future governor may decide that state resources would be better used dealing with, to name one example, the housing crisis. Gov. Jerry Brown, a big proponent, is leaving office at the end of the year.\u201cThe project seems to make even less sense today,\u201d said Joe Nation, a professor of public policy at Stanford University.For advocates of high-speed rail, California under Mr. Brown has been a rare bright spot, while other ambitious government-funded bullet train proposals across the nation have struggled in the face of opposition from Republicans who are concerned about the costs and disruptions.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida rejected Federal funds to help build a high speed rail line from Tampa to Orlando, saying it was too expensive for taxpayers. Attempts to upgrade rail service between New York and Boston on Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor have repeatedly faltered because of community opposition.A high-speed rail line is moving ahead in Texas, connecting Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, but it is being financed by private industry.The high-speed train in California, championed by Mr. Brown, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, his Republican predecessor, is the most ambitious public transportation project underway in the nation today. It is moving ahead while other mass transit improvement ambitions \u2014 for the subway system in New York City, for an innovative elevated train line in Honolulu \u2014 have also been hamstrung by costs and opposition.The entire 800-mile line is scheduled for completion by 2033. There is no shortage of obstacles to what even the project\u2019s biggest boosters call an ambitious timetable, including the engineering challenge of tunneling through the Tehachapi Mountains, a barrier between the Central Valley and Los Angeles.The cost was originally supposed to be split among the state, the federal government and private business. But that arrangement faltered, as hopes for federal dollars faded with Republicans in power in Washington and businesses shied away from such an uncertain venture. As of now, the rail authority has come up with less than $30 billion of the necessary $100 billion, and the project\u2019s costs are expected to continue to rise.\u201cThe rest has to be found,\u201d said Martin Wachs, an emeritus engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a member of a committee appointed by the Legislature to review the project. \u201cAt the moment, 100 percent of the cost is going to be absorbed by the taxpayers.\u201dBeginning construction without all of the financing in place represents a strategic gamble by the rail authority, and by Mr. Brown, that once enough work is completed, future leaders will be loath to walk away from the project and leave a landscape of unfinished pillars, viaducts, bridges and track beds. Faced with reduced resources, the authority has altered its plans, and is now focused on finishing a 119-mile stretch of track from Bakersfield to Madera by 2022.Brian P. Kelly, the head of the authority, argued that when this stretch of train is completed, people will rally around the project and the business community would become convinced of its viability.\u201cIf I can get trains on the ground, Californians will start to see that this is something that we want,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attention paid to what we don\u2019t have. But we have significant fund-raising to get done what we have to get done.\u201d\u201cYes, the project has challenges,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cAnd the primary challenge for this same project is the same today as it was the day the voters passed the bond: And that is, we don\u2019t have enough money to build what we want to build.\u201dNEV.SanFranciscoCALIFORNIAMaderaPlannedhigh-speedrail routeFresnoSectioncurrentlybeing builtin CentralValleyBakersfieldPACIFICOCEANLos AngelesCALIF.Planned routeof second phaseArea ofdetailSan DiegoMEXICOBy The New York TimesIn downtown Fresno, more than 300 homes and businesses have been relocated, some by condemnation, to make way for the rail line. A mile-long network of viaducts, bridges and platforms is rising more than 60 feet over farmland.\u201cWe had to shift this freeway here over by 100 feet,\u201d said Diana Gomez, the Central Valley regional director of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, as she drove down a brand-new stretch of Highway 99 that was rebuilt to make way for the train line just north of this city.The strategy of concentrating first on the section from Bakersfield to Madera puts off tunneling through mountains, which Mr. Kelly said could cost anywhere from $4 billion to $13 billion. It also means that people living in California\u2019s two major population centers \u2014 San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 will see no sign of the project any time soon.\u201cThe latest business plan is essentially a going-out-of-business plan,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cIt finally admits that it cannot complete a high speed rail plan between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The question is whether the construction on display in the Central Valley will be enough to dissuade a future governor from doing that.\u201cThe more they can show what they have done, the harder it is to abandon the project,\u201d Mr. Wachs said. \u201cOn the other hand, it can easily be argued that the cost of what they have done so far has so exceeded their projections that it\u2019s not inappropriate for a governor to look at it and say, \u2018Let\u2019s not throw more good money after bad.\u2019\u201dMr. Kelly said that the merits of the project would ultimately pull it through.\u201cThe project has been a political football for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I know is this: This project has all the right points of what California is trying to do with transportation. We are trying to provide fast, efficient service and we are trying to do it in a clean way that expands our economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a professor of public policy at Stanford.

{"Headline": "Trump Poised to Enter NATO Meeting as Wild Card Among Allies", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 NATO summit meetings were once ritualistic events, with the member nations assembling to proclaim that the alliance had never been stronger and pledging to work together on the security issues of the day.In the Trump era, however, they have become anxiety-producing confrontations where the main object is to avoid long-term damage to the military alliance. This time the stakes are even higher, as the allies seek to project strength and solidarity against Russian threats.For the allies, that has meant figuring out how to handle President Trump, who arrives on Tuesday in Brussels for this year\u2019s summit meeting having already pressured some member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to expand their military budgets.As he has prepared for Brussels, Mr. Trump has accused Europe of exploiting the United States and hinted that he might play the role of agitator at NATO, sowing disagreement among allies, which would play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands.Allies are concerned that Mr. Trump may try to bargain American troop strength in Europe for increased military spending by others.\u201cTo be honest, no one really knows how Trump will act during the summit,\u201d Mr. Valasek said. \u201cHis unpredictability is not a byproduct but a design feature \u2014 he likes it that way. He comes to this meeting not only prepared to go into confrontation with his peers and allies but with his own staff.\u201dMr. Trump appears to have a special animus toward Germany, believing that Berlin has developed a vibrant social system and thriving export-driven economy unfairly, and on the back of the United States, by not spending enough on defense.He also said he had suggested to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that the tens of thousands of United States troops who are stationed in her country might not be worth the expenditure \u2014 an opinion he has shared privately with advisers at the White House, according to one person familiar with the discussions.Germany has promised to increase military spending to 1.5 percent of its economy by 2024. While not the 2 percent level, Berlin will argue that will still be more than any other NATO country other than the United States.Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chairman of the German Parliament\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, said the answer to Mr. Trump is \u201cto accept he has a point, and respond by displaying more European strength and enhancing European defense in cooperation with NATO.\u201d As a whole, the alliance\u2019s European members spend about $200 billion a year.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s cost inefficient, militarily ineffective and lacks political weight and impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to strengthen the European pillar of NATO.\u201dStill, the fear is that Mr. Trump will seek to bargain \u2014 to conflate trade and security \u2014 as he has already done with South Korea and Japan.Europeans cannot accept making collective security transactional, or dependent on actions on tariffs or specific spending targets in a relationship that is mutually beneficial, said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, a policy institute in London.\u201cIt can feel like a protection racket, trading security for economic return,\u201d Mr. Niblett said, especially as Mr. Trump \u201cthen goes off to see Putin.\u201dMr. Trump has dismissed concerns about Mr. Putin as overblown.Last month, he suggested that Russia should be readmitted to the Group of 7, from which it was expelled after illegally annexing Crimea.During a phone call with Mr. Putin in March, when the president was urged by aides not to congratulate the Russian president on his electoral victory, Mr. Trump did just that.He told Mr. Putin that Russia and the United States should get along better. And he described as \u201cstupid people\u201d the unnamed Trump administration officials whom the Russian president said had tried to prevent the call from happening, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have struck a far sharper tone against Russia.They say that the president is ready to confront Mr. Putin about Russia\u2019s \u201cmalign activities,\u201d and that the United States wants a strong and unified NATO. They also have dismissed any suggestion that Washington would consider pulling back its military presence or commitment to the alliance in response to what it considers to be under-spending by member countries.\u201cThe major thing, the major deliverable, the major overall theme of this summit is going to be NATO\u2019s strength and unity,\u201d Kay Bailey Hutchison, the United States ambassador to NATO, said in a conference call with reporters last week.She said she had heard nothing about adjusting the United States\u2019 military presence in Germany, and praised European allies for spending more on their defense, saying it would be a main focus of the gathering.\u201cEvery one of our allies \u2014 100 percent \u2014 are increasing defense spending,\u201d Ms. Hutchison said. \u201cSo that is something that we will talk about as an achievement, but also that we need to do more.\u201dThe worry in Europe is that Mr. Putin will flatter Mr. Trump and play on the American president\u2019s notion of himself as a great negotiator in face-to-face meetings. They cite the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, following the Group of 7 crackup, when Mr. Trump emerged to announce the cancellation of longstanding military exercises with South Korea \u2014 without consulting or informing either the South Korean government or the Pentagon.\u201cIn the past, Europe did not doubt that U.S. interests and values were fundamentally aligned with theirs,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, who was an international economic adviser to President George W. Bush and a White House veteran of major summit meetings.\u201cNow they wonder whether they can count on us in times of crisis without our first checking to see if they are current on their rent or royalty payments,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cThe decline in confidence is palpable.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade Truce With Europe Has a Familiar Feel: It Mirrors Obama\u2019s Path", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump called a truce with the European Union over trade, the general outlines of his plan sounded familiar. It echoed of earlier negotiations \u2014 the ones started under President Barack Obama and shelved by Mr. Trump last year.Mr. Trump, in many ways, is taking credit for solving a crisis of his own making. After taking office, he criticized the deals of his predecessor and cut off trade talks with the European Union. He raised the stakes by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, prompting retaliatory measures by the European Union. Then he stoked the tensions by calling Europe a \u201cfoe.\u201dNow, Mr. Trump, in hashing out an agreement on Wednesday with president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is declaring victory. He said the two sides would work to lower tariffs and other trade barriers. They would reduce bureaucratic roadblocks to industrial goods flowing across the Atlantic, while ending conflicting regulations for drugs and chemicals.The United States was pursuing much the same under Mr. Obama through a deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. And the collapse of the deal still smarts for large segments of American and European business who had fervently hoped to create a trans-Atlantic version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union has repeatedly told the Trump administration that it would be happy to revive trade talks.\u201cMost of the deal is stuff we were already on the verge of agreeing on in the T.T.I.P. negotiations, before that deal got deep-sixed after Trump\u2019s election,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters. \u201cBut at least the President is talking about more open trade instead of how great tariffs are.\u201dBoth European and American officials resisted comparisons to previous negotiations. But it was not immediately clear what would set the new talks apart from those carried out by the Obama administration, beyond their more limited scope. Unlike with the previous round of negotiations, European officials said that the agricultural sector would be excluded from a deal with the Trump administration.Speaking from Air Force One on Thursday, the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, called the European Union\u2019s willingness to negotiate a \u201creal vindication of the president\u2019s trade policy.\u201d\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had steel and aluminum tariffs, we never would have gotten to the point we are now,\u201d Mr. Ross said.\u201cThe major progress today is that our American friends agreed not to increase tariffs on cars and other products during the negotiation, which is a major concession by the Americans, I have to say,\u201d Mr. Juncker told reporters after the meeting in Washington.Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive posture has helped him gain leverage on the trade front with countries like China. But his confrontational approach has also strained relations with vital allies like the European Union.It is possible that Mr. Trump has changed the political calculus for Europeans. They are frightened by the prospect of escalating tariffs with their largest trading partner.Penalties on foreign cars and auto parts were especially worrisome for Europe, where the industry is a big economic driver. Mr. Trump will postpone imposing them to see how the negotiations progress.\u201cThe Europeans have to ask themselves, \u2018Do we want a trade war or a trade pact?\u2019\u201d said Gabriel Felbermayr, director of the ifo Center for International Economics in Munich. \u201cBefore it was a choice between a pact and the status quo.\u201dAmong European business leaders, there was cautious optimism that the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker could signal a return to the cooperative relationship that once prevailed between Europe and the United States.\u201cWe would see this as a step in the right direction,\u201d said Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union in Brussels. \u201cWork on these areas first, build up trust, and then we work on progress toward other areas.\u201dWhether the announcement turns into a signed trade deal is not exactly assured.Europeans continue to question whether a president with an expressed fondness for tariffs is negotiating in good faith. Diplomats, officials and analysts in Europe worry that Mr. Trump could easily pivot back to the hostility he showed toward European leaders at the G7 summit meeting in Canada in June or the NATO summit meeting in Brussels this month.\u201cIt buys time. Potentially it could be more,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said of the agreement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Juncker. But Mr. Kr\u00e4mer added, \u201cTrump is a protectionist, and we can\u2019t rule out this was just a tactical move.\u201d\u201cUncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of protectionism, remain prominent,\u201d he said at a news conference in Frankfurt.The trade talks did not go smoothly under Mr. Obama, either.Europe and the United States started their trade talks in 2013 in an effort to cut regulations as well as expand trade and investment. But the talks dragged on over divisions over pharmaceuticals, consumer safety and investment rules.In Europe, the deal ran into resistance from critics who complained that the negotiations were held largely in secret. A big worry was that companies would exploit a trade pact to water down regulations on the environment and food safety.Germans were among the most strident opponents of a trans-Atlantic trade deal, even though the country\u2019s auto industry was strongly in favor of removing tariffs. In 2016, thousands of people marched in Berlin to protest the proposed deal.When Mr. Trump was elected, the negotiations fell apart.One of the most toxic parts of the prior deal, an investment court that allows businesses to sue governments for unfair treatment, would likely not be part of future talks. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have criticized these courts and insisted on removing them from Nafta.Opposition groups signaled on Thursday that they would keep a close eye on what emerges from this new attempt to dismantle trade barriers.\u201cAny trade talks between the world\u2019s two biggest economies must not start a race to the bottom, jeopardizing hard-won protections for labor rights, public health, sustainable agriculture and the environment,\u201d Shira Stanton, a trade policy strategist for Greenpeace, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf the E.U. and U.S. try again to water down essential safeguards behind closed doors, they should expect the same public opposition.\u201dThen there are the practical hurdles to negotiating a trade pact, a process that typically takes years.To abide by World Trade Organization rules, any future pact would have to cover nearly all trade between the United States and the European Union, which makes it hard to exclude many sectors. Although Europeans have said agriculture will not be included in the talks, many other industries, from manufacturing to services, may fight back against efforts to slash the tariffs and regulations that protect them.There may be ways to finesse those rules, which the Europeans are anxious not to openly flout. When Japan and the European Union signed a trade pact earlier this month, they phased in some provisions over 15 years to blunt the impact.\u201cIf they want to do it, they can,\u201d said Mr. Felbermayr. \u201cA trade war would be a lot worse than a free trade deal, and no one is going to object.\u201dAna Swanson reported from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Geneva. Milan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
