{"Headline": "The Biggest Spender of Political Ads on Facebook? President Trump", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It\u2019s official: President Trump is the single biggest political advertiser on Facebook.Mr. Trump and his political action committee spent $274,000 on ads on the social network since early May, outpacing the second-biggest spender, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood spent just over $188,000 on Facebook ads over the same period.The ads bought by Mr. Trump and his PAC were also seen the most by Facebook\u2019s users, having been viewed by at least 37 million people since May. That compared with 24 million people who saw the second-most viewed group of political ads, which were also from Planned Parenthood.Facebook now requires buyers of political ads on its network to be verified as United States citizens or permanent residents, to cut down on foreign interference. That means Facebook\u2019s political ad archive largely provides a portrait of domestic activity, spotlighting both the digital ad buying of Democratic and Republican elected officials and political candidates, as well as nonprofit organizations, for-profit groups and PACs. The archive also shows how much these ads were actually consumed by the social network\u2019s users.\u201cOne of the challenges in previous election cycles is that we never had a good repository of political ads,\u201d said Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He said the study was an \u201cimportant initial analysis that reveals both the potential, and the many limitations, of Facebook\u2019s political ad database.\u201dThe N.Y.U. researchers broke out the top 449 spenders of political ads on Facebook since May for The New York Times. Of those, 210 were left-wing groups, 124 were right-wing groups and 115 groups were politically neutral, they said.Damon McCoy, who conducted the study with two fellow researchers, Laura Edelson and Shikhar Sakhuja, said they were not able to tally the total spending for Republicans and Democrats because their analysis was ongoing, though they planned to release those figures in the future.But the new study found a healthy amount of activity from what the researchers described as left-leaning politicians. Of the top 20 political candidates and PACs purchasing Facebook ads, 12 were identified as Democrats while eight were Republicans, according to data provided by the N.Y.U. researchers.Facebook\u2019s database worked well for identifying specific ads, Mr. McCoy said, but it did not give an overview of how a particular group or politician was advertising on Facebook. Some groups, he said, used multiple names to promote ads, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which also had ads placed as the A.C.L.U.The researchers said they also found 43,575 cases of ads with political content that did not name a sponsor, indicating that whoever purchased the ad did not go through Facebook\u2019s verification process. They added that men and women between the ages of 25 to 34 were the most targeted for ads, while those under 17 or above 65 were the least targeted.Facebook said it welcomed the new study and hoped others would begin delving into its data.\u201cThis report is the exactly how we hoped the tool would be used \u2014 outside experts helping to analyze these ads on Facebook,\u201d said Rob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management. \u201cIt brings more transparency to the messages people see and increases accountability and responsibility over time, not just for us but advertisers as well.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.The Facebook ads from Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, ran the gamut from those challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s position on reproductive rights to ads about its services in various states.\u201cRunning ads on Facebook is a targeted and cost-effective way to reach both our 2.4 million patients and 12 million supporters,\u201d said Erica Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. She pointed out that the figures in the database included ads from the organization\u2019s 56 affiliates, including services they provide, as well as \u201cadvertisements raising the alarm about what is at risk as the Trump-Pence administration and many states try to take away access to health care.\u201d\u201cWhile Facebook is trying to deal with a very real problem of fake news, their solution is far from perfect and creates the unintended consequence of painting a false picture of political advertising on their platform,\u201d Ms. Sackin said.According to the study, most other politicians shelled out well under $100,000 on ads on the social network, reaching only hundreds of thousands of Facebook users.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Yogi Behind Modi\u2019s Rise", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "FeatureBaba Ramdev built a business empire out of mass yoga camps and ayurvedic products. But is his pious traditionalism a mask for darker forces?Supported byOn a hazy day in early February, some of the most powerful men in India\u2019s government gathered at Chhatrasal Stadium in New Delhi, an arena famous for its boisterous wrestling bouts. The men had come for a different kind of spectacle \u2014 a biographical film epic, whose initial episodes (out of 57 total) would be shown for the first time that evening. At the center of a makeshift stage, surrounded by smiling politicians and cabinet members, was the person whose life was being celebrated: a slender figure in saffron robes with a long, dark beard, his chest-length hair tied in a bun. He needed no introduction. This was Baba Ramdev, one of the most famous men in India.One by one, the dignitaries rose to recount Ramdev\u2019s extraordinary career: how he brought physical fitness to the Indian middle class with his mass yoga camps and television empire; how he built his medicine-and-consumer-goods company, Patanjali Ayurved, into a multibillion-dollar colossus. \u201cSwamiji has changed the direction of the world, the thinking of the world,\u201d one speaker shouted, referring to Ramdev with an affectionate honorific. \u201cThat is how great he is. Swamiji has changed India, which was going toward the West \u2014 its dress and food and culture \u2014 and has changed its direction to yoga!\u201dAt last silence fell, and the 50-foot screen flickered to life. For the next hour, India\u2019s political elite watched in humble silence as Ramdev\u2019s life unfolded, from his birth in a remote rural village to his early days as a lissome yogi (the remaining episodes had been condensed into trailer form). As a film, it was a shambolic melodrama that seemed to treat Ramdev almost as a divine messenger. But as an expression of the Indian public\u2019s feelings, it wasn\u2019t far off the mark.Ramdev has been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised several American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. He appeared alongside Modi on several occasions, singing the leader\u2019s praises and urging Indians to turn out for him. Ramdev has called Modi \u201ca close friend,\u201d and the prime minister publicly lauds Patanjali\u2019s array of ayurvedic products \u2014 medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Although Modi campaigned heavily on promises to reform India\u2019s economy and fight corruption, there were frequent dog whistles to the Hindu nationalist base, some of them coordinated with Ramdev. A month before Modi\u2019s landslide victory, a trust controlled by Ramdev released a video in which senior leaders of Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.), including the current ministers of foreign affairs, internal security, finance and transportation, appeared alongside him with a signed document setting out nine pledges. These included the protection of cows \u2014 animals held sacred in Hinduism \u2014 and a broad call for Hindu nationalist reforms of the government, the courts, cultural institutions and education. After Modi won, Ramdev claimed to have \u201cprepared the ground for the big political changes that occurred.\u201dOn the surface, Ramdev\u2019s blissful demeanor is worlds away from Trump\u2019s growls and sneers. But his namastes provide cover for a reactionary campaign to transform the country. When challenged on his evasions and slurs, Ramdev \u2014 like the White House\u2019s current occupant \u2014 tends to respond by pointing a finger at \u201ccorrupt\u201d figures in the secular elite. It seems to work. Last year an Indian judge banned a critical biography of Ramdev before it was released and then put a gag order on its author, barring her from even mentioning the book on social media. In a sense, Ramdev is more powerful than any prime minister. He may be a wholly new breed: a populist tycoon, protected from critics (and even, to some extent, from the law) by a vast following and a claim to holy purpose.I was baffled for a moment, and then found myself marveling at his legerdemain. As a Hindu monk, Ramdev has repeatedly declared his disapproval of homosexuality, calling it \u201cimmoral and unnatural.\u201d He says it can be cured by yoga. But he has the politician\u2019s gift for charming his audience. In a single, East-meets-West moment, he had both deferred to tradition and hinted to me that he was a closet liberal. (He was also kidding about the offer to sleep on his floor, as it turned out.)Ramdev\u2019s informality and practical bent set him apart from most other gurus. Indian religious celebrities are known popularly as godmen, a word that suggests stardom but also adds a hint of derision. They are heirs to an ancient tradition of humble, loincloth-clad wisdom seekers, but opportunism seems to come with the territory as well. Some godmen have become immensely rich and built cults of personality that stretched around the globe. They tend to surround themselves with fawning followers, and many claim to perform miracles, like Sathya Sai Baba, who became notorious in the 1960s for conjuring Omega watches out of thin air. Ramdev is not the first one to gain influence in politics; in the 1970s Indira Gandhi often sought advice from her own yoga teacher, who became known as the \u201cRasputin of Delhi.\u201d But Ramdev rarely clouds the air with talk about enlightenment and religion. \u201cMy yoga is very simple,\u201d he told me. \u201cNo critical postures. No philosophy or ideology. All yoga practices are based on benefit. Instant benefit.\u201dRamdev is also the first godman to earn his millions as a businessman instead of just siphoning donations from wealthy followers. Patanjali has vaulted in just over a decade from a tiny operation into an economic powerhouse, with $1.6 billion in sales in the current fiscal year. Turn on a TV or glance at a billboard almost anywhere in India, and you are likely to see Ramdev advertising one of its products. During our talk, Ramdev boasted of Patanjali\u2019s success, detailing his plans for expansion and saying he aimed to reach about $15 billion in annual sales by 2025, a figure that would make Patanjali one of India\u2019s biggest companies. But he also insisted that Patanjali is not a business at all; it is \u201ca service for humanity, for the nation.\u201d He maintains that neither he nor the company\u2019s C.E.O., Acharya Balkrishna, takes a salary. Ramdev says he doesn\u2019t even have a bank account (he abides by the monk\u2019s vow of austerity and chastity, though the company seems to more than take care of his needs). All profits, he said, are plowed back into research and charity, and the company\u2019s low costs allow it to undersell competitors. Most of Patanjali\u2019s employees are paid much less than they would receive elsewhere; asking for a raise is taboo. (A company spokesman denies this.) They are forbidden to drink alcohol or eat nonvegetarian food. \u201cPenance in individual life, prosperity for others,\u201d Ramdev told me with a smile. This blend of fierce capitalism and monkish renunciation is aimed at making India a \u201cworld economic power and world spiritual power by 2050.\u201dRamdev told me his nationalist vision embraces all religions and castes, but he added a revealing caveat. \u201cCountry first,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a must. Not, \u2018I\u2019m great, my caste is great,\u2019 but my country is great. Unlike Muslim leaders \u2014 they say Islam is great. I say, No: The nation is great, the citizen is great.\u201d And the nation, in Ramdev\u2019s telling, is subtly twinned with a history and culture that is distinctly Hindu: yoga, ayurvedic medicine and the ancient Vedic scriptures from which they are said to have emerged. Sometimes the hints are not so subtle. Two years ago, when a Muslim politician refused to chant a nationalist slogan, Ramdev laid into him at a right-wing rally, saying that were it not for his respect for the law, \u201cwe would behead hundreds of thousands\u201d of such people. A court later issued a warrant for Ramdev\u2019s arrest, though the matter appears to have been dropped.In an effort to overcome these internal fissures, the early Hindu nationalists built a regimented anticolonial social movement in the 1920s, which later formed links with Italian and German fascism; the main branch was known as the RSS, from the Hindi words for \u201cnational organization of volunteers.\u201d In place of black shirts and armbands, they wore khaki shorts and carried bamboo sticks. This association tainted them in the decades that followed, especially after so many British and Indian soldiers died fighting the Axis powers in World War II. Another serious blow came in 1948, when a Hindu nationalist zealot assassinated Mohandas Gandhi, modern India\u2019s saintly father figure. Afterward, Nehru, Gandhi\u2019s political heir, suppressed Hindu nationalist organizations and fostered his own countervailing conception of India as a pluralist, secular state. Although he was a Brahmin, Nehru was a passionate cosmopolitan who saw Hindu identity as narrow and tribal. He wanted India to be defined by its diversity, not by any one faith. It was an idea shaped in part by his British education at Harrow, Cambridge and the Inns of Court in London, and one shared by many of his peers. For decades after independence, India\u2019s ruling class was mostly a \u201cthin layer of brown Englishmen,\u201d in the phrase of an Indian friend of mine who heard it from his grandfather, a friend of Nehru\u2019s. They were patrician figures who rebelled successfully against the British but absorbed many of their ideas about how the country should be governed.By the 1990s, Nehru's Congress party had become almost synonymous with the Indian state, but his tolerant, worldly vision was starting to fray. The Hindu nationalist movement anointed the B.J.P. as its political vehicle, and the party slowly gained strength, fueled by perceptions of corruption and entitlement in the secular political elite. In 1998, the B.J.P. was able to sustain a majority coalition in India\u2019s Parliament for the first time. But in early 2002, bloody communal riots broke out in the western state of Gujarat, reviving the party\u2019s old demons. It started when a train carrying some Hindu pilgrims caught fire. Revenge mobs quickly formed. In the ensuing violence, more than a thousand people were killed, most of them Muslims, and there was widespread looting. Ramdev\u2019s future friend Narendra Modi was Gujarat\u2019s chief minister at the time, and evidence soon emerged suggesting that he and other top B.J.P. officials had stoked the violence, or at least given a green light. (A court-appointed investigation cleared Modi of wrongdoing in 2012, but many scholars and analysts who have examined the evidence disagree.) Many Indian Muslims still consider the riots a state-sanctioned pogrom, and see Modi \u2014 who has never apologized for his role \u2014 as a criminal. But even among Hindus, the B.J.P. suffered from its reputation as a party led by Brahmins and other upper-caste Hindus. It had trouble winning votes from Dalits (untouchables) and others at the lower end of India\u2019s caste hierarchy.Ramdev was just the kind of unifying figure the B.J.P. needed. At the time of the Gujarat riots, he was emerging as a celebrity, crisscrossing India to preside over mass yoga camps and pitch his home remedies. He tapped into a hunger for spirituality and health among India\u2019s growing middle class and quickly became a symbol of Hinduism at its most benign, a ready-made package of rituals and foods that were fun, affordable and good for you. As his fame spread, a stream of politicians and celebrities made their way to Haridwar, eager to donate to his cause and seek his endorsement; he was becoming what Indians call a \u201cvote bank.\u201d In 2011, he embraced the nationwide anti-corruption movement, led by the independent social activist Anna Hazare, which swept India that year. In June, he started a hunger strike against corruption, and 40,000 of his followers rallied in his support in Delhi. The police showed up with tear gas, and in the ensuing melee, Ramdev shed his saffron robes under a stage and tried to escape disguised as an injured woman, only to be detained and exposed on video, bushy beard and all. The Indian press mocked him for days.But nothing seems to taint Ramdev for long. Three years later, his reputation as a crusader against corruption \u2014 a frequent B.J.P. talking point \u2014 made him even more valuable in the elections that swept the Hindu nationalists to power. He turned his yoga-camp meetings, which often had tens of thousands of people in attendance, into unofficial rallies. Two weeks before the elections started, he welcomed Modi onstage at a huge outdoor gathering in New Delhi. \u201cYou\u2019ll make other people understand, won\u2019t you?\u201d Ramdev said to the microphone, as Modi sat next to him, grinning. \u201cYou won\u2019t sit at home, will you?\u201d The audience roared back: \u201cNo!\u201dRamdev founded a short-lived political party in 2010, and has since been rumored to be weighing a political career himself. When I brought up the question, he smilingly batted it away, saying that he\u2019d become a \u201cnonpolitical person\u201d and that the triumph of the B.J.P. had obviated any need for him to run for office. \u201cModi is an honest prime minister,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe is a visionary and a missionary. He will win the next term (in the 2019 elections). He will build a strong foundation for India.\u201dMany Indian Muslims say they have begun to feel like strangers in their own land. The B.J.P. has proposed a number of laws with a troublingly sectarian cast. One of them would allow immigrants from nearby countries who are Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Christian to apply for citizenship but would explicitly exclude Muslims. Even worse, some Muslims say, is the government\u2019s winking attitude toward communal violence. In 2015, a Hindu mob in a village near Delhi beat a Muslim to death on suspicion of having eaten beef. When one of the accused killers later died of an unrelated illness, a B.J.P. politician attended his funeral; the coffin was draped in the Indian flag. Episodes like this have multiplied since Modi\u2019s victory in 2014.This narrative about yoga\u2019s ancient roots has become a sacrament for Hindu nationalists, and it is echoed in the West. But it is mostly myth, an idealized origin story of the kind so many would-be nation-builders, from ancient Rome to the Zionists, have fostered about themselves. The oldest Hindu scriptures contain almost no mention of physical postures. Even the Yoga Sutras, the so-called bible of yoga, include only a few short verses suggesting comfortable postures for sitting. Many of the postures practiced in yoga today appear to have emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Dozens of modern ashtanga yoga postures are similar or identical to those found in a gymnastic routine introduced to India by the British in the first decades of the 20th century and originally developed by a Danish fitness instructor named Niels Bukh, who later became notorious for his pro-Nazi sympathies. Bukh, needless to say, has been conveniently forgotten by both Indians and the yoga-loving celebrities of Hollywood.Yoga is only half of Ramdev\u2019s work. He and Balkrishna also use their television empire to tout the healing virtues of Patanjali\u2019s ayurvedic medicines and health foods, rooted in the supposedly curative powers of herbal and mineral compounds. Western scientists view ayurveda (the \u201cscience of life\u201d) with skepticism, and studies have found that some ayurvedic products contain toxic levels of heavy metals, usually from soil or ash, in the mix. But in India they have become a booming business, thanks in part to Ramdev's marketing efforts. Balkrishna gave me a tour of Patanjali\u2019s medical research institute, in a gleaming new building that was inaugurated last year by Modi himself (\u201cSwami Ramdev\u2019s herbs help you overcome all problems,\u201d the prime minister told the crowds gathered for the event).If Ramdev is Patanjali\u2019s flamboyant mascot, Balkrishna is his foil, a number-crunching introvert with buckteeth and a high, soft voice. He led me upstairs to a laboratory where white-coated technicians were drying masses of swampy green spirulina, a form of algae, to be packed into pills. \u201cIt is high in protein and vitamins,\u201d one of the men told me. In his spare time, Balkrishna said, he wanders the forests of the Himalayas looking for medicinal herbs. Some can be found growing in a garden behind the research center, adjoining a Disney-style religious theme park, with life-size sculpted figures enacting scenes from the Vedas inside man-made caves.It looked like Hindu kitsch to me. But for Ramdev and Balkrishna, all this herbal wisdom is serious business. When it comes to marketing against foreign competitors, they wield their holiness like a club. One Patanjali ad runs: \u201cAs East India Company plundered our country for 200 years likewise these multinationals are exploiting our country by selling their harmful and dangerous chemical products. Beware!\u201d Ramdev\u2019s competitors have sued Patanjali repeatedly, but the slurs persist.Over the years, this way of fending off criticism has become a pattern; nonetheless, Patanjali has faced at least half a dozen legal actions over its products. In October 2016, the food and drug administration of Haryana State found Patanjali\u2019s cow ghee (clarified butter) to be \u201csubstandard and unsafe.\u201d Last April, the Indian military stopped selling a popular Patanjali juice to soldiers after a government agency tested samples and found them \u201cunfit for consumption.\u201d (Patanjali countered that the juice was medicine and thus the wrong test had been performed.) In the banned biography of Ramdev published last year, the journalist Priyanka Pathak-Narain wrote that Patanjali\u2019s cow ghee \u2014 advertised as the purest on the market \u2014 was made from white butter sourced from hundreds of thousands of small producers, blending cow, buffalo and goat milk. In India, where pure ghee is required for religious purposes, such things matter.Some former employees say Ramdev is guilty of more than safety violations. One former high-level executive at Patanjali, who worked at the company for several years, spoke to me on condition of anonymity, saying he feared retaliation. When I asked him why he left, he said of Ramdev: \u201cBecause he\u2019s a crook. Because he\u2019s a hypocrite.\u201d He rattled off a sheaf of shocking claims about fraud and employee abuse. (These have been written about in the Indian press, but none appear to have been substantiated in court.) One story involved Ramdev\u2019s brother, Ram Bharat, who was arrested in 2013 and accused of kidnapping and imprisoning a worker suspected of theft (the charges were later dropped). Another former Patanjali executive told me similar stories and added that he began receiving threatening phone calls after he refused to facilitate what he saw as kickback schemes. He complained to Balkrishna, he said, but the calls continued and \u2014 feeling his life might be in danger \u2014 he resigned. A Patanjali spokesman categorically denied that any of these events took place.For Ramdev\u2019s critics, the skeletons in his closet are tied to a broader concern that his political value to the B.J.P. may have placed him above the law. I heard wealthy businesspeople in Delhi speak of him with audible fear in their voices, as if he could damage them at will. One thing is certain: Ramdev has received extraordinary favors from the Indian government since Modi was elected. Soon after the 2014 election, B.J.P.-led state governments across India began facilitating steep discounts on land purchases for Patanjali. There is some precedent for nonprofits or religious organizations to receive such favors, but the deals Patanjali got were very unusual. In the largest of these deals, Patanjali was given a 1,200-acre parcel of land in the eastern state of Assam at no cost. According to state legislature documents I was shown by a local academic, the deal was made by an agency controlled by the Bodoland People\u2019s Front, a party aligned with the B.J.P. Last year a Reuters investigation documented several discounted land sales and leases in three other Indian states that saved the company a total of $46 million. Critics say these deals were partly payback for the boost Ramdev provided to the B.J.P. in the elections. But by spreading Patanjali\u2019s presence into outlying areas where it needed support, the party was also sowing the seeds of future electoral victories.Not long after the party\u2019s 2014 victory, Patanjali secured two large tracts in Assam and began work on a vast production facility. I reached the plant after a bumpy eight-hour journey through endless tea plantations and was greeted by the site manager, an ebullient man with bushy eyebrows named S.B. Singh. His newly built office was empty apart from a large picture of Ramdev on the wall. Through the windows we could see earth-moving machines and construction crews and big piles of muddy, ocher-hued soil.\u201cThere was jungle where we\u2019re sitting,\u201d Singh told me. \u201cElephants.\u201d Patanjali got the factory up and running in only 132 days, he told me, razing the jungle and clearing out a total of 88 elephants before building a complex of warehouses on the 155-acre site. (The elephants were guided gently to a patch of forest nearby, Singh told me.) He unleashed a blizzard of statistics \u2014 4,000 workers, 1.2 million bags of cement, a 20-person management team \u2014 his eyes sparkling with pride at the achievement. The plant remained unfinished and was still running at partial capacity. But already hundreds of workers were busy making cookies and cosmetics. Thousands more were being trained, and not just in job skills.\u201cWe are mentally conditioning them,\u201d Singh said. Patanjali ran more than 380 workshops for prospective employees, where it taught a \u201cvalue system.\u201d Assam\u2019s people, he explained, had \u201cbad habits,\u201d including eating nonvegetarian food and a lack of proper respect for the nation. \u201cThey\u2019ve been listening to corrupt politics from corrupt people for too long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take what our sages said thousands of years ago and put it to use. We didn\u2019t invent it. We took what\u2019s available in our scriptures and put it in a modern format.\u201d In other words, they inculcate Hindutva.Singh took me on a tour of the production complex in an electric golf cart. After admiring the cookie plant and its 300-foot oven, we drove across a deliciously smooth, median-free stretch of pavement that resembled a runway. In fact, it is a runway, built in consultation with the Indian Air Force so that jet fighters can take off and land on it, Singh told me. \u201cWe will dedicate this to the nation in case there is need for an extra airstrip,\u201d he said, and then added with a knowing look, \u201cWe are near China.\u201d Patanjali seems almost to view itself as an extension of the state \u2014 or rather, an illustration of what has become a \u201cstate-temple-corporate complex,\u201d in the apt phrase of the Indian author Meera Nanda.Patanjali\u2019s work in Assam has benefited from longer-term efforts by the RSS. Founded in 1925, the group was briefly banned several times in the wake of communal riots, most recently in 1992. It periodically went underground, doing grass-roots organizing and forming dozens of affiliate organizations that often hide their links with the RSS. Most of the B.J.P.\u2019s top leaders, including Modi, emerged from the RSS and profess loyalty to it. Yet for all its vast influence, there is something curiously slippery about the RSS. Its ideologues insist that it is larger than Hinduism or any single religion, and they speak of a mystical connection with the Indian subcontinent and the saffron flag, the group\u2019s symbol. They aspire to change India at both the collective and the individual level. \u201cIt is a man-making mission,\u201d I was told by Shiv Shakti Bakshi, an RSS veteran who now runs the B.J.P.\u2019s English-language publications. \u201cTo make a man who can work for the society, a selfless worker for the society.\u201d This focus on personal change meshes perfectly with Ramdev\u2019s promotion of physical fitness and health, and Bakshi spoke about the guru in glowing terms. \u201cHis messages are taken seriously by people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn elections, opinion building is important.\u201dThe RSS has become more visible since Modi\u2019s 2014 victory. The group and its affiliates have built hundreds of schools and job-training centers in Assam and other northeastern states in recent years. I visited several and saw unmistakable signs of the RSS ideological program. At one school, young children \u2014 some of whom had been raised Christian \u2014 recited Hindu prayers and sang songs to Lord Ram before starting their lessons, which include Sanskrit instruction.All this hard indoctrination work has paid off. In 2016, the B.J.P. won control of Assam\u2019s state government in legislative elections. And in March of this year, the party won stunning electoral upsets in two adjacent northeastern states, where leftist parties had dominated for decades. There was talk of a \u201csaffron wave\u201d that might spread to the south Indian regions, including Communist-dominated Kerala, that have long resisted the advance of Hindu nationalism. Many Indian political analysts said the RSS\u2019s grass-roots work was essential to the recent electoral victories. But one RSS volunteer in Assam, a construction contractor, told me Ramdev\u2019s presence and his yoga promotion had been very influential, too. The contractor said he'd helped to arrange the purchase of cement and other supplies for the new Assam factory site I toured. But eventually he soured on Patanjali, which he saw as too focused on the bottom line. \u201cEven we are not happy with the way the government helps Ramdev so much,\u201d the contractor told me.The latest wave of B.J.P. victories has been attended by angry criticism of the way the party feeds communal resentments, and Ramdev has not been spared. Assam\u2019s B.J.P.-led state government is compiling a citizenship registry that could cause millions of residents, mostly Muslims, to be declared stateless and expelled, in an eerie echo of the disfranchisement that preceded the mass murder of Rohingya people in nearby Myanmar. One Assamese university professor, who asked not to be named because he feared for his safety, told me that Ramdev had abetted the RSS\u2019s efforts to \u201cquestion all other religions here, anything non-Hindu.\u201d He also said Patanjali \u2014 emboldened by its ties to the Modi government \u2014 had run roughshod over laws regulating the harvest of medicinal plants.Retention has been a persistent problem for Ramdev. Applicants flock to the company, despite the fact that Patanjali reportedly pays 25 to 50 percent less than its competitors. Many leave after a year or less, I was told by executives at Patanjali and other companies. \u201cAutonomy is very low,\u201d said one executive at a competing company who asked not to be named, saying (like many other people I spoke to) that he feared retaliation. \u201cRamdev is very hands-on. There\u2019s no doubt who\u2019s in charge. He\u2019s a micromanager.\u201d Behind his laughing public persona, Ramdev is said by some to be an autocratic boss, capable of lashing out furiously when he\u2019s thwarted.I got a glimpse of Ramdev\u2019s ashram-style management at Haridwar, where he allowed me to observe him one afternoon. On the second floor of the company\u2019s main corporate office, the hallway was clogged with followers who had come for a glimpse of the guru. One group told me they had come all the way from Tamil Nadu, in the far south. Eventually one of Ramdev\u2019s handlers escorted me past the guards and into a wood-paneled office, and there was Ramdev, a splash of saffron color among button-down oxford shirts and gray flannel pants. He was sitting languidly on a couch, a wooden sandal dangling from his toe, interviewing candidates for jobs in sales and marketing. The applicants seemed as much in awe of Ramdev as the followers outside: as they entered, each of them touched Ramdev\u2019s feet reverently, then sat down. He asked them to say what they could contribute to Patanjali. A senior executive sat nearby taking notes, but Ramdev presided over the interview like a king on a throne. He is involved in even the smallest details: decisions about hiring, ads and product development. If anything were to puncture his aura \u2014 some scandal worse than those he has weathered in the past \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine that Patanjali would last a day.Ramdev would not be the first godman to crash and burn. At least a half-dozen other powerful gurus have been arrested and charged with serious crimes in the past 20 years. The most recent and perhaps the most flamboyant was Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, a potbellied and chubby-cheeked figure who cast himself as a superhero in several bizarre self-made action movies with titles like \u201cMSG: Messenger of God.\u201d Singh, who claimed 60 million followers around the world, was convicted of rape last August and sentenced to 20 years in prison. (He has also been formally accused of castrating about 400 of his disciples, a charge he denies.) After the verdict was issued, his followers rioted, smashing cars, setting fire to buildings and attacking police officers; at least 38 people were killed and more than 250 injured.But Ramdev is bigger and better protected than his predecessors. Patanjali has vastly expanded the market for ayurvedic products, and in late 2014 Modi created an entire new government ministry to promote yoga and ayurveda, elevating what had been an obscure government office. Ramdev has made himself a symbol of Indian economic independence, and no one wants to question that, not even his enemies. One Indian C.E.O. who has accused Patanjali of false advertising told me he was grateful to Ramdev \u2014 despite his many sins \u2014 for attracting a new customer base in ways that benefited everyone. \u201cThe worst thing for us would be if he implodes \u2014 with godmen you never know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would impact the whole ayurvedic market.\u201dRamdev appears to have a second layer of insurance: The clouds that hang over him also hang over his political patrons. Modi is regarded by much of the secular elite as a criminal because of his supposed role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. His close ally Amit Shah, the leader of the B.J.P. and by most accounts the second-most-powerful man in India, was arrested in 2010 and charged with arranging the murder of an underworld couple in police custody and making it look as if they were killed during a shootout. The case was ultimately dropped, but suspicions about Shah\u2019s role linger, fueled by a recent series of investigative stories in the Indian press. Modi and Shah respond to their accusers in exactly the same way Ramdev does, by lambasting the secular elite. Their shared feelings of unjust persecution appear to thicken their bond with Ramdev. And they see no need to change their stance; by all available measures, the Indian public is as supportive of Ramdev as ever. In early May, a widely watched business survey reported that Patanjali was the most trusted brand in the country, beating about 1,000 other companies in its sector, including multinationals.If the Modi government gets its way, Ramdev\u2019s star will rise even higher. At the Chhatrasal stadium event in February, Amit Shah told the crowd that the B.J.P. wanted Ramdev to join them in reforming the Indian educational system. One of the party\u2019s new priorities is an ambitious effort to rewrite Indian school textbooks to assert Hindu primacy. Mahesh Sharma, India\u2019s culture minister and an avowed follower of the RSS, has said he hopes to rewrite the conventional narrative about India as a multicultural tapestry, and to inculcate the belief that the ancient Hindu scriptures are historical facts, not legends.\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done in education,\u201d Shah said on the stadium floor, just after the premiere of Ramdev\u2019s biopic. \u201cBecause of our saints and our heroes \u2014 all this needs to be brought into our educational system.\u201dWhen his turn came to speak, Ramdev walked to the lectern, smiling graciously at the gaggle of B.J.P. luminaries onstage. He pledged his support to Modi and Shah, and their efforts to transform India. \u201cIf the first 50 years of my life were a struggle,\u201d he said, \u201cmy next 50 years I dedicate my time and energy to the cultural and spiritual education of the country, to bring our country the great knowledge of the Vedas.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe will see an Indian education policy in this country instead of the education policy given us by Lord Macaulay.\u201d Before stepping down, he pumped his fist once again in a chant of \u201cIndia my motherland is great.\u201d The crowd roared.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Michael Cohen\u2019s Audio Clip Unraveled Trump\u2019s False Statements", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe have no knowledge of any of this,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the newspaper. She said the claim of an affair was \u201ctotally untrue.\u201dIn a capital where politicians have made an art form of the nondenial denial, press secretaries typically reserve their on-the-record denials for reports that are outright false. Candidates can weather most embarrassing stories, and spokespeople know that getting caught in a lie only makes things worse.It was a lie about an affair, after all, that led to President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment \u2014 though his most fateful move was testifying falsely under oath \u2014 just as it was a lie about infidelity that ended the political career of John Edwards, once a rising Democratic star (a story that broke in The Enquirer, coincidentally).Mr. Trump ignored shouted questions from reporters on Wednesday in the Rose Garden of the White House about the recording. A representative for Ms. Hicks declined to elaborate or explain her November comment, and asked to explain his denial from last week, Mr. Giuliani maintained that his client was not heard on the tape doing anything wrong. He did not explain why he characterized it as \u201cexculpatory.\u201dThe tape that surfaced Tuesday concerned the former model, Karen McDougal, who says she began a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump in 2006. Shortly before the 2016 presidential election, she sold her story for $150,000 to The Enquirer. But the tabloid, which was supportive of Mr. Trump, sat on the story, a practice known as catch and kill. It effectively silenced Ms. McDougal for the remainder of the campaign.The recording is potentially significant because it places Ms. McDougal in the context of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen talk polling, surrogates, fending off journalists, and, finally, whether to buy Ms. McDougal\u2019s rights from A.M.I.The recording was among 12 handed over to prosecutors from a trove of Mr. Cohen\u2019s material that F.B.I. agents seized in April.In the recording about American Media and the McDougal deal, Mr. Trump does not appear surprised to hear about the arrangement. Mr. Cohen describes the agreement with \u201cour friend David,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s chief executive, David J. Pecker.The tape also shows how enmeshed the Trump Organization had become in politics and the effort to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s image. Mr. Cohen can be heard telling Mr. Trump that he had consulted with the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, \u201cwhen it comes time for the financing\u201d of the payments to the Enquirer\u2019s parent company.\u201cWait a sec, what financing?\u201d Mr. Trump is heard saying.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to pay him something,\u201d Mr. Cohen then says.Like the deal involving Ms. McDougal, statements from Mr. Trump and his representatives about Ms. Clifford fell apart under legal scrutiny, in that case as part of the suit Ms. Clifford filed to have her agreement \u2014 drafted by Mr. Cohen directly \u2014 nullified.When the recording of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussing the A.M.I. deal with Ms. McDougal surfaced last week, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers drafted a transcript and circulated it to reporters. In their version, Mr. Trump told Mr. Cohen \u201cdon\u2019t pay with cash\u201d and then says, \u201ccheck.\u201dThe transcript, however, is based on widely circulated audio easily accessible with the click of a mouse, as Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal team noted on Wednesday. Mr. Trump\u2019s team manufactured a dialogue to make it more favorable for their client. \u201cThey have been getting away with saying that a lie is the truth and don\u2019t believe the media,\u201d said Mr. Davis, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer. \u201cBut they walked into a trap here because a tape is a tape. It\u2019s a fact. If you\u2019re for Donald Trump, don\u2019t believe me. I\u2019m a Democrat. Believe your own ears.\u201dRepeated screenings of the tape do not clearly reveal Mr. Trump saying the words \u201cdon\u2019t pay with,\u201d an omission that would entirely change the meaning of his comment. That creates a chasm between what is heard on the tape, and what Mr. Trump\u2019s aides say is heard on the tape.Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Gritty Club at the Heart of \u2018This Ain\u2019t No Disco\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a scorching July day, Peter Yanowitz peered through the entrance of 77 White Street in Manhattan, as if looking for ghosts.Those things hold such deep fascination for Mr. Yanowitz that he and his writing partner Stephen Trask have spent the last eight years developing a new rock opera set in the New York club scene of 1979. Titled \u201cThis Ain\u2019t No Disco,\u201d after the Talking Heads lyrics that name-checks the Mudd Club, the musical toggles between that downtown punk-rock dive and the chic Midtown club it\u2019s often contrasted with, Studio 54.Mr. Yanowitz, 50, and Mr. Trask, 51, were too young to take part in that scene. Still, Mr. Trask said, \u201cThe fantasies of it were formative for me.\u201dThe music takes influence from new wave and disco, as well as Paul McCartney and Benjamin Britten. Both Steve Rubell, a co-owner of Studio 54, and Steve Mass, the owner of the Mudd Club, are depicted, but the second act focuses on the downtown outpost, approximating its most avant-garde sounds. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure nothing like that has been presented in a rock musical before,\u201d Mr. Trask said.Still, the play is hard-pressed to beat the creativity and grittiness of the Mudd Club itself. Howie Pyro, of the band D Generation, said it was \u201clike a Velvet Underground song come to life,\u201d while Johnny Dynell, a key D.J. at the club, described it as \u201cCaligula\u2019s lair.\u201dInspired by the 1963 experimental film \u201cFlaming Creatures,\u201d Mr. Mass had originally wanted to create an underground film studio in the space, in the then-desolate area of TriBeCa. The club was meant to finance this dream. But \u201cno landlord would rent you space if you said you wanted to open a rock club,\u201d Mr. Mass said. \u201cSo, I lied and said I was going to open a really cute Parisian cafe.\u201dHis day job \u2014 running an ambulance service \u2014 provided the funds to rent the space for $500 a month from the artist Ross Bleckner and his father, who owned the building. After attending shows at the punk epicenters CBGB and Max\u2019s, Mr. Mass found himself thinking, \u201cWho needs all these bands? They\u2019re just a distraction from the audience, which is just as interesting.\u201dFor his club, he focused on the crowd, despite the many artists who performed there. From Studio 54, which had opened 18 months earlier, he swiped the idea of an exclusive door policy, a heretical idea within the egalitarian world of punk. \u201cIt enraged people, which generated more interest in the place,\u201d Mr. Mass said.Instead of a velvet rope, the club employed an S-and-M chain. And, in a highly attention-getting stunt, Mr. Mass claimed he was going to exclude celebrities. Excluded, in fact, was anyone who asked, \u201cHow long do I have to wait?\u201d Also denied were large groups of rowdy straight men, and, according to Mr. Boch, Paul Simon, \u201cbecause he said the worst thing you could possibly say, which is, \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019\u201dTo keep things spontaneous, Mr. Mass came up with perverse new door policies. \u201cOne night he said, \u2018No one gets in with a leather jacket,\u201d Mr. Boch said. \u201cOf course, everyone on line was wearing one.\u201d\u201cThe place was instantly fun and different,\u201d said Fred Schneider of the B-52\u2019s. \u201cThe Mudd Club had a darker edge than any other disco.\u201dD. J.s broke the mold by offering an unusually catholic mix of music, from vintage soul to surf rock. Mr. Dynell said that Mr. Mass instructed him to mess with expectations by tossing in a recording by Alvin and the Chipmunks or spinning a record mutilated with a scissor.The bands who appeared, like the Bush Tetras and ESG, advanced new trends in askew punk-funk. The club even hosted a series showcasing new minimalist composers from the classical world. \u201cThe music, and the tone of the club, went way beyond the clich\u00e9 of a scowling punk disco,\u201d said Tim Lawrence, the author of the book \u201cLove and Death on the New York Dance Floor.\u201dMudd wasn\u2019t the first \u201cpunk-disco\u201d in New York to reintroduce rock fans to dancing. Hurrah, on West 62nd Street, beat it by six months. But that space was slick while the Mudd Club was proudly sleazy; and Hurrah was centered on the bands who performed.\u201cMudd was more about a social gathering,\u201d said Richard Barone, whose band the Bongos played some of their earliest shows there. \u201cIt was a place for artists and designers and musicians to merge and trade ideas.\u201dAnd it pioneered gender neutral bathrooms, though Mr. Barone said, \u201cyou\u2019d do your best never to go into them.\u201dA place of transgressive mirth, Mudd reflected the whims of Mr. Mass and his creative partners, the art curator Diego Cortez and the downtown fixture Anya Phillips. They dreamed up increasingly daft theme nights, like \u201cThe Joan Crawford Mother\u2019s Day Celebration,\u201d an instillation that included an actress handcuffed to a chair; and \u201cThe Puberty Ball,\u201d headlined by the teenage band the Blessed.\u201cWe got to take drugs and go home with other underage people and nobody cared,\u201d said Mr. Pyro, who, at 17, was the oldest member of that band at the time.The most elaborate theme night was \u201cThe Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Funeral Ball.\u201d The club took over White Street to create an immersive funeral procession, complete with coffins holding artists who played the corpses of dead rock stars, including Janis Joplin and Sid Vicious. Mr. Mass also littered the club with syringes he got from his earlier ambulance business.\u201cWe fed on the idea of making mothers\u2019 hair turn gray,\u201d he admitted.Beneath the whimsy, serious connections were being made among designers like Anna Sui and Jasper Conran and artists, including Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, whose works decorated the building\u2019s upper floor. And Mudd brought the Bronx hip-hop scene downtown when Fred Brathwaite, a.k.a. Fab 5 Freddy, co-curated a graffiti-related art show there in 1981, titled \u201cBeyond Worlds.\u201dThe particular mix of art, music, fashion, dancing and drugging at Mudd presaged clubs like Area, Danceteria and the Palladium. Mr. Mass closed Mudd in 1983 because of the competition. \u201cWhen people saw that an idiot like me had such success,\u201d he said, \u201cthey flooded the market with new clubs.\u201dToday, as his musical prepares to open, Mr. Yanowitz views Mudd\u2019s era as \u201cthe last moment before the total corporatization of New York started to happen.\u201dAs moneyed as the current city might be, Mr. Trask sees parallels between then and now.\u201cWe\u2019re in a moment of humongous political change just as people were when they were entering the Reagan era,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went from Studio 54 and the Mudd Club into AIDS.\u201d\u201cOnce again,\u201d he added, \u201cthings don\u2019t seem at all good and nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tech Guru Captivated Canada. Then He Fled to China.", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Sun Yian was living the Canadian dream.The Chinese immigrant found fortune harnessing Canadian talent to develop cutting-edge technology, everything from semiconductors to facial recognition, to take back to China. His company grew to more than 1,500 employees across China and North America, and was lauded by Canadian officials as a model for unlocking the Chinese market to create homegrown prosperity.Then Mr. Sun stopped paying his Canadian workers and fled to China. Left behind are lawsuits from angry investors and Canadian employees who are wondering whether their work could be used to help China\u2019s growing domestic surveillance state.Canada has long benefited from close business ties to China, and lawmakers have courted the country as a new market for Canadian companies as well as a source of investment. Now, Mr. Sun\u2019s story is fueling calls for heightened skepticism of Chinese money.\u201cCanadian officials have to some degree been blinded by China\u2019s incredible economic growth and waves of capital spreading worldwide,\u201d said Michael Byers, a professor of global politics and international law at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly na\u00efve to China\u2019s approach to acquiring high tech from other countries, and they haven\u2019t pushed hard on getting answers before allowing deals to go through.\u201dMr. Sun\u2019s company, Istuary Innovation Group, initially appeared to represent the positives of Chinese investment. His company brought jobs and high-tech business to Vancouver. But a review of the company\u2019s finances and interviews with former employees reveal a murky web of financial and previously undisclosed ties to the Chinese government.Mr. Sun, 45, who goes by the name Ethan, founded Istuary in 2013 in a Vancouver Starbucks, just as the Canadian government was welcoming greater Chinese investment. At its peak, the technology incubator and venture fund occupied two floors of a downtown Vancouver office building, where engineers toiled on semiconductors, robotics, big data analytics and facial recognition. By 2017, Istuary had 24 offices in places around the world, including Beijing, Shanghai, Los Angeles and Toronto.Yet some of Istuary\u2019s work provoked concern among employees.Eric Hsu, 39, an American data scientist hired by Istuary\u2019s Vancouver office in 2016, said he worked on artificial intelligence capable of recognizing a person\u2019s face across multiple surveillance feeds or detecting specific human behavior, like fighting. \u201cA lot of these security applications were both humanitarian and ethically troubling,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cChinese clients had lots of ideas for ways they would use our applications. Some of those raised red flags.\u201dAn Istuary customer presentation reviewed by The New York Times highlighted the services its technology could offer in Chinese cities. They included the ability to recognize faces through security cameras and run them through databases, as well as track people\u2019s personal relationships. It also highlighted other services, like tracking crowds and land records.Mr. Sun enjoyed ties to the Chinese government that his Canadian workers and investors say he did not disclose.Kuang\u2019en Network Technologies, a cybersecurity company he founded in Beijing in 2014, specialized in industrial control systems for some of China\u2019s biggest state-owned enterprises.According to corporate documents and Mr. Sun\u2019s employees in China, Istuary and Kuang\u2019en shared funding, workers, technology, office space and shareholders, including Mr. Sun\u2019s wife, Hu Yulan.Former Istuary employees in Vancouver said the company\u2019s collapse began last spring with a series of missed payrolls and final paychecks in May 2017. Many stayed at their jobs anyway.\u201cSun kept giving us false hopes,\u201d said Manivannan Gajendran, who led an Istuary quality testing team in Vancouver. He said he took out a $15,000 line of credit to cover his daily expenses while he waited for money that never came.By then, Mr. Sun had gone back to China. In August, Istuary investors in British Columbia sued Mr. Sun and his wife, accusing the couple of illegally using funds to purchase two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver.A British Columbia provincial employment department has since ordered Istuary to pay around $2.2 million in unpaid wages to more than 150 employees and has begun collection proceedings in order to seize Mr. Sun\u2019s residential properties, a spokeswoman from the province\u2019s labor ministry said in an email.In December, Istuary and Kuang\u2019en\u2019s offices began closing across China, without employees being paid for months of work. \u201cThese people never got any of their salaries,\u201d Ms. Fan said.Just before Christmas, former employees said, two people from a Chinese technology firm that had invested in Kuang\u2019en camped out in the Beijing office, hoping to catch Mr. Sun. A few weeks later, debt collectors locked the doors with a heavy chain. On a recent visit to the shuttered office, trash covered a rickety cot and chairs visible in the entryway.Someone had scrawled a large handwritten message across the glass doors: \u201cThe fraudster network fakes bankruptcy, maliciously owes salaries and cons its employees.\u201dUnderneath was an ultimatum: \u201cPay us the money and we\u2019ll unlock the place.\u201dJuecheng Zhao contributed research from Beijing, and Cao Li from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pruitt\u2019s Resignation Is Just the Beginning", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Eisen is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, where\u00a0Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s near-complete disregard for taxpayers\u2019 trust made for a great deal of work not only for the many government investigators probing his behavior, but also for journalists and government watchdogs. Our group alone filed 20 legal matters, including litigation focusing on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s and the E.P.A.\u2019s failure to produce documents about his actions \u2014 or even to create them. There are too many reported instances in which agency employees were instructed not to document meetings or often avoided the creation of certain documents \u2014 a brazen dodge of the laws requiring both preservation and production of such materials so the people know what our government is doing, and why.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s departure may be reason for celebration, but the mess that he created is substantial. He has turned the agency into an ethics and regulatory Superfund site that will take years to clean up. Thanks largely to him, the ethics system at the E.P.A. is broken and in need of repair. Why did no one with authority in the agency step in to stop him, or support whistle-blowers who tried to speak the truth? The involvement of political appointees in this process, and the apparent fear of retaliation instilled in officials across the agency, suggest to us that the current system is unable to ensure that federal ethics standards are upheld. Nor are all the investigations into Mr. Pruitt likely to vanish just because he has resigned; if his use of public office for private gain has caught the eye of federal prosecutors, there may be more coming.And all that is before one gets to the alleged violations of law represented by the environmental policies Mr. Pruitt pushed through, also mired in the courts. That litigation is ongoing, and may be for years.The trust of the E.P.A.\u2019s 14,000 dedicated, ethical federal career workers will also need to be repaired. Regaining the confidence of these employees, and that of the public in them, will be a tall order.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s most recent clients before entering the administration included Energy Fuels Resources Inc., Xcel Energy and Bear Head LNG Corporation \u2014 all of which have interests before the E.P.A. According to his executive branch financial disclosure form, Mr. Wheeler also worked as a strategic adviser for Growth Energy, General Mills, Archer Daniels Midland and International Paper. Even if he proves to be a more ethical administrator, his ties to industries with a stake in the E.P.A.\u2019s decisions run just as deep as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s did \u2014 and so do his conflicts of interest.Given the extent of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s scandals and the damage he leaves behind, it is a wonder that he survived so long. Some may point to the fact that he doggedly pursued Mr. Trump\u2019s environmental agenda, including the shredding of Obama-era commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions in the power and transportation sectors, but we are not convinced \u2014 after all, that effort didn\u2019t work out as well as he had hoped.A more likely explanation is that Mr. Trump did not want to let Mr. Pruitt go because the president was afraid of what it might mean for him. Mr. Trump too has endured in the face of mounting investigations and litigation. Between the Russia investigation, Michael Cohen\u2019s potentially impending cooperation with the government, and a raft of civil cases, Mr. Trump surely knows that the legal flood around him is rising. Did he put off firing Mr. Pruitt because he was afraid to admit the taint of scandal on his administration?Mr. Pruitt\u2019s case demonstrates that in America, no one is above the law and common decency. Even if it\u2019s possible to hold off the flood after the cracks in the dam begin to appear, at some point the dam eventually breaks.Norman L. Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, where Noah Bookbinder, a former federal corruption prosecutor, is the executive director.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why NATO Matters", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe allies are looking with dread to this week\u2019s summit as President Trump continues his campaign to undermine a decades-old partnership.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Born after World War II, NATO linked America and Europe not just in a mutual defense pledge but in advancing democratic governance, the rule of law, civil and human rights, and an increasingly open international economy. The alliance was the core of an American-led liberal world order that extended to Asia and relied on a web of international institutions, including the United Nations and the World Bank. American military protection gave the allies space to develop their economies and pluralistic societies. Despite compromises and occasional failures, the experiment was broadly successful. Yet NATO is being weakened from within \u2014 by members\u2019 failure to spend enough on defense; by the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism, especially in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; and perhaps most of all, by President Trump, who seems to prefer President Vladimir Putin of Russia to America\u2019s European allies.NATO has always depended on leadership from the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy and most lethal military power. Mr. Trump not only doesn\u2019t want to lead the West, he has denigrated the alliance, bullied its leaders and accused NATO and the European Union of exploiting American largess. \u201cWe\u2019re the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019ll see NATO and I\u2019ll tell NATO, \u2018You\u2019ve got to start paying your bills.\u2019\u201dBut NATO is not a golf club, and money, the only thing Mr. Trump prizes, is just one, narrow measure of the costs and benefits of belonging. This president has shown no understanding of the power of partnership, and the reciprocal nature of its bonds, in an alliance that stands for something far bigger than paying your dues on time. Mr. Trump is burning up all the credit the United States has accrued with our allies across decades by attacking the basis of this alliance, if not the very idea of any alliance \u2014 thus, deliberately or not, doing the bidding of Mr. Putin in his quest to divide the West. \u201cNATO can withstand four years under Trump,\u201d one former NATO ambassador said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll withstand eight.\u201d Given the legacy of Republican support for national security and democratic allies, one might expect that Republican congressional leaders would speak up. But, cowering before Mr. Trump, they have been virtually silent as he has undermined America\u2019s alliances.Sooner rather than later, NATO is also going to have to decide what to do with Turkey and the other countries that are eroding the fabric of the alliance by repudiating democratic principles.At this week\u2019s gathering, the result that matters most is a firm and convincing commitment to a strong NATO, ready to contribute to stability today, and to adapt to future challenges. With no coherent vision of his own to make Americans, and democracy generally, more secure in a world without NATO, Mr. Trump would do well to make that commitment, and honor the friends we have.

{"Headline": "What the Russia Hack Indictments Reveal About Bitcoin", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Werbach is the author of a forthcoming book about blockchain and digital currency.Yet what makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to criminals also limits their usefulness to them. Bitcoin transaction records helped investigators find the Russian agents under indictment. To cover their tracks, the perpetrators of the hacking scheme would have been better off using briefcases full of cash.The details of this case are an encouraging sign. Cryptocurrencies are part of a global experiment in making money \u2014 the secure exchange of value \u2014 as decentralized as information on the internet. Just as anyone can put up a blog without going through traditional media, cryptocurrencies can remove control from financial intermediaries.And like the internet, cryptocurrencies are not inherently a force for lawlessness. Nor is their legitimacy guaranteed. Governments and the private sector must make existing gateways between cryptocurrency and the traditional financial world, such as Bitcoin exchanges, more transparent. And they must adopt mechanisms to limit illegal activity, fraud and regulatory evasion, while preserving the freedom to innovate.Cryptocurrencies make transactions trustworthy without relying on private intermediaries or central banks. Banks know your public identity, but they keep transaction specifics secret. Bitcoin does the opposite. Identities are represented with private, seemingly arbitrary strings of letters and numbers known as cryptographic keys. Transactions, however, are public. Anyone can see how the money flows. That\u2019s necessary for Bitcoin\u2019s security model, which relies on a public network of computers collectively validating transactions.The problem for criminals is that it\u2019s possible to reconstruct Bitcoin identities from transaction patterns. The currency moves through gateways, exchanges and wallet systems, which makes it easier for people to acquire, store and use cryptocurrency in a world that still speaks dollars and euros. However, these systems are usually centralized, so they can be traced, and their administrators can be asked to cooperate with law enforcement. That is likely what happened in the Russian hacking case.There are ways to make cryptocurrency activity harder for law enforcement to track. But hiding transactions adds cost and complexity. More important, decentralized cryptocurrency networks still require trust in the software developers, transaction validators and other support organizations that work with them. These partners have to be responsible if they want to support large markets.To be sure, there is still substantial illegal activity involving cryptocurrencies. Much of it, though, involves thefts and swindles from legitimate cryptocurrency users. Unless law enforcement and regulation weed out these bad actors, cryptocurrencies will not become mainstream.The miracle of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they can create trustworthy transactions in the absence of financial institutions and processes that the world has relied on for centuries. Bitcoin took hold, in part, because the 2008 financial crisis shook so many people\u2019s faith in the status quo. Trust, however, is a fickle thing. Both cryptocurrency proponents and governments must sustain it to create a viable environment for the money of the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $20 Billion Question for Guyana", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "This largely underdeveloped country on South America\u2019s northern Atlantic coast is the unlikely setting for the world\u2019s next big oil boom. But is it ready to handle the riches?Supported byGEORGETOWN, Guyana \u2014 Guyana is a vast, watery wilderness with only three paved highways. There are a few dirt roads between villages that sit on stilts along rivers snaking through the rain forest. Children in remote areas go to school in dugout canoes, and play naked in the muggy heat. Hugging the coast are musty clapboard towns like Georgetown, the capital, which seems forgotten by time, honeycombed with canals first built by Dutch settlers and African slaves. The power grid is so unreliable that blackouts are a regular plague in the cities, while in much of the countryside there is no electricity at all.If all goes well, one of the poorest countries in South America could become one of the wealthiest. Suddenly the talk of Georgetown is a proposed sovereign wealth fund to manage all the money, as if this were a Persian Gulf sheikhdom.But there are obstacles. If history is any guide, countries that discover oil often waste their opportunity, as the resource blends seamlessly with corruption. Countries with weak political institutions like Guyana are especially vulnerable.\u201cYou have an alignment of money and power in the hands of the state, so the party in power controls the resources,\u201d said Floyd Haynes, a Guyanese-born finance professor who is a consultant to Business Ministry. \u201cAnd the money is usually squandered, misapplied or downright stolen.\u2019\u2019Senior government officials here have little experience regulating a big oil industry or negotiating with international companies. The civil service is corrupt, and the private sector is slow to innovate, businessmen and aides to senior officials acknowledge.Still, there is cautious optimism. \u201cWe see this oil discovery as almost like providence,\u201d said Raphael Trotman, the natural resources minister. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given a second chance to get things right.\u201dThe first chance was independence from Britain in 1966, and that chance was blown. A plague of ethnic tribal politics has produced a fragile state with an economy propelled by drug trafficking, money-laundering, and gold and diamond smuggling. A vast majority of college-educated youths emigrate to the United States or Canada, while those who stay behind experience high rates of H.I.V. infection, crime and suicide.\u201cThe challenges are enormous and shouldn\u2019t be underestimated,\u201d said Lars Mangal, president of Totaltec Oilfield Services, a Guyanese company seeking to train local workers in safety and basic oil operations. \u201cWe have to overcome nepotism, entitlements, corruption, cynicism and skepticism.\u201d\u201cWhen we have big projects, we hire foreign companies who bring their own workers,\u201d said Khemraj Dhaneshrie, a young chemist at the Leonora estate sugar mill. Mr. Dhaneshrie is typically skeptical about his government\u2019s ability to oversee foreign operations after Guyana\u2019s long experience of opportunistic Chinese investment. He noted that the Chinese financed and built an enormous factory in 2009 to rescue the sugar industry, but it turned out to be a $181 million boondoggle. Colorful Hindu monuments tower over Guyana\u2019s rice fields, a reminder of the cultural distance between the country and its Latin American neighbors. It is English speaking because of the legacy of British rule, and its two biggest ethnic groups are Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese \u2014 the descendants of slaves from Africa and of indentured servants brought from the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.Over the last 37 years working for ExxonMobil, Mr. McGehee has taken his black cowboy boots, silver belt buckle and Texas A&M class ring into the oil fields of Angola, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea. In all those places, oil wealth has risen to the top, only to leave the poor behind. Last year, for example, a Paris criminal court convicted the vice president of Equatorial Guinea of money-laundering and embezzling more than $100 million.But as Mr. McGehee monitored operations aboard the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship on a recent day, he insisted that Guyana could be different. \u201cIf the government manages the resource right, every Guyanese should benefit with better schools, better health facilities, better roads,\u201d Mr. McGehee said.That is no small \u201cif.\u201d Guyanese need look no further than neighboring Venezuela to see a failed state where the world\u2019s largest oil reserves have not prevented hunger, shortages of medicine and hyperinflation from producing widespread misery. Nearby Trinidad and Tobago offers another example of how countries dependent on oil can neglect traditional industries and then suffer severe economic shocks when crude and natural gas prices fall. Others warn of the \u201cDutch disease,\u201d a phenomenon so labeled in the 1970s after a natural gas boom sapped the strength of manufacturing in the Netherlands. Nations that contract the disease from a sudden influx of mineral money typically suffer a surge of inflation, while labor from farming and other traditional professions is drawn to the higher-paying oil sector. Thus, wealth becomes more concentrated.But dispiriting examples of wasted opportunity abound. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about the negatives,\u201d Prime Minister Moses V. Nagamootoo said.But she also sees risks in these new ventures. More affluent Guyanese may turn away from the sports uniforms she already makes to buy name brands like Nike and Adidas, she said, and she is concerned that food prices will rise.\u201cCheck out the Trinidad economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought oil was the best thing since sliced bread, and they spent Sunday to Sunday. They stopped producing and imported everything with oil money. It could happen here.\u201dBefore the recent breakthrough, various oil companies had drilled more than 40 wells off Guyana and neighboring Suriname since the 1960s. All were dry holes or otherwise not economically promising. But as oil prices rose a few years ago, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell decided to take another look. (Shell eventually dropped out of the partnership.)Exxon\u2019s top geoscientist on the scene was Kerry Moreland, an Oklahoman whose family has been in oil for three generations. Ms. Moreland toyed with becoming a professional bowler and had interned as a tornado chaser for a Tulsa television station before going to work for Exxon and traveling the world in search of new fields. She pinpointed on the map where the first deepwater well, named Liza-1, should be drilled.Recalling the day three years ago when she decided to duck out of some business meetings in Georgetown to visit the drilling platform, she said there was no more than a 20 percent chance that a meaningful amount of oil would burst out from three miles below the ocean bottom. As luck would have it, just as her helicopter landed on the platform, the drill bit penetrated the oil reservoir. She went to the control room as the first data from the wells showed promising signs of hydrocarbons. When rock fragments came to the surface a few hours later, they were dripping with oil.There\u2019s a lot at stake for Exxon in Guyana.Darren Woods, the company\u2019s chief executive, has a plan to reverse company fortunes, and Guyana is a big part of it.Leading a consortium that includes Hess and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Exxon is making an effort here that is nothing if not ambitious. Within three years of its big first discovery, it has begun drilling the first of 17 wells that will start yielding oil in 2020, with a floating production, storage and offloading vessel able to handle 120,000 barrels a day. And that is just the first phase.Another floating vessel, with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day, is planned, and a third vessel is being considered. In all, 500,000 barrels a day could be produced by sometime in the next decade \u2014 the equivalent of Ecuador\u2019s national output. (Repsol of Spain, Tullow Oil of Britain and other companies are exploring, too.)That produces nothing but excitement for the 60 Guyanese workers on the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship, who have typically seen their incomes soar.Gorshum Inniss, a 25-year-old roustabout with an easy smile and flashing dark eyes, is working on a crane crew lifting casing pipe for new wells, doubling what he earned working on a tugboat. He said he now had enough money to visit his parents and younger brother in New York and planned to build a house for him and his daughter.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of the pioneers in this big moment for Guyana,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Guyana as the new Middle East.\u201dNot far from the turbulent Venezuelan border, there is a quiet stretch of coastline, pounded by surf, known as Shell Beach because its sand is made of tiny crushed seashells that make it feel like sawdust. Several endangered species of turtles come to nest at night. Once hunted for food, they are jealously guarded from poachers by residents who make a living fishing and selling coconuts.Audley James, a former turtle hunter who makes necklaces out of beads and coconut shells, remembers when Trinidadian environmental consultants representing Repsol came six years ago to give two days of spill-response training.The Trinidadians taught the residents how to lay temporary floating barriers to protect the beach from an oil spill, and gave them training certificates that look like diplomas. But there has been no further training that might prepare them for what is now a much less theoretical hazard. \u201cPlenty of us don\u2019t understand what is going on,\u201d Mr. James said.Environmentalists are worried that oil will forestall development of renewable energy and that the government and oil companies are not fully prepared to prevent a possible spill.\u201cIt\u2019s two years before first oil, and we don\u2019t have a national oil spill contingency plan,\u201d said Annette Arjoon-Martins, president of the Guyana Marine Conservation Society. \u201cWe have our hands in the mouth of a jaguar.\u201dMs. Arjoon-Martins said the government\u2019s agreement with Exxon did not specify in enough detail the company\u2019s responsibilities in case of a spill. Government officials disagreed, saying the country\u2019s laws would hold the company fully liable.Exxon executives say the company is doing everything possible to minimize the dangers of a spill disaster. The company has skimmers and oil booms on hand to collect errant oil, and it has applied to the government to use chemical dispersants in an emergency to break up any spilled oil. They say Guyana is close enough to the Gulf of Mexico to bring in plenty of help in an emergency.Local oil executives say one obstacle to overcome is a lackadaisical attitude toward safety among Guyanese workers, who frequently arrive at their construction and wharf jobs in flip-flops and sometimes use their hard hats as soup bowls. That is something Exxon and other companies are working to change with courses and other training that teach workers to be careful, not only for their own safety but also to safeguard the fragile marine environment. \u201cUse your heads before you use your hands,\u201d he told the room full of Guyanese and American workers. He got an ovation and smiled proudly.To visit the most senior oil regulator in Georgetown, one needs to climb an exterior staircase of warped wood that could sorely use a fresh coat of paint.Mr. Dennison has a computer by his desk, from which he could consult data gathered by Exxon drill ships, though he said he had yet to do so. \u201cWe\u2019re in transition,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge.\u2019\u2019There are a few signs of progress. \u201cI see a lot of red flags,\u201d said Mr. Mangal, who shuttles between Guyana and his home in Houston. \u201cWe cannot allow the Guyanese industry to be built around this shabby foundation of corruption.\u201dThere are other signs of trouble.Foreign development bank advisers have told the government that legislation to create a sovereign wealth fund to invest the royalties and taxes coming to the government lacks sufficient regulatory controls to avert corruption. The legislation is now in limbo. Mr. Granger\u2019s energy department has not gotten off the ground, and a bill to set up the petroleum commission is stuck in the National Assembly.That leaves Mr. Dennison and his commission in charge of regulation. He said he and everyone in the government felt pressure to get things right. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Arles Festival, 7 Promising Photographers to Watch", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtists from China, France, Poland, Switzerland and Turkey talk about the work they are exhibiting at the influential show in France.ARLES, France \u2014 How far should technology help augment the human body? Can photography be reinvented in the digital age? How does it feel to explore a neighboring country that has toppled into a state of war, or to document counterculture in an authoritarian regime?These are edited excerpts from conversations in which the artists explain their work.Some of these scenes are quite harsh and include people with disabilities or mutilations. But I always treat them with respect. With my subjects, I feel I am in a form of wordless communication.I always have my camera with me. Somehow these little scenes naturally come my way, as if some higher spirit had granted me an eye for things, as well as the gift of luck. I am very lucky in my adventures.Transhumanists believe the body we consider healthy is already diseased and technology is the completion of humankind. But where do therapeutics end and body enhancement begin? I don\u2019t have the answers.To me, an iPhone is the perfect transhumanist prosthesis: It induces a fusional relationship and dependency as a substitute for human abilities \u2014 our memory, our sense of orientation, for instance.I call myself a philosophical documentary photographer. I love the investigative part of the work, then I decide which images I need, like for a giant puzzle.Balconies are a succession of layers. They perfectly match my manner of working, layer after layer. My work explores the frictional encounter of two opposites: digital image making, which can be endlessly fine-tuned; and the mysteries of the darkroom, which are sensual and beyond my control. I like pushing the boundaries of photography. Nowadays, as digital takes over, many artists are returning to analog photography. It echoes what happened when photography took over painting\u2019s role as a faithful recorder of reality. Painting literally took off in new directions. When one medium is replaced by another, it is set free and things start to happen.Ceausescu ordered the old part of Bucharest demolished. After my grandfather heard his house would be bulldozed, he had a stroke and died. Seven churches were placed on train tracks and dragged behind housing blocks. A synagogue was hidden behind new buildings. One church was towed 200 meters behind what are the secret-police headquarters. Another was moved twice. One was pulled just 14 meters aside. The churches were sliced up but the crypt remained underground. An atheist state was financing the rescue of religious buildings. Inside one church, I found a fresco gloriously depicting Ion Antonescu, an ally of Hitler; in the synagogue, an exhibition documents his crimes. I grew up in eastern Poland and spent holidays in Ukraine. The war was a big shock. Sometimes you live in a country where something happens that changes your life.I went there to meet volunteer fighters about my age, asked them how it felt and shot portraits. I also went to the front line. \u201cSparks\u201d is what the civilians there call shrapnel. In this war, there are trenches and mobile phones. Yurko gave me a picture of his squadron, explaining \u201cthis one died, this one lost his legs, this one a hand, this one his mind.\u201d I covered the deceased with gold, used for heroes and symbolic in Eastern Europe.I shot a video of my teenage brother stringing a bow and projected it over a photograph showing a gilded shape on a patch of grass. It is called \u201cBody.\u201dUrfa, the conservative hometown where I was born, became very rich after a dam was built on the Euphrates River. On the other side of the border, however, in Syria and in Iraq, the dam caused a huge drought. I have explored Istanbul\u2019s underground for a while and found out about dog fights. They are illegal and organized at night. I spent six months in jail for photographing the war in Kurdish cities and might still be sentenced to 22 years. My work is considered \u201copposition\u201d and could not be shown in Turkey.Artists in Turkey express themselves without taking risks, away from the street, the truth and society; I believe this goes against the true purpose of art. The issues I\u2019m dealing with are those facing us throughout the world. We will all need to deal with them sooner or later.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Back Against the War on Homeless Shelters", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityEarly this year, the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services announced that it was opening a men\u2019s shelter on a stretch of West 58th Street adjacent to some of the most expensive real estate in the world. A social service agency had acquired the lease to a building, formerly the Park Savoy Hotel, and had won the contract from the city to operate it as a facility for 150 men who were working or actively looking for employment.There would be job-training services on site and plenty of security, but this did little to appease the people living nearby, who envisioned their world erupting into chaos and formed the West 58th Street Coalition to resist the perceived onslaught.That the broader social order had unraveled long before, once the surrounding corridors of Midtown were given over to towers with $40 million apartments, many sitting empty, wasn\u2019t necessarily obvious to people who seemed less terrified of the dark-money billionaires living around the corner than of the coming janitors and fast-food workers locked out of New York\u2019s forbidding rental market.Since Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan last year to put 90 new shelters in neighborhoods across the city rather than aggravate the problems of concentrated poverty that already exist and, in many cases allow homeless men and women to live closer to the places they are from, it has been easier to track Nimby-ism\u2019s progress as a legitimized form of racial prejudice, as a means by which liberals can express their repressed discomforts.When she arrived, she had the agency produce a major advertising campaign showing the homeless as they really are \u2014 for the most part, working parents marginalized in an evermore Darwinian economic system. And yet biases even against poor mothers with infants are not easy to overcome.A while back there was a lot of opposition, for instance, to a proposal for a family shelter in Astoria, Queens, where real-estate interest has been furious in recent years. When the shelter was finally developed, property values continued to go up and crime continued to plummet, precisely the reverse of what some people in the neighborhood had feared. Anticipating the same line of complaint in another community where she had planned a shelter, a year ago Ms. Quinn commissioned an analysis of the Astoria project to bring to the people who lived in the new neighborhood to ratchet down anxiety.\u201cIs something like this going to erase peoples\u2019 fears entirely? No, but it is going to bring a calming moment,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe key to any of these settings is not to expect a lot of support but to get to a point of comfortable neutrality.\u201dWin is currently building a shelter in Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Ms. Quinn has been talking with residents there for two years in an effort to get to that place of neutrality. When residents worried that a bakery next door would be demolished, she set about to save the bakery. In previous eras, during the Koch and Giuliani administrations, there was no back and forth, no negotiations about cake; you found out about a shelter next to your apartment building when it opened.How much neutrality can exist in neighborhoods like the one surrounding the proposed West 58th Street shelter? This month, residents filed a lawsuit against the city claiming that the building in which the shelter is planned does not meet fire safety standards and has other problems pertaining to its construction that make it unsuitable: it will endanger the people who live there, the argument now goes. Of course, the building is still in the process of being rehabilitated \u2014 it is scheduled to open later in the summer \u2014 so saying that it is unsuitable is like walking into a kitchen in the middle of a renovation when the range hasn\u2019t yet arrived and getting alarmed that you can\u2019t cook dinner.The filing of the lawsuit follows a familiar pattern. First, residents will protest a shelter because they don\u2019t like it, and then, realizing the negative optics, they switch the debate to worries over building infrastructure, environmental strain and so on. \u201cOften concerns initially expressed around people become concerns around traffic,\u201d as Ms. Quinn put it.When I heard about the lawsuit against the shelter on West 58th Street, I assumed that it was being financed by Extell, the developer of One57, the premier address on Billionaire\u2019s Row. Instead, according to the lawyer representing the West 58th Street Coalition, Extell hasn\u2019t provided any money at all. The group has instead received donations from 150 individuals and businesses.Advertisement"}

He has recently begun buying some television ads in New York City \u2014 a luxury that Ms. Nixon may have to do without for now.The latest fund-raising figures were due to be filed with the state Board of Elections on Monday. The campaigns released selective summaries of those figures.Marc Molinaro, the Republican candidate, announced raising $1.1 million with $887,000 cash on hand.Ms. Nixon has made Mr. Cuomo\u2019s reliance on big donors a centerpiece of her campaign, and her team pointed out that, in contrast, almost 97 percent of her donations were less than $200.Mr. Cuomo has proved one of the most aggressive fund-raisers in the country, with top givers asked to give as much as $25,000 or $50,000 to attend a private dinner at the St. Regis or an evening of Broadway entertainment.Mr. Cuomo has said he was speaking to federal authorities about how to proceed.\u201cFederal prosecutors don\u2019t give such guidance. But former federal prosecutors can \u2014 just return the money,\u201d Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, wrote on Twitter.Now the Cuomo campaign says that 57 percent of his donations were for $250 or less in the latest filing period.

{"Headline": "After Trump\u2019s Fed Comments, Mnuchin Offers a Clarification", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 At a gathering of finance ministers from the world\u2019s largest economies on Saturday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sought to clarify remarks by President Trump this week, insisting that the administration would not interfere with the decisions of the Federal Reserve or move to manipulate the value of the dollar.Mr. Mnuchin was preparing to address currency concerns with his counterparts at the meeting, which is expected to be tense because of an escalating trade war. But he first sought to defuse any tension between the Fed and the president, who a day earlier had criticized the central bank for raising interest rates.Mr. Mnuchin asserted that the president had no intention of upsetting the established norms, saying, \u201cI fully support the Fed\u2019s independence, as does the president.\u201d Referring to the chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, Mr. Mnuchin continued, \u201cThe president was very clear in saying that he supports Chairman Powell, that he supports Chairman Powell\u2019s determination of interest rates.\u201dThe Treasury secretary, who said that it would be inappropriate for him to discuss interest rate policy, said it was not a mistake for Mr. Trump to do so. He said that he spoke to Mr. Trump about his comments and that the president was voicing a personal perspective, not trying to pressure the central bank.\u201cBeing a real estate person, real estate people obviously follow interest rates,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of Mr. Trump.The president also suggested this week that a \u201cstronger and stronger\u201d United States dollar was \u201ctaking away our big competitive edge.\u201d But the United States will not intervene in the currency markets, Mr. Mnuchin said.\u201cThe president is prepared to deal with different issues where he has opinions, but let me be clear, this is not in any way the president trying to intervene in the currency markets whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, adding that a strong dollar over the long term was in the interests of the United States.Brushing off cries of protectionism, Mr. Mnuchin was preparing to press for a new trade deal between the United States and the European Union that would eliminate all tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade. The idea, which Mr. Trump has broached before, has emerged as America\u2019s latest strategy to repel accusations that it has abandoned free trade.\u201cI think the G-7 and the E.U. constantly talk about a rules-based system, eliminating tariffs and trade barriers and how good free trade is for the global economy,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview before his meetings. \u201cIf they\u2019re sincere, we\u2019re willing to sit down and negotiate those discussions.\u201dThe proposal is largely conceptual at this stage, and it is not entirely clear how it would work. Mr. Mnuchin suggests that the pact would substantially reduce America\u2019s trade deficit with the European Union as a percentage of gross domestic product. However, both sides are likely to seek exceptions and loopholes to protect vulnerable industries such as steel and automobiles in the United States.Next week, European Union officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, are to hold additional trade talks with Mr. Trump in Washington. The officials\u2019 visit is an attempt to stave off new tariffs on European car imports.The United States will have about a dozen bilateral meetings this weekend and will participate in a broader meeting of the Group of 7 countries, which is intended to focus on China\u2019s trade practices. Mr. Mnuchin has no one-on-one meetings scheduled with Chinese officials, but he said that he expected informal talks to take place. (Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier and the country\u2019s top economic official, is not in attendance.)Thus far, the trade dispute with Beijing shows no signs of abating. Mr. Trump said in an interview with CNBC that aired on Friday that he was prepared to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese imports \u2014 approximately all the goods China sends to the United States each year \u2014 if necessary.Sarah Bloom Raskin, a deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, said that the erratic nature of the trade moves by Mr. Trump was most likely straining relations between the United States and its allies.\u201cPerhaps the staffs of Treasury and the staffs within finance ministries in other countries will continue against all odds to maintain good will,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cBut this wears thin \u2014 at our peril \u2014 when leadership is so aimless and chaotic.\u201dMr. Mnuchin was perhaps most optimistic about Nafta, which could still remain a trilateral deal with Canada and Mexico or be restructured as two separate trade pacts. Despite the recent tension, Mr. Mnuchin said that meetings with Mexico\u2019s incoming administration this month left him hopeful that the pace of negotiations would improve now that elections there are over.And while frustrations flared last month between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Mnuchin maintains a warm relationship with his Canadian counterpart, Bill Morneau, dining with him at an upscale Argentine steakhouse on Friday night.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Is Preparing for Extreme Weather. It\u2019s Time to Plant Some Trees.", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "The state expects drier dry years and wetter wet ones in the decades ahead. That means projects to restore river habitats now serve another purpose: battling the coming floods.Supported byMODESTO, Calif. \u2014 For years, there has been a movement in California to restore floodplains, by moving levees back from rivers and planting trees, shrubs and grasses in the low-lying land between. The goal has been to go back in time, to bring back some of the habitat for birds, animals and fish that existed before the state was developed.\u201cWe thought we were just going to plant some trees out here and get some birds to move in,\u201d said Julie Rentner, executive vice president of River Partners, a conservation group that is restoring hundreds of acres of farmland on the outskirts of Modesto in the Central Valley, where agriculture has overwhelmed the natural environment. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got this whole much larger public benefit thing going on.\u201dResearchers say it is unclear whether climate change will make California drier or wetter on average. What is more certain is that the state will increasingly whipsaw between extremes, with drier dry years, wetter wet ones and a rising frequency of intense periods of precipitation.River Partners\u2019 project, Dos Rios, covers more than three square miles of farmland here at the confluence of the Tuolumne and San Joaquin rivers. It will benefit endangered animals like the riparian brush rabbit and birds like the least Bell\u2019s vireo, but it is also designed to absorb some of the floodwater, holding it or slowing its flow to reduce levels in the nearby town of Grayson and elsewhere along the rivers.Dos Rios is only one of many such efforts. Kris Tjernell, deputy director for integrated watershed management at the California Department of Water Resources, said the state was actively working on \u201cupward of 20 or 30\u201d projects, some on its own and some in concert with groups like River Partners.That number is expected to grow significantly since California voters last month approved Proposition 68, which includes $300 million for floodplain projects in the Central Valley.California, and especially the Central Valley, is no stranger to floods. The biggest one in modern times occurred in 1861-62, when 40 days of rain turned the valley into a 250-mile-long lake and Leland Stanford, the state\u2019s new governor, took a rowboat to his inauguration in Sacramento.That flood occurred before most of the state\u2019s dams, levees and other flood-control works were built (and when the population was one-hundredth of what it is today). While not as big, some more recent floods have been severe, including one in 1997 that killed nine people and caused nearly $2 billion in damage.John Carlon, the president of River Partners, said floodplains that the group had restored on the Feather proved their worth in that event.\u201cThey just absorbed that floodwater beautifully \u2014 they acted like a shock absorber,\u201d said Mr. Carlon, who farms blueberries in the northern valley town of Chico. \u201cIt was a big test for this concept and we\u2019re really pleased with how it worked.\u201dDr. Swain said his research suggested that in California, as in many other parts of the world, severe floods are far more likely as warming continues. \u201cFor me the most surprising aspect is that the likelihood of seeing a repeat of this 1862 event over the next 40 years is greater than 50 percent,\u201d he said.No floodplain would help in such a disaster, but projects like Dos Rios can lessen some of the impacts of smaller floods. By allowing water to sweep over its acreage, a floodplain can reduce the river level in a nearby community.Even lowering a flood stage by a fraction of a foot can in many cases buy time \u2014 for farmers to move their cattle, for instance, or for a town to shore up its flood protection or evacuate the area if necessary.About three-quarters of the land at Dos Rios was owned by a dairy farmer who was tired of dealing with flooding and sold it in 2012 to River Partners, with various state and federal agencies financing the $21.8 million cost. An adjacent farmer then sold his land to the group in 2014 for $9.3 million.The result is 2,100 acres, including three miles of frontage along the Tuolumne River and four and a half along the San Joaquin. River Partners is removing berms along the riverfront that the owners formed from earth and rubble to keep the smallest floods out.A higher, more permanent levee, built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s, protects about 1,000 acres in the core of the project, back from the rivers. Modifications will allow water to enter, so the area will serve as a giant bathtub, holding up to 10,000 acre-feet of floodwater.This will not only reduce river levels, but as the water percolates into the land it should provide another benefit, helping to recharge aquifers that have been depleted statewide because of pumping for agriculture.About 600 acres inside the levee have been converted from farmland to riparian woodlands, and another 700 acres inside and outside the levee are in the process of being restored. The entire project should be finished by the middle of next decade, Mr. Carlon said.River Partners plants many species \u2014 trees like cottonwood and black willow, shrubs like golden currant and valley elderberry and a variety of grasses \u2014 all of which can recover after being underwater for months.Eventually the rows disappear \u2014 as evidenced by the land directly across the San Joaquin, where beginning 17 years ago River Partners restored about 3,000 acres of farmland that now appears to be a natural woodland, part of a national wildlife refuge.The exact mix of species to be planted in a given spot depends on what River Partners and state engineers want the water to do as it spreads across the land.\u201cThere\u2019s always an opportunity to use vegetation and this green infrastructure to lower flood risk \u2014 move the water where it will do the most good and redirect it from places that will do the most harm,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can do that in a way that is durable and sustainable over time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Our \u2018Winner-Take-Most\u2019 Economy, the Wealth Is Not Spreading", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLabor\u2019s share of the pie is still crumbs. Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. They go on:Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor \u2014 known among economists as \u201clabor share\u201d \u2014 coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to \u201ctemporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.\u201dThe outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the \u201cfissuring of the workplace\u201d that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account \u201cfor a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.\u201dThe steady erosion of workers\u2019 bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors.\u201cThe Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,\u201d Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court\u2019s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June\u2019s Janus decision, and the Court\u2019s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses.The authors document increasing market concentration:From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues.Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile \u201cgrew 160 percent\u201d while firms \u201cin 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.\u201dWhat economists\u2019 technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people.The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: \u201cConcentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent \u2014 monopsony \u2014 that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.\u201d Firms dominating concentrated labor markets \u201cface relatively inelastic labor supply\u201d (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to \u201creduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.\u201dReduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor\u2019s share of income has fallen.Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart.Labor\u2019s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted.115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:97.17INDEXED TO 2009 = 100\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:INDEXED TO 2009 = 10097.17\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector.In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share.Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: \u201cResults show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.\u201dWhat does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back:Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening:1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it).2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits.3. A general increase in profits.Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately becausewithout any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits.Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profitsaffects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households \u2014 which live on wage/salary income \u2014 and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments.This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate.The growing importance of digital innovation \u2014 new products and processes based on software code and data \u2014 has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter\u2019s vision, digital innovation gives rise to \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, \u201caccrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.\u201dHow much money are we talking about?The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity \u2014 from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies.In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent.While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years.$22.80Tax bill enactedJUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80Tax bill enacted$22.80JUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars.Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we\u2019ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover.That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations \u2014 amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections \u2014 is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates\u2019 probability of victory.These improvements, in turn, \u201clower uncertainty about an election\u2019s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.\u201dThe effect, then, is thatwhen one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most.Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others \u2014 a majority of them men \u2014 have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them.How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

There was plenty of skepticism on offer.S\u00e9bastien Genco, a blockchain specialist at the auditing and financial services company Deloitte, said the percentage of global investment in this technology that related to art represented \u201calmost nothing.\u201dMr. Genco, in his talk at the Christie\u2019s event, titled \u201cWhy the Art World Wasn\u2019t Ready for Blockchain,\u201d cited the art world\u2019s slow embrace of technology, limited collaboration, lack of trust in a process that is not fully understood, and costs as some of the reasons blockchain had yet to have a significant impact on the art trade. But that could change, he said. \u201cWe just need to educate people.\u201dAs the Christie\u2019s event progressed, a clearer picture emerged of what blockchain could and could not (yet) do for the art world. The technology\u2019s potential for verifying provenance, authenticity and ownership was widely cited by speakers and attendees.\u201cI see the benefit for my clients in terms of reliability of information,\u201d said Harco van den Oever, chief executive of Overstone, a London-based company providing specialist services to banks that issue art-secured loans. \u201cBlockchain is a secure database. I can\u2019t rely on a piece of paper.\u201dAnd blockchain has already proved to be a game-changer in one important area of growth, according to those at the Christie\u2019s event: art in digital forms.For other art and technology experts, \u201ctokenization\u201d \u2014 using the value of an artwork to underpin tradable digital tokens \u2014 is the way forward. \u201cBlockchain represents a huge opportunity for the size of the market,\u201d said Niccol\u00f2 Filippo Veneri Savoia, founder of Look Lateral, a start-up looking to generate cryptocurrency trading in fractions of artworks.\u201cI see more transactions,\u201d added Mr. Savoia, who pointed out that tokens representing a percentage of an artwork could be sold several times a year. \u201cThe crypto world will bring huge liquidity.\u201dBut the challenge for tokenization ventures such as Look Lateral is finding works of art of sufficient quality to hold their value after being exposed to fractional trading. The art market puts a premium on \u201cblue chip\u201d works that have not been overtraded, and these tend to be bought by wealthy individuals, not by fintech start-ups.With so much attention focused on such technological endeavors, the emergence of a new fund might seem like a blast from the art finance past. But that\u2019s what we have in the recently and very discreetly introduced UTA Brant Fine Art Fund, devised by the seasoned New York collector Peter Brant and the United Talent Agency in Los Angeles.Those that do, like the UTA Brant fund, have tweaked the model. Echoing recent strategies of the London-based Fine Art Group, formerly known as the Fine Art Fund, this latest venture plans to use auction guarantees both to generate additional revenue and to buy works, depending on the performance of pieces at auction.Mr. Brant\u2019s personal art transactions of at least $750,000 from 1996 to 2016 had a gross annual return of 19.2 percent, the fund\u2019s prospectus says, outperforming the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for the period.Mr. Brant declined to comment on the fund, as did the United Talent Agency, citing Securities and Exchange Commission guidance regarding private offerings.But funds, tokenization and even digital art are all investments that don\u2019t give investors anything to hang on their walls.\u201cWe should never forget that in the center of it all is artists,\u201d Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries in London, said in the concluding panel of the Christie\u2019s conference.Whether driven by fintech or funds, today\u2019s finance-driven art world makes it quite easy to forget that.Advertisement"}

Together, they have benefited from tens of millions of dollars a year from public-sector unions \u2014 funding now in jeopardy because of the prospective decline in union revenue.Liberal activists argue that closing that pipeline was a crucial goal of the conservative groups that helped bring the case, known as Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\u201cIf the progressive movement is a navy, they\u2019re trying to take out our aircraft carriers,\u201d said Ben Wikler, Washington director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org.Even President Trump took notice of the justices\u2019 ruling, declaring on Twitter that it was a \u201cbig loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\u201dIn the 5-to-4 decision on Wednesday, the court\u2019s majority ruled that requiring nonmembers to make union payments violated their First Amendment rights, since much of what unions do could be considered political activity at odds with their beliefs.The unions\u2019 ability to spend on progressive causes and candidates was already diminishing.Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, said that her union had cut its budget by about 30 percent in anticipation of the decision, and that the service employees had been talking with leaders of liberal groups for two years about how to offset the loss. She said the union, with about two million members, would provide a range of nonmonetary support, from in-kind staff assistance to help with fund-raising.The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank producing research on worker rights, wages and employment, has relied on the four biggest public-sector unions for about 10 to 15 percent of its roughly $6 million in annual revenue in recent years.\u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing it as an existential threat,\u201d said Thea Lee, the institute\u2019s president, \u201cbut we have been trying to be conservative in what projects we pursue.\u201dA group called Mi Familia Vota, which advocates on behalf of Latino voters and immigrants, had received about $1 million a year directly from the Service Employees International Union since 2012 \u2014 a significant portion of its annual revenue, which has ranged from about $1.5 million to $5 million during that time.Last year, the union gave just $25,000.\u201cWe\u2019ve been adjusting,\u201d said Ben Monterroso, director of Mi Familia Vota, which focuses on issues including education, health care, workers\u2019 rights and voting rights. \u201cSome of the programs we\u2019ve needed to scale back. Demonstrations, activities, actions, we\u2019ve scaled back.\u201dMr. Monterroso said the group was now focused primarily on elections and elected officials. \u201cWe do that by growing the electorate \u2014 helping people become citizens when eligible, and helping those eligible be registered,\u201d he said.Other groups that register and mobilize voters may be vulnerable, too. America Votes, a group with a permanent staff in more than 20 states that turns out voters on Election Day and rallies them around causes like reproductive rights and the environment, received more than one-fifth of its nearly $10 million budget from the four biggest public-sector unions in 2016.(Some unions said it was too early to know what spending they would cut. The American Federation of Teachers was adamant that it would continue funding certain groups, like America Votes.)In some arenas, the loss of union money will almost certainly be offset by other liberal donors \u2014 both the wealthy and ordinary citizens. Few party operatives worry, for example, that the Democrats will lack resources for their next presidential nominee, or candidates in high-profile Senate and House races.In other cases, the loss of union money may be offset by grass-roots activism.In 2016, the four major public-sector unions gave nearly 15 percent of the $17 million raised by the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which funds state legislative races nationwide. But the group is optimistic that any loss of union revenue can be offset by what it calls the \u201cpeople power\u201d of union members and other voters.Activists and party operatives said union cash would be more difficult to replace in other areas. Mr. Wikler said MoveOn\u2019s monthly donor base had quadrupled since Mr. Trump was elected, allowing it to increase support for groups working on immigrants\u2019 rights, workers\u2019 rights and racial-justice causes.\u201cBut the scale of what we can kick in to efforts like that are dwarfed by what the public-sector unions can muster,\u201d he said.Mr. Woodhouse said labor money could be especially critical to groups that must form quickly for a specific policy fight. He cited the example of Americans United, founded in 2005 to block President George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to partly privatize Social Security.\u201cIt was a lot easier to go to labor to do that than it is to kind of try to do this through other means \u2014 low-dollar or individual donors,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeed was essential, and we were caught a little flat-footed.\u201d (Labor has funded some of these efforts through super PACs in recent years.)In the end, the loss of union money may be less detrimental to Democrats and progressive causes than the loss of union members.In the 2000 presidential election, noted Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., 43 percent of the votes cast in Michigan came from union households, which tend to vote Democratic by a large margin. In the 2016 presidential election, the first after the state passed a \u201cright to work\u201d law ending mandatory union fees, only 28 percent of votes came from union households. That drop-off accounts for Hillary Clinton\u2019s margin of defeat in the state many times over.The key to unions\u2019 importance, said John D. Podesta, who was chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and is a founder of liberal advocacy and research groups, is \u201ctheir ability to change outcomes through educational efforts of their own members.\u201d\u201cThey do a very good job of communicating with their own members and getting them out to vote,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

(\u201cRogue Nation\u201d ultimately took in $736 million worldwide.) \u201cFallout\u201d also received stronger reviews \u2014 an achievement of critical importance for the franchise going forward; if audiences are satisfied with one sequel, they are likely to go to the next one.Ticket buyers gave \u201cFallout\u201d an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.

He has also pushed ahead long-gestating movies like \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which stars Mr. Cruise in a return to his role from the 1986 original and is scheduled for release next July.\u201cYou\u2019re always just a few good movies from turning things around,\u201d Mr. Gianopulos said.Many cinephiles bemoan sequels, but the masses still seem avid for them.

The four productions are expected to cost about $75 million to mount \u2014 \u201cKing Kong\u201d alone is budgeted for up to $36.5 million, and \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d for up to $28 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201cThese are ambitious projects, they\u2019re high-profile projects, and they\u2019re big budgets,\u201d Carmen Pavlovic, the hard-charging chief executive of Global Creatures and the lead producer of the four shows, said. \u201cIf I start to think about it, I get nervous. But I don\u2019t let myself start to think about it.\u201d\u201cKing Kong\u201d and \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d are bigger productions \u2014 \u201cKong\u201d requires 13 people just to operate the ape \u2014 with bigger question marks.\u201cMoulin Rouge!,\u201d which is aiming for Broadway next season, is the first Global Creatures show to begin outside Australia, and has not yet had a production, so anything is possible. But expect it to look dazzling, reflecting what its director, Alex Timbers, calls \u201cdeluxe maximalism.\u201dAt the same time, Australian theatermakers, who have long endured a commercial scene overwhelmingly dominated by musicals imported from Broadway and the West End, are delighted by Global Creatures\u2019s rare effort to nurture and export large-scale shows. And Australian state governments have supported the shows \u2014 as they have done for other commercial productions \u2014 with monetary and marketing help.\u201cEveryone is looking at them and saying, \u2018Thank God,\u2019\u201d Simon Phillips, a prominent Australian director who is leading the development of \u201cMuriel\u2019s Wedding,\u201d said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a cash cow in the animatronics, and they don\u2019t actively need theater, but they believe in it.\u201dMs. Pavlovic, who is 49, is from Australia and had spent years working in theater production in Sydney and London, first at Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s Really Useful Group and then at Stage Entertainment, where she headed international production. She set up \u201cCats\u201d in Russia, \u201cThe Lion King\u201d in France, and \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d in Germany. She also knew quite a bit about \u201cWalking With Dinosaurs\u201d because she is married to the show\u2019s scenic designer, Peter England (now the set designer for \u201cKing Kong\u201d).Ms. Pavlovic agreed to run the company on one condition: in addition to the animatronics business, she wanted to produce traditional theater.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to just create shows about creatures,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to just replicate Broadway and the West End, which is what every other producer does.\u201dMr. Ryan agreed, and she moved back from London to help buy out the other \u201cWalking With Dinosaurs\u201d producers and set up Global Creatures. Mr. Ryan and Ms. Pavlovic jointly own the company, which has 22 employees in Sydney, London and New York. (The animatronics division, which also created a \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d arena show, is now separate.)The first target, Ms. Pavlovic thought, seemed obvious. Given that Global Creatures had developed expertise building robotic beasts, why not start with one of the most famous man vs. animal stories of the last century, \u201cKing Kong,\u201d about a gorilla who is enchanted by an actress, captured by a showman, and taken from his Skull Island home to face captivity and then death at the top of the Empire State Building.As the show prepared for Broadway, Ms. Pavlovic brought on a veteran American producer, Roy Furman, who had been looking for a large-scale musical to champion.\u201cI\u2019ve just noticed that while there are lots of artistic shows that are doing beautifully, there is an audience for big-scale productions \u2014 something people can\u2019t see at home \u2014 if done right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 was instructive. Even with all its problems, it was the third-highest-grossing show when it was running.\u201dEvery member of the current creative team interviewed said they had been skeptical until they saw Kong himself.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t on my radar \u2014 doing a big musical with a massive puppet \u2014 but as soon as I saw what they\u2019d built, I couldn\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Mr. Thorne, the writer, said. He, like other members of the team, said he had been approached out of the blue by Ms. Pavlovic \u2014 in his case, by email \u2014 and was taken by her gumption and candor.\u201cShe was saying \u2018Kong\u2019 hadn\u2019t worked out in a number of iterations, and the thing I loved most was the risk \u2014 risk that she celebrated,\u201d Mr. Thorne said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even look at the previous scripts \u2014 I\u2019m sure they were magnificent, but I wanted a blank page.\u201dThe musical is set in the 1930s \u2014 on Skull Island, in New York, and aboard a ship \u2014 but Mr. Thorne\u2019s book is reframed for contemporary sensibilities, and new songs by the Australian musician Eddie Perfect range from dance hall to swing to rhythm and blues. \u201cEvery song is like an anthem, to success or to failure or to change,\u201d Mr. Perfect said. \u201cIt\u2019s big, because everything about the show is very big \u2014 big ideas, big puppetry, big statements.\u201dMr. Luhrmann, who fended off earlier offers from other production companies, said he liked that Global Creatures was Australian, was impressed that Mr. Ryan \u201chad the stamina to stand by a show until he got it right,\u201d and appreciated Ms. Pavlovic\u2019s \u201cvery intense enthusiasm.\u201dThough he directed the initial stage adaptation of \u201cStrictly Ballroom\u201d in 2014, subsequent productions were directed by a young British choreographer, Drew McOnie, who is now also directing \u201cKong.\u201dMr. Luhrmann said he had learned a lesson: \u201cI\u2019m either going to spend the rest of my life looking after the canon of work I\u2019ve made, or I should surrender it to a younger generation and let them interpret as I go on to the rest of my journey.\u201d He has taken only an advisory role with \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d \u2014 he calls himself \u201cDear Old Uncle Baz\u201d \u2014 which, despite being set in Paris, is the most American of the projects.The \u201cMoulin Rouge!\u201d movie, which starred Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, was a trippy sensation, nominated for eight Academy Awards and winning two, and the stage adaptation shares its sumptuous aesthetic. An 18-foot-high elephant and a 17-foot-high windmill (both icons of the Moulin Rouge cabaret) flank the stage. Satine, one of the main characters, makes her entrance flying in from above.\u201cMuriel\u2019s Wedding,\u201d which is Global Creatures\u2019s biggest critical success to date, came about almost as an afterthought, while the other shows were in early stages. \u201cI was puttering around a bookshop to go and have a little think, and I found a book on \u2018Muriel\u2019s Wedding,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pavlovic said.Frustrated by a lack of available theater space in Australia and interested in the potential financial and artistic advantages of working with a nonprofit \u2014 as is often done in the United States and Britain \u2014 Global Creatures decided to develop the show with the Sydney Theater Company.That nonprofit run of \u201cMuriel\u2019s Wedding\u201d ended in January; the show is now being tweaked in anticipation of its commercial run in Australia next year, and Ms. Pavlovic said she hoped it would have a life outside Australia, although she doesn\u2019t know where or when. (Financial realities demand that big shows made in Australia travel to recoup their investments: \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough human beings in Australia to buy tickets to justify the cost of developing a musical,\u201d Mr. Perfect, the songwriter, said.)There is more to come. Ms. Pavlovic said Global Creatures was partnering with the Old Vic Theater in London on a project she declined to describe. \u201cThere\u2019s no end to the things I want the company to do,\u201d she said.Mr. Ryan has given little artistic input into the shows; many of those working on them have never met him, and some have never heard of him. But he does cheer on the cast and creative artists; he is planning to visit New York soon to check out development on \u201cKing Kong,\u201d and said he was confident of success.\u201cI\u2019m a long-term investor,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI know this is risky, but the higher the returns, the riskier it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s Having a Major Revival.", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "At a time of mounting uncertainty in Europe, the country has defied critics who insisted on austerity as the answer to the Continent\u2019s economic and financial crisis.Supported byLISBON \u2014 Ram\u00f3n Rivera had barely gotten his olive oil business started in the sun-swept Alentejo region of Portugal when Europe\u2019s debt crisis struck. The economy crumbled, wages were cut, and unemployment doubled. The government in Lisbon had to accept a humiliating international bailout.But as the misery deepened, Portugal took a daring stand: In 2015, it cast aside the harshest austerity measures its European creditors had imposed, igniting a virtuous cycle that put its economy back on a path to growth. The country reversed cuts to wages, pensions and social security, and offered incentives to businesses.The government\u2019s U-turn, and willingness to spend, had a powerful effect. Creditors railed against the move, but the gloom that had gripped the nation through years of belt-tightening began to lift. Business confidence rebounded. Production and exports began to take off \u2014 including at Mr. Rivera\u2019s olive groves.\u201cWe had faith that Portugal would come out of the crisis,\u201d said Mr. Rivera, the general manager of Elaia. The company focused on state-of-the-art harvesting technology, and it is now one of Portugal\u2019s biggest olive oil producers. \u201cWe saw that this was the best place in the world to invest.\u201d\u201cWhat happened in Portugal shows that too much austerity deepens a recession, and creates a vicious circle,\u201d Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said in an interview. \u201cWe devised an alternative to austerity, focusing on higher growth, and more and better jobs.\u201dThe government raised public sector salaries, the minimum wage and pensions and even restored the amount of vacation days to prebailout levels over objections from creditors like Germany and the International Monetary Fund. Incentives to stimulate business included development subsidies, tax credits and funding for small and midsize companies.The economic about-face had a remarkable impact on Portugal\u2019s collective psyche. While discouragement lingers in Greece after a decade of spending cuts, Portugal\u2019s recovery has pivoted around restoring confidence to get people and businesses motivated again.\u201cThe actual stimulus spending was very small,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Borges de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, a professor at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Business and Economics. \u201cBut the country\u2019s mind-set became completely different, and from an economic perspective, that\u2019s more impactful than the actual change in policy.\u201dThe brighter outlook has lifted companies like Elaia, the olive oil producer. Its parent company, Sovena, opened Elaia as a start-up on a vast agricultural plain in southern Portugal in 2007, just before the downturn. Its timing could hardly have been worse, but managers persisted, paving the way for a surge in production when the crisis ebbed.Elaia says it generates 14 percent of Portugal\u2019s olive oil today, contributing to a renaissance in Portuguese exports, which now constitute 40 percent of economic activity. Drones buzz over vast olive groves, precision-planted with 2,000 trees per hectare, or roughly 2.5 acres, compared with around 150 trees for a traditional farm, monitoring crops for insect infestations, water levels and optimum harvesting time. Olives are picked by machine. Instead of field hands, the company hires technicians to operate the robots, and it has teamed up with universities for research.\u201cPortugal has benefited a lot after the tough years we had,\u201d said Jorge de Melo, Sovena\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe mood is much better than it was before, and that\u2019s important for the economy.\u201dYet Portugal\u2019s success is still vulnerable.Portugal\u2019s unions are now threatening strikes to press the government to more fully reverse austerity, increase wages and unlock more public spending to reduce inequality.\u201cWe didn\u2019t go from the dark side to the bright side of the moon,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d\u201cBut when we started this process, a lot of people said that what we wanted to achieve was impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cWe showed that there is an alternative.\u201dTo cement the growth cycle, the government is putting what little investment it makes into targeted initiatives like tax breaks for foreign companies and training for the unemployed.An hour and a half east of Lisbon, in \u00c9vora, a five-acre factory built by the French airplane-parts maker Mecachrome rises from rolling plains fringed with cork trees. Lured in 2016 by government incentives and European Union loans, it invested \u20ac30 million in a vast aerospace park where bulldozers are plowing fields to make way for roads and businesses.Robots forge precision parts for Airbus, Boeing and other industry giants. Most of the 150 technicians were recruited nearby by an unemployment agency that started an intensive retraining program with the government.Luis Salgueiro, 29, an apprentice with Mecachrome, was jobless during the crisis. He eventually got work as a waiter, and then in a tomato factory, before landing again at the unemployment office. At the Mecachrome plant, however, he was helping to code a complex machine to fashion a titanium airplane part. Completing the apprenticeship is expected to lead to a full-time job.\u201cThe future looks really bright for me now,\u201d he said, beaming as he gestured around the factory.Christian Santos, Mecachrome\u2019s director in Portugal, said he plans to hire 150 more workers and to make millions in additional investments in the next three years.\u201cThings are happening in Portugal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an enthusiastic mojo here.\u201dCamilo Soldado contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Ram\u00f3n Rivera's olive-oil business.

{"Headline": "A Dramatic Play About Finance? Yes, if It\u2019s Lehman Brothers", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat\u2019s smart about director Sam Mendes\u2019s and designer Es Devlin\u2019s setting is that the past is always staged in the present: The action remains in a chrome and glass office, file boxes \u2014 which we saw so many photos of shellshocked Lehman Brothers employees clutching desperately as they left in 2008 \u2014 becoming whatever set or prop is needed. You can\u2019t view this story of a hard-grafting immigrant family, this apparent tale of the American dream, without awareness of where it all wound up.Basically, the Lehmans are present for all things great and horrible about U.S. economic shifts, trends and fads since, roughly, the 1840s. But it\u2019s also a family story, too. And this leaves the thorny question of what we are to think of these people. Are they merely opportunists? Are they amoral? Are they geniuses? Are they a net positive for the country? The answers change because the plot follows three generations of very different characters. But the question persists, in my mind, after the curtain falls. What did you make of this remarkable little clan, Holly?While there\u2019s a strong argument that the best way to stop history repeating is to really understand it, and a human look at the people behind mega institutions can help that, the play was still three and half hours of white men talking about how much money they want to make. I found it completely compelling, I should add, but it\u2019s always worth thinking about whose stories get told on our major stages.Anyway, David, what I want to know is how does it feel to see this very American story told by Brits? Did we do a reasonable job at catching something of the national psyche? So far, British critics seem unanimous in their praise \u2014 do you think it would play so well on Broadway? Famously, Lucy Prebble\u2019s \u201cEnron\u201d was a smash in London and a flop over there.I also think that American audiences will like the kinetic staging. For stretches of the show, you are transported via a video backdrop that is inventively deployed \u2014 to convey fire, war, the crash, nightmares, and most winningly, the \u201cdance\u201d of an economy at full throttle. Also, the U.S. is filled with fans of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and one of the brothers is played by Adam Godley, who was Elliott Schwartz in that show. Mr. Godley demonstrates range that he never got to in the show. Like his co-stars, he plays women, children and an assortment of men, all while wearing the same dark overcoat and suit.That said, I felt it was less effective with the female roles. All the female parts were played for laughs, really. Given these three actors exhibit such mastery at inhabiting different roles, this didn\u2019t need to be the case.This was an evening that could have felt very pedantic \u2014 an Italian playwright and an English production on Britain\u2019s national stage, at a moment when the world is pontificating and theorizing about what ails America. Mr. Massini rarely puts his thumb on the dramatic scales, and only toward the end, when he makes it clear that avaricious people are to blame for a catastrophe. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t feel lectured to, or pointed toward a particular conclusion, any other time.The revelation is what comes before that. The men who rise from nothing and a nation that makes that rise possible. It is a yarn with plenty of ugliness, sometimes acknowledged by the main players, more often not. But what a yarn.Advertisement"}

Others coordinated during lunchtime phone conferences. Most of them haven\u2019t even graduated from high school.For the last year, a tight-knit group spanning both coasts has been organizing on social media. The teenagers kicked off their campaign with a protest on Saturday at the National Mall in Washington, along with sister marches across the country.\u201cThe march is a launch. It isn\u2019t, \u2018That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Margolin, the founder of Zero Hour. \u201cIt means it doesn\u2019t give them an excuse to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what the kids want.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, you do.\u2019\u201dThey are trying to prove the adults wrong, to show that people their age are taking heed of what they see as the greatest crisis threatening their generation.\u201cIn our generation when we talk about climate change, they\u2019re like: \u2018Ha ha, that\u2019s so funny. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ll have to deal with,\u2019\u201d said Nadia Nazar, Zero Hour\u2019s art director. \u201c\u2018Oh, yeah, the polar bears will just die, the seas will just rise.\u2019 They don\u2019t understand the actual caliber of the destruction.\u201d\u201cNo one gives you an organizing guide of how to raise thousands of dollars, how to get people on board, how to mobilize,\u201d Ms. Margolin said. \u201cThere was no help. It was just me floundering around with Dory-like determination, like, \u2018Just keep swimming,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to the Disney movie \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201dAt the Sierra Club\u2019s Washington headquarters on Wednesday, as Zero Hour members continued to make preparations, six of the coalition\u2019s leaders and founding members discussed how they became involved with the group, and why they think it\u2019s one of young people\u2019s best shots at creating a healthy, sustainable environment.Jamie Margolin, 16, Seattle\u201cI\u2019ve always planned my future in ifs,\u201d Ms. Margolin said. If climate change hasn\u2019t destroyed this, if the environment hasn\u2019t become that.So for the last few years, Ms. Margolin has worked to raise awareness about climate justice issues. A passionate writer, she went through an \u201cop-ed phase,\u201d submitting essays to publications, like one titled \u201cAn Open Letter to Climate Change Deniers\u201d published in the monthly magazine Teen Ink.Still, Ms. Margolin thought that she and other young people could \u2014 and should \u2014 be doing more.\u201cI had had this idea building up since January, since the Women\u2019s March\u201d last year, Ms. Margolin said. \u201cThe kind of idea that was nagging me and you try to ignore, but it\u2019s an idea poking you.\u201dAt a Princeton University summer program last year, she met other teenagers interested in taking action on climate change and created Zero Hour. They began to plan a huge protest in the nation\u2019s capital. On social media, Ms. Margolin espoused factoids and reached out to other young activists.Since starting Zero Hour, Ms. Margolin said she had been overwhelmed by the response from people of all ages. Dozens of environmental advocacy groups and nonprofits have approached the coalition, looking to donate to or sponsor it.\u201cWe flipped the scenario as the underdog. We\u2019ve proven ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on the verge of something amazing. We\u2019re going to change history.\u201dKallan Benson, 14, Crownsville, Md.\u201cThe original idea was, \u2018We got to get them on the National Mall,\u2019 but then we thought that, \u2018Well that shouldn\u2019t be our first exhibit; it\u2019s a little ambitious,\u2019\u201d Ms. Benson said.\u201cThen we talked to Zero Hour and they were like, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you bring them out?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI never imagined it would get this far.\u201dMadelaine Tew, 15, Teaneck, N.J.As Zero Hour\u2019s director of finance, Ms. Tew has had to get creative about securing funds and grants.On the day of a deadline for a major grant \u2014 $16,000 from the Common Sense Fund \u2014 Ms. Tew\u2019s school was hosting an event where seniors gave presentations about their internships. But she knew the grant would be a huge boost for Zero Hour.\u201cSo I went to the nurse and was like: \u2018Oh, I have cramps. Can I lie down with my computer?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen I just went in and wrote the whole grant.\u201dHer stunt paid off. Zero Hour secured the grant, and now Ms. Tew\u2019s finance team, made up of students just like her, has raised about $70,000 for the coalition.Ms. Tew, who attends a magnet high school where she takes classes in business and finance, has been involved in clubs to get the school and local businesses to adopt more renewable practices. But before meeting Ms. Margolin at the Princeton summer program last year, she thought those local efforts were \u201cas far as you can go\u201d for someone her age.\u201cIt shifted from youth being a limitation to \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tew said.Though the practices of big corporations can sometimes anger environmentalists, for Ms. Tew, combining \u201cmy love for business and my care, my concern for climate\u201d just makes sense.\u201cIn many cases you can see how the environmental movement can be rooted in the way we do business,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about building more cooperative farms,\u201d Ms. Tew said, but also figuring out how to integrate ethical and sustainable environmental policies into business so \u201cwe can continue the American economy\u2019s future.\u201dIris Fen Gillingham, 18, Livingston Manor, N.Y.When three floods in the mid- to late 2000s swept through the vegetable farm Iris Fen Gillingham\u2019s family owned in the Catskill Mountains, the topsoil was washed away and their equipment was submerged, eliminating their main source of income.The floods devastated Ms. Gillingham\u2019s family, which has always lived \u201cvery consciously with the land and with nature,\u201d she said. Even her name, Iris Fen, like the flower and marshy wetland behind her house, alludes to that attachment.\u201cI have a pair of mittens that are made out of one of our Icelandic sheep, Rosalie,\u201d Ms. Gillingham said. \u201cMy brother named her, I remember her being born and I\u2019ve seen her grow up and my mom sheering her and spinning the wool.\u201dSo when landsmen came to explore the possibility of hydraulic fracturing \u2014 a technique of oil and gas extraction also known as fracking \u2014 in their neighborhood when she was about 10, Ms. Gillingham joined her father, an environmental activist, in speaking out at local meetings, often as the youngest in the room.But part of it was also knowing firsthand how essential a sustainable lifestyle \u2014 growing food at home, conscious spending, building greener homes \u2014 will be for her generation.\u201cWe\u2019re setting aside our differences and we are building a family and a community using our skills and our creativity,\u201d Ms. Gillingham said of the movement. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re laughing with each other, but we\u2019re also talking about some pretty serious issues and injustices happening in this country.\u201dNadia Nazar, 16, Baltimore\u201cI had just gotten a cat,\u201d Ms. Nazar said. \u201cWhat if my cat was that cow?\u201dShe got her start as an activist by trying to persuade people in her neighborhood not to go to SeaWorld, which has been criticized over its treatment of animals. (\u201cI was slightly successful in that.\u201d)Then she dug deeper into the root causes of animal suffering and death.\u201cI found out how so many species are endangered by climate change, and how many are dying and going towards extinction that we caused ourselves,\u201d Ms. Nazar said.During a class, she stumbled upon Ms. Margolin\u2019s Teen Ink essay and followed her on Instagram. And a little over a year ago, when Ms. Nazar saw a post by Ms. Margolin calling for action, she knew it was her chance to put her artistic skills to use. As art director, she helped organize a smaller art festival on Friday, and created the majority of the graphic elements for the coalition.\u201cHer story said: \u2018I\u2019m going to do it. Who wants to join me?\u201d Ms. Nazar said. She immediately messaged Ms. Margolin. She was in.Zanagee Artis, 18, Clinton, Conn.Zanagee Artis\u2019s journey as an environmentalist began in the same place many other budding activists get their start \u2014 in a high school club.During his junior year, he had big ambitions for his school: the building facilities department would finally start recycling white paper, students would start composting their food waste and the lunchroom would be free of plastic foam trays.\u201cI\u2019m going to accomplish all these things and I\u2019m going to go to the administration and tell them, \u2018Stuff needs to change,\u2019\u201d Mr. Artis said.But, he said, \u201cnothing ever happened.\u201d Mr. Artis said the problem was clear: Without engaging other students who might be interested, change was unlikely to happen.\u201cSo we accomplished all these things because we worked together as a community, and that\u2019s how I feel about the climate movement,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Artis said he \u201creally didn\u2019t think I could do much\u201d beyond his local community until he met Ms. Margolin and Ms. Tew last summer at Princeton.

{"Headline": "Montana Governor Sues I.R.S., Warning of \u2018Foreign Money\u2019 in Elections", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat who has crusaded against the loosening of campaign finance rules, is suing the Trump administration to block it from eliminating a mandate that politically active nonprofit groups disclose the identities of their major donors to the government.The change in rules stirred immediate political controversy because of its effect on so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups, which spend money in elections but are not required to reveal the sources of their funding except to the I.R.S. Under the new reporting regime, groups associated with organizations like the National Rifle Association, Planned Parenthood and Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy network backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, would no longer have to list their donors, even to the government.But in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Montana, Mr. Bullock and his administration alleged that the Trump administration had flouted proper government process in eliminating the disclosure requirements. The suit asked the court to issue a judgment voiding the new I.R.S. policy.Mr. Bullock, in an interview, argued that if the new procedure were allowed to take effect, it would undermine Montana\u2019s ability to regulate nonprofits and would make it harder to police illegal spending in political campaigns.\u201cThe goal of the litigation is to make sure that dark money and foreign money isn\u2019t flowing into our elections unchecked,\u201d Mr. Bullock said, accusing the Trump administration of \u201cplaying fast and loose with Treasury procedures.\u201dMr. Bullock said that because Montana currently uses I.R.S. information to administer nonprofits at the state level, the abrupt policy shift could hobble its ability to conduct oversight and collect revenue.\u201cNot only do we have a long history of fighting against dark money and corporate money in our elections, but it could also substantially impact our state treasuries \u2014 what Montana and other states collect,\u201d said Mr. Bullock, adding that he hoped other states would consider mounting challenges of their own.A Treasury Department spokesman did not immediately respond on Tuesday to a request for comment.The Montana lawsuit is the latest in a barrage of litigation launched by Democratic governors and attorneys general against the Trump administration, on matters ranging from President Trump\u2019s travel ban to Pentagon restrictions on transgender troops, to the deregulatory policies championed at the Environmental Protection Agency by Scott Pruitt, the former administrator who was ousted earlier this month.In announcing the shift in disclosure requirements last week, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, described it as giving relief to groups unduly burdened by the government. A number of conservative groups had pushed for the change, in part because of several episodes in which donor information was accidentally disclosed to the public after being reported to the government.\u201cThe I.R.S. simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.On Tuesday, Mr. Bullock said he could pursue even more intensive state regulations on nonprofit groups if his lawsuit against the I.R.S. is not successful.\u201cWere this lawsuit to fail, then certainly the state of Montana \u2014 and other states \u2014 would have to take other steps to protect the integrity of its tax base,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner\u2019s Firm Deepens Ties to Those With Business in Washington", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEighteen months into Jared Kushner\u2019s White House tenure, his family\u2019s real estate firm is deepening its financial relationships with institutions and individuals that have a lot riding on decisions made by the federal government.In the latest example, an arm of Brookfield Asset Management is close to completing an investment of up to $700 million in the Kushner family\u2019s tower at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The deal will be a boon to the Kushners, who are struggling to recoup their investments in their flagship building.At the same time, another Brookfield unit is awaiting the Trump administration\u2019s approval of its acquisition of the nuclear-power company Westinghouse Electric. The deal is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, made up of senior federal officials who consider the potential national security risks of transactions involving foreign companies. Brookfield\u2019s headquarters are in Canada.Mr. Kushner, who is President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, has broad portfolios of both White House responsibilities and personal business interests \u2014 a combination that experts say has the potential to create real and perceived conflicts between his public and private roles.\u201cJared knows who is invested with the family business. He can\u2019t unlearn that,\u201d said Don Fox, acting director of the Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama and an official in both Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cThere is absolutely potential for him to be influenced if he has to make a decision or provide advice to cabinet officials that could affect his investors. And that can\u2019t be lost on the people that are investing with him.\u201dThe family\u2019s business, Kushner Companies, declined to comment. Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, said Mr. Kushner had followed the advice of ethics lawyers concerning the sale of certain assets and \u201cis not in any position to comment on business decisions made by others at his former companies since he left.\u201d Representatives of the White House did not respond to requests for comment.A Brookfield spokeswoman, Suzanne Fleming, said there was no connection between the 666 Fifth Avenue deal and Brookfield\u2019s plans to acquire Westinghouse. Another Brookfield representative, Andrew Brent, said the company had met with Mr. Kushner in the past, but not since he joined the Trump administration.Kushner Companies has also recently negotiated a number of previously undisclosed transactions with investors who have business in Washington. Those investors include a businessman who arranges United States visas in exchange for real estate investments from overseas. His company is leading the lobbying fight against proposals to change the federal program on which his business relies.The 98-page annual filing isn\u2019t required to and didn\u2019t disclose the identities of his family company\u2019s growing network of partners and lenders.Mr. Kushner\u2019s White House portfolio ranges from shaping Middle East strategy to overhauling the government\u2019s technology and overseeing investment in infrastructure. Those responsibilities at times have overlapped with his family business dealings.Although Mr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies last year and sold portions to a trust controlled by his mother, he retained most of his stake in the business. During 2017, his family\u2019s company bought and sold properties worth between $22 million and $102 million using entities in which Mr. Kushner remained invested, filings show.One of those deals involved the refinancing of apartment buildings that Kushner Companies owns in Baltimore and its suburbs. As part of last year\u2019s refinancing, the firm took on some new backers, whose identities Kushner Companies hasn\u2019t disclosed. One of them was Nicholas Mastroianni II, who invested roughly $4 million, he said in an interview. He is the founder and chief executive of a company called U.S. Immigration Fund.U.S. Immigration Fund has much at stake in Washington. Its business revolves around raising money from foreign investors through a controversial government-sanctioned program called EB-5, which offers United States visas in exchange for real estate investments of at least $500,000.Since 2015, U.S. Immigration Fund has spent $1.4 million lobbying against changes to the EB-5 program, which was intended to finance development in poor neighborhoods but has morphed into a source of cheap financing for luxury real estate projects.Kushner Companies has been one of U.S. Immigration Fund\u2019s big clients, helping the Kushners raise money from Chinese investors.Last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, wrote to Mr. Trump urging the Department of Homeland Security to finish regulations that would make it harder for real estate developers to use the program to fund projects in wealthy areas.\u201cCertain EB-5 interest groups are telling investors they have \u2018bought off the White House\u2019 and that your administration will never allow the EB-5 regulations to take effect,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote. \u201cThese comments are very disturbing.\u201dMr. Mastroianni described his investment in the Kushners\u2019 buildings as \u201cjust an opportunity that was brought to us.\u201d He said the investment had no connection to the EB-5 work the firm had done for Kushner Companies. He added: \u201cWe are along for the ride.\u201dKushner Companies has continued to do deals in 2018. In March, it bought a pair of apartment buildings in Hackensack, N.J., for about $102 million, with financial backing from a firm run by Andrew Farkas, according to a previously unreported securities filing.While Mr. Farkas hasn\u2019t been vocal in seeking to influence federal policymaking, he has repeatedly worked with a prominent businessman from the United Arab Emirates, where Mr. Kushner is a point person for American foreign policy.Mr. Farkas attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural ball in January 2017 with his frequent business partner, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the chief executive of the emirates\u2019 powerful ports operator, DP World. Mr. Farkas has previously done deals with the Kushners, and he worked with Mr. Trump on a planned Dubai project that ultimately stalled.The most important deal for the Kushner family this year is Brookfield\u2019s investment in 666 Fifth Avenue.Jared and Charles Kushner bought the building near the peak of the real estate market in 2007. Loans totaling $1.4 billion on the building are due in February, and the entire property is worth less than $1 billion by some estimates. (Jared Kushner sold his stake in the building to the trust controlled by his mother.)For two years, the Kushners have been trying to find someone to salvage their investment. Those efforts repeatedly failed. The company had conversations about a possible bailout with China\u2019s Anbang Insurance Group \u2014 with close ties to the Chinese government \u2014 and current and former government officials from Qatar.The deal with Brookfield\u2019s property arm, which is partly owned by the Qatari government, was tentatively reached this spring, a few months after Brookfield announced its $4.6 billion purchase of Westinghouse.Because Brookfield is a foreign company and Westinghouse operates in the nuclear industry, the acquisition is subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius. The committee is made up of senior members of at least nine United States government agencies, including the State and Treasury Departments.Over the years, the body has forced many foreign companies to drop or change their proposed deals in the United States.Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been pushing officials in Saudi Arabia to hire American companies like Westinghouse to build nuclear power plants. In order for American companies to participate, though, United States law requires Saudi Arabia to sign a nonproliferation agreement, and it is not clear whether the kingdom is prepared to do that.William K.

Cuomo has always been a big-money politician, relying on large benefactors to accumulate a $31.1 million war chest. But even as he emerged as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific fund-raisers, he has all but ignored grass-roots contributors.But campaign disclosures on Tuesday revealed the extent to which Mr. Cuomo remains dependent on big donors \u2014 and some of the maneuvers undertaken to obscure that fact.One donor contributed 69 times to Mr. Cuomo in the final days before the deadline \u2014 67 of them $1 donations, driving down his average donation size. The donor, Christopher Kim, shares the same address on his filing as one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign aides, Julia Yang.\u201cWe appreciate his enthusiasm,\u201d said Abbey Collins, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign. \u201cGoing forward, we\u2019ll put measures in place to count contributions like this differently.\u201dBut Mr. Kim was just one in a line of aides, relatives, roommates, allies, appointees and lobbyists sprinkled through Mr. Cuomo\u2019s filing, giving tiny sums like $1 and $5.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s former finance director and current adviser, Jennifer Bayer Michaels, whose firm received $126,500 from Mr. Cuomo in the filing period, donated $5.Other small donors included the father of one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s spokeswomen (who gave $1), the lobbyist father of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s top aide (who gave $10), as well as others who share addresses with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s paid campaign staff. Another lobbyist gave checks of $10,000, $5,000 and $50 in the period.Jaynne C. Keyes, a Cuomo appointee to the state arts council married to a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s father, gave Mr. Cuomo $20,000 on July 9. Days later, she followed that up with two more donations \u2014 for $5 each.The cumulative effect of these donations was negligible: of the $6 million raised in the last six months, only 1 percent came from those donating $250 or less. All told, Mr. Cuomo earned more in interest payments on his campaign war chest (nearly $154,000) than he collected in total contributions from donors who gave less than $1,000 (just under $110,000).\u201cI think they\u2019re experimenting with how to do this and you are always innovating and trying to figure out the best ways,\u201d said Chris Coffey, a Democratic strategist who has given some informal advice to the Cuomo campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know there is anything wrong with taking very small donations.\u201dOn Monday, before releasing the full report, the Cuomo campaign had touted that 57 percent of his contributions were for $250 or less and his most common contribution was a mere $5. Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign on Tuesday accused the governor of running an \u201cAstroTurf campaign,\u201d and highlighted her more than 30,000 donations.Overall, the filings reveal the depth of the challenge that lies ahead for Ms. Nixon, who trailed Mr. Cuomo in a recent public poll by 35 percentage points. She reported less than $660,000 cash-on-hand compared with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s $31.1 million.In fact, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s report showed that so far he has spent more on television ads, $1.7 million, than Ms. Nixon has raised in total. He spent another $93,000 on polling.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s financial edge has only expanded in recent months, as he added large contributions from powerful institutional donors such as the New York A.F.L.-C.I.O. ($65,000), the state nurses association ($64,600), and Viacom Telecommunications LLC ($50,000). Billy Joel and Alexis Joel each reported $26,992 in in-kind contributions to Mr. Cuomo, as well, this month.A spokeswoman for the Winklevoss brothers said, \u201cThey contributed to Governor Cuomo\u2019s campaign because they believe he\u2019s doing a great job, is a problem-solver, and is definitely the right person to lead New York in the years ahead.\u201d A Cuomo campaign spokeswoman said contributions do not influence government action.Ms. Nixon and Marc Molinaro, the Republican nominee for governor, had both called on Mr. Cuomo to give away the funds.Some of Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign aides also appear on her donor reports, including Rebecca Katz, a top adviser who hosted a fund-raiser for her. She gave $3,500 and five other smaller donations, a pattern noted by the Cuomo campaign.\u201cWe rolled out a new low-dollar campaign to reach a wide variety of supporters and as part of that effort reached out to our network, just as Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign has dozens of contributions from her staff and their family members,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Ms. Katz said that some of her donations went for \u201csome of Cynthia\u2019s campaign merch,\u201d including a \u201cWhat the F?\u201d T-shirt with a #CuomosMTA hashtag, featuring the F train logo. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to suggest that that\u2019s comparable to the Cuomo campaign\u2019s systematic effort to juice the numbers to make up for a lack of genuine grass-roots support,\u201d she said.Some other members of Ms. Nixon\u2019s team also gave $1, which Ms. Katz said had been used to test the functions of their website. Unlike Mr. Cuomo, Ms. Nixon is less in need of small donations and more in need of large ones.She added a couple of donations from fellow actresses, including $10,000 from Lena Dunham, $11,000 from Susan Sarandon and $1,000 from Chelsea Handler.Ms. Nixon\u2019s average contribution was around $50. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s was about $3,100.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revealed: The People Behind an Anti-Breitbart Twitter Account", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust after the 2016 election, an anonymously run Twitter account emerged with a plan to choke off advertising dollars to Breitbart News, the hard-edge, nationalist website closely tied to President Trump\u2019s administration.\u201cThe way it happened sucks, but I\u2019m super proud of this thing and of all the people who worked on it and all the people who followed it,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said in his first interview since his involvement in the account was revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that we made advertisers think a little bit and realize what they\u2019re supporting.\u201dMr. Rivitz did not expect to rock the ad and media worlds with Sleeping Giants, which he viewed as an apolitical crusade against hate speech. While he is a registered Democrat, he said he had never been politically active outside of attending \u201cmaybe two marches pre-election.\u201d Most of his work for advertisers was focused on television commercials and did not involve social media. He wasn\u2019t a particularly active Twitter user.But Mr. Rivitz said he was struck by what he viewed as \u201cincredibly bigoted and racist and sexist\u201d content on Breitbart News, including in its comment sections, after his first visit to the site in November 2016. The site had gained prominence because of its ties to Stephen K. Bannon, its former chairman, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\u201cI was pretty amazed at the stuff they were printing, and my next thought, being in advertising, was, \u2018Who is knowingly supporting this stuff?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI thought maybe it would be two to three companies, and I quickly realized within a couple hours it was all placed programmatically.\u201dMr. Rivitz was referring to the automated systems that place most online ads and tend to target consumers based on who they are, rather than which site they are visiting.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like the advertisers would want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI just set up this anonymous Twitter handle and set up an anonymous email and just went for it, because I wanted to contact one advertiser \u2014 a progressive loan company from San Francisco.\u201d (The company, Social Finance, quickly pulled its ads.)Brian Glicklich, a spokesman for Breitbart, said, \u201cThe specific allegations they make about our content being racist, sexist or bigoted are false.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the idea behind Sleeping Giants was to inform advertisers, rather than to force boycotts. Breitbart News saw the account\u2019s mission differently.\u201cSleeping Giants\u2019 political playbook is to attack opposing speech through harassment and false claims to try to drive it out of business,\u201d Mr. Glicklich said. \u201cThey and others have failed at this every time it has been attempted. Democracy flourishes from more conversation, not less, which is why Matt Rivitz\u2019s speech suppression through economic force is among the most reviled techniques of coercion.\u201dMs. Jammi, who said her previous interest in politics had amounted to nothing more than following the news, discussed anonymity \u201cearly and often\u201d with Mr. Rivitz.\u201cInitially, we were kind of freaked out at the alt-right influence, and, obviously, one of our primary concerns was staying safe,\u201d she said.Since Sleeping Giants got its start, a great number of brands have taken steps to make sure that they do not appear on Breitbart. The site had about 649 advertisers on its website last month, showing around 1,902 different display ads, according to data from Moat Pro, a digital ad intelligence product. That was down from 3,300 advertisers and 11,500 display ads in November 2016. (Sleeping Giants\u2019 count of departed advertisers is closer to 4,000.)Critics have accused Sleeping Giants of engaging in a form of censorship, a criticism that Mr. Rivitz rejected.\u201cThere are plenty of conservative- and liberal-leaning news organizations that are doing everything in good faith and are talking about policy without bringing divisiveness and racism into it, and that\u2019s where the break is with some of these websites,\u201d he said.He added that he had received a barrage of threats and harassment in the wake of the Daily Caller article, which also named his wife and friends.Ms. Jammi, who was not named by The Daily Caller, said she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of harassment to expect, now that her role had been made public. She added that she hoped the attention would raise scrutiny of the big-tech platforms that kept advertisers in the dark.\u201cBreitbart is where we started, but ultimately the problem is not Breitbart or The Daily Caller \u2014 the problem is the tech companies,\u201d Ms. Jammi said. \u201cI fully support that right for them to write whatever they want. What I have a problem with is Facebook and Twitter monetizing it.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the Sleeping Giants community had grown so robust that he felt like an administrator. Still, he said, its mission remains the same.\u201cPeople can use their free speech to say whatever they want and print whatever they want, and that\u2019s what makes this country great,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean they need to get paid for it, especially by an advertiser who didn\u2019t know they were paying for it.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rough Rio de Janeiro Neighborhood, Ballet as \u2018Anesthetic\u2019 and Escape", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRio de Janeiro DispatchRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The young ballet students walked into the room with red paint \u2014 simulated blood stains \u2014 smeared all over their leotards.It was a macabre costume for girls as young as 7 and 8, performing before the mayor and governor.To understand why their beloved ballet teacher, Daiana Ferreira de Oliveira, put them in those outfits, it helps to go back to a formative day of her own childhood.Ms. Oliveira was 6 or 7 when her mother first brought her and her two sisters from their home in an impoverished neighborhood in northern Rio de Janeiro to the majestic Municipal Theater downtown for a production of \u201cSwan Lake.\u201dThe family stood out: a black single mother who made a living cleaning homes, guiding her gobsmacked daughters through crowds of mostly white theatergoers and across the gilded entrance of one of the city\u2019s architectural gems for their first ballet.Her mother, Rosali Ferreira dos Santos, had developed a fascination with art after tagging along with her bosses to art galleries and the theater. She came to see such outings \u2014 to a concert, an opera or a play \u2014 as essential for her daughters, whenever she could find free or discounted tickets.\u201cMy mother said we needed to have culture,\u201d Ms. Oliveira, 29, said. \u201cFor her it wasn\u2019t a matter of being rich or poor.\u201dMs. Oliveira said she could have lived without the opera, recalling being horrified at \u201call those people screaming at each other.\u201dBut dance dazzled her.\u201cAn anesthetic,\u201d she called it. \u201cFor people like us, there were no shrinks.\u201dSince moving to Rio de Janeiro, I\u2019ve been fascinated \u2014 and often startled \u2014 by the split-screen reality of this megacity.I grew up in Colombia, where, as in much of South America, stark inequality is so institutionalized it\u2019s easy to become inured to it. But the way splendor and poverty coexist here in Rio makes for a head-snapping contrast.In the city\u2019s dizzying spectrum between rapture and despair, Manguinhos, the neighborhood where Ms. Oliveira grew up, leans solidly toward the latter.It is among the patchwork of districts known as favelas, which were settled by squatters decades ago. Traffickers from the powerful drug gang Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, have held sway in the area for many years, wielding more authority than the police.It is the kind of place where residents don\u2019t expect homicides will be investigated, never mind solved. Drugs are sold in the open, laid out on tables. Garbage is disposed of by burning small piles at a time on sidewalks.When Ms. Oliveira earned her degree in physical education in 2012, the situation in Brazil was starting to look up.The country\u2019s economy had been growing at a healthy clip for a decade. Education opportunities for the poor were expanding. Grand plans were drawn up to establish a permanent police presence in, and deliver basic services to, the favelas, as the country prepared for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.One of the tangible signs of change was a state-financed library in Manguinhos, where Ms. Oliveira began offering free classical ballet lessons in 2014.She said she tried to be warm but firm toward her students, warning them about unplanned pregnancies and urging them not to date drug traffickers.\u201cThere is no set destiny,\u201d she would tell the girls and young women. \u201cJust because you were born in a favela does not mean your life needs to play out a certain way. You don\u2019t need to end up working as maids.\u201dThe message resonated with Danice Sales, one of her first students, who went on to study Italian literature.\u201cIt was an escape from reality,\u201d said Ms. Sales, 29. \u201cI went through very hard things in my life and the only thing that allowed me to avoid going on medication and sinking into a deep depression was ballet.\u201dBy 2014, optimism gave way to dread as Brazil\u2019s economy began contracting and a giant corruption investigation exposed a systemic pattern of kickbacks among the country\u2019s political and business leaders. State officials in Rio de Janeiro began shutting down government employment centers and initiatives that had been inaugurated during the boom years.Among those on the chopping block was the library in Manguinhos, which prompted Ms. Oliveira to take her students to protests in 2015.She and other community activists persuaded the mayor\u2019s office to help pay the bills by repeatedly raising an uncomfortable question: \u201cHow can a country hosting the Olympics shut down libraries?\u201dBut a few months after the Games wrapped up, the library and scores of government programs closed. Ms. Oliveira fumed for a few days. Then she came up with a plan.With the help of a locksmith who refused to charge her, Ms. Oliveira broke into the abandoned library, cleaned it up and installed her own padlock.Next, a bit of favela diplomacy was in order. Ms. Oliveira sought out a leader of the Red Command and asked him to spare the library from the ransacking that befell other shuttered government buildings. The trafficker, who respected what she was doing, agreed.Even as violence worsened, and unemployment grew, dozens of parents continued to bring their daughters, and a few sons, to Ms. Oliveira\u2019s classes.\u201cIt was a way for them to understand the outside world, a world that does not exist here,\u201d said Tatiane Ribeiro Barboza, 40, who has two daughters in the troupe. But the main draw was exposing them to Ms. Oliveira. \u201cThey see a woman who has no weaknesses,\u201d she said.Giovana Xavier, an education professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said role models in communities like Manguinhos can have a transformative effect on youth.\u201cA big challenge is building positive references about what it means to be black,\u201d Ms. Xavier said. \u201cThe prevailing notions you see in the media are generally limited to criminality, in the case of men, and hypersexualization, in the case of women.\u201dIsabelle Sande, 15, one of the dance students in Manguinhos, said ballet has made her disciplined and politically minded. She was eager, for instance, to participate in a performance about feminism.\u201cIt\u2019s a taboo subject in the favela,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is the beginning of a path to assert yourself, to gain consciousness.\u201dMs. Oliveira was less than elated by the news. The library had opened during an election year and now it would be reopening during another one. Politicians always seemed eager to use photos of her troupe during campaigns, she complained, but did nothing to support her after an election.So when Ms. Oliveira was asked to prepare a special choreography for the reopening ceremony, which would be attended by Rio de Janeiro Governor Luiz Fernando Pez\u00e3o and Mayor Marcelo Crivella, she decided to give them a photo opportunity to remember.\u201cI reflected on all that has been taken from us, the violations, the violence, not just physical but psychological,\u201d she said. \u201cEach day it feels like we die a little because each day something is taken from us, be it a book or a plate of food.\u201dShe did not tell officials about the choreography she had planned.So, flanked by a gaggle of photographers, the mayor and governor looked ashen when the young dancers streamed into the room, with the red splashes of paint on their costumes, and laid on the floor, playing dead.\u201cWe are not votes!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIf the library closes after the election, we will be back here and we will stay put.\u201dWhen she was done, she asked the dancers to rise.\u201cYou are not dead,\u201d she told them. \u201cThis was just a way of noting that every day here, we\u2019ve been bleeding.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tinder Moment, a Gift From OkCupid and a Bumble Officiant", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe couple met on the online dating platform four years ago. They went on their first date at a bar near Grand Central Terminal after exchanging messages about their mutual love of snowboarding, their families and their jobs. Ms. Walsh is currently director of sales for Bliss, a spa and skincare company, while Mr. Walsh is a foreman for Metro-North Railroad.Now that they were engaged, they wanted their matchmaker at the wedding. \u201cIf I had met Mike through a friend or colleague or acquaintance, I would have invited them to my wedding,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cSo why not invite the people behind the scenes of OkCupid who made it all happen?\u201dThey addressed a random invitation to the team with a note saying they had met through the site and couldn\u2019t thank them enough for making the connection. Although no one from OkCupid attended their wedding, they were shocked to not only get a response card back but a baking dish from Crate & Barrel listed on their registry. \u201cI work in a headquarters, I know how busy it can get,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cSo for them to take the time to send well-wishes, that is lovely.\u201dOthers ask the startups to make their offices available for proposals (it is the closest place resembling where the couple met); to sponsor parts of the wedding (imagine a Tinder-branded photo booth); even to officiate ceremonies.\u201cI\u2019ve been asked to marry people so many times, I got ordained to do it,\u201d said Alex Williamson, the head of brand for Bumble. \u201cI don\u2019t really find it so weird. It\u2019s exciting to be part of a brand that people are proud of. They met the love of their life on it.\u201dIn November, Ms. Williamson traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, to marry Olivia Canlas, 36, and Lee Alexander, 37, 141 days after they met on Bumble. Wanting to share their story with family and friends, they reached out to the company. \u201cInitially we thought it would be awesome if Bumble had some presence like branded cookies or champagne glasses,\u201d said Ms. Canlas. \u201cObviously it escalated. Our guests loved it.\u201dSimilarly, when Daniel Rubin, a 31-year-old criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles, was proposing to Nikki Rubin, 26, who is studying to be a speech pathologist, he knew Tinder had to be part of the equation. \u201cWe were always known in our friendship circle as the longest lasting relationship to meet on Tinder, and we wanted to embrace that,\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have even met if it wasn\u2019t for the app.\u201dSo he asked the company if he could pop the question in their West Hollywood, Calif., headquarters.He told Ms. Rubin he had to look at office space for a friend. The doors opened, and she saw a huge sign with their Tinder profile pictures and the heart sign signifying a match. \u201cThis was the last thing I could have expected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was super original, creative, and cool. It\u2019s so much part of our identity.\u201dFor this couple, their friends and family understood how much they value their online dating provider. \u201cWhen we tell them our engagement story, people always respond with, \u2018Oh man, I need to get on Tinder,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rubin said.Ms. Walsh, however, remembers her finance\u2019s grandparents being very confused about why a random person from a corporation was getting a prime spot on the guest list. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought it was meant for family and friends, and why would we invite strangers? It took a lot of convincing on our end. We had to explain that we just feel very, very connected to them, and we have so much gratitude.\u201dDating platforms are currently trying to navigate this demand from users.\u201cWe do not take the invitations lightly,\u201d said Rosette Pambakian, head of brand marketing and communications for Tinder. \u201cWe send Champagne, we send personalized gifts. The stories are moving, so we selectively do what we can.\u201dBumble has two staff members whose duties include responding to engaged couples who reach out. The company may send wine flutes, flowers, or gifts from registries. It also has a budget to give select users extravagant wedding-related experiences. Bumble recently planned and paid for a proposal in Brooklyn that involved bringing the woman into a winter-themed warehouse and pelting her with fake snowballs from behind trees planted for the event.OkCupid sends framed copies of the first messages pairs exchanged over the platform \u201cIf we know they talked about wine or connected because they both volunteer for the A.C.L.U., we will also buy them a case they love or donate to the charity in their name,\u201d said Melissa Hobley, the brand\u2019s chief marketing officer.\u201cThere is a little bit of a small business move in all of this,\u201d Ms. Hobley said. \u201cWhat better proof that a dating app can help you find your person than a beautiful story of exactly that? And people talk. They say, \u2018Look what I got today from OkCupid.\u2019\u201dAs their clientele matures, these enterprises are also looking ahead to the next step: babies. If couples reach out to Bumble with news of a pregnancy they will send presents including baby beanies, onesies, blankets, and socks, all with Bumble\u2019s hive logo. Tinder already has a name for the next generation: Tinder Tots.The Walshes are currently expecting their first child. \u201cWe were talking about it, and we will probably invite OkCupid to the baby shower, and we will absolutely send pictures and another thank you note and to let them know we are pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cWe might even end up making the baby shower have a cupid theme.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Insecurity Shadows Mali\u2019s President. It May Also Help Him Get Re-Elected.", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAMAKO, Mali \u2014 Reports of military abuses and extravagant spending have shadowed him. His term in office has been pockmarked by terrorist attacks on peacekeepers and even a luxury hotel. Critics of Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta, have taken to chanting, \u201cFather must quit.\u201dBut at a recent campaign rally as he runs for re-election in a vote on Sunday, Mr. Ke\u00efta, 73, stood in a crisp white flowing gown before a throng of supporters in Bamako and defiantly responded, \u201cFather won\u2019t quit.\u201dYet Mr. Ke\u00efta, with a flush campaign fund and a raft of challengers, is likely to be re-elected, analysts say, in part because the violence could keep many people from the polls. Speaking about security issues, the president recently told journalists that Mali suffered from only \u201cpockets of violence.\u201dMr. Ke\u00efta promotes his achievements on billboards lining the streets. One features a little girl doing homework under a lamp and brags about the spread of electricity. Others boast of new access to potable drinking water.\u201cTogether, let\u2019s march toward progress,\u201d reads one billboard.But the memory of Mali\u2019s near collapse six years ago is still raw.In 2012, low-ranking soldiers in Mali, a former French colony, overthrew the government, saying they were fed up with being underequipped to fight rebels who benefited from of a flood of weapons that poured in after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.In 2013, the same year Mr. Ke\u00efta was elected and replaced the transitional government that followed the coup, French troops swooped in and chased the group from the area.At the same time, clashes between ethnic groups have spiked. Fatouma Barry fled her village after rumors of violence between ethnic Fulani and Dogon people. She headed to a displaced persons camp on the outskirts of Bamako. Her home now is a large white tent next to dozens of other Fulani women and children.\u201cI\u2019m going to vote, but not for the current president,\u201d Ms. Barry said. \u201cLook at us here.\u201dIn 2014, the International Monetary Fund temporarily halted $70 million worth of aid money citing concerns about Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s purchase of a $40 million presidential jet. He also was criticized for a round of expensive trips abroad early in his presidency \u2014 when he had yet to visit the beleaguered northern region of his own country \u2014 as well as political appointments that went to members of his family, including his son.Under Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s leadership, Mali\u2019s economy has bounced back from losses suffered during the 2012 coup. Much of Mali\u2019s growth is tied to prices of commodities like gold and cotton. Recent rainfall has helped the cotton crop; gold prices, after dipping, are on the rise again.But the country is still among the world\u2019s 25 poorest and is heavily reliant on foreign aid. Most Malians eke out a living as farmers, herders or fishermen, relying on the fertile area near the Niger River to survive. More than half of the country is a punishing desert crisscrossed by members of Islamist groups and migrants making their way to Libya where they set sail on the Mediterranean in hopes of a better life in Europe.Like many nations in the region, Mali is undergoing a growth boom with its population, about 18 million, expected to double in the next 17 years. The median age here is just 15.8.Young voters between the ages of 23 and 33 make up a third of all registered voters, according to the consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. Many have mobilized to express their frustrations with Mr. Ke\u00efta.\u201cWe think his term in office has been a disaster,\u201d said Mohammed Yousuf Bathily, a youth activist and radio personality who coined the \u201cFather Must Quit\u201d slogan.Mr. Bathily recently pledged his support to Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9, a former finance minister and the most popular rival candidate of 24 on the ballot.\u201cThe problem of insecurity has deepened,\u201d Mr. Ciss\u00e9 said in an interview. \u201cThe people feel a big frustration and sense of betrayal.\u201dConcerns about voter fraud have also been raised in recent days. The campaign manager of Mr. Ciss\u00e9 and another candidate, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, have accused the government of irregularities in voter rolls.\u201cWe are heading toward a lot of questioning of the results for this election,\u201d said Mr. Diarra, an astrophysicist who is a citizen of both Mali and the United States.\u201cThe stakes for the election are high,\u201d said Kalilou Sidib\u00e9, a professor of international relations at the University of Law and Political Science in Bamako, \u201cand Mali\u2019s democracy and future peace depend on the transparency of the process.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Mali\u2019s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta.

If your project needs a \u2018star\u2019 for financing, then it\u2019s simply not good enough.\u201dPeople who are not transgender have been quick to shout things like, \u201cThis is why it\u2019s called \u2018acting!\u2019 \u201d and to wonder what the fuss is all about. Cisgender folks who\u2019ve never walked in our shoes can\u2019t believe the hubris of trans people insisting that we play ourselves in film and television roles, rather than having other people imitate us.Megyn Kelly assembled a whole panel of people on her show on Thursday who agreed that objecting to Ms. Johansson\u2019s casting \u201ctakes away from the creativity of Hollywood.\u201d Incredibly, of the four panelists, including Ms. Kelly, not a single one was trans. Which, if you think about it, is kind of like putting together a group to talk about the #MeToo movement that consists only of men.It\u2019s true, of course, that creativity and imagination are at the core of an actor\u2019s craft. At the same time, some kinds of casting are simply insulting and offensive, Mr. Rooney\u2019s \u201cMr. Yunioshi\u201d being one painful example. The use of blackface, to say the least, is another.But the days of transface are numbered. \u201cI\u2019d like to be the last cis man playing a transgender woman,\u201d Mr. Tambor said, when he accepted his Emmy for Transparent in 2016 (in a role from which he has since been fired). \u201cIt\u2019s time to hand out the keys to the kingdom and open the gates.\u201dThere are two reasons why we should open those gates. First, as Ms. Richards makes clear, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of trans actors ready to play these parts. We deserve the chance to represent our own truth.Secondly, there\u2019s usually something slightly off when cisgender actors play us. People who aren\u2019t trans don\u2019t see it; they give each other awards and weepily hail their bravery. Jared Leto and Eddie Redmayne were lauded for their courage in portraying trans women on film (\u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d and \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d) \u2014 but not so much by transgender women themselves, many of whom found the performances mannered, studied and implausible.If you haven\u2019t walked in our shoes, you wouldn\u2019t notice the difference. But we have, and we do.Trans actors should play trans roles because we can do the best job. The freedom to live our lives out loud ought to include the chance to make art from the complex, difficult, joyful reality of our lives.When Hollywood tells us that they love us, that we belong to them, we need to resist.Like Holly Golightly, we need to say, once and for all, \u201cI\u2019ll never let anyone put me in a cage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Doctors and Health Workers Reflect on Rural America\u2019s Limited Access to Care", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedical professionals and health care industry workers describe the hardships involved in trying to provide care in rural areas. Kela Abernathy\u2019s urgent ride to the Missouri hospital where she would give birth to premature twins covered 100 miles, took nearly four hours, and featured one stop at a hospital that couldn\u2019t help because its labor and delivery ward was defunct. In the comment section for the article, we heard from rural doctors and health care industry workers whose facilities have instigated some of these changes. And we heard from urban medical professionals familiar with the economics of providing health care in rural America.Both shared personal stories that explained why rural doctors and hospitals are getting out of the obstetrics business, and some described their own financial challenges. Here is a condensed and edited selection of some of the comments.I too have been in that ambulance with a laboring patient flying down snowy country roads toward the closest obstetric center, and reading this story brought back some harrowing memories. Unfortunately, that is a reality of rural life in North America, the hollowing out of communities and the migration of the rural young to cities. How many times have I heard someone tell me, \u201cThey used to have a nursery here\u201d (now a waiting room) or \u201cIn the \u201980s there was actually a small surgical practice here\u201d (now a storage room with an old gas blender as a witness). However, in Canada, where hospitals and health networks are coordinated by the provinces, at least critical transports and referrals to tertiary centers occur in a comparatively timely fashion. The key to this system is the true heroes: the rural family physicians. They are still practicing in the mold of their forebears, servicing community members in their towns from birth to grave, with house calls not unheard-of. I would say that it is vital for rural communities to recruit and retain compassionate, smart and motivated primary care doctors (a problem everywhere). But just as importantly, from a policy perspective, states need to take over and manage medical assets in rural counties in a similar vein as the Tennessee Valley Authority did for power and land management. A patchwork of competing health networks, spurring innovation, may work in the cities but clearly does not serve rural counties.In my professional career, I struggled for over 15 years to provide health care to several locations in exurbia and to rural parts of the country, with only limited success. Victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan. Reasons for my personal difficulties were numerous but mostly out of my control. Local civic leaders lacked vision and local citizens often lacked resources to pay for and support medical services. I ultimately chose to jump ship to a medical system with deep financial backing and a supreme transportation infrastructure, ending my medical career in service to the U.S. Navy. As a physician, I once spent two years in a very rural part of California as part of the National Health Care Service. We had a small 10-bed hospital, now out of business. I was a family practitioner who also did obstetrics. Malpractice for delivering babies back then was reasonable; it has since become very costly. It is economically infeasible nowadays to practice obstetrics in rural areas. One needs a large practice to compensate for the high malpractice premiums. Among all the other problems of American health care, the litigious nature of our culture also affects the cost of health care.In residency for OB-GYN, our tertiary care system served 29 counties in our state. Folks would routinely drive one to two hours for prenatal visits and delivery, and this was 15 years ago. Whenever any woman was high risk, none of the smaller local groups would take them out of fear of litigation or bad outcomes. That\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle. The main issue I\u2019ve seen working in health care is consolidation of smaller systems into larger collectives. Smaller rural hospitals are bought by the larger systems, which in turn buy out practices, and end up owning everything in a three to five county radius \u2014 sometimes more. The system shunts patients to their main facilities and either closes or cuts back on services offered at the smaller hospitals. It\u2019s not surprising, because it is a balancing of limited resources in a for-profit system, but it does leave the most vulnerable without access to care.If you can\u2019t travel, you are out of luck. What\u2019s more, the access vans available to our Medicaid patients are limited and often don\u2019t travel out of county. I\u2019ve had patients show up four hours before their appointments, willing to wait, because that was the only time the van could bring them. Maybe our C.E.O. would be willing to take a pay cut to pour some resources back into our community.I live in a community of 40,000 near Seattle and the publicly built hospital in my city was acquired by a national Catholic hospital chain, which developed a plan to close the hospital and move services to an unincorporated area with fewer low-income patients.

{"Headline": "Yad Vashem Rebukes Israeli and Polish Governments Over Holocaust Law", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Polish law, which made it illegal to accuse Poland of complicity in the Holocaust, was amended last week. The two leaders \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki \u2014 issued their statement in an effort to put the controversy over the law behind them.Among other things, it objected to the statement\u2019s assertion that the wartime Polish government-in-exile tried to stop the systematic murder of Polish Jews in Nazi death camps by trying to raise awareness among the Western allies, and that it \u201ccreated a mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people.\u201dYad Vashem, a venerated state institution and the country\u2019s hallowed authority on Holocaust education, documentation and research, said \u201cexisting documentation and decades of historical research yield a totally different picture.\u201dThe Polish government-in-exile and its representatives in occupied Poland \u201cdid not act resolutely on behalf of Poland\u2019s Jewish citizens at any point during the war,\u201d Yad Vashem said. \u201cMuch of the Polish resistance in its various movements not only failed to help the Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them.\u201dYad Vashem also said that even after the amendment of the law, its \u201cessence\u201d was the same, and raised the possibility of harm to \u201cthe historical memory of the Holocaust.\u201dThe original law had been furiously condemned in Israel. Since then, Israeli and Polish representatives have conducted months of intense, quiet dialogue that culminated in the changes to the law.Mr. Netanyahu welcomed the amendment, saying in a statement on June 27, \u201cOur ties with Poland are very important and are based on trust.\u201d He then read aloud, in English, the full text of the joint statement, which he said he was making with the prime minister of Poland.That was supposed to lay the controversy to rest.Then on Thursday, the Polish government took out paid advertisements and published the joint statement, in English and Hebrew, in Israeli newspapers, soon after similar advertisements ran in the German press.That prompted the unusually forthright rebuke from Yad Vashem, an independent body that is partly financed by the Israeli government and that is also known as the World Holocaust Remembrance Center.In Israel, home to tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors, the Polish law has touched a sensitive nerve.Some remembered the help extended by individual Poles, but many more were outraged at what they saw as a Polish government effort to whitewash the crimes of Poles who collaborated with the Nazis.While there is shared pain, there is also plenty of residual anger: Of the six million Poles killed during World War II, three million were Jews \u2014 nearly half of all the Jews killed in the Holocaust.The first signs of trouble for the Israeli-Polish agreement came last week when Yehuda Bauer, 92, a Yad Vashem historian, described the joint statement in a radio interview as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that \u201churt the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust.\u201dThe negotiators added that she had approved the historical clauses appearing in the joint statement.Professor Porat, who has been Yad Vashem\u2019s chief historian since 2011 and is also professor emeritus of modern Jewish history at Tel Aviv University, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday and was not answering her phone.A spokesman for Yad Vashem, Simmy Allen, said that if Professor Porat had been involved in the drafting of the joint statement, she was not representing Yad Vashem in that role.Relishing the opportunity to excoriate Mr. Netanyahu, who is battling multiple corruption investigations, his rivals weighed in from the political left, right and center.This is not the first time Yad Vashem has called out Mr. Netanyahu.The renewed Holocaust uproar in Israel hit Poland as it was engrossed in an internal upheaval over its government\u2019s efforts to purge the judges of its Supreme Court.Bartosz Cichocki, the vice minister of foreign affairs and the leader of the Polish group for legal and historical dialogue with Israel, said the position expressed by Mr. Netanyahu in the joint statement of late June was \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cbinding.\u201d\u201cWe follow the internal Israeli debate with great interest,\u201d Mr. Cichocki said in a radio interview. \u201cIt is our deep conviction that it confirms the necessity of further tightening the cooperation.\u201dHe said that process should take place not only through the joint efforts of scientific and educational institutions, but also through the dialogue groups established by both governments.Anatol Magdziarz contributed reporting from Warsaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Affordable Housing Crisis Grows, HUD Sits on the Sidelines", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The country is in the grips of an escalating housing affordability crisis. Millions of low-income Americans are paying 70 percent or more of their incomes for shelter, while rents continue to rise and construction of affordable rental apartments lags far behind the need.The Trump administration\u2019s main policy response, unveiled this spring by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development: a plan to triple rents for about 712,000 of the poorest tenants receiving federal housing aid and to loosen the cap on rents on 4.5 million households enrolled in federal voucher and public housing programs nationwide, with the goal of moving longtime tenants out of the system to make way for new ones.As city and state officials and members of both parties clamor for the federal government to help, Mr. Carson has privately told aides that he views the shortage of affordable housing as regrettable, but as essentially a local problem.A former presidential candidate who said last year that he did not want to give recipients of federal aid \u201ca comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say, \u2018I\u2019ll just stay here; they will take care of me,\u2019\u201d he has made it a priority to reduce, rather than expand, assistance to the poor, to break what he sees as a cycle of dependency.And when congressional Democrats and Republicans scrambled to save his department\u2019s budget and rescue an endangered tax credit that accounts for nine out of 10 affordable housing developments built in the country, Mr. Carson sat on the sidelines, according to legislators and congressional staff members.Local officials seem resigned to the fact that they will receive little or no help from the Trump administration.\u201cTo be brutally honest, I think that we aren\u2019t really getting any help right now out of Washington, and the situation has gotten really bad over the last two years,\u201d said Chad Williams, executive director of the Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, which oversees public housing developments and voucher programs that serve 16,000 people in the Las Vegas area.Nevada, ground zero in the housing crisis a decade ago, is now the epicenter of the affordability crunch, with low-income residents squeezed out of once-affordable apartments by working-class refugees fleeing from California\u2019s own rental crisis.\u201cI think Carson\u2019s ideas, that public housing shouldn\u2019t be multigenerational, are noble,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cBut right now these programs are a stable, Band-Aid fix, and we really need them.\u201dUnderlying the conflict between Mr. Carson and officials like Mr. Williams are fundamental disagreements over the role the federal government should play.Mr. Carson believes federal aid should be regarded only as a temporary crutch for families moving from dependency to work and sees the rent increases as a way to expand his agency\u2019s budget. Low-income renters and many local officials who run housing programs see the federal assistance as a semi-permanent hedge against evictions and homelessness that needs to be expanded in times of crisis.This year, the White House proposed to slash $8.8 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s most important housing programs. While aides say Mr. Carson privately pushed for a restoration in programs for seniors and disabled people, he publicly supported the gutting of his own department, reiterating to lawmakers last month that he felt as much responsibility toward taxpayers as tenants.\u201cI continue to advocate for fiscal responsibility as well as compassion,\u201d Mr. Carson told a House committee in June. He declined to comment for this article.Under Mr. Carson\u2019s most significant policy proposal as secretary, so-called minimum rents paid by the poorest households in public housing would rise to $150 a month from $50.His proposal has received little support from local housing operators. Over the past month, Mr. Carson has huddled with Representative Dennis A. Ross, Republican of Florida, who is drafting less stringent legislation that would allow, but not mandate, local housing authorities to raise rents and carry out reforms to streamline the process of verifying the poverty of applicants, aides said.Still, both proposals represent a paradigm shift in federal housing policy, ending the requirement that low-income tenants spend no more than 30 percent of their net income on rent.Tying rents to incomes has been a central part of the system since 1981, especially for the Section 8 housing voucher program, enabling 2.1 million low-income families to rent private apartments they could not otherwise afford. Mr. Carson\u2019s proposal would peg rents to 35 percent of gross income for all tenants. The Ross bill excludes voucher recipients, at the request of local housing authority officials.\u201cWe need sensible reforms to make the system more efficient for agencies and residents,\u201d said Adrianne Todman, chief executive of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. \u201cBut now is not the time for arbitrary federal rent hikes.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t about dependence,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president of the nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group that has released several recent reports documenting the affordability crunch. \u201cToday\u2019s housing crisis is squarely rooted in the widening gap between incomes and housing costs.\u201dAnd the crisis didn\u2019t begin under Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.Median national rents rose by 32 percent in constant dollars from 2001 to 2015, while wages remained flat, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The pace has picked up over the last few years, buoyed by an improving economy.The rent increases are hitting poor and elderly people, African-Americans and low-income wage earners the hardest. A survey by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a worker earning the state minimum wage could afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in only 22 of the country\u2019s 3,000 counties.The Obama administration initially proposed steep increases for Section 8 and other programs, but pulled back after the Republicans won control of the House in 2010.During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama promised to fund an affordable housing trust fund for the construction of new units. But the $200-million-a-year program, funded by the profits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was blocked by Republican lawmakers until 2014. In 2017, it was on track to finance the construction of about 1,000 units of affordable housing in 32 states, according to federal data.Its sister program, the Capital Magnet Fund, which has leveraged private investment to create 17,000 new units, is in the cross hairs of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who tried to cut it by $141.7 million this year as part of his unsuccessful budget recession effort this summer.Under Mr. Trump, funding for public housing, vouchers and new construction has risen slightly \u2014 against the president\u2019s wishes.In March, Republican and Democratic negotiators rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, adding $1.25 billion to HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs and injecting an additional $425 million to the HOME program, which funds state, local, nonprofit and private partnerships to build affordable housing.Those moves, while significant, are likely to have a limited impact on the larger problem of the increasing number of families who cannot afford a place to live.While prices are cooling at the high end of the market in many big cities, the low- and middle-income housing markets in Nevada, Texas, California, Florida and Colorado are so hot, local officials say, that landlords routinely reject subsidized tenants because they can charge more to other renters.Rental construction has focused on attracting high-income tenants. From 2001 to 2013, the number of rental apartments for high-wage earners increased by 36 percent, while units for poor people shrank by nearly 10 percent, according to federal housing statistics.With affordable stock scarce, prices are spiking. An estimated 12 million Americans, most of them poor, now spend more than half of their earnings on housing, according to HUD statistics.One of them is Judith Toro Fortyz, 75, who receives $848 a month in Social Security and pays $594.88 of it to remain in the small two-bedroom apartment on Staten Island that she once shared with her mother.Mrs. Toro Fortyz has been turned down for federal vouchers, reflecting a shortage in assistance that has shut out three of every four eligible applicants for Section 8. Even with an additional housing stipend from the city, she is spending 70 percent of her income on rent.That has forced her to make wrenching decisions, like forgoing her favorite fruit, oranges, after a price spike at her local supermarket.\u201cI stay home a lot. I\u2019d rather not go out because going out means you have to spend money,\u201d said Mrs. Toro Fortyz, a retired data storage worker. \u201cI have a friend who gets Section 8 and, oh my God, they pay $200 a month. I can\u2019t even imagine having that much money to live on.\u201dMr. Carson\u2019s proposal alarmed many low-income tenants, especially older ones, who could face significant rent increases under the plan. \u201cWe basically wouldn\u2019t be able to get by,\u201d said Patrick Greene, 69, a retired truck driver who lives in a small HUD-subsidized apartment with his wife in Montgomery, Ala.A more immediate threat to affordable housing, critics say, is the huge tax bill passed by Congress last year, which imperils one of the most important sources of long-term funding, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.Novogradac & Company, a firm that provides analytics for the construction and finance industries, estimated that demand for the $9-billion-a-year credit could dry up as investors realize savings through the tax cuts. The firm estimates that nearly 235,000 fewer apartments could be built over the next decade as a result of the tax code rewrite.A bipartisan coalition, led by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, was able to expand the credit by an additional $400 million. But that is not likely to offset the damage done by the tax measure.The administration is observing these efforts from the sidelines. Mr. Trump, scion of a New York real estate family that made its fortune in the 1950s and 1960s building affordable housing for white working-class neighborhoods, has shown little interest in tackling the problem.He made only passing mention of the issue during the 2016 campaign and has pressed Mr. Carson to move more aggressively to impose work requirements on federal aid recipients.For his part, Mr. Carson publicly acknowledges the crisis in most of his speeches. \u201cAlarmingly high numbers of Americans continue to pay more than half of their incomes toward rent,\u201d he told a House panel in October. \u201cMany millions remain mired in poverty, rather than being guided on a path out of it.\u201dBut he is focused less on federal solutions than on prodding local governments to ease barriers to construction. He has ordered his policy staff to come up with proposals to push local governments to reduce zoning restrictions on new projects, especially low-cost manufactured housing. HUD will also begin working with landlords around the country to come up with ways to make housing vouchers more attractive and more inclusive, aides said.\u201cSubsidies are a piece of the puzzle,\u201d said Raffi Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Carson, \u201cbut we must also address the regulatory barriers relative to zoning and land use in higher-cost markets that are preventing the construction of new affordable housing.

{"Headline": "Neo-Nazi Terrorist Jailed for Life in Case That Shamed Germany\u2019s Spies", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 The sole surviving member of one of Germany\u2019s deadliest neo-Nazi terrorist groups was sentenced to life imprisonment on Wednesday, in the culmination of a saga that has shamed the country\u2019s security services, strained its relationship with Turkey and fueled accusations of institutional racism.After a trial in Munich that lasted more than five years, the group member, Beate Zsch\u00e4pe, was convicted of 10 counts of murder, with additional counts of attempted murder, robbery, arson and belonging to a terrorist organization.But her conviction and sentencing, almost 18 years after the group\u2019s first victim was killed, seems unlikely to bring closure at a time when German politics have become more fractured and the national discourse more anti-immigrant.The trial started before Germany accepted more than a million refugees and before a far-right party had won any seats in Parliament, let alone become the country\u2019s main opposition.Then as now, however, victims and their families said that the criminal inquiries and subsequent trial had not done enough to expose the group\u2019s network of helpers, with the initial investigators far quicker to suspect people from immigrant backgrounds than to realize that they were being targeted by right-wing terrorists.But as the judges explained their verdict, protesters outside demanded that more people be held accountable.Between 2000 and 2007, Ms. Zsch\u00e4pe, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe B\u00f6hnhardt killed a police officer and nine people from Greek or Turkish backgrounds, mostly shooting workers at small businesses.The court also found they had twice planted bombs in Cologne, a city in western Germany, wounding almost two dozen people, and carried out a series of robberies to finance their terrorist cell, which they called the National Socialist Underground, a reference to the Nazi party\u2019s official name.The police initially sought suspects for the shootings among immigrant groups, questioning members of the victims\u2019 families. One task force was named Bosporus, for the strait in Turkey separating Asia and Europe.German news media referred to the crimes as the \u201cd\u00f6ner\u201d murders because many of those killed had worked in shops selling Turkish-style roasted meat on a skewer.The result was that the neo-Nazi terrorists went unobserved, unsuspected and relatively free to continue their killing spree.Nor was it an official action that cracked open the case.Mr. Mundlos and Mr. B\u00f6hnhardt killed themselves after a botched robbery in 2011. Ms. Zsch\u00e4pe set fire to the apartment where they had been holed up, apparently to get rid of evidence, and walked into a police station a few days later. She has been in custody ever since.In 2013, the president of the German Parliament offered an official apology to the victims\u2019 families. Two federal parliamentary inquiries \u2014 and more than half a dozen state parliamentary inquiries \u2014 have examined the case.Gamze Kubasik, the daughter of Mehmet Kubasik, a Turkish-born kiosk owner who was killed by the trio in the western city of Dortmund in 2006, said at a news conference on Tuesday, \u201cThe N.S.U. killed my father, but the investigators destroyed his honor.\u201dThe Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, also called for further investigation, according to Turkish news media, raising the idea of an official conspiracy.\u201cPunishment of the top suspect and other suspects are not enough,\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu was quoted as saying. \u201cWho are behind these murders in the intelligence service, in the deep state? Which state institutions? They must be revealed and punished too.\u201dTurkey has been involved in the trial since before its beginning, which was delayed by a lawsuit demanding space in court for Turkish reporters. Eight of the 10 murder victims had Turkish roots.The life sentence for Ms. Zsch\u00e4pe, handed down by Munich\u2019s highest state court, came with a judgment of \u201cespecially heavy guilt,\u201d which bars her from seeking parole for 15 years. Her punishment is the most severe available to a German court.After the sentence was read, a lawyer for Ms. Zsch\u00e4pe announced that she would appeal the verdict.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stealth Campaign to Kill Off Obamacare", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut last year, when Republicans mounted an aggressive effort to repeal the law, the group made a point of staying outside the fray. \u201cWe\u2019ve not taken a position,\u201d Stephen Ubl, head of the organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, said in an interview in March 2017.But there was no way the public could have known at the time about PhRMA\u2019s support of the network or the identity of other deep-pocketed financiers behind the group.Unlike groups receiving its funds, PhRMA and similar nonprofits must report the grants in their own Internal Revenue Service filings. But the disclosures don\u2019t occur until months or sometimes more than a year after the donation.(It is impossible to know from public records whether PhRMA donated before or after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, which made repealing the health law a real possibility. In any case, most donations to dark-money groups are not earmarked for a particular program.)Generally speaking, dark-money groups are politically active organizations, often nonprofit, that, under I.R.S. regulations, are not required to disclose the identities of their donors.At a time of high drug prices and its heaviest political expenditures in years, the pharmaceutical industry has directed substantial resources through AAN and other such groups that hide the identity of their donors and have few if any limits on fund-raising.\u201cPhRMA has always been very aggressive and very effective in their influence efforts,\u201d said Michael Beckel, research manager at Issue One, a nonprofit devoted to campaign-finance transparency. \u201cThat includes using these new, dark-money vehicles to influence policy and elections.\u201dPhRMA\u2019s $6.1 million, unrestricted donation to AAN was its single-biggest grant in 2016, dwarfing its $130,000 contribution to the same group the year before. Closely associated with House Republicans \u2014 AAN has a former Republican senator and two former Republican House members on its board \u2014 the group backed the failed G.O.P. health bill intended to replace the Affordable Care Act. It also supported the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade.PhRMA disputes the suggestion that it backs particular actions by the recipients of its donations. \u201cPhRMA engages with groups and organizations that have a wide array of health care opinions and policy priorities,\u201d said its spokesman, Robert Zirkelbach. \u201cIt is inaccurate and would be inappropriate for you to attribute those grants to a specific campaign.\u201dAAN declined several requests for comment.PhRMA\u2019s surge in donations to AAN coincides with the arrival of Mr. Ubl, who took over as president and chief executive in 2015 and has longstanding ties to Norm Coleman, a former United States senator from Minnesota who is now the network\u2019s chairman. Mr. Ubl once ran the lobby for manufacturers of knee implants, heart stents and other medical devices, one of which, Medtronic, is based in Minneapolis.PhRMA also gave $50,000 to Americans for Tax Reform, run by the conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.PhRMA and other trade associations donate to such groups \u201cto avoid attracting attention\u201d amid the political fray, said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which seeks to shed light on corporate political spending. \u201cThey\u2019re achieving their goals by giving money to these folks and helping elect members that are going to be in support of them.\u201dMostly smaller amounts went to centrist and liberal groups. Center Forward, which claims to seek bipartisan, common ground on drug policy and other issues, received $300,000 directly from PhRMA and another $179,000 from a PhRMA-backed group called the Campaign for Medical Discovery, according to tax filings.Mr. Zirkelbach disputed the notion that PhRMA donations to the American Action Network and other groups were intended to achieve specific goals, saying, \u201cWe seek to work with organizations we agree with as well as those where we have disagreements on public policy issues.\u201dMuch of the work by groups connected to PhRMA that take dark money touches health policy and harmonizes with PhRMA\u2019s positions.PhRMA\u2019s dark-money allies push its agenda without disclosing its role, critics say.PhRMA is \u201cspending millions of dollars on politics every cycle, and they\u2019re splitting it up between the state and federal level,\u201d said Robert Maguire, political nonprofits investigator for the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political donations. \u201cThey\u2019re just not running the political ads themselves,\u201d which keeps their name off the product, he said.Caregiver Voices United is \u201cnot influenced\u201d by PhRMA or any other outside group, said John Schall, its president.Dark-money groups received pharmaceutical industry money from individual companies as well, not just the PhRMA trade organization.But the center\u2019s research also shows that many pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t disclose donations made to 501(c)(4) organizations, nor are they legally required to do so.Corporations \u201ccould dump millions into one of these (c)(4)s and nobody would ever know where it came from,\u201d said Steven Billet, a former AT&T lobbyist who teaches political action committee management at George Washington University.This article was produced in collaboration with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

{"Headline": "Erdogan Begins New Term and Names His Son-in-Law Finance Minister", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sworn in on Monday for a five-year term under a new Constitution that gives Turkey\u2019s president sweeping executive powers. He promptly named his son-in-law finance minister, an appointment that unsettled financial markets and raised new concerns about the concentration of so much power in one politician.\u201cWe as Turkey, and the Turkish nation, are making a new start here in your presence,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told hundreds of foreign leaders, dignitaries and party members gathered in the gardens of the presidential palace in Ankara, the capital. \u201cWe will make major moves in every area from macroeconomic balances to investments to make Turkey one of the 10 biggest economies of the world.\u201dThe currency fell further on Monday after Mr. Erdogan named his son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, a former energy minister, as treasury and finance minister. The new cabinet, announced late in the evening, was keenly awaited for an indication of what Mr. Erdogan plans with his newfound powers.Many of the appointments were of bureaucrats; only four were of elected politicians. The foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, kept his position; the former army chief of staff, Hulusi Akar, was named defense minister; and an American-trained bureaucrat, Fuat Oktay, was named vice president.Mr. Oktay had served as under secretary in the prime minister\u2019s office, which was abolished with the transition to a presidential system.\u201cThis means there will be more continuity than change,\u201d Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director in Ankara of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said before the announcement. \u201cThey will be implementers,\u201d he added, \u201cso he is taking things into his own hands.\u201dMr. Erdogan has defended his constitutional change to introduce a strong presidential system \u2014 passed by referendum last year \u2014 as necessary for greater efficiency and a responsive government.\u201cThe presidential government system is not coercive but a specific choice that the history directed us to,\u201d he told his guests. \u201cFor the first time in history since Ottoman times, Turkey made its choice at a critical crossroads not by force of a military coup,\u201d he said, \u201cbut with the free will of our nation.\u201dCritics warn the new presidential system will not solve Turkey\u2019s problems, from growing economic strains to its bitterly divided politics.\u201cIt is completely false that if we change the system problems will be solved,\u201d said Murat Sevinc, a professor of constitutional law who writes a column for the newspaper Duvar. \u201cThey have built a system that is nongovernable, nonmanageable, whoever is elected.\u201dFew Western leaders were present \u2014 the only leader from the European Union was the president of Bulgaria \u2014 although a former chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who has maintained close relations with Mr. Erdogan since his time in office, was present.Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia sat in the front row, alongside the presidents of Somalia, Sudan, Chad and Pakistan. The emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader present, and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela was the lone leader from the Americas. The United States was represented by Philip S. Kosnett, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at its embassy in Ankara.The United States and European nations have criticized Mr. Erdogan\u2019s growing authoritarianism in recent years, and in particular his harsh crackdown against political opponents since a failed coup in July 2016. Over 100,000 people have been arrested under a state of emergency since the coup, and 150,000 purged from their jobs.Hours before his inauguration, Mr. Erdogan dashed off a decree ordering the firing of another 18,000 state employees, most of them members of the police and army, but also teachers and academicians.Legislators from the main opposition parties \u2014 the Republican People\u2019s Party and the Good Party, and the pro-Kurdish Democratic People\u2019s Party \u2014 refused to stand as Mr. Erdogan took his oath before the newly elected Parliament. Mr. Erdogan entered the chamber to applause, but some boos rang out in the chamber as well.The president remained stern faced throughout, even when waving to clapping supporters.Mr. Erdogan won the presidential race with 52 percent of the vote, but his party failed to win a majority in Parliament and will work in alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party. Nearly half the Parliament \u2014 representing a population the size of Spain\u2019s \u2014 remains opposed to Mr. Erdogan, said Soner Cagaptay, author of a book on Mr. Erdogan, \u201cThe New Sultan.\u201dA clap of thunder sounded the moment after Mr. Erdogan took his oath, and rain descended upon the crowd gathering to celebrate the inauguration across town in the gardens of the presidential palace.First, Mr. Erdogan paid his respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic.\u201cEsteemed Ataturk,\u201d he wrote in a visitors\u2019 book. \u201cI promise to go on strengthening the unity and fraternity of our nation, aggrandize our country, glorify our state.\u201dThe gesture seemed intended to mollify opponents who have accused Mr. Erdogan of seeking to unravel the secular parliamentary republic that was Mr. Ataturk\u2019s legacy.Mr. Erdogan rode in a black car carpeted in red carnations, flanked by a mounted police escort to the presidential palace, arriving as Turkish artillery sounded a 21-gun salute.In regal procession, he walked the length of the palace gardens, with his wife, Emine, by his side, past a colorful honorary guard in medieval costumes. He greeted guests and supporters, and allowed himself a smile.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a book on Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by Soner Cagaptay.

{"Headline": "After Storm, Foreclosures in Puerto Rico Stopped. They\u2019re Starting Again.", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe foreclosure machine that ground to a halt in Puerto Rico after the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September is slowly cranking up again. Island residents who fell behind on their payments are facing creditors ranging from Wall Street to the federal government.Over the last four months, nearly 300 new foreclosure actions were filed in federal court in San Juan and in local courts across the island.Among the firms filing cases are an investment firm controlled by Credit Suisse, one in which the private equity firm TPG Capital is an investor and banks like Citigroup and Santander. Even the United States Department of Agriculture, which has underwritten more than 3,000 mortgages in mainly rural areas of Puerto Rico, has begun to foreclose on delinquent borrowers.The filings are some of the first in Puerto Rico since several federal agencies \u2014 including the U.S.D.A. \u2014 imposed moratoriums on new foreclosures and legal actions in existing cases after the hurricane devastated the island\u2019s electrical grid. But the moratoriums have begun to expire, setting the stage for what housing advocates have feared could be a wave of home foreclosures in the United States territory of 3.4 million people.\u201cThe main problem here is that people are not prepared, and a lot of borrowers will be taken by surprise,\u201d said Ricardo Ramos-Gonz\u00e1lez, coordinator of a consumer legal aid clinic at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. \u201cA lot of people are going to lose their homes.\u201dHe said the situation was complicated by the fact that up to 125,000 island residents temporarily relocated to the mainland after Maria. Some who get sued may not be aware they were served with a foreclosure action \u2014 and some may not be able to afford lawyers to defend themselves.In some of the new foreclosure cases, lawyers have said the homes were severely damaged.A yearlong moratorium is a long one, but given the slow economic recovery in Puerto Rico, some housing advocates have argued it is not enough time. Lenders counter that at some point a determination needs to be made whether a borrower will ever be able to make payments again.A slowly improving economy has made it easier for thousands of homeowners to resume making mortgage payments. But the number of delinquent mortgages remains high \u2014 roughly double the tally of overdue loans before the storm.Before the hurricane, there were about 13,000 pending foreclosure cases in federal and local courts.In all, there are 425,000 home-loan borrowers in Puerto Rico and roughly a quarter of those mortgages are guaranteed against default by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has its own moratorium on foreclosure filings until Aug. 17. The department, however, recently modified the moratorium to permit some older foreclosure cases to move forward.The banks and investment firms said most of the new foreclosure filings were against borrowers who had been delinquent on their mortgages long before Hurricane Maria hit. The investors and banks called their actions reasonable first steps in dealing with delinquent borrowers and in line with what the federal agencies were permitting.\u201cWe have respected the moratorium and are beginning to resume foreclosures on properties, most of which were secured by loans in serious delinquency prior to the hurricane,\u201d said Drew Benson, a Citigroup spokesman. The bank, he said, had stopped writing new mortgages in Puerto Rico a decade ago.Credit Suisse said its DLJ Mortgage Capital subsidiary is only filing foreclosures against borrowers who were already delinquent before the storm.Ann Davis, a spokeswoman for Banco Santander Puerto Rico, said the bank \u201cfully complies with federal and local laws applicable to foreclosures\u201d and works with borrowers \u201cto help them avoid foreclosure proceedings.\u201dA spokesman for the firm that manages mortgages for Roosevelt Cayman Asset Company declined to comment.Earlier this year, a number of advocacy groups lobbied public pension funds in the United States to put pressure on TPG and other investors that had bought mortgages in Puerto Rico to honor the foreclosure moratoriums. The advocacy groups also met with some of the investment firms to discuss their concerns.Most private mortgage investors were not bound by the moratoriums since any federal guarantees on those loans had expired when the mortgages were resold at discounted prices. Also, some of those loans were originally issued without federal guarantees.For the most part, the lobbying effort to honor the moratoriums was successful. Private investment firms, including Roosevelt Cayman, held off on instituting any new foreclosure proceedings until recently.Julio L\u00f3pez Varona, one of the coordinators of the lobbying effort, said that Roosevelt Cayman began filing new foreclosures cases and reopening dormant cases shortly after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big government-controlled mortgage-finance firms, decided not to extend beyond May 31 a foreclosure moratorium on loans they had guaranteed.\u201cIt is a concern because they are one of the biggest private investors in mortgages,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said of Roosevelt Cayman.Even a federal agency is starting to foreclose. The U.S.D.A. is foreclosing on mortgages issued by its Farm Service Agency. The mortgages typically written by the Agriculture Department are for homeowners, businesses and borrowers living in rural areas.The U.S.D.A. is filing foreclosures mainly on delinquent farm and emergency loans. John Shea, a spokesman for the Farm Service Agency, said in an emailed statement that the only foreclosure cases it had filed involved mortgages that became delinquent years before Maria hit the island. He added that the agency had \u201coffered substantial assistance to its Puerto Rico borrowers.\u201dBut some housing lawyers said the U.S.D.A. had taken a hard line with borrowers seeking to negotiate lower monthly payments.\u201cThey are very difficult with loan modifications,\u201d said Rafael Rodr\u00edguez Rosell\u00f3, a legal services lawyer.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said he was working with several borrowers who had mortgages from the U.S.D.A., including a disabled borrower who was denied a loan modification in April. The borrower, who lives in Gurabo, a town of 45,000, wanted to lower his payments after he stopped receiving money from a family member who had been supplementing his income.The U.S.D.A., according to letters to the borrower, rejected the modification request because Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s client had a prior loan reduction and was not entitled to another one under federal regulations.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said an appeal of the loan modification denial was pending.Advertisement"}

It is the third time the museum, known as MOCA, has picked a leader from New York.\u201cHe\u2019s exceptional,\u201d said Catherine Opie, who serves on the museum\u2019s board, citing in particular Mr. Biesenbach\u2019s strong relationship with artists. \u201cOne of the things MOCA has always prided itself on is being the artists\u2019 museum.\u201dAlthough he feels strongly attached to MoMA \u2014 where he started in 1995 as a curator at PS1 (then called P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art) and also serves as MoMA\u2019s chief curator at large \u2014 Mr. Biesenbach, 52, said he is excited to begin this next chapter on the West Coast.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. His start date has yet to be determined.Mr. Biesenbach is not an uncomplicated choice. During his tenure at PS1, one of the largest art institutions in the United States dedicated to contemporary art, Mr. Biesenbach championed emerging artists made the institution a gathering place for multidisciplinary programs and expanded the board to 30 members from 11. But he has also been roundly criticized for curating shows at MoMA like the retrospective of the Icelandic musical artist Bj\u00f6rk in 2015 and the Marina Abramovic show \u201cThe Artist Is Present\u201d in 2010.Maurice Marciano a chairman of MOCA\u2019s board, said that art is often controversial and that the board had satisfied itself that Mr. Biesenbach had learned from those experiences. \u201cWhen you try to innovate and do really new things which have not been done before, sometimes you\u2019re very successful and sometimes it doesn\u2019t succeed the way you were hoping,\u201d Mr. Marciano said, adding that he thought Mr. Biesenbach would be \u201cmuch more thoughtful\u201d going forward.Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA\u2019s director, said that while he is sorry to see Mr. Biesenbach leave, that \u201che was an obvious candidate for MOCA\u201d and \u201cwill do an outstanding job.\u201d (MoMA will begin a search for his replacement this fall.)Founded in 1979 by a group of collectors, MOCA over the years has built an internationally renowned collection of postwar art of more than 7,000 objects.Nevertheless, the museum maintains that things are looking up. In 2013, MOCA successfully completed a campaign that brought its current endowment to more than $130 million.Mr. Biesenbach said he originally began conversations with the museum as an informal consultant who might help them into the next phase and then quickly became a candidate himself. (The board said it narrowed the pool from 40 to 4 before selecting Mr. Biesenbach.)Having started organizations like the Kunst-Werke (KW) Institute for Contemporary Art (1990) and the Berlin Biennale (1996), Mr. Biesenbach said his experience is relevant to MOCA\u2019s needs. \u201cI\u2019ve done several times the reorientation of an institution in a moment of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe word curator also means taking care.\u201dIndeed, he has a track record of generating activity and attention. At PS1 \u2014 working with Alanna Heiss, its founder \u2014 he created the \u201cWarm Up\u201d outdoor summer series of live music and helped found the \u201cGreater New York\u201d exhibition series, which showcases emerging talent in the metropolitan area.In 2006, he was named chief curatorial advisor at PS1 and founding chief curator of MoMA\u2019s newly formed department of media, which he broadened through performance workshops and acquisitions, and, in 2009, he became founding chief curator of the parent organization\u2019s department of media and performance art.In response to Hurricane Sandy, he started the ongoing \u201cRockaway!\u201d public arts festival, which has featured site-specific works in Fort Tilden by Janet Cardiff, Patti Smith, Katharina Grosse, and Yayoi Kusama.\u201cI really think L.A. is turning into the new Berlin,\u201d said Mr. Biesenbach, who lived in the German capital for 15 years. \u201cSo many artists are moving there. It\u2019s a completely different city right now.\u201dTo all appearances, it looks as if the lines of visitors across the street at the Broad Museum haven\u2019t yet spilled over into MOCA\u2019s galleries, though Ms. Opie said attendance was up. Still, Mr. Marciano acknowledged that MOCA hopes to generate similar buzz about its own activities, and Mr. Biesenbach said he wants to work closely with the city\u2019s art museum directors, including Joanne Heyler at the Broad; Michael Govan at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Ann Philbin at the Hammer Museum.\u201cI would love to reach out to them and say, how can we collaborate and listen to their feedback,\u201d Mr. Biesenbach said. \u201cI think L.A. is at a moment where there is a change, where all of a sudden it looks like America is reorienting a lot of attention to the West Coast.\u201dFollow Robin Pogrebin on Twitter: rpogrebin.Advertisement"}

What seems plain is that Judge Kavanaugh is on the libertarian side.But there is every reason to think a Justice Kavanaugh would continue to press one of his old boss\u2019s signature projects: dismantling campaign finance laws that restrict the ability of people and groups to spend money to influence elections.Harmonizing Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s decision with Citizens United is hard because Justice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion said that \u201cthe First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker\u2019s identity.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh ruled against the two foreigners, saying their speech could be limited because they were not members of \u201cthe American political community.\u201d (American corporations, he wrote, were part of that community.)At the same time, he carved out an important exception. On the one hand, he said, a federal law barring most foreign nationals from contributing to candidates or spending money to promote their election was constitutional. But he said foreigners remained free to spend money on \u201cissue advocacy \u2014 that is, speech that does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate.\u201dThat leaves room for plenty of lawful spending, as it is child\u2019s play to recast prohibited express advocacy (\u201cVote for Trump\u201d) into a permissible issue advocacy (\u201cTrump wants to help American workers\u201d).In that same speech, Justice Stevens made the case for equality, noting that the Supreme Court itself gives equal time to the lawyers on each side. In presidential debates, he said, the moderators try to let the candidates have comparable opportunities to express their views.\u201cBoth the candidates and the audience would surely have thought the value of the debate to have suffered if the moderators had allocated the time on the basis of the speakers\u2019 wealth, or if they had held an auction allowing the most time to the highest bidder,\u201d Justice Stevens said.He still hoped, he said, for a re-examination of \u201cthe rule that Congress may not \u2018restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others,\u2019\u201d he said, quoting the sentence that is Judge Kavanagh\u2019s First Amendment lodestar.Advertisement"}

Each seat on the Supreme Court would be limited to a term of 18 years, with terms staggered to expire every two years. That would allow every president to appoint at least two justices.2. Every presidential nominee would be considered to be confirmed if the Senate does not affirm or reject the nomination within 120 days. The recess appointments clause should also be changed so that appointments are effective only for the recess and 120 days after the Senate returns to session.DANIEL B. EVANS, GLENSIDE, PA.To the Editor:The Equal Protection Clause has been interpreted to guarantee equal rights for a wide range of groups. Yet without explicit protections in the constitutional text, these interpretations could easily shift \u2014 especially as the Supreme Court\u2019s composition evolves. The Constitution should specifically guarantee equal rights regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, religion, country of origin, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity.As the president selects his nominee to the Supreme Court, people should not have to wonder whether their fundamental rights will be recognized.ALETA SPRAGUE, LOS ANGELESThe writer is a senior legal analyst for the WORLD Policy Analysis Center, U.C.L.A. Fielding School of Public Health.To the Editor:The Constitution has too many flaws to patch it up with a few amendments here and there. It is thoroughly unfit for a nation of 330 million, in 50 unequal states with 21st-century problems, values and ideals. Therefore, we should introduce one Final Amendment to terminate the Constitution and draw up a new and better Constitution, with an expiration date of 50 years.The new Constitution should be an academic endeavor by a body of 300 or so of the best minds in political science, law, history, sociology, economics and philosophy, and must exclude politicians. It should draw upon the history of democracy, not just in the United States but around the world. We must recognize that the existing 50 states are completely nonsensical on multiple levels and contribute to today\u2019s polarization.The Final Amendment and its Constitution should propose, possibly, 22 states of about 15 million people each, redrawing boundaries around natural borders and cultural considerations.MARK TRACY, VALENCIA, SPAINThe writer is an American citizen.To the Editor:Our Republic is in trouble. It was intended to be a government of the people, by the people, for the people; instead we have devolved into an oligarchy. Congress is beholden to the donor class, corporations, unions, special interests and foreign powers. Super PACs and dark money groups have the capability to spend unlimited amounts of money to buy influence.We need an amendment that would offer real campaign finance reform and overturn Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United. The best path forward would be through a so-called Article V Convention, called by two-thirds of the state legislatures, to propose this amendment, since we know Congress has already sold out.To the Editor:America needs a constitutional amendment to do away with the two-party system once and for all. This can be accomplished with an amendment that redefines congressional districts and institutes a proportional voting method for the House of Representatives. Allowing smaller parties to win a proportion of seats in the legislature \u2014 as few as they may be \u2014 will introduce new ideas into our political culture, increase energy for third-party candidates running at the presidential level, and force the Democrats and Republicans to adopt positions beyond their traditional comfort zones.MATT HINSON, PRINCETON, N.J.To the Editor:The Constitution should be amended to require at least a three-fifths majority on all Senate votes. If 60 votes were required, an unpopular president, elected without a majority, could not appoint people with only the support of his party.The makeup of the Senate already grants disproportionate power to the least populous states. My proposal would force the president to nominate judicial candidates who have broad support and represent the mainstream of judicial thinking, rather than extremists on either side of the political divide. It would also lead to legislation that could pass only with broad support, which would compel members of both parties to work together for the good of the country.To the Editor:As an L.G.B.T.Q. person, I\u2019d like to see \u2014 permanently and finally \u2014 a constitutional amendment prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (real or perceived), in employment, housing, public accommodations, credit and the military.Many well-intentioned straight folks seem genuinely startled when they learn that no federal law exists to protect against widespread anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bias and/or hatred \u2014 particularly with regard to workplace discrimination.DAVID DORAN, LOS ANGELESThe writer is a consultant for companies on L.G.B.T.Q. and workplace issues.To the Editor:The Supreme Court\u2019s failure to rule on whether partisan gerrymandering may be unconstitutional, coupled with the announced retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, should convince us that we cannot rely on courts to protect the right to vote. Accordingly, we should amend the Constitution to do so.The amendment I propose would have four clauses: 1) a declaration that the right to vote shall not be denied or impaired because of voters\u2019 race, religion, creed, national origin or political affiliation; 2) a requirement that state and federal legislative districts be compact, contiguous and as nearly equal in population as is practical; 3) a requirement that state and federal districts be drawn by commissions in which no party constitutes a majority; and 4) a provision that the federal courts shall enforce the rights stated in the amendment.Fair elections are essential to democracy. The Constitution should protect them.The writer is a civil rights lawyer.To the Editor:Serving as a senator or member of Congress was never intended to be a lifetime job. All members of Congress should be limited to 12 years \u2014 two terms for senators, and six terms for representatives. They would then be ineligible for 12 years. But this will never happen as the members of Congress will never vote themselves out of a job.To the Editor:I propose what I call the \u201cMerrick Garland Amendment.\u201dSection 1. Any bill, treaty or nomination that has the support of at least one-fifth of the Senate shall be presented to the full Senate for due consideration.Section 2.

{"Headline": "Fly Farther, for Cheaper. For Now.", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayTechnology advancements and the surge in low-cost carriers, particularly on international routes, have made flying more convenient and cheaper, if not necessarily more comfortable.Summer is perennially peak season in air travel and this summer appears to be an especially good time to fly as airline competition, the increased deployment of fuel-efficient planes, and expanding route maps offer travelers more choices and often bargain fares.The number of fliers is expected to rise 3.7 percent this summer over last, with a record 246.1 million passengers traveling domestically on United States airlines between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to Airlines for America, the industry trade organization representing most of the major American airlines.Added capacity has helped keep prices down, even as demand is rising, according to research by the airfare prediction app Hopper. It estimates that prices will be down this summer 6.7 percent compared to last summer, forecasting average domestic fares to drop to $211 in July and August from $240 in June.\u201cEvery summer, there\u2019s a big spike in the number of people traveling, but the last few years we\u2019ve had low oil prices which has caused airlines to increase capacity,\u201d said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist for Hopper. \u201cThat could be coming to an end with rising oil prices. This summer may be your last chance to get a cheap deal, particularly if you\u2019re flying internationally.\u201d Since the industry was deregulated in 1979, increased competition and airline consolidation caused airfares, when adjusted for inflation, to drop 40 percent, according to the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank devoted to transportation issues. In 2016, it found the average domestic round-trip ticket in the United States cost $367 versus $187 in 1979. \u201cAirlines became very efficient at trying to get as many paying passengers onboard per flight,\u201d said Paul Lewis, the vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center. \u201cSeats got closer, load factors got higher and while we don\u2019t tend to like cramming into an airplane, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to enjoy relatively low fares.\u201dTechnology advancements and the surge in low-cost carriers, particularly on international routes, have made flying more convenient, if not necessarily more comfortable.\u201cThen they were flying quad engines and now they can do it with two,\u201d said Seth Kaplan, the managing partner at Airline Weekly, an industry publication. \u201cBeing able to cover the same distance with half as many engines with far less fuel can make it viable again.\u201dThe three major Persian Gulf carriers \u2014 Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways \u2014 have aggressively marketed to American fliers, offering relatively affordable economy fares to Asia, in particular by positioning their base airports in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, respectively, as long-distance flight hubs. Last year, I couldn\u2019t pass up a $950 flight to Sri Lanka on Qatar that required a change of planes in Abu Dhabi when the next cheapest fare, also a one-stop, was $400 more.United States airlines have cried foul, noting that Gulf governments with deep pockets are subsidizing these money-losing routes at the expense of true competition. In May, the United Arab Emirates, which owns Emirates and Etihad, agreed to more financial transparency; Qatar agreed to the same earlier this year.\u201cAmerican carriers believe they\u2019re not playing fair and over the next 12 months we\u2019ll have a better sense of how this will play out,\u201d said Mr. Lewis. Legacy carriers in the United States \u2014 American, United and Delta \u2014 have expanded their networks by partnering with foreign airlines to sync connecting flights. They are also increasing seasonal nonstop service, such as American\u2019s Chicago-to-Venice flights introduced this summer, when demand warrants. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all parties,\u201d said Rob Britton, the founder of the aviation consultancy AirLearn. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed the airlines to build networks in all directions. And it\u2019s good for the consumer because they\u2019re given enormous choice.\u201dBudget-minded fliers have embraced low-cost flights for their rock-bottom fares, so much so that legacy carriers in the United States have created frill-free fares to compete with them. Hopper found that Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air expanded their domestic capacity by 15 percent in the last year.International low-cost carriers, including WOW Air, Germanwings, Cebu Pacific and others, expanded their service to American markets by 52 percent in the past year, according to Hopper.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t fly Norwegian, other airlines have to compete with them and it puts downward pressure on airfares,\u201d said Mr. Kaplan. \u201cSo, it\u2019s an interesting time for air travel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Vowed to Fix the Subway a Year Ago. On-Time Rates Are Still Terrible.", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA series of meltdowns and accidents on New York City\u2019s subway last summer led to a startling admission: The system was in crisis and in desperate need of immediate repairs.But one year later, subway service remains in many ways the same \u2014 dismal.Long delays continue to upend New Yorkers\u2019 lives. Trains are still breaking down at an aggravating pace. Signal equipment dating to the Great Depression repeatedly wreaks havoc across the system, which sprawls across 665 miles of track and 472 stations \u2014 the most stations of any subway in the world. With a daily ridership of more than 5.5 million, New York\u2019s subway is the most heavily used rail system in the country.\u201cAll I see is the construction, but I don\u2019t see the extra improvement,\u201d Chance Shealey said on a recent afternoon as he rode a D train through the Bronx.\u201cThe subway action plan was designed to arrest a decline in performance and to stabilize the system,\u201d Mr. Byford said in an interview.The subway action plan is expected to pour $836 million into fixing the system. So far, officials have spent about $333 million on repairs and hired an additional 1,100 workers. About $253 million has gone toward operating costs and $79 million for capital spending. Mr. Lhota called for 2,700 new workers, but it is unclear how many the agency will hire.The effort has been massive: Workers have repaired more than 10,000 track defects and 1,000 signal components, subway leaders say. More than 240 miles of drains have been cleared of debris and 1,500 leaks grouted. Subway doors on more than 6,000 cars have been inspected.Still, subway leaders have acknowledged that major weekday incidents, which delay 50 or more trains, remain \u201cstubbornly high.\u201d There were 85 major subway incidents in May, compared with 75 in May 2017. In June, however, major incidents did drop to 62.The key to any significant transformation, transportation advocates said, is a willingness by elected officials to finance Mr. Byford\u2019s ambitious and expensive long-term blueprint.\u201cThe service level may have improved from torturous to merely terrible, but everyone is still waiting for the funding plan that will bring it up to acceptable or even remarkable,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, has faced a torrent of criticism over his handling of the crisis. When the rescue plan was announced last July, Mr. Cuomo said that he understood that the subway was essential to people\u2019s lives. \u201cI am all about getting results,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Peter Ajemian, said the measures had helped to stabilize the system, but added that some work had been delayed because Mayor Bill de Blasio had for months refused to pay for it.\u201cRiders are rightly frustrated and the governor won\u2019t be satisfied until the M.T.A. accelerates repairs,\u201d Mr. Ajemian said.\u201cThe mayor is supporting and rooting for Andy Byford, but at this point it feels like the governor and M.T.A. are digging out of a ditch with a teaspoon,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.One rider, Kyana Palmer, described the all-too-common experience of being swept up in a painful delay this month. She had taken an Uber from her home in Brooklyn to the Franklin Avenue station, hoping one of its four lines would be running to take her to work. Instead, she found hundreds of frustrated riders waiting on a sweltering platform for more than half an hour.\u201cYou\u2019d think people would be out protesting in the streets,\u201d Ms. Palmer said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing so many changes and I\u2019m like, \u2018Is it helping?\u2019 It\u2019s still the same.\u201dSubway officials said the culprit that morning was a train with mechanical problems that happened to get stuck on a switch that is used by all four subway lines. It caused a ripple effect of delays that continued into the evening rush.Ms. Palmer said the subway had become so erratic that she wanted to move.\u201cI\u2019m trying to move closer into downtown because there are more train options,\u201d she said.Major weekday incidents dropped by about 11 percent in the last year, compared to the six months before the subway action plan began, Mr. Byford said. He pointed to another positive sign: June\u2019s weekday on-time rate rose to 68 percent, from about 62 percent last June.Trains are breaking down less frequently \u2014 the distance that subway cars traveled between breakdowns was about 120,000 miles on average over the last year, up from about 116,000 miles last year. Workers are responding to problems on the tracks more quickly and addressing safety concerns, Mr. Byford said.\u201cLessons have been learned from those incidents that occurred last year,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cA huge amount of effort has gone into rolling stock overhauls, keeping tracks free of obstructions and clearing garbage to prevent track fires.\u201dMr. Byford said he planned to provide an update on the rescue plan to the authority\u2019s board in September. Last July, Mr. Lhota told reporters that the rescue plan would reduce delays. But about 62,000 weekday trains are still delayed each month \u2014 about the same as a year earlier.\u201cHold me accountable,\u201d Mr. Lhota told reporters about the subway rescue plan.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trains should be reliable.\u201dNicholas Kulish contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Klein, the former leader of the I.D.C., who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. Mr. Klein has been a major beneficiary of such funds, receiving $200,000 this year. Other former I.D.C. members have also received large transfers, including Senator Marisol Alcantara of Manhattan, who got more than $160,000; Senator Jose Peralta of Queens, who received $113,500; and Senator Jesse Hamilton of Brooklyn, who received $109,700.All four are facing challengers in the Democratic primary on Sept. 13. On Tuesday, those opponents seized the opportunity to press the senators to return the funds.\u201cJose Peralta has tried to scam our community for the last time,\u201d said Jessica Ramos, who is challenging Mr. Peralta. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dIf the decision holds, the impact could be significant on the I.D.C.-tied incumbents, who were given 20 days to respond to the request from Ms. Sugarman. An analysis by the Working Families Party \u2014 which opposes the I.D.C. \u2014 found that the bulk of money supporting the likes of Mr. Klein and his cohorts has come from the disputed campaign fund, with far less support from small donors who have flocked to their challengers.Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for Mr. Klein and other former I.D.C. members, faulted the interpretation of the June ruling and said they would ask the court to punish Ms. Sugarman \u201cif she persists in distorting the judgment of the court.\u201d\u201cHer release of this letter to the press in the middle of a heated political campaign is an abuse of her powers,\u201d Ms. Brancaccio said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anti-Abortion Protesters at Queens Clinic Did Not Harass Patients, Judge Rules", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Saturdays since 2012, protesters have gathered outside the Choices Women\u2019s Medical Center in Jamaica, Queens, starting at 7 a.m. to urge women arriving at the clinic not to have an abortion.For the next three hours, according to a lawsuit filed in June 2017 by Eric T. Schneiderman, the former New York attorney general, protesters violated federal, state and city laws guaranteeing access to reproductive health care by crowding women as they entered the clinic and ignoring their requests to be left alone. Protesters tried to block the entrance with 3-by-5-foot signs with what they said were pictures of aborted fetuses and allegedly made death threats to people trying to escort women \u2014 not all of whom were there for an abortion \u2014 into the clinic.The lawsuit against 13 of the regular protesters asked a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction against the protests and create a 16-foot buffer zone around the clinic.But in a ruling issued late Friday denying the request for the injunction, Judge Carol Bagley Amon of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District said the attorney general\u2019s office \u201cfailed to show\u201d that any of the 13 defendants \u201chad the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm\u201d patients, their companions or the people escorting women into the clinic.\u201cThe interactions on the sidewalk outside Choices were generally quite short, and there is no credible evidence that any protester disregarded repeated requests to be left alone over an extended period or changed his or her tone or message in response to requests to be left alone in a way that suggested an intent to harass, annoy, or alarm,\u201d Judge Amon wrote in her decision.The ruling left advocates of abortion rights on alert.\u201cThe evidence detailed a clear pattern of harassment,\u201d Ms. Spitalnick said, citing a successful effort in 2012 to get a buffer zone around a Planned Parenthood clinic in Utica in a similar case.But after seeing the evidence, including testimony and written logs from the escorts, as well as questionnaires from patients, Judge Amon relied mostly on video from the clinic\u2019s security cameras, which she weighted heavily.Judge Amon said witness testimony exaggerated the \u201cimpropriety of the defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d and omitted \u201cmitigating circumstances.\u201d She called the patient questionnaires \u201chearsay.\u201d\u201cIn our view the attorney general should have never brought this case,\u201d said Stephen Crampton, a lawyer with the Thomas More Society, a Chicago public interest law firm that litigates on behalf of anti-abortion groups, and co-counsel for 10 of the protesters from Church at the Rock in Brooklyn. \u201cThis was more about politics than justice.\u201dMr. Crampton said the case was really about First Amendment freedom of speech rights.\u201cThis case encapsulates the intellectual battle going on in our nation,\u201d Mr. Crampton said.In a statement, Kenneth W. Griepp, the senior pastor of Church at the Rock and a defendant, said his \u201csidewalk counselors\u201d would \u201ccontinue to offer compassion to those who see abortion as the only way out of an unexpected pregnancy.\u201dJudge Amon was nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed in 1990.Opponents of Friday\u2019s decision said that Judge Amon had ignored what amounted to a critical pattern of harassment by protesters and focused on the inability of escorts and staff members to recall details from incidents that occurred years before.Merle Hoffman, president and owner of the Choices Women\u2019s Medical Center, founded the health care facility in 1971. She said the judge \u201cdismissed the lived experiences of the patients, the staff and the escorts\u201d in her decision.Patients who make it through the gantlet of protesters on Saturdays are often shaken once they get inside, she said. On Saturday, she said, the clinic had about 100 gynecological patients and 26 who came in regarding an abortion.\u201cThey don\u2019t make a distinction,\u201d Ms. Hoffman said of the protesters.Judge Amon confirmed that the attorney general\u2019s office has the purview to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights and did not rule that New York City\u2019s clinic access law was too vague, as the defendants\u2019 lawyers had argued. The judge also cautioned protesters against continuing to speak to patients who affirmatively ask to be left alone.

His wife, an elementary-school teacher in their home village, was \u201cterrified\u201d that he got to manage so much money, Mr. Wang said.Things are different this year. After three months and visits with more than 90 potential investors all over China, Mr. Wang and his partners raised only $3 million for a second fund. In June, they shut down the firm.Their fund, East Zhang Hangzhou Investment Management Ltd., was one of nearly 10,000 founded over the past three years amid a technology gold rush powered in part by China\u2019s government-guided economic growth engine. Now they have become the latest sign that China\u2019s engine is slowing down.\u201cAll industries, institutions and individuals are running short of cash,\u201d said Zhang Kaixing, founder and chief executive of an online asset management company in Shenzhen called Jinfuzi, which means \u201cgolden ax.\u201d Jinfuzi, which manages over $4.5 billion in assets, is the type of investor that technology funds court.\u201cMany investors in private equity and venture capital funds want to take their money back,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.Venture capital is a small part of the Chinese economy, which by most accounts is still growing at a quick pace compared with that of many other countries. But the industry\u2019s fund-raising problems may be a symptom of a widening malaise.After many years of easy credit and go-go growth, China is struggling with weakened investment and household consumption and increasing corporate and local government defaults. It could present Xi Jinping with his most difficult problem since he became the country\u2019s top leader in 2013. Will China\u2019s 40 years of continuous economic expansion stop under his rule? If so, how will 1.4 billion Chinese react when they realize that the country\u2019s upward trajectory is coming to an end?Many Chinese still believe that the central government has the capacity to keep the economy from sliding into a recession, just as it did during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Great Recession in 2008. Beijing controls the banks, land, foreign exchange rates and the media, so it can mobilize and manipulate them when necessary.\u201cIn China we believe in Keynesian economics,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, the Jinfuzi chief executive, referring to the economic theory that favors a bigger role for government. \u201cIf what\u2019s going on in China were happening in the U.S., it would have been called a recession. But in China, the government will step in to interfere in significant ways.\u201dYet in private conversations, investors, entrepreneurs and economists admit that with the high debt level and a trade war with the United States, the room for government maneuvering is shrinking. The degrees of pessimism vary, but many of them are bracing for a tough ride ahead.They told me to change all my savings into gold, a risk-management measure for extreme times. They worry that the trade war will hurt the tech and the venture capital industries because they operate globally. They even envision the possibility of the world\u2019s going back to the Iron Curtain era, the pre-1989 world order of distinct political, economic and ideological barriers between the Soviet bloc and the West.Wu Xiaoling, a former deputy central bank governor and now dean of Tsinghua University PBC School of Finance, told the graduates last week to brace for global economic and political uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time left to revel in the carnival of bubbles,\u201d she said in a speech. \u201cEvery country, every individual should be prepared to face the reality after the tide retreats.\u201d The speech was circulated widely on the Chinese social media, possibly because she said what\u2019s on many people\u2019s minds.China\u2019s venture capital industry may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. It is sensitive to both money flows and capital sentiment, and therefore could offer a good gauge of the health of key parts of the Chinese economy. The Chinese government on Monday reported that the economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year ago.So far, funding this year is weak. In the first three months, private equity and venture capital funds raised less than two-thirds of what they had raised over the same period a year ago, according to Zero2IPO Research in Beijing. Their investing activity dropped by nearly half. Funding has slowed in the past when the economy hit bumps, but both the data and the people involved say the current slowdown is unprecedented.Venture funds like East Zhang came into existence in part because, starting in 2014, Beijing made innovation and entrepreneurship top priorities. Leaders hoped that start-ups would help elevate China from a manufacturing power to a technology power. Corporations, banks and wealthy individuals fought to give money to venture funds to invest in start-ups.\u201cWe ended up with a lot of dumb money, managed by inexperienced investors,\u201d said Ran Wang, chief executive of the investment bank CEC Capital Group in Beijing.Wang Shidong of East Zhang said his firm raised funds in 2016 without having to answer tough questions. They decided to set it up in the eastern city of Hangzhou, which \u2014 to attract funds like Mr. Wang\u2019s \u2014 provides streamlined business registration, tax cuts and below-market office rents, as many other Chinese cities do.They invested in 17 projects in e-commerce, internet, biotech and agriculture. Only one of them is doing well. The rest either have failed or are barely surviving, Mr. Zhang said.The funding climate changed completely this year, he said. \u201cInvestors started paying attention to our numbers.\u201dIt\u2019s not just newbie firms like East Zhang that are having a hard time finding investors. Funding is getting hard to come by for almost every venture capital firm.Under pressure from the government to improve their finances, banks pulled away from risky investments. This year\u2019s ailing Chinese stock market has cost companies and wealthy investors alike a great deal of money. The government has cracked down on the risky and informal sources of money within China that provided a lot of venture capital funding.Even venture capital firms with good track records are taking longer to reach their money-raising targets, said Ran Wang of CEC Capital. Some firms have to settle for smaller funds than planned, Mr. Wang said.There\u2019s another sign China\u2019s boom in start-ups may be over: They\u2019re going public. More than two dozen of China\u2019s star start-ups hope to sell shares on public stock markets this year. Generally, as in the United States, start-ups prefer not to go public as long as they have plenty of access to private money. China is home to more than 70 unicorns, or start-ups with valuations over $1 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s getting increasingly harder for companies with high valuations to raise funding from venture capital investors,\u201d said Mr. Wang of CEC Capital.As for Wang Shidong of East Zhang, he has sold his apartment and car to repay some of his investors and is getting ready to start anew. He is considering an offer from an acquaintance to work for an online payment venture in Nigeria.\u201cI\u2019m an adventurer,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the founder of the asset management company Jinfuzi.

{"Headline": "As Gillibrand Pushes Left, Her Economic Agenda Tilts to Populism", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Standing before a crowd of a thousand union members and progressive activists last month at a conference here that served as a 2020 audition for aspiring Democrats, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was asked if she supported imposing a new tax on financial transactions in the stock market.It once would have been unthinkable for a senator from New York, the epicenter of Wall Street money and influence, to back a tax so targeted at her own constituents. But Ms. Gillibrand did not hesitate to answer.\u201cI do,\u201d she said. The crowd erupted in cheers.The unequivocal embrace of the tax proposal was just the latest in a series of policy pronouncements and political moves that have thrust Ms. Gillibrand toward the front and left of the Democratic Party in the age of President Trump.If that sounds like the fundamental planks of a 2020 presidential campaign, Ms. Gillibrand, who is running for re-election in November, demurred. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about 2018,\u201d she insisted.\u201cLabels are hard,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in a wide-ranging interview about her agenda. \u201cBut I\u2019m comfortable with \u2018populist.\u2019\u201dMs. Gillibrand, unsurprisingly, views her economic platform in more generous terms, with roots in President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201csecond Bill of Rights\u201d and Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s call for full employment. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a bolder idea, and it\u2019s larger in scale, than all the things I\u2019ve worked on in the last 10 years,\u201d she said.On Capitol Hill, Ms. Gillibrand is viewed by her colleagues as one of a half-dozen senators most clearly positioning themselves for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, along with Mr. Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.When Ms. Gillibrand forswore corporate PAC money in February, she was following Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren; Mr. Booker joined them within hours. (Ms. Harris, at a town hall, initially waffled on doing so. \u201cIt depends,\u201d she said. But she soon reconsidered and joined the rest of the bloc by late April.)\u201cWhat is required of you, for that money?\u201d Mr. Oliver asked. \u201cBecause it makes me uncomfortable.\u201dToday, Ms. Gillibrand, who has long called for publicly financed campaigns, says that her decade-plus in Washington has taught her that \u201cevery ill in Congress, no matter what it is, it will stem from the fact that money corrupts politicians and politics.\u201dMs. Gillibrand\u2019s leftward tack has manifested itself in other ways. She has continued to outpace her colleagues in opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to his administration and the federal courts. (She rushed late at night to the courthouse steps after Mr. Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and led chants of \u201cStand against Kavanaugh!\u201d)And she became the first senator to call for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.Her call to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d drew the attention of Mr. Parscale, the Trump campaign manager. He posted to Twitter an archived screenshot of her campaign website from when she was running in a conservative upstate New York House district. Then, she had opposed giving \u201camnesty to illegal aliens\u201d and called for English to be the country\u2019s \u201cofficial language.\u201d\u201cYou might want to update your website,\u201d Mr. Parscale wrote.\u201cHer only core belief is that her positions can be completely reversed to meet the mood of the progressive left,\u201d Mr. Parscale later said.How left is Ms. Gillibrand today?Ms. Gillibrand acknowledges her shift on immigration \u2014 \u201cI am very proud where I am today,\u201d she said \u2014 but cast her economic policies as in line with her past, citing more than once in the interview that she had opposed the bank bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, despite pressure from constituents and donors.Nationally, Ms. Gillibrand remains most closely identified with her stances and work on issues around women and sexual harassment, from her yearslong push to remove military sexual-assault cases from the chain of command to being the first Senate Democrat to call for then-Senator Al Franken to resign following allegations of sexual misconduct last year.Weeks earlier, she had declared that President Bill Clinton should have resigned over his inappropriate sexual relationship with an intern. The Clintons had been among Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s earliest and most important benefactors. (Hillary Clinton wrote the foreword to Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s book.)\u201cShe\u2019s living in a different context. And she did it for different reasons,\u201d Mr. Clinton said of Ms. Gillibrand on his recent book tour.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s Republican opponent for re-election this year, Chele Farley, has accused the senator of being \u201cbusy running for president\u201d in her first television ad. And Ms. Gillibrand does keep an aggressive schedule that includes travel across the country to hold high-dollar fund-raisers and campaign for other Senate candidates, especially women.Her outspokenness on sexual misconduct and her early adoption of the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d tagline have drawn national attention recently, but in the New York world it was her openness to a Wall Street tax that was seen as the clearest sign that her political outlook had expanded far beyond her home state\u2019s borders.\u201cWhy would the representative of the U.S. financial capital be putting an additional tax on the financial industry?\u201d asked Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of Partnership for New York City, a powerful business group. \u201cIt seems counterintuitive.\u201dNow her increasingly populist rhetoric and agenda appears to be a calculated gamble that, should she run in 2020, the traditional donor class by then may be eclipsed by the grass-roots fund-raising model for national Democrats.Indeed, her aides estimate that forgoing corporate money will cost Ms. Gillibrand $800,000 to $1 million this year alone. But she has invested heavily in digital fund-raising, collecting roughly $4.5 million online in 2017 alone, according to her campaign. About 97 percent of her donations this cycle have been $100 or less.Ms. Gillibrand sounded happy with where she is now. \u201cIt\u2019s a much better policy to take no corporate money,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

At first glance, it looks like a cryptic disused graveyard with odd tombstones laid out in a mysterious pattern.

The keys used to be quite tall, but have settled into the earth over the years just as real computer keyboards have gotten shorter. Dmitry Kalinin, who helps run a local exhibition and event center that includes a computer museum, said that while Russians have great admiration for I.T. specialists, their work remains slightly mysterious to computer users. \u201cUsually you deal with them when something goes wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have this stereotype that they\u2019re not only tech nerds, but they really do know more about everything than we do,\u201d Kalinin added, recalling a time when, suffering from computer problems, he sought help through an online I.T. forum. \u201cI tried to find some information, and it was like, \u2018What are you talking about, guys?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a word they were saying.\u201d It\u2019s not quite the same as when druids gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. But participants bring snacks and, using their own laptops, play the 1990s computer game Quake, said Sergey Marbyanov, who runs the computer museum. There is also a sort of I.T. Olympics, which includes powerlifting defunct hard drives and competing to see who can throw a computer mouse the farthest. The keyboard monument was financed mostly with money and materials provided by a local tech company, and installed by volunteers who were paid 1,000 rubles a day, or $15.93 at today\u2019s exchange rate, Vyatkin said. It is cleaned and maintained (and its keys occasionally repainted) by keyboard enthusiasts who have taken it upon themselves to do the job.\u201cIt\u2019s great that her life goes on regardless of me,\u201d said Vyatkin, the artist. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that the I.T. people are engaged in it and are promoting it.\u201d According to local lore, couples who can contrive to press CTRL+ ALT+ DEL simultaneously can restart their relationships. \u201cEverybody knows that this combination of keys allow you to close and then open again \u2014 to reset,\u201d Kalinin explained. \u201cThe problem is that you have to use teamwork, and this is hard to do.\u201dTo make a wish, visitors can spell it out by jumping on the correct letters and then hitting ENTER.

Schneiderman as attorney general, is the chosen candidate of Gov. Andrew M.

{"Headline": "Trump Officials Slash Grants That Help Consumers Get Obamacare", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it was slashing grants to nonprofit organizations that help people obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the latest step in an escalating attack on the law that threatens to destabilize its insurance markets.The cuts are the second round in two years. The government will provide $10 million this fall, down from $36 million last autumn and $63 million in late 2016 \u2014 a total reduction of more than 80 percent.Trump administration officials said the insurance counselors, known as navigators, did not enroll enough people to justify more spending. Insurance agents and brokers do much better, they said.The administration is not only cutting grants to navigators, but fundamentally changing their mission. They will, for the first time, help people enroll in health insurance plans that do not comply with the consumer protection standards and other requirements of the Affordable Care Act.Such plans do not have to provide the standard health benefits like preventive services, maternity care or prescription drug coverage, but administration officials say they will also be more affordable to consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the navigator program to evolve, which is why we are announcing a new direction for the program today,\u201d Ms. Verma said Tuesday.In each of the past two years, she said, navigators enrolled less than 1 percent of the people who signed up for coverage in the federal marketplace. In the most recent enrollment period, about 8.7 million people signed up for coverage in states using the federal marketplace, the administration said.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, expressed outrage at the administration\u2019s effort to redefine the purpose of the navigator program.\u201cThis move amounts to federally-funded fraud \u2014 paying groups to sell unsuspecting Americans on junk plans,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Having failed to persuade Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the president is now engaged in a \u201csabotage crusade\u201d to wreck the law, Mr. Wyden said.Fred Ammons, who supervises the Insure Georgia navigator organization, said: \u201cThis is a huge cut to navigator programs across the country. It will virtually eliminate face-to-face in-person assistance. It means less help, much less help, to underserved, hard-to-reach populations, people who live in rural areas or have low literacy or don\u2019t speak English as their primary language.\u201dThe House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said, \u201cYet again the Trump administration is trying to trick Americans into buying junk health insurance plans and making it harder for families to enroll in real affordable, quality health coverage.\u201dPresident Trump declared last fall that the health law was \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cgone,\u201d but it has proved to be surprisingly durable and evidently meets a significant need. Nationwide, in federal and state marketplaces, 11.8 million people signed up for coverage in the last open enrollment period, down from 12.2 million in the prior year but substantially more than many experts had predicted.The Trump administration on Tuesday defended its decision to cut grants to insurance counselors, saying consumers had many other ways to learn about their options. It said, for example, that insurance companies had \u201csignificantly increased their marketing and promotional spending.\u201dHowever, insurance companies typically push their own products, while navigators are not supposed to favor or recommend a specific company or product.In addition, the administration said the insurance exchange was now \u201can established marketplace\u201d for people seeking coverage. \u201cLast year,\u201d it said, \u201cwe had our most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date. As the exchange has grown in visibility and become more familiar to Americans seeking health insurance, the need for federally funded navigators has diminished.\u201dMs. Verma said grants to navigators would be based on their performance in past years. Some, she said, had performed poorly.In 2016-17, she said, 17 navigator groups enrolled fewer than 100 people each, at an average cost of $5,000 for each person enrolled.By contrast, she said, agents and brokers accounted for more than 40 percent of enrollment in the federal exchange for the current year, and the cost to the government, for training and technical assistance, was just $2.40 for each person enrolled.Agents may receive commissions from insurance companies \u2014 typically modest payments for marketplace plans \u2014 but navigators are generally forbidden to accept compensation from insurers.The Trump administration said it was also eliminating a requirement that navigator groups have a physical presence in the areas they serve. This would presumably allow federal grantees to provide aid by telephone or through web portals, like online insurance brokers.Navigators can help consumers fill out applications, complete enrollments and renew coverage online, the administration explained.Rachel Fleischer, the executive director of Young Invincibles, an advocacy group for young adults, said she was dismayed by the cuts announced on Tuesday. Research, she said, has shown the effectiveness of in-person assistance provided to people shopping for health insurance, a notoriously complicated product.The cuts, she said, \u201cwill result in far fewer in-person assisters and huge swaths of the country lacking any in-person help.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kochetkov, an urban activist. \u201cFor the first time, people could see that foreigners don\u2019t bite and that streets can turn pedestrian.\u201dBut building stadiums and fan zones and transforming entire cities are very different projects, and visits to a half-dozen of the more provincial Russian cities on the World Cup map \u2014 Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Saransk, Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd and Yekaterinburg \u2014 revealed both substantive improvements and a host of Potemkin villages, a term that originated in Russia to describe an effort to conceal grim reality from a short-term visitor.Russia\u2019s federal government, for example, sent about $550 million to Nizhny Novgorod, an industrial hub on the confluence of Volga and Oka rivers, to help finance a new airport as well as a metro station near the stadium, which opened this year. One stretch of the embankment along the river likely to draw visitors, which had been surrounded by a blue fence for years, was finally refurbished.To spend the money most effectively, the local government designated several so-called \u201cguest routes\u201d \u2014 essentially streets and sights that World Cup fans were most likely to see. The city administration pledged to repair all decrepit buildings on these avenues, but paperwork delayed the fixes until three months before the tournament.In the end, migrant workers simply splashed paint on buildings, many of them architectural monuments, to obscure their battered state, said Anna A. Davydova, a local urban preservation activist. Only three buildings were properly restored, she said.\u201cWhat was done was a mere minimum, so that we would not be completely ashamed of what is happening in our city,\u201d Mrs. Davydova said.Samara, another big industrial city on the Volga, faced similar problems. A booming bread-trading hub before the Russian Revolution, it inherited dozens of first-class art nouveau buildings. A few of the buildings in the city center, which had fallen into despair in recent decades, were repaired for the World Cup, and the city\u2019s long, lush beachfront got the care it deserved as Samara\u2019s crown jewel.But not all of Samara\u2019s buildings and neighborhoods were as fortunate.To disguise those, the local government bought and installed 6.8 miles of fence, said Yulia V. Torgashova, a local financial analyst. The comedian Ivan Urgant, the Russian equivalent to Stephen Colbert, joked about the plan on his late-night show, saying that the next step should be for the government to cover the faces of residents who were deemed not attractive enough for foreign eyes.Rostov-on-Don got an almost identical aid package as Nizhny Novgorod to spend on infrastructure improvements: new airport terminals and roads, as well as a new stadium that opened in May. But not every project begun for the World Cup was completed. A giant glass building, resembling a moored cruise ship, stands in front of the Rostov-on-Don railway terminal. The logo on top says Sheraton, but the hotel was not finished in time for the World Cup and will never be opened, said Maksim N. Khmel, the head of a local real estate company.For locals and foreign visitors, however, debacles like that did not seem important.\u201cWe used to go abroad to see the world; now the world has come here to see us,\u201d said Vladimir Ovechkin, a local artist and fashion designer. \u201cThis has opened our eyes.\u201d\u201cGod knows what will happen after the World Cup,\u201d said Damir Yefarov, who lives in front of the stadium, which is capable of hosting 13 percent of the city\u2019s population. \u201cLife will get harder. But it has never been easy in Russia. What can we do? We love Russia, so we will have to be patient.\u201d\u201cI am looking at what happens in Moscow, how things get better there, and I realize that we are just so far behind,\u201d said Anton Astakhov, the head of an IT company in Volgograd, a city known more for an abundance of outsourced call centers.The city\u2019s dependency on the central government in Moscow was a recurrent theme in conversations with residents. Some see the absence of a real autonomy from the Kremlin as the biggest problem; others were grateful that the central government chose their city at all, and sent some money for improvements.\u201cIt was all poured onto us from the outside,\u201d said Denis V. Shilikhin, a local entrepreneur. \u201cThe World Cup, the financial resources \u2014 all of it.\u201d\u201cYekaterinburg is far enough from Moscow for it not to suck too many people out of here,\u201d said Dmitri Kolezev, the editor of Znak.com, a local news website with a national reach. As a result, Yekaterinburg has the reputation as a city aloof about what others think of it. Still, to please visitors, the local authorities removed barbed wire from a pretrial detention center that stands about a block from the city\u2019s World Cup stadium, and increased the number of guards.\u201cDirty and free,\u201d is how Timofey Radya, a leading Russian street artist, described Yekaterinburg, or Yoburg, as locals call it.Advertisement"}

It is set among the restlessly shifting American landscape of three different centuries, and its characters are shaken by three monumental wars.But what makes this work a ticket worth cashing in your gilt-edged securities for are its three extraordinary actors, who are the sole occupants of the vast Lyttelton stage for nearly 180 minutes. They are Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. Behold them with wonder, humble theatergoer, for they are multitudes.Henry will soon set up shop, a general store specializing in cotton goods, in Montgomery, Ala., where he is joined by his younger brothers, Emanuel (Mr. Miles) and Mayer (Mr. Godley). Though the original siblings will have died long before the play ends, they will always be with us, as guides and observers throughout the multigenerational story of expansion, acquisition and loss that follows.Here is Henry, speaking in the play\u2019s opening minutes: \u201cHe took a deep breath and walking quickly, despite not knowing where to go, like so many others he stepped into the magical music box called America.\u201d It\u2019s a sentence that gives you fair warning of the script\u2019s language.Instead, you are pulled you into its unceasing tidal sweep, as tickled as a toddler with a bedtime story that promises endless permutations. That\u2019s partly because the play\u2019s performers, under Mr. Mendes\u2019s impeccably paced direction, are so inventively mutable.Though never stepping out of Katrina Lindsay\u2019s original costumes \u2014 sharply tailored suits in shades of gray that bring to mind daguerreotype family portraits \u2014 the brothers Lehman transform themselves into an innumerable host of others. These include their descendants, spouses, colleagues, rivals and employees during more than 160 years.What\u2019s most remarkable about the performances, though, is how the actors manage to suggest they are both inside and on top of their characters at all times. That dichotomy is essential to sustaining the mystical omniscience of a play that draws heavily from biblical scripture and Jewish ritual. The plagues of Egypt are invoked for the third act; so, for a boxes-toppling climax, is the Tower of Babel.And, yes, \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy\u201d could be described as a religious parable of reckoning. Past, present and future are coterminous here, a sense underscored by Jon Clark\u2019s lighting and Luke Halls\u2019s video projections, which summon an eternal Manhattan that is equal parts steel and shadow.The word \u201cnothing\u201d echoes throughout. Nothing is what the Lehman brothers say they come from; nothing is finally what\u2019s left of all they\u2019ve achieved. That\u2019s what happens when money floats into the ether of latter-day Wall Street, unmoored by connection to substance.But \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy\u201d is unlikely to leave anyone who sees it in a nihilistic frame of mind.

{"Headline": "Trump Should Just Give People Money", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lowrey is the author of a new book on\u00a0universal basic income.The Trump administration, Republicans in Congress and conservative governors across the country want the government to be simpler, smaller and more effective \u2014 unless, that is, the government is dealing with the poor.In a matter of months, hundreds of thousands of low-income residents of Arkansas, New Hampshire and Indiana will have to convince local bureaucrats that they have a job or are on a path to getting one in order to receive Medicaid coverage. In a matter of weeks, Congress is likely to expand work requirements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. And if the Trump administration has its way, housing authorities will make their subsidies contingent on work.The initiative is galling, given President Donald Trump\u2019s boasts about slashing regulations and simplifying government. It is striking given the ample evidence of the ineffectiveness of work requirements, the negative impact of poverty on generation after generation and the power of cash. And it gives urgency to the argument that future administrations should give more to and demand less of lower-income Americans \u2014 up to and including showering them with money, no strings attached.Just giving people money: It\u2019s a method backed by extensive research, and it has a bipartisan pedigree. But it is a method the Trump administration, which is likely to oversee a better economy than any administration in two decades, seems loathe to consider. Instead, the president is choosing to increase the ranks of the poor and to slash what support this country does offer those who need it.The White House\u2019s splashiest ideas to remake the safety net \u2014 through the total repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the conversion of SNAP benefits into a Blue Apron-style delivery box and the merger of federal aid programs into a kind of Department of Welfare \u2014 have gone nowhere, and are likely to remain there. Yet the administration has advocated or implemented a number of smaller changes that could push millions of lower-income Americans out of the safety net and into whatever lies beneath.The general gist is to make the safety net more complicated, and more tied to personal circumstances. Unlike most other high-income countries and contrary to popular belief, the United States has no welfare entitlement \u2014 people aren\u2019t getting cash free and easy just because they are poor. For decades, many recipients of benefits from SNAP and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program have been required to work in exchange for aid. Republicans now seek to apply such work requirements to millions of people in other programs.Indeed, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who recently took a tour of Puerto Rico, Alabama and West Virginia, among other places, has argued that the country is seeking to \u201cstigmatize\u201d those in need of help and undertaking a \u201csystematic assault\u201d on the safety net.More broadly, the government could use the tax code to eliminate poverty by providing a guaranteed minimum income to all households, via something called a \u201cnegative income tax,\u201d almost implemented during the Nixon administration.The most radical and potentially transformative idea would be to grant all Americans a monthly cash payment, a policy commonly known as a universal basic income. In the past few years \u2014 with the middle class being squeezed, trust in government eroding, technological change hastening, and the economy getting Uberized \u2014 the idea has vaulted to a surprising prominence, even moving from airy hypothetical to near-reality in some places. Mark Zuckerberg, Hillary Clinton, the Black Lives Matter movement, Bill Gates and Elon Musk are just a few of the policy proposal\u2019s flirts, converts and supporters.Under such a proposal, Uncle Sam would send every American $500 or $1,000 a month, likely eliminating other stingier and less-effective programs. The price would be significant, though financing it would not raise taxes higher than they are in similarly prosperous countries. The benefits would flow not only to the very poor but also to working Americans given leverage to demand better wages, to the unemployed, to students, to the elderly, to caregivers, to young parents. In a society as rich as ours, the argument goes, everyone deserves a guarantee of financial security, and we\u2019re better off trusting each citizen to make the best decision for herself.Perhaps the biggest and most important change would be to stop judging the poor for their poverty, and to seek to repair the pernicious trauma of having too little money by just giving people money \u2014 nothing more and nothing less.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "The significance of the harbor cannot be overstated in Hong Kong\u2019s history. After all, Hong Kong means \u201cfragrant harbor\u201d in Cantonese and was the original title of Victoria Harbor before its renaming in 1841. \u201cIt\u2019s a very deep natural harbor, well located, protected from extreme typhoons and a great place for shipping goods,\u201d says Professor John Carroll, a historian at the University of Hong Kong. Picture a lively channel of junk boats ferrying everything from incense to tea \u2014 the lifeblood of the city\u2019s economic development in the 19th century.Although Hong Kong still boasts one of the world\u2019s busiest ports, it\u2019s a much different scene today. The waterfront is in the throes of transformation: The promenades on both sides have been overhauled and beautified with such projects as Tamar Park, while the West Kowloon Cultural District and a new business district in Kowloon East promise to inject the area with renewed cultural and economic vitality. With great views, attractions and places to relax, the harbor has never been more accessible and enjoyable for locals and tourists alike.Among the communities of innovators found on the western flank of the island at the Cyberport Smart-Space is a legal tech start-up called Zegal, run by its co-founder Daniel Walker. The firm's chairman, Antoine Blondeau, also founded the AI start-up Sentient Technologies in San Francisco. \u201cThe start-up scene in Hong Kong displays a few of the characteristics of Silicon Valley, such as the appetite for risk, the cosmopolitan nature of teams and the availability of financing,\u201d says Blondeau.Zegal is a digital platform that empowers companies to do routine legal work on their own, without the need to retain a law firm, while matching them up with professional lawyers for more complex needs. \u201cWe are offering legal solutions at scale to 25,000 businesses around the world,\u201d explains Walker, himself a former corporate lawyer who first moved to Hong Kong in 2006. Setting up his business in Hong Kong was a no-brainer. \u201cHong Kong has one of the very few legal systems in the world that are very transparent and very trustworthy,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt also has a very progressive outlook from law firms and regulators.\u201dJay Kim, a San Francisco-born investor who hosts a podcast series dedicated to start-up culture, adds that an ecosystem of accelerators, low taxes and a supportive network of venture capitalists set the stage for talented entrepreneurs to succeed. \u201cIt is a lot easier for a young person to make an impact in Hong Kong\u2019s start-up scene than in Silicon Valley,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere it\u2019s more of an old-boy network.\u201dFormerly the Central Police Station compound, the sprawling colonial complex perched along the slopes of the Mid-Levels has found new life as an arts and heritage center. Since its May opening in 2018, this cultural landmark has been hosting live performances and art exhibitions. Along with the much-loved PMQ design center just down the street, this successful preservation of Hong Kong\u2019s built heritage is one of the twin bastions of the city\u2019s design and culture scenes, respectively.If you\u2019ve flown into Hong Kong International Airport recently, chances are you\u2019ve glimpsed this 26-mile bridge cutting across the Pearl River Delta. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge comprises an eye-catching cable-stayed bridge with a tower height of 535 feet, a sub-sea tunnel and boundary crossing facilities. The entire project is 15 times the length of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge and is designed to withstand earthquakes, typhoons and even a collision with a 10,000 ton vessel. The game-changing project cements Hong Kong\u2019s position as a trade and logistics hub by slashing commute times between the city and Zhuhai on the Mainland, while creating new development and tourism opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area.In difficult times, Hong Kong is the kind of city that digs in its heels. When the IFC opened in 1998 in the Central district, it was during the wake of the Asian financial crisis, and the skyscraper designed by the Argentine architect Cesar Pelli became the physical embodiment of Hong Kong\u2019s economic resilience and commitment to free trade. Today, it houses the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, along with the financial heavyweight UBS. The base of the IFC is also a shopping haven, with the four-story luxury mall where Apple opened its first flagship store in the city.The ICC anchors the business and cultural district on the Kowloon side of the harbor. Just two minutes away from the IFC via the Hong Kong Airport Express, the city\u2019s tallest building reaches nearly 1,600 feet into the sky \u2014 an expression of the city\u2019s financial prospects. Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley have their offices here, while The Ritz-Carlton sets the benchmark for luxury hospitality from floors 102 to 118. Like the IFC, the first few floors feature the luxury retail complex, Elements.\u201cWhen most people think about Hong Kong they think it\u2019s a concrete jungle, without realizing that there\u2019s a lot of nature,\u201d says Jay Kim, who has written a fitness book called \u201cHack Your Fitness.\u201d From Hong Kong\u2019s highest peak, Tai Mo Shan, it\u2019s impossible to escape this fact. \u201cThere are plenty of hiking trails and beaches in Hong Kong to enjoy,\u201d the investor continues. \u201cI was living in the New Territories where there was a lot of greenery, which reminded me of home in San Francisco.\u201dBesides local flora and fauna, the vantage point on Tai Mo Shan also reveals at a glance how well connected Hong Kong is and what advantages this connectivity confers. To the north, Shenzhen is within view, while the airport in the west is visible on a clear day. This is a globally oriented city with easy access to Mainland China, making it a natural base from which to start a business.

{"Headline": "Trump Signals Consequences for Michael Cohen Over Secret Recording", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. \u2014 President Trump lashed out at his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, on Saturday, suggesting that there could be legal consequences for Mr. Cohen\u2019s decision to record a discussion they had two months before the 2016 election about paying a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.With his tweet, the latest in a week of dizzying statements by a president whose advisers say has become more unwilling than ever to listen to advice, Mr. Trump signaled open warfare on Mr. Cohen, a longtime fixer he had until now tried to keep by his side. The Justice Department is investigating Mr. Cohen\u2019s involvement in paying women to quash potentially damaging news coverage about Mr. Trump during the campaign.The investigation into Mr. Cohen, the onetime keeper of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business secrets, remains a source of deep concern for the president\u2019s lawyers, and in recent months, Mr. Trump has offered public messages encouraging Mr. Cohen to stay loyal to him.While the president suggested on Saturday that Mr. Cohen\u2019s recording may have been illegal, New York law allows one party to a conversation to tape it without the other knowing. Over the years, Mr. Cohen, in his dealings on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf with journalists, opposing lawyers and business adversaries, frequently taped his conversations, unbeknown to the people with whom he was speaking. Mr. Trump himself also has a history of recording phone calls and conversations.After learning about the tape, The New York Times approached Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. A person familiar with the discussions said that once The Times approached Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s legal team chose not to assert attorney-client privilege over the recording.But at the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s largely unconvincing efforts to repair the damage by asserting that he in fact accepts that Russia interfered in the election \u2014 and the inability of his aides to persuade the president to make a decisive pivot on the issue \u2014 has kept the news from Helsinki front and center.The frantic conversations over what to do began on the flight home. While the president groused about the difficulty of the questions posed to him by American journalists, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, mostly stayed away from Mr. Trump.Mr. Bolton wrote down four bullet points aboard Air Force One that he believed were relevant, including that Mr. Trump should acknowledge that he believed the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings on the Russian meddling. He relayed them to the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, although it was unclear whether the suggestions were delivered to the president.On the plane, Mr. Trump\u2019s mood vacillated from snappish to upbeat. He asked advisers once again about the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked (he had raised the server issue while standing next to Mr. Putin), and why cyberintruders had not penetrated Republican National Committee systems.In the days since arriving back home, Mr. Trump has surveyed almost everyone he has talked to about his performance in Finland, but few told him just how poorly it had gone. Aides suggested different options for \u201cchanging the narrative,\u201d without seeming to realize that a simple story would not suffice.Mr. Trump ultimately came up with his own solution: He would say he had left out a word in the news conference with Mr. Putin. \u201cThe sentence should have been, \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, trying to clear up the confusion but heaping on more. \u201cSort of a double negative.\u201dWhen it was clear that the news cycle had not jumped ahead, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka looked for ways to push the narrative away from Russia. On Thursday morning, at a senior staff meeting, Ms. Trump, a senior adviser to the president, told the group that she wanted help keeping her father on message, according to a person briefed on what took place. She said her worker retraining announcement with her father later in the afternoon at the White House could provide a pivot toward a new story.Once she finished talking, the president\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, pointed out that Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and two other administration intelligence officials would appear at a national security conference in Aspen, Colo., noting that it could become another day of coverage about Russia. John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, resumed the meeting without addressing the issue. No one else suggested a plan of attack either.By Saturday, the president tried to move the focus away from his dealings with Russia by targeting Mr. Cohen. But in doing so, he shifted the story back to another matter nagging his presidency: accusations by women that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers had paid them for their silence in the wake of extramarital affairs before he was elected president.The recording is sure to raise new questions about what the president knew about the payments and when.Ms. McDougal says she began a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump in 2006, shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, gave birth to their son Barron. Ms. McDougal sold her story for $150,000 to The National Enquirer, which was supportive of Mr. Trump, during the final months of the presidential campaign. But the tabloid sat on the story, which kept it from becoming public. The practice, known as \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d effectively silenced Ms. McDougal for the remainder of the campaign.On the recording, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen were discussing what would essentially have been a reimbursement to American Media Inc., or A.M.I., the parent company of The Enquirer, whose chairman, David J. Pecker, is friendly with the president. The recording was found during an F.B.I. raid on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office this year.Privately, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have suggested that Mr. Cohen had done things that Mr. Trump was unaware of. The recording makes that harder to accept.On his way to the New Jersey golf club, the president ignored several questions from reporters about why his campaign would have denied knowledge of the payments if he was on tape discussing them with Mr. Cohen.Katie Rogers reported from Berkeley Heights, N.J., and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Russia: One Mystery, Three Theories ", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn agnostic's guide to our president\u2019s strange conduct. Opinion ColumnistSo maybe this is a good time to step back and sketch out the three main ways to understand Trump\u2019s relationship to Russia and Putin and the 2016 hacking of his Democratic rivals, the three major theories that make sense of our president\u2019s strange conduct before and since. I\u2019m not going to formally choose among them, but for people interested in betting I will offer odds for each.In this theory of the case, you can explain all of Trump\u2019s Russia-related behavior simply by finding him guilty of being the person we always knew him to be \u2014 vain, mendacious, self-serving, sleazy and absurdly stubborn, with a purely personalized understanding of allies and adversaries, a not-so-sneaking admiration for strongmen and the information filter of an old man who prefers his own reality to the discomforts of contrary information.If Trump seems to have a more intense affinity for Putin than for other autocrats, two further explanations may suffice. First, his history of doing business deals with Russians makes him particularly inclined to seek geopolitical deals with Russia \u2014 an inclination that\u2019s essentially a shadier version of the affinity that the Bush family and other Arabists had with the Saudis and the Gulf States, cross-pollinated with the sleazy campaign-finance relationships that the Chinese cultivated with the Clinton White House. At the same time, his vanity and amour propre, joined to his rage against his doubters, makes it impossible for Trump to admit that anyone else helped him win the White House \u2014 so he cannot bring himself to fully acknowledge and criticize Russian election meddling because to do so might call into question not only his legitimacy but his self-conception as a political grandmaster. And what about the election-season contacts with suspicious Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, the Don Jr. meeting and the Roger Stone forays? In this theory they\u2019re indicators that Trump, a shady guy surrounded by shady guys and professional morons, might well have colluded given the opportunity \u2014 but they don\u2019t prove that any such opportunity presented itself. After all, neither the hacking nor the leaking of emails required his campaign\u2019s cooperation, so there was no reason for the Russian side to advance beyond a deniable low-level meeting and WikiLeaks D.M.s, and thus no real opportunity for the Trump team to be a true accessory to the underlying crime.This narrative does not exonerate Trump; indeed, it provides various grounds to condemn him. But those grounds are the same grounds that were obvious during the campaign: We watched him blow kisses to dictators then, complain about our allies then, promise a d\u00e9tente with Russia while exploiting the D.N.C. hacking then, double and triple down on falsehoods and bogus narratives then, cling to self-destructive feuds (the Khans, Alicia Machado) in the same way that he clings to public flattery for Putin \u2026 and after all this, he was still elected president. So be appalled when he behaves appallingly, but do not be surprised, do not confuse Trump being Trump with Trump being treasonous \u2014 and recognize that he isn\u2019t leaving office until you beat him at the polls.Because Trump is Trump, I think it\u2019s more reasonable to see this behavior as of a piece with all his other irrational-seeming, self-destructive behavior on questions unrelated to l\u2019affaire Russe. But there\u2019s always the possibility that this characterological analysis is a form of overthinking, and that when the truth comes out we\u2019ll look back and say that his guilt should have been obvious all along.And what kind of guilt would it be? There are various possibilities, but the latest Mueller filing supplies one possible answer: In addition to the email leaks, we now know that the Russian hackers also accessed Democratic campaign analytics, a prize that (far more than the emails) would have been hard to fully weaponize if they weren\u2019t shared directly with the Trump campaign. That leaves 10 percent for the most dramatic theory, which is that any collusion wasn\u2019t just something Trump\u2019s team stumbled into during the campaign but something connected to a much longer-running Russian intelligence operation, and that Trump\u2019s relationship to the Russian state is not just a personal or ideological affinity or a campaign-season alliance but a partnership forged through blackmail or bribery or both.There is a great deal of enthusiasm for this kind of theory, on social media especially, and on many days I think it\u2019s embarrassing or risible \u2014 a birtherism of the center-left, an exculpatory fantasy from an establishment thrashing about to evade its own responsibility for the rise of populism, a \u201cbrown scare\u201d about an omnicompetent Putin and a fascist international that mirrors similar paranoias on the right. The first two narratives I\u2019ve offered seem far more parsimonious, Trump seems like too brazen a sinner to be effectively blackmailed, and his worldview seems very palpably his own. Meanwhile, the Trump administration\u2019s actual Russia policy, with its combination of the public bromance with Putin and more hawkish policies behind the scenes, would be a pretty strange way for a Kremlin stooge to play his part.Advertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.The documentary makes a case for viewing Trayvon Martin\u2019s death and the Zimmerman verdict as a turning point that galvanized progressive political activists and white supremacists alike. Did it help spark your own desire to be more publicly outspoken about politics?I wouldn\u2019t use that as the catalyst. So many things have been going on and the whole climate in America has changed again. I mean, obviously, I think it was the pendulum swinging back from Obama being president. I feel like it was festering and I think the Obama administration just brought those frustrations to another place where people can spread the propaganda of hate.Also, on the flip side, we\u2019re looking at people who, in areas like Middle America, were not really taken care of. You know? They vote for Democrats because their parents voted Democrat and America was a different place at that time. The middle class was allowed to thrive and there was steel in Indiana and the car jobs in Detroit and all these places where these factories were to provide a way for you to start somewhere in low income, get middle class and then maybe end up with the house of your dreams. This was the American dream and it was real. Then that America changed and no one addressed that.There are a lot of things going on that lead to these sorts of films, these docs that I\u2019m creating now. It\u2019s more of an education, because it\u2019s so egregious that people don\u2019t believe it.People have to really see this. They have to see it again and they have to see it with facts and details, because people don\u2019t really believe it. Until the world believes it and everyone gets involved, it\u2019s going to be a black problem.I think people have been able to hide behind, \u201cHe must\u2019ve been out there doing something.\u201d \u201cHe had a hoodie on.\u201d I\u2019m not talking about people who have this preconceived notion of black people as robbers bad. I\u2019m talking about good people who\u2019ve been able to hide behind the idea of, \u201cNo way that happened. Something had to be going on.\u201dYes, absolutely. Again, it\u2019s an educational process. This law, we have to get people to understand what it says. Of course, he will not be found guilty. It\u2019s very difficult to be found guilty with this law as it stands today.The system doesn\u2019t work as it exists today. No one wants to talk about that because it\u2019s as if you are bashing police officers. I\u2019m not bashing police officers. I\u2019m just saying the facts do not support this being the answer, the system as it stands today.That narrative that this is something new for me \u2014 I get it, I understand, because now you see my name on the doc. But I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time.The constitution of where I am from \u2014 from the streets of the Marcy Projects, it was a thing, where you would give someone something and never mention it. It\u2019s crass, and it\u2019s not cool.So that was my foundation. My foundation was that of, let\u2019s never talk about what we do for each other. It should be unspoken. I\u2019m there for you, you\u2019re there for me. If I need some help, you help me out.So my charity was tied to that.And yes, Big B and I, we had a conversation shortly after. I\u2019ve been to his house, we\u2019ve talked many times. I don\u2019t know how far he wants this to go out. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever spoken about it, so I won\u2019t speak too much in detail. But we had brilliant conversations after this. Do you think black celebrities have a duty to be a little more vocal? No, I don\u2019t believe in that. I never did. I think the way that people view celebrity is unfair. Everyone should be filling in and doing their part because it isn\u2019t about money. It\u2019s not.That doesn\u2019t solve it. I think that everyone should check our compassion and our empathy. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s going to happen, that we all check in, and we get in touch with our compassion and empathy cause that is the solution.And until we get into that place, things like this will continue to happen. We\u2019re still on basic problems. This is like, you\u2019re white, I\u2019m black. I mean, there are so many different levels of all the complexities of things we have to get through as a human race, and we\u2019re still on basic levels.An earlier version of this article misstated which member of George Zimmerman\u2019s defense team was interviewed by the filmmakers of \u201cRest in Power.\u201d Don West was interviewed; another defense lawyer, Mark O\u2019Mara, appears in archival footage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Trump Allies, Seeing Unlimited Opportunity, Instead Drew Scrutiny", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Early one morning in October, Rick Gates, a Washington lobbyist who had been a top official in the Trump campaign, emailed family and friends warning them that he was about to be indicted by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. He declared himself innocent of \u201ccollusion with the Russians,\u201d and denounced the investigation as \u201chighly politicized and an assault on those who helped elect a president that was not favored by many.\u201dOne recipient of the email, Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for President Trump, responded quickly, expressing his condolences to Mr. Gates and adding that he and his family were \u201cin my thoughts and prayers.\u201dThe warm response hints at the relationship that once existed between the two men as they worked together to pursue lucrative opportunities in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington. Mr. Broidy was a client of Mr. Gates, and had paid him at least $125,000. For that money Mr. Gates advised Mr. Broidy on how to pursue both a contract for his business and appointments for his associates and provided insight into the new administration\u2019s foreign policy plans, according to interviews as well as internal emails and documents obtained by The New York Times.Those activities are detailed in a batch of Mr. Broidy\u2019s emails that was hacked and provided to The Times and other news outlets by an anonymous individual or group opposed to Mr. Broidy\u2019s work in Washington for foreign countries, including the United Arab Emirates. The emails detailing Mr. Gates\u2019s work with Mr. Broidy were corroborated by people familiar with the arrangement, as well as additional documents from other sources.Mr. Broidy has not been implicated by the authorities in any wrongdoing related to his work during the Trump era. But his associates have drawn legal scrutiny, bringing attention to his dealings.It is a marked contrast from the early days of the Trump administration, when there seemed to be unlimited clout \u2014 and earning potential \u2014 for those who helped elect the new president.After the inauguration, Mr. Gates began receiving monthly consulting payments for help navigating the new administration from a company headed by Mr. Barrack, Colony NorthStar, which paid Mr. Gates $20,000 a month, and one owned by Mr. Broidy, which paid Mr. Gates $25,000 a month, according to documents and people familiar with the relationships, who requested anonymity to discuss private business arrangements.But when Mr. Gates was indicted in October, Mr. Trump\u2019s allies began to further distance themselves. Colony NorthStar quickly terminated its arrangement with Mr. Gates, according to someone familiar with it.Mr. Broidy\u2019s payments to Mr. Gates had begun in March 2017 and ran through that July, according to an associate of Mr. Broidy\u2019s, who requested anonymity to discuss private financial arrangements. The associate said that Mr. Broidy continued consulting with Mr. Gates after the payments ended, but that Mr. Broidy had stopped seeking advice before the indictment.Mr. Gates submitted at least two invoices after July, including one sent three weeks after he was indicted. But those were not authorized or paid by Mr. Broidy, according to one of Mr. Broidy\u2019s lawyers, Christopher Clark, for whom Mr. Broidy unsuccessfully sought to secure a position as a United States attorney with help from Mr. Gates.Mr. Gates declined to comment through his lawyer. Mr. Broidy also declined to comment.Mr. Broidy\u2019s work has made him enemies, as was evident when the anonymous person or group critical of American policy toward the United Arab Emirates began distributing tranches of his emails to news organizations.On Monday, his lawyers also filed another lawsuit accusing Jamal Benomar, a former United Nations diplomat, of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Qatar. In a statement, the lawyers accused him of \u201chelping spearhead the operation to generate damaging media stories with PDF files and physical printouts sent to media outlets with cherry-picked, curated hacked emails.\u201dMr. Benomar declined to comment.In a letter to The Times this month, Filiberto Agusti, a lawyer for Mr. Broidy, called the leaked documents detailing Mr. Broidy\u2019s relationship with Mr. Gates \u201cpart of a foreign power\u2019s sophisticated campaign to smear a prominent U.S. citizen who has spoken out against its policies.\u201d Mr. Agusti added that the emails were \u201ca carefully curated selection of Mr. Broidy\u2019s emails, designed to portray him in a false and unflattering light.\u201dWhile documents and interviews show that Mr. Gates advised Mr. Broidy on numerous ventures, he appears to have had limited success delivering on Mr. Broidy\u2019s objectives.In one instance, Mr. Broidy sought assistance from Mr. Gates in securing an endorsement from the Commerce Department for Circinus\u2019s efforts to win lucrative defense work from the Romanian government, in partnership with its state-owned defense company, Romarm.Mr. Gates told Mr. Broidy and Circinus officials in an email that he intended to flag the request for \u201cmy contacts at Commerce,\u201d including \u201cin the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d He relayed talking points about why Circinus deserved the endorsement to one such contact, Eric Branstad, who had served as senior White House adviser to the Commerce Department until January, and before that had worked on the inaugural committee with Mr. Gates.Mr. Branstad, the son of the Trump administration\u2019s ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, relayed Circinus\u2019s request to the agency staff overseeing Romania, according to someone who worked with the agency.The Commerce Department eventually provided an endorsement, which is commonly sought by American companies trying to do business with foreign governments. But it is unclear what role, if any, Mr. Gates\u2019s efforts played.A person familiar with his involvement said Mr. Gates did not lobby the Romanian government or Romarm to award a contract to Circinus. Romarm said an active \u201ccooperation agreement is in place\u201d with Circinus, but the Broidy associate said no contracts have been awarded or are pending.Mr. Clark, the lawyer for Mr. Broidy, said Mr. Broidy sought similar help from many contacts who he believed might have influence in the appointment process. And the person familiar with Mr. Gates\u2019s involvement said he did not directly lobby the administration to hire people recommended by Mr. Broidy.One associate recommended by Mr. Broidy for a top post in the Justice Department, Robert C. Riegle, said he was also recommended by several other people. Mr. Riegle had been hired in 2012 by Threat Deterrence, a company Mr. Broidy had started to provide training and technology to law enforcement agencies.Mr. Riegle did not get the job for which Mr. Broidy had recommended him. Mr. Broidy \u201cnever mentioned\u201d Mr. Gates\u2019s involvement, according to Mr. Riegle.Mr. Gates\u2019s prospects for a lucrative Washington consulting practice, once seemingly limitless at the beginning of the Trump administration, had dried up by last fall amid intensifying scrutiny by Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators. He appears to have lost paying clients, such as Mr. Broidy, while his legal bills mounted amid preparations for a potentially long and costly defense.In February, he decided to plead guilty and cooperate with Mr. Mueller, citing the onerous costs and the \u201ccircuslike atmosphere of an anticipated trial.\u201d\u201cI will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process,\u201d he said on the day of guilty plea.Kenneth P.

Cohen, escalated his dispute with the president on Tuesday by releasing a secret recording of a conversation in which Mr. Trump appears to have knowledge about hush money payments to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen is heard telling Mr. Trump that he will need to set up a company to arrange the payments.Mr. Trump then asked, \u201cWhat financing?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Mr. Trump then appears to say, \u201cPay with cash.\u201dMr. Cohen then says, \u201cNo, no.\u201dThe word \u201ccheck\u201d is uttered, but it is not clear by whom, and the audio is then cut off.Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen and a longtime supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, told The New York Times on Tuesday night that Mr. Cohen released the tape because he is \u201con a new path \u2014 it\u2019s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.\u201dMs. McDougal was paid $150,000 by The National Enquirer for her story in summer 2016. The tabloid, which has often given Mr. Trump favorable coverage, then did not publish the story. According to people close to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, the two men were discussing on the tape a second payment to The Enquirer that would continue to keep Ms. McDougal from speaking publicly about Mr. Trump.On the tape, Mr. Cohen raises the possibility of creating a separate company to buy the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story from A.M.I.\u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\u201d Mr. Cohen is heard saying. David Pecker is the chairman of A.M.I.; he has acknowledged being \u201cpersonal friends\u201d with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen, who had been considered one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal personal aides and the keeper of many of his secrets, is under investigation by federal authorities in New York. Investigators are examining Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in making payments during the campaign to women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump and whether campaign finance laws were violated.American Media, which has also drawn scrutiny from prosecutors over whether it ultimately engaged in an illegal coordinated campaign contribution with Mr. Cohen, did not respond to an email on Tuesday night asking whether it discussed selling the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story to Mr. Trump.As they discuss Ms. McDougal and A.M.I., Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen appear to be concerned that in leaving the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story in A.M.I.\u2019s hands, they are ceding an uncomfortable level of control in trusting a tabloid publisher, even such a friendly one, with such a delicate story.Mr. Cohen is heard saying, \u201cYou never know where that company \u2014 you never know where he\u2019s gonna be,\u201d to which Mr. Trump is heard raising the fear that \u201che gets hit by a truck.\u201dOn the recording, Mr. Cohen can also be heard describing efforts by The Times to unseal Mr. Trump\u2019s divorce records from his first marriage, to Ivana Trump. Mr. Cohen is heard telling Mr. Trump that they will fight the efforts. Mr. Trump ultimately prevailed over The Times and the records remained sealed.Despite the fact that the tape is not clear, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers and Mr. Cohen\u2019s representatives have made completely different claims about what the recording demonstrates.After The Times\u2019s Friday report, Mr. Giuliani said that the president could be heard saying that the payment should be made with a check rather than cash so it could be properly documented. The audio is not that conclusive, but nor is it as clear as Mr. Cohen\u2019s representatives claim. They say it shows that Mr. Trump directed it be paid in cash.\u201cEverybody heard just now Donald Trump say the word \u2018cash\u2019 after Michael Cohen mentioned financing,\u201d Mr. Davis said on CNN after it broadcast the tape on Tuesday. \u201cWhatever spin Mr. Giuliani is trying to invent, it says cash.\u201dMr. Giuliani has acknowledged that the situation that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen are primarily discussing on the tape is A.M.I.\u2019s $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal.Mr. Trump, who has lately been wary of Mr. Cohen\u2019s willingness to cooperate with federal investigators, said on Saturday morning that Mr. Cohen\u2019s recording was \u201cperhaps illegal.\u201dMichael S.

There\u2019s a far side to this American disgrace, a way to contain the damage, and it\u2019s both utterly straightforward and entirely effective.It\u2019s called voting. And from now until Nov. 6, we must stay fanatically focused on that \u2014 on registering voters, turning them out, directing money to the right candidates, donating time in the right places.The moral of the Helsinki freak show, the NATO tragicomedy and the children in cages near the border isn\u2019t just that Donald Trump lacks any discernible conscience, real regard for this country or mature appreciation of history and our exalted part in it. It\u2019s that this next election matters \u2014 immeasurably.We can\u2019t lose sight of that, but in all our fury and feelings of helplessness, we sometimes do. Too many people spend too much of themselves on the shouting and save too little for the plotting, and Trump does his best to leave us morally wiped out. He\u2019s a steamroller. But if we hang in there, we don\u2019t have to be flattened.And Trump won the presidency because of about 78,000 ballots in three states. A nation\u2019s direction can hinge on a margin that small. Every vote counts.\u201cWe\u2019re basically arming people,\u201d Dan Sena, the D.C.C.C.\u2019s executive director, told me. He stressed that living outside a swing district \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a role in taking back the House.\u201d Making phone calls or sending mail may be more tedious than fashioning cheeky social-media posts that circulate among friends and preach to the choir. It may also be more impactful.But not all of the primaries this year have yielded the kind of turnout that Democrats had hoped for; a few suggested that Republicans\u2019 engagement is every bit as strong as Democrats\u2019.\u201cWe do have some concerns,\u201d Sena said. It\u2019s time, after this wretched and stupefying past week, to allay them.Does our discipline rise to the level of our anger? Does our will? A large-enough showing by voters opposed to Trump would overcome the forces of gerrymandering and overwhelm the Koch brothers. The fight may not be fair, but its outcome isn\u2019t foreordained. There\u2019s a chance here \u2014 an excellent one \u2014 to establish a check on the president\u2019s worst impulses and a limit to the harm he\u2019s doing. But we have to seize it.To blunt Trump\u2019s attack on our democracy, we have to use our democracy. We can restore faith in it by showing faith in it. For all its corruptions and imperfections, it still gives us a power \u2014 through our ballots \u2014 that exceeds even the most power-hungry president\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fast and Furious Michael Avenatti", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "FeatureIn representing the porn star Stormy Daniels, the lawyer thinks he can bring down a president \u2014 one cable-news appearance at a time.Supported byOn the second Tuesday in May, Avenatti, who is 47, strode down the hallway of his luxury Manhattan hotel and, toeing open the door, sat down at his desk to read a draft his paralegal had recently uploaded to Dropbox. In bulleted, 12-point Arial font, the document levied an astonishing charge: that in 2017, a Russian oligarch named Viktor Vekselberg had deposited around $500,000 into the same bank account Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former fixer, used to pay off Avenatti\u2019s client in October 2016. If the details were accurate, as Avenatti was certain they were, the two dominant scandals dogging the Trump administration \u2014 a supposed 2006 affair between Daniels and Trump and the Robert Mueller-led investigation into election meddling by the Russian government \u2014 were about to merge.Avenatti, whose ability to steer a news cycle is rivaled by only the president\u2019s, initially hoped to distribute the file that morning, thus ensuring wall-to-wall coverage for the better part of the day. Then came word that Trump had scheduled an early-afternoon address, to announce that the United States would be withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. So Avenatti delayed posting a link to the Dropbox file on Twitter until 5 o\u2019clock, with three cable appearances to follow, starting with an 8 o\u2019clock spot on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360,\u201d on CNN.After a final scan of the document, Avenatti fished out his iPhone and thumbed in the number of his law office, in Newport Beach. \u201cLooks good,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dIn preparing to share the file, Avenatti had immediately zeroed in on a potential weakness in his strategy: The document wouldn\u2019t stand up for long without independent corroboration, especially not if he insisted on keeping the source of his information anonymous. (The leaker was later identified by The New Yorker as a law-enforcement official, who said he acted out of concern that the data wasn\u2019t being shared with investigators.) But a few days earlier, The Times published an article revealing that Vekselberg had been interviewed by Mueller, the special counsel; Avenatti, who keeps in close contact with reporters in Washington and New York, was anticipating a follow-up. \u201cHe\u2019s smart that way,\u201d a reporter on the Mueller beat told me. \u201cHe needs the television for attention, but he leans on print publications to vet the information he uses on TV.\u201dAt 6:10 p.m., The Daily Beast went live with an article confirming that the transactions between Columbus Nova and Cohen\u2019s company, Essential Consultants, had taken place. The Times followed with a more in-depth corroboration, based on a review of bank records. Avenatti opened up his MacBook and ate from a tub of gummy worms while he scrolled. In the frenzied news landscape of 2018, it is all but impossible for any development to dominate the conversation for long; by the following afternoon, analysis of Cohen\u2019s alleged misdeeds would be replaced by the ongoing story of Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, who had recently resigned amid accusations of sexual abuse. But for the moment, Avenatti was at the center of the news universe. His mailbox swelled with interview requests. In his Twitter mentions, canonization proceedings were underway.\u201cThere is a God,\u201d one follower suggested. \u201cHe sent us Avenatti.\u201d\u201cYou and Stormy,\u201d another said, \u201cmay be the saviors of our democracy.\u201dAvenatti pecked at the keyboard: \u201cWe are just getting started. ... \u201d\u201cShould I send it?\u201d he asked me. His finger, trembling with adrenaline, hovered above the laptop. \u201cI\u2019m going to send it.\u201dHe stood up and began to pace. His face, steely and composed, was now looking back at us from the television screen in archival footage from a news conference he gave with Daniels in April, and when I clicked from CNN to MSNBC, there he was again. The phone rang, and it did not stop ringing for the better part of an hour. Avenatti does not employ a public relations specialist, preferring to handle all media scheduling himself, and I listened as he fielded calls from nearly every major news outlet. He exchanged a few minutes of profane banter with his friend Don Lemon, then accepted a call from Lemon\u2019s colleague Jake Tapper.\u201cAre you going to put me on at the top of your show tomorrow?\u201d Avenatti asked Tapper, in a tone that suggested he was only half joking. (The next day he appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d)Half an hour later, he was slumped in the makeup chair at the CNN studios in Columbus Circle, where he seemed to know most of the staff by name. Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, appeared in the doorway, grinning. The men exchanged greetings and retreated to a corner of the greenroom to speak privately.At 7:57 p.m., Avenatti followed a junior producer into the studio, took a seat across from Cooper and calmly tented his elbows on the table. Cooper led, as expected, by noting that CNN was unable to verify Avenatti\u2019s claims.\u201cWe would not have released this if we were not 100 percent confident in the accuracy of the information,\u201d Avenatti shot back. \u201cRight before we went live, The Times issued an article where they verified the accuracy of what we\u2019ve released based on an independent review of other documents. There\u2019s no question this is accurate.\u201dCooper continued to press his guest, pointing out that the payments the document attributed to Vekselberg had actually come from Columbus Nova, an investment firm whose biggest client is a company controlled by Vekselberg. \u201cAt the very least, there may be no nefarious reason here at all that this company would have given $500,000 to Michael Cohen,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey could\u2019ve been hiring him for any number of consulting work \u2014 \u201dAvenatti cut him off: \u201cFor what? For his legal skill and acumen? I doubt that.\u201dThe segment wrapped at 8:30, giving Avenatti a little more than an hour before he was due at 30 Rock for a taping of \u201cThe Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\u201d Borrowing a wet wipe from the greenroom, he cleared the orange foundation from his face and rode the elevator down to Porter House, where he ordered a Grey Goose martini and a filet mignon, medium-rare. Pat Sajak, the \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d host and a notable Republican donor, stopped by the table to pay his respects, as did Andrew Napolitano, the Fox News legal analyst, who grabbed Avenatti by the head with both hands and pulled him into an awkward embrace.Several outlets, including The New York Times, had reported that Avenatti was exploring the possibility of hosting his own cable-news program. But at Porter House, Avenatti shrugged off the idea. \u201cDude,\u201d he told me, as Napolitano returned to his own table, \u201cI could have it in a second, if I wanted it. But I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He gazed out the window and across Columbus Circle at the glistening black flank of the Trump International Hotel and Tower. \u201cRight now?\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019ve kinda got my hands full.\u201dTwo decades ago, a different Los Angeles lawyer, William Ginsburg, appeared on all five Sunday talk shows on a single morning, in an attempt to vindicate his client, Monica Lewinsky, in the court of public opinion. The feat is known today as \u201cthe Full Ginsburg.\u201d Avenatti has taken Ginsburg\u2019s underlying approach \u2014 let the American people be the jury \u2014 and updated it for the social-media era. He has learned, with practice, to leverage Twitter in much the same manner as the president: as a place to goad (\u201cThis is the best Mr. Trump can do?\u201d), a venue for self-aggrandizement (\u201cThis is getting too easy\u201d) and a direct conduit to an adoring base of supporters. Paparazzi trail him to his favorite bars in Beverly Hills. \u201cEveryone Wants to [expletive] Stormy Daniels\u2019 Lawyer Now,\u201d read a headline in the online magazine Mel.\u201cThere\u2019s a progression happening: We have President Trump because of reality television, and we have Avenatti because of President Trump,\u201d says Tom Rosenstiel, a media scholar and the executive director of the American Press Institute. \u201cBut I\u2019d argue we also have Avenatti because the left so desperately desires an anti-Trump: A person who can elicit the same dopamine reaction in his supporters that Trump can from his.\u201dLike Trump, Avenatti is all Freudian id, loudmouthed and cocky. \u201cI\u2019m a mercenary,\u201d he acknowledged to me. \u201cThat\u2019s what people hire me for, and I don\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d He traffics primarily in a commodity in short supply among left-leaning voters: hope. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, recently told The New Yorker that she doesn\u2019t \u201clike to talk about impeachment,\u201d but Avenatti has gleefully predicted Trump will be out of the office before his term ends. Robert Mueller, no matter the outcome of his investigation, is unlikely to ever call Rudolph Giuliani a \u201cpig\u201d or Michael Cohen a \u201cmoron\u201d; Avenatti uses both insults so frequently that they have become a kind of refrain.On paper, at least, Avenatti\u2019s campaign against Trump and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is limited to three lawsuits. The oldest, from March, seeks to void the 2016 nondisclosure agreement prohibiting Daniels from discussing her supposed affair with Trump, on the grounds that Trump failed to sign the document \u2014 possibly, Avenatti has argued, because the future president wished to maintain plausible deniability. (Trump is identified in the paperwork by the pseudonym \u201cDavid Dennison.\u201d) A corollary suit, from April, accuses Trump of defamation for calling Daniels \u201ca total con job\u201d on Twitter, after Daniels said she had been threatened by someone who warned her to \u201cleave Trump alone.\u201d And a final suit claims that Daniels\u2019s previous attorney, Keith Davidson, conspired with Michael Cohen and President Trump to keep Daniels quiet. Included in that last filing are messages that appear to show Davidson and Cohen trying to get Daniels to retract her claims about Trump on a TV program hosted by another Cohen client, Sean Hannity.In early April, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as part of a bank-fraud probe, raided Cohen\u2019s offices and the hotel room he was using during construction in his apartment building, seizing thousands of documents and electronic devices. Although the results of the raid have not been made public, the evidence is widely believed to contain files pertaining to the Daniels payout, which Cohen has admitted to orchestrating and which Trump had previously denied knowing anything about. If any of the seized material reveals evidence of campaign-law violations \u2014 or if Avenatti, in the discovery phase of a trial over the NDA, is able to produce such evidence \u2014 Trump could be held criminally liable. Avenatti, for his part, claims to already have all the damning evidence he needs. \u201cJust like the Nixon tapes years ago,\u201d he said at a news conference in May, \u201cwe now have what I will refer to as the \u2018Trump tapes.\u2019\u2009\u201dAvenatti often describes his media omnipresence as integral to his long game: It rattles Trump\u2019s defenders \u2014 as appeared to happen when the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contradicted the White House and acknowledged payment to Daniels. It has also helped bring in almost $600,000 for a CrowdJustice account in Daniels\u2019s name, which Avenatti says is his sole source of financing for the case. It has also generated leads for Avenatti, like the Vekselberg data. \u201cNone of this happens if we don\u2019t have a high profile,\u201d Avenatti said.\u201cI\u2019ll put it this way,\u201d Daniels told me. \u201cPeople forced to play defense tend to get sloppy, they tend to make mistakes. And look, if I didn\u2019t think Michael was doing a good job, I would fire his ass.\u201d But, she added, \u201cevery time I watch him work, I think, This is what it must have been like to see the Sistine Chapel being painted. But instead of paint, Michael uses the tears of his enemies.\u201dBut litigating a case in the press is not without risk. As one of Avenatti\u2019s former colleagues, the lawyer Brian Panish, pointed out, \u201cMichael is good with the media, but the media isn\u2019t always going to do what he wants them to do.\u201dIn recent months, Avenatti, who was essentially unknown outside Los Angeles law circles before this spring \u2014 in February, he had just 500 followers on Twitter \u2014 has seen his personal life and past investments raked over. Fox News tracked down his second wife, Lisa Storie, and elicited her opinions on their acrimonious divorce. (Storie recently told me that they were now on \u201creally good terms.\u201d) CNN recently published a quadruple-bylined expose on bankruptcy proceedings against Eagan Avenatti, one of the two Los Angeles law firms Avenatti helped found. At times, he has seemed genuinely unsettled by the scrutiny: He recently responded to a Los Angeles Times article about his failed tenure as owner of the coffee company Tully\u2019s with fury (\u201cSensational reporting at its finest\u201d), and after The Daily Caller published a critical piece, he threatened to sue the conservative site for defamation. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m kidding, you really don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d he wrote to the reporter in a Twitter message, which was denounced by other journalists. \u201cThis is the last warning.\u201d For many people, it was the first time Avenatti\u2019s hardball tactics had spilled into public view.He has since expanded into a new front in his fight against the government, flying, late last month, to the Texas border to meet with Central American migrants. \u201cWe will travel this nation far & wide in an effort to locate missing children and reunite them with their mothers,\u201d he tweeted on June 21. He now represents, pro bono, more than 70 children and 60 parents in multiple lawsuits against the government, and he recently announced on MSNBC that he is also working with several \u2014 he declined to say exactly how many \u2014 Immigration and Customs Enforcement whistle-blowers.Predictably, the Texas trip bolstered his messianic standing among liberals, and invited claims, from detractors, that he is little more than a flagrant opportunist, inserting himself, as The New York Post put it, into a fight he doesn\u2019t understand. But to the people who know him best, the evolution into partisan firebrand is hardly surprising.\u201cLook, Michael has always been a hard-charging guy,\u201d says Brian Kabateck, the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. \u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re seeing now is that he\u2019s a perfect foil for Trump, because he actually sees the world just like Trump does. He has that same faith in the spotlight,\u201d Kabateck paused. \u201cIn a way, he is sort of is Trump.\u201dNeither Avenatti\u2019s mother nor father graduated from college, and they expected their only son to support himself from an early age. (Avenatti has two half-siblings, from his mother\u2019s first marriage.) In 1989, he worked part time for Representative Dick Gephardt, a Democrat, and enrolled in St. Louis University, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania as a political-science major. Photos from that time depict a scrawny kid; his hair is dark and full, his glare preternaturally confident. \u201cI used to call him the little man with the brown briefcase,\u201d Avenatti\u2019s first wife, Christine Avenatti-Carlin, told me.\u201cHe was 21 years old when we met,\u201d Avenatti-Carlin says, \u201cbut he was already incredibly driven, incredibly serious. I don\u2019t think he ever relaxed.\u201d A year earlier, Anheuser-Busch restructured, and Avenatti\u2019s father was laid off. Michael was still reeling, Avenatti-Carlin says: \u201cIt hit him hard. I can remember him talking about how he was going to get through law school, so he could help \u2018the disenfranchised.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo avoid going too deep into student-loan debt, Avenatti, who had long thought about going into politics, took a year and a half off from Penn and accepted a full-time job with Rahm Emanuel\u2019s political-consulting firm, the Research Group. At first, Avenatti, \u201cthe low man on the totem pole,\u201d as he puts it, was on the advance team for rallies and speeches, but the firm\u2019s leadership soon promoted him to opposition researcher. \u201cThis was before the days of the internet, so if you wanted to find clerk records or look up business disputes, you would have to go to the candidate\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Avenatti says. \u201cI did a lot of flying around, a lot of gumshoeing.\u201dIn total, he says he participated in 150 campaigns in 42 states, including Pennsylvania and Delaware Senate races and a Philadelphia mayoral contest. It was an exceptionally demanding schedule for someone who had not yet finished his senior year in college, and by 1996, Avenatti was burned out on politics. He and Christine moved to Washington, where Avenatti had been accepted at George Washington University\u2019s law school. Between his second and third years there, he was a summer associate at O\u2019Melveny & Myers, a white-shoe defense firm based in Los Angeles. After graduation, he accepted a full-time job as a junior associate.One of his bosses was a silver-coiffed attorney named Daniel Petrocelli. \u201cDan was the trial guru at O\u2019Melveny,\u201d Avenatti told me: He represented the family of Ron Goldman during the civil suit against O.J. Simpson and once went to battle for Disney over merchandising rights to Winnie the Pooh. \u201cHe was a street fighter,\u201d Avenatti recalls. \u201cBut he was exceptional at speaking to juries, and I\u2019d like to think he saw a little bit of him in me.\u201d In his first case involving the entertainment industry, Avenatti was deputized by Petrocelli to help defend two members of the Eagles, Don Henley and Glenn Frey, against claims that they\u2019d stiffed a third, Don Felder, out of his share of touring profits. (The case was settled out of court.)\u201cA lot of what I absorbed from Dan involved his preparation,\u201d Avenatti told me. \u201cHe was extremely diligent, and he was able to absorb a lot of information in a short period of time.\u201d But Avenatti was honest with Petrocelli and the other senior partners at the firm: He wasn\u2019t going to stay at O\u2019Melveny forever, no matter how high the pay. \u201cThe drafting, the redrafting of motions, the back and forth, he hated it,\u201d Avenatti-Carlin told me. \u201cHe wanted to be more than a paper pusher. He wanted to be a change agent.\u201dAvenatti was, by then, no longer with O\u2019Melveny. A year earlier, Bruce Broillet, a founding partner of a boutique Los Angeles firm, had been attending a conference in a casino ballroom in Las Vegas when he spotted a young man wading through the crowd in his direction. \u201cMichael shakes my hand and tells me he\u2019s driven over from L.A. just to meet me,\u201d Broillet recalled. \u201cHe said he\u2019d read up on what we did. He wanted to be David, not Goliath; he wanted to level the field for the little guy.\u201dUnlike O\u2019Melveny, Broillet\u2019s operation is what\u2019s known as a plaintiff-side firm, which sues large corporations on behalf of individuals. The firm had a track record of winning big verdicts and settlements for its clients. But such cases are expensive to litigate and can drag on for years, with little \u2014 or, in the event of an adverse verdict, nothing \u2014 to show for it. Still, the high-risk-high-reward aspect of the work appealed to Avenatti; it was a good fit, he thought, for his personality. When Broillet reached out with an offer of full-time employment, he accepted on the spot.Soon enough, Avenatti was taking on the defining case of his young career, suing the accounting giant KPMG for audit malpractice, for failing to notice or report the some $40 million the chief financial officer had embezzled from Targus, a manufacturer of computer cases. \u201cFor the better part of a year, we were flying all over the world, taking depositions,\u201d Michael Ward, then the general counsel for Targus, recalled. \u201cAnd Michael was a force of nature. He was like a little computer: He\u2019d sit there processing, synthesizing. Then he\u2019d sit down with the witness, and you\u2019d watch him set them up, listen to their answers, and set them up again. They didn\u2019t know what hit them.\u201d In March 2006, KPMG was forced to settle for $22 million.Avenatti co-founded Eagan O\u2019Malley & Avenatti in 2007, but the principals eventually became enmeshed in a dispute over the partnership. O\u2019Malley ultimately exited the firm, and settled for $2.7 million. By early 2016, Avenatti was dealing with a potentially more costly legal matter, this one involving a former litigator at the firm, Jason Frank. In an arbitration case filed in California, Frank claimed that Avenatti had kept pertinent financial forms from him and generally misstated profits in order to avoid paying Frank millions. A counterclaim for Eagan Avenatti charged that Frank was fired after being caught plotting with other attorneys to form a new firm, taking clients with them; he was accused of fraud and breach of contract. In 2017, an arbitration panel of three retired judges began hearing both claims.Then came a puzzling twist: A Florida man and felon named Gerald Tobin, who previously worked for Eagan Avenatti as a contract investigator, filed a petition to put the firm into involuntary bankruptcy. Tobin has said he did so \u201cbecause I had read that such an action usually resulted in getting a debt paid quickly and would place the target under considerable pressure to resolve the matter.\u201d A judge in Florida issued what\u2019s called an automatic stay on Eagan Avenatti, a temporary form of bankruptcy that would remain in effect until the debt to Tobin was repaid. The timing and circumstances of this development \u2014 which meant Frank could not move forward in his effort to recoup the millions he said he was owed \u2014 troubled the judge in charge of adjudicating the bankruptcy. Referring to what she described as a \u201cstench of impropriety,\u201d the judge said it was unclear whether \u201cTobin had some relationship with the firm that would have induced a collusive filing\u201d or whether \u201cEagan Avenatti just got plain lucky.\u201d\u201cAt their root, the O\u2019Malley thing and the Frank thing, they were both about Michael not playing nicely with others,\u201d says a prominent Los Angeles litigator who has known Avenatti for years and requested anonymity because he still occasionally works with him. \u201cMichael has always been attack, attack, attack. That ability to sit down and calmly settle things behind closed doors, that\u2019s the club missing from his bag. He has no reluctance about letting problems turn into public, very ugly brawls.\u201dAvenatti has played down the relevance of his recent legal travails, which he says are overshadowed by the $1 billion in settlements and verdicts he claims to have won for his clients as lead counsel. \u201cThe kind of work I do,\u201d Avenatti told me recently, \u201cthere\u2019s usually a lot of money on the line, there are jobs on the line. It\u2019s not a world that lends itself to everyone being friendly all the time. We\u2019re certainly not sitting around holding hands, singing \u2018Kumbaya.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn February of this year, a settlement with Frank was approved by a bankruptcy judge: Eagan Avenatti was to pay Frank $4.85 million, with $2 million due in May. (That first payment was missed; the parties now dispute the terms of the settlement.) Around the same time, Avenatti reached out to William Hearon, a lawyer friend, to talk about a new client he was considering representing in a civil suit. \u201cYou take cases because you think you\u2019re right, because you trust your client,\u201d Hearon, a Miami attorney, told me. \u201cAnd that was what was happening here: Michael was convinced a wrong had been perpetrated, and he wanted to help correct it.\u201dAvenatti has taken great pains not to reveal how he was introduced to Stormy Daniels, possibly because he worries the story of their meeting could help fuel persistent suspicions that he is acting on behalf of a Democratic donor \u2014 charges he vehemently denies. (The Times has reported that Avenatti reached out to major Democratic financial backers, including David Brock, to discuss funding for the lawsuit, but that no money changed hands.) Daniels, for her part, told me Avenatti was not the only attorney she spoke with after parting ways with her previous lawyer, Keith Davidson. \u201cMichael never sought me out,\u201d Daniels told me. \u201cI hate it when people say Avenatti must have persuaded me to do this. I had the same conversation with him I had with other lawyers,\u201d she went on. \u201cMichael was the best choice. He never tried to discredit what I was saying. He believed me. He thought I was speaking the truth.\u201dAs Daniels saw it, a January article in The Wall Street Journal publicly disclosing the 2016 payments from Cohen for the first time had \u201couted\u201d her without her permission, and mischaracterized the situation. She has since said she was \u201cintimidated\u201d and \u201ccoerced\u201d into agreeing to the NDA. And after Cohen subsequently produced a letter he said was signed by Daniels, denying an affair ever took place, she grew increasingly frustrated. \u201cPart of the reason that we went with a media-heavy strategy,\u201d Avenatti told me, \u201cwas because we wanted to reset the narrative around my client. I wanted the American people to see what she\u2019s all about. I wanted them to see her in the way that I had come to know her.\u201dOn March 6, Avenatti and Daniels entered their lawsuit against the president and Michael Cohen in a California court, arguing that the 2016 NDA was null and void. His first media appearance in the case, on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d was the very next day.The potential legal costs of a press-heavy approach, meanwhile, are immense. Should Avenatti, for instance, fail in his bid to invalidate the NDA, his client, who described on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d the details of her alleged affair with Trump \u2014 down to the precoital spanking and the claim that she could identify his genitals \u2014 could be liable for millions in damages. And by continuing to appear on television, Avenatti risks annoying jurists on his cases like Kimba Wood, the judge overseeing the federal Cohen probe. At a hearing in early June, Wood instructed Avenatti that he had to choose between his \u201cpublicity tour\u201d and representing Daniels\u2019s interests in her courtroom. \u201cI either want you to participate or not be in the matter at all,\u201d the judge went on. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have some existence in a limbo where you\u2019re free to denigrate Mr. Cohen and, I believe, potentially deprive him of a fair trial by tainting a jury pool.\u201d (Avenatti subsequently withdrew the motion to represent Daniels in Wood\u2019s court, while reserving the right to refile at a later date.)\u201cMy own personal opinion is he\u2019s getting too much exposure,\u201d says Robert Bennett, President Clinton\u2019s personal lawyer leading up to the 1999 impeachment hearings. \u201cIf you want to really win, and not just cause embarrassment to the White House, you should resist the urge to be in the spotlight all the time. You don\u2019t want to overplay your hand.\u201dA few days after Judge Wood delivered her ultimatum, I met Avenatti at his apartment in Los Angeles. Climbing into a spectacularly expensive European convertible \u2014 for privacy reasons, I agreed not to identify the make \u2014 we sped south on the 405 toward Newport Beach.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I was able to just chill,\u201d Avenatti shouted over the throaty gurgle of the engine. He toyed with the stereo, settling on the Guns N\u2019 Roses cover of \u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door.\u201d The traffic coarsened and then stopped dead. An S.U.V. pulled up alongside us. The driver\u2019s face was crumpled with rage.\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d Avenatti asked.\u201cEssentially,\u201d I translated, \u201che\u2019s arguing that you cut him off.\u201d\u201cBack in the day,\u201d Avenatti told me, cranking up the volume knob, \u201cI\u2019d follow that guy off the highway. Have a talk. Can\u2019t do that anymore. Too much at stake.\u201dHis phone rang. It was a reporter at a local law magazine, asking for comment on a new countersuit filed by Keith Davidson, Daniels\u2019s former lawyer, who was claiming Avenatti and Daniels had defamed him. (Cohen has filed an analogous motion, seeking to stop Avenatti from talking about him in the press; Avenatti says the motion is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d) \u201cYou want a comment?\u201d Avenatti responded. \u201cHere\u2019s the comment: Keith Davidson is a disgrace.\u201dAvenatti\u2019s offices, in Newport Beach, occupy half a floor of a tower overlooking the city\u2019s crowded downtown and, farther out, the crenulate, denim-blue sprawl of the Pacific. The space is airy and quiet, decorated with paintings by an Italian artist Avenatti admires. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorite pieces right there,\u201d he said, gesturing at an angular, modernist canvas that must have measured more than 30 feet across. The subject appeared to be Batman. \u201cOverlooking Gotham City,\u201d he noted with approval.Avenatti settled into his chair, crossing his legs and gazing at the heap of paperwork on his desk. \u201cAnd none of this is Stormy-related,\u201d he said. I wondered if, given the intense highs of the Daniels case, he could envision himself going back to regular old corporate law in a full-time capacity. Wouldn\u2019t politics be more appealing?There was a long pause. \u201cNever say never,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve told me four months ago we\u2019d sit here talking about this \u2014 that I\u2019d be representing an adult film star, to in the present, that I would become a household name, at least in a lot of households \u2014 I would\u2019ve told you, \u2018You are out of your mind!\u2019\u2009\u201d He went on: \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen over the next 18 to 24 months. I just don\u2019t know.\u201dTwo weeks later, in response to a journalist on Twitter, Avenatti would go a step further, saying he\u2019d run for president if \u201cthere is no other candidate in the race that has a REAL chance of beating\u201d Trump.At the end of the day, we climbed into the sports car and headed back toward Beverly Hills. The sun was setting, the temperature was hovering around 75 degrees and there was a warm breeze blowing off the ocean. Even on the 405, the air was fragrant. Using the car\u2019s paddle shifters, Avenatti dropped the car into fifth, and we shot forward down the carpool lane until the surrounding scenery had been reduced to a nauseating blur.Around Torrance, I spotted the lights.\u201cPull over,\u201d the police cruiser\u2019s loudspeaker crackled.I sneaked a look at Avenatti. He was smiling. He took the next exit, and drawing to a halt in a strip-mall parking lot, waited for the cop to reach his window. Instead of writing a ticket, the officer gave Avenatti a warning: \u201cSir, in the future, make sure to stay in your lane.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the investment firm Columbus Nova. Its biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg; the firm is not controlled by Vekselberg.An earlier version of this article misidentified Richard Gephardt for whom Avenatti worked in 1989. He was a representative, not a senator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Education of a Brotelier", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Weprin, 40, had taken the subway there from Manhattan, an experience that he seemed to regard as a kid would a carnival ride. (He stood the entire train ride despite all the empty seats, and excitedly gave a subway mariachi musician 10 bucks.) When he emerged from underground, he didn\u2019t have his bearings. He walked south. He pivoted. He walked north. He asked a security guard for directions. Then he found what he was looking for.As Instagram bait goes, it will be hard to beat the view from the roof bar \u2014 the entire East Side skyline of Manhattan. \u201cThe Graduate was just an idea, and now it\u2019s coming to life in New York City,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, adding, as he often does, a four-letter expletive. Then he spotted a hot dog truck, ambled over and ordered two, which he gulped down in one bun.Mr. Weprin is the founder and chief executive of AJ Capital Partners, the Chicago real estate company that is behind Graduate Hotels, a four-year-old chain of boutique hotels situated near college campuses and designed to cater to the nostalgia and local boosterism that are part of the culture of university towns. (Room keys are imprinted with the names of famous alumni, and public spaces are decorated with historical photos of campus life, vintage art and other collegiate artifacts.)\u201cThe cost of living is low, you have culture, you have commerce, and you have a youthful energy,\u201d said Mr. Weprin, who, with his confident manner and determinedly youthful look (that country singer cap seems to be a staple of his wardrobe) might well represent a new generation of hotel executive: the brotelier.He and his company are trying to create a brand that will find year-round business by catering to more than just alumni coming back for once-a-year football weekends or 10-year anniversaries of their graduating classes. Travel to college towns has increased in recent years thanks to more frequent visits by \u201chelicopter parents\u201d and the rise of the parent-child college tour. Mr. Weprin, who grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from the University of Tennessee, has even come up with a name for this growing niche: \u201cvisitcation.\u201dThere are 11 Graduate Hotels in locations like Ann Arbor, Mich.; Oxford, Miss.; Tempe, Ariz.; and Charlottesville, Va.; and nine more in construction or renovation phases, including in Nashville, New Haven and Palo Alto, Calif. In September, AJ Capital expects to close a $475 million fund-raising round, said Cooper Manning, a principal of AJ Capital and its head of investor relations. The company expects the portfolio to grow to 30 hotels or more. The company has $3 billion in assets.In 2014, Mr. Manning \u2014 whose brother Eli, the New York Giants quarterback, is one of Mr. Weprin\u2019s best friends \u2014 began to advise Mr. Weprin as he was developing the Graduate in Oxford, home of the University of Mississippi, the alma mater of the two Mannings and their father, Archie. The Manning family connected Mr. Weprin to locals and helped him get a feel for the Ole Miss vibe. Mr. Weprin named the roof bar the Coop.Mr. Weprin didn\u2019t start out to be a hotelier.\u201cLarry knew everyone,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. \u201cHe had a lot of influence and power, and a lot of swagger.\u201dAfter two years in Nashville, where he and a college friend started a business buying and renovating buildings, Mr. Weprin and his wife, Mary Ann, moved back to Chicago, and Mr. Weprin took a job overseeing Mr. Levy\u2019s real estate investments.Among the investments that were in his purview was Mr. Levy\u2019s interest in Auberge Resorts, which operated luxury hotels like the Esperanza Resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In the fall of 2008, as the economy was cratering, Mr. Levy told Mr. Weprin that he intended to sell his interest in Auberge. Mr. Weprin, a new father who was studying for an M.B.A. at Northwestern University, decided he wanted to buy it.Mr. Levy was encouraging, but reminded Mr. Weprin that he was going to have a hard time getting bank financing to buy a luxury hotel business when Wall Street was in a free fall. He gave him about 45 days to get the money.\u201cMy dermatologist from Dayton, Ohio, was probably our largest investor,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. (AJ Capital sold its interest in Auberge in 2016.)\u201cThat validated us because people thought we were nuts trying to be in luxury hotels at that time,\u201d Mr. Weprin said.The idea for the Graduate started a little closer to home. Mr. Weprin was walking in his Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park when he focused in on a shuttered, neglected Days Inn. The location had none of the traditional market drivers in its favor \u2014 it wasn\u2019t in the business or tourist district. But it was near Wrigley Field, DePaul University, and the homes of thousands of young professionals and families who might need a close-by place to put up visiting relatives, if not a cool local spot to grab a drink.The first branded Graduate Hotel, in Tempe near Arizona State University, opened in 2014. Next came Athens, Ga., and Madison, Wis.\u201cWe want people to wake up and have a sense of place, and it should be secondary that they\u2019re waking up at the Graduate Hotel,\u201d Mr. Alford said.These sort of details, and the overall business model, have impressed other successful hotel owners. Jonathan Tisch, the chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels, met Mr. Weprin about six years ago, when Mr. Weprin was attending a Giants game with Eli Manning\u2019s wife, Abby. (The Tisch family owns the Giants.)The men, along with their wives, have become friends. (Mr. Tisch\u2019s wife, Lizzie, persuaded Mr. Weprin to include her student ID photo on a key card for the Graduate in Ann Arbor, putting her in the company of Gilda Radner, Iggy Pop and Desmond Howard.) But the two have a professional connection as well.\u201cI have tremendous respect for him for finding a market that was not necessarily being filled and, having been in the business for 35 years myself and knowing the challenges, for having the ability to react to the white space and create a brand,\u201d Mr. Tisch said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Books Consider What Happens When the Robots Take Over", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistThere is little doubt humanity is on the precipice of massive change in how we work. The only question is whether it is a future of shared prosperity and leisure or one of mass unemployment and turmoil.\u201cThe Future of Work\u201d offers a quick introduction to the basic concepts that underlie the debate. We find here all the current buzzwords, from \u201cmachine learning\u201d to \u201cthe Internet of Things\u201d to \u201cprecision medicine.\u201dHowever, it never scratches far beneath the surface, or tries to answer the many questions it raises. That makes \u201cThe Future of Work\u201d a quick read but ultimately leaves the reader wanting, like a computer with too little data to draw any conclusions.The second section of the book, for example, addresses the need for enormous societal change, including a shift to lifetime learning, a need for a new social contract and new definitions of work. These are laudable goals, but how do we achieve them?The notion of a universal basic income (in which everyone receives enough money to live) gets mentioned and defined. But the huge cost and attendant challenges are barely addressed.Perhaps the most interesting observations in the book relate to the rise of Donald Trump. \u201cTrump himself may be a transitional political leader, but the cleavages he identified are real and enduring,\u201d West writes, noting that political and economic turmoil are likely only to grow.The biggest challenges shaping the future of work, West writes, will demand greater political will at a time when it\u2019s hard to imagine any politician enacting legislation that might demand long-term thinking or lead to shared sacrifice. Among his recommendations are abolishing the Electoral College and implementing significant campaign finance reform \u2014 but we might have to wait until the robots actually take over for either of those things to come to pass.\u201cThe Fourth Age\u201d not only discusses what the rise of A.I. will mean for us, it also forces readers to challenge their preconceptions. And it manages to do all this in a way that is both entertaining and engaging.Reese, whose day job is chief executive of the technology research company Gigaom, begins by grounding the reader in what he sees as the three major changes in human civilization. The first, characterized by the discovery of fire and language, led humans to greatly increase their brain size, paving the way for future advancement. The second was the development of agriculture, which led to the birth of cities. And, finally, writing and the wheel have shaped much of everything until the present.Robots and A.I., meanwhile, promise a fourth age characterized by new challenges, including what the place of humans will be in a world filled with devices that are stronger and potentially smarter than us.Reese makes the possibility of impending doom quite palpable, with an array of anecdotes. It\u2019s not a light read, in large part because the issues Reese is grappling with are complicated and filled with ethical problems the likes of which humans have never confronted.Will robots and A.I. take all the jobs or will just as many new ones be created? Will all of society benefit, or only those who own the robots? Assuming we could, should we build computers that are as broadly intelligent as humans? And if we do, to what ends? Can computers become conscious? And if a computer does become conscious, does it deserve rights?You don\u2019t have to have all the answers \u2014 even the experts don\u2019t agree. But \u201cThe Fourth Age\u201d successfully forces us to face just how thorny those questions are.Compared with the amount of ink spilled over the prospects of artificial general intelligence and all its accompanying fears \u2014 the singularity! \u2014 there\u2019s been much less attention to the smaller changes already happening in the realm of A.I. and their quite profound economic implications.Enter \u201cPrediction Machines,\u201d which looks at just how far \u201cnarrow A.I.\u201d has come over the past few years. Computers are already good at performing a single task for which they have been trained, making them more efficient and cost-effective than humans in many cases.Of course, decision-making involves more than just being able to make accurate predictions, but A.I. is also being drafted for higher-level functions including using predictions to weigh outcomes and pass judgment.For all their gains, though, computers are significantly better under certain conditions \u2014 say, when they have a lot of past data \u2014 and decidedly weaker in others, like predicting \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d \u201cPrediction Machines\u201d does a good job of showing where computers work best and where humans still have an edge.The authors argue, though, that we shouldn\u2019t see this as an either/or fight to the death. In many cases, the best answer is to combine the powerful pattern recognition of a computer with the insight of a trained human.Take one example they offer, from the field of medicine. A well-trained algorithm was able to find a certain type of breast cancer with 92.5 percent accuracy. Human pathologists were able to do so at 96.6 percent. Stop there and you would say that computers are getting quite good, but not quite as good as highly skilled humans, at least at this task.But one need not stop there, and thankfully the researchers didn\u2019t. Combining the work of computers and humans resulted in 99.5 percent accuracy. In part, that\u2019s because humans and computers made different kinds of mistakes. It\u2019s certainly a happier outcome to imagine that we and the machines could work together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Fighting Injustice to Facing Death Row: The Bizarre Case of Pastor Glasgow", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe local media in Dothan, a small, unprepossessing city in Alabama\u2019s Wiregrass region, have long followed his story of reinvention from felon to do-gooder who hand-delivered meals, organized unity marches and \u2014 in a place where few were willing to speak out \u2014 crusaded against brutality and racism.Nowadays, though, one thing tops the search results: a mug shot, his eyes hooded, his white goatee jutting out at a defiant angle.In March, Mr. Glasgow was charged with capital murder.And then there is the fact that he did not actually kill anyone.The police say that a passenger in a car that Mr. Glasgow was driving got out and fatally shot another motorist. Under Alabama\u2019s complicity law, also known as the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d statute, an accomplice to a crime is just as guilty as the main actor. To make their case against Mr. Glasgow, prosecutors must prove that he knew, or reasonably should have known, that violence was going to occur. He says he had no idea.\u201cI don\u2019t do violence,\u201d he said when I went down to Dothan to hear the story firsthand. \u201cTo know that I\u2019m the cause, or involved in, a black woman\u2019s death? It\u2019s like the death of me, really.\u201dMr. Stokes and Mr. Glasgow have a history that is Dothanesque. They have been adversaries \u2014 Mr. Glasgow, who is black, once protested when Mr. Stokes, who is white, chained two African-American bail-bond clients to the courthouse doors. Mr. Stokes was convicted of misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment, and complained that Mr. Glasgow had unduly made a racial issue out of it.But it all turned out to be nothing personal: Mr. Glasgow has now requested Mr. Stokes\u2019s investigative services on his very bizarre case.Here\u2019s what happened: On Sunday, March 25, Mr. Glasgow was in the Bottom, the poor neighborhood where he does much of his work, with a friend known as Little John. A young man, Jamie Townes, who Mr. Glasgow says was an acquaintance, approached and reported that his car was missing. Mr. Glasgow believed he had seen the car, a Monte Carlo, a few blocks away.Mr. Townes, a woman named Choyce Bush, Little John and Mr. Glasgow got into the car Mr. Glasgow was driving that day, a borrowed brand-new Toyota Camry, to go look for it.The Monte Carlo had gone on a wild ride, careening through church grounds, fields and ditches, knocking over a street sign and ramming into a tree in someone\u2019s front yard. Finally, with its hood popped open, blocking the driver\u2019s view, it plowed into the front of the Camry on the driver\u2019s side.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find the car,\u201d Mr. Glasgow said. \u201cThe car found us.\u201dAfter the collision, Mr. Townes got out of the back seat of the Camry and, the police say, began firing at the driver of the Monte Carlo, who everyone assumed was a man.It turned out to be Breunia Jennings, a young woman with a long history of mental illness, who in the preceding hours had cut her hair short, fled from a motel barefoot and barely dressed, donned men\u2019s clothing and, apparently, found Mr. Townes\u2019s car with the motor running. The police now believe that she was driving so erratically because she was being chased.There\u2019s more to the story. Mr. Glasgow says that not only did the Monte Carlo hit the Camry from the front, but another vehicle hit the Camry from behind. (Ms. Bush also told the police about a rear-end collision, and Mr. Townes said he was \u201cpunch drunk\u201d from \u201cmultiple collisions,\u201d according to police testimony.) The Camry did suffer some rear damage, but no third vehicle was ever found.Thinking there was some sort of ambush in progress, Mr. Glasgow says, he ducked, and did not see the shooting. Nor, he says, was he aware that Mr. Townes had gotten out of the car.Dothan is a city where judgment is swift and punishment can be harsh. It is the seat of Houston County, which ranks among the top 10 in the nation for death row convictions. It has a relatively new district attorney; the previous one was known for striking African-Americans from juries.But at Mr. Glasgow\u2019s preliminary hearing, where he appeared in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, Judge Benjamin Lewis seemed dubious that criminal charges were warranted.Judge Lewis took the rare step in a capital murder case of allowing Mr. Glasgow to post bond. A grand jury will decide whether to indict him.While he waits, the police, some local news coverage and the Dothan rumor mill have portrayed him as callous and indifferent. Much has been made of the fact that he did not call the police to report the Monte Carlo missing, nor did he call 911 after the accident.To the first point, Mr. Glasgow says, he and his passengers believed the car had been taken by a friend. To the second, the police arrived at the scene moments after the shooting, so he says there was no need to call them.There has been surprisingly little controversy over what may be the most unflattering part of the episode: Mr. Glasgow spent the minutes after the accident trying to commit insurance fraud. The Camry\u2019s owner was concerned that her insurance would not cover the accident, so she hurried to the scene in order to stand in as the driver.At the time, Mr. Glasgow says, he did not know that anyone had died.When Mr. Glasgow learned, hours later at the police station, that the situation was far more serious than just a car wreck, he says he promptly confessed to having been the driver.Mr. Glasgow, 53, says he did not know that Mr. Townes, 27, had a gun. Even so, prosecutors may try to argue that it was reasonable to expect that Mr. Townes, who the police say is a drug dealer, would commit violence. Mr. Townes had previous state charges for theft and drug possession, but not for violent offenses.Mr. Townes\u2019s lawyer, James Parkman III, says his client fired in self-defense, pointing to a Facebook post in which Ms. Jennings said she was going to \u201cstab and shoot\u201d and \u201ccatch a murder case.\u201dIn the eyes of the police, Mr. Glasgow\u2019s association with Mr. Townes is suspicious. But helping people with unsavory pasts is Mr. Glasgow\u2019s calling. It was some two decades ago, during Mr. Glasgow\u2019s most recent of several stints in prison, that he and a friend conceived of a ministry focused on addiction, poverty and life after incarceration. They called it The Ordinary People Society.\u201cThe real story of what happens in America happens in these small towns, and in these small towns there are people whose rights have been completely upended,\u201d said Asha Bandele, until recently a senior director at the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped finance Mr. Glasgow\u2019s work for years.Dothan\u2019s population is about one-third African-American, but the city has an entrenched white power structure: It has never had a black mayor, police chief, circuit judge, county sheriff or school superintendent. It is the type of place where, if you call the police chief or the district attorney with a complaint, he may offer to pray with you right there on the line. In part through the common ground of Christianity, Mr. Glasgow has been able to forge some relationships with white businessmen who help pay for his work.But where some see an advocate, many others \u2014 particularly white people in town \u2014 see a charlatan. The murder charge complicated matters. Though his hearing was packed with supporters, some African-American residents have turned against Mr. Glasgow as well.The city was teeming with unfounded rumors: That Mr. Townes was actually Mr. Glasgow\u2019s son. That they were in cahoots as drug kingpins. That Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Townes had terrorized and raped Ms. Jennings, then hunted her down. I heard that one from Ms. Jennings\u2019 mother, Lakesia Reeves, who said she heard it from an anonymous caller.In that environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Glasgow, too, would believe he is being deliberately targeted. For his opponents, he says, restoring voting rights to felons was bad enough, he says, but the victory of Mr. Jones, a Democrat, in the Senate race was the final straw. \u201cThey want me dead,\u201d he insisted.Accustomed to being an activist for others, Mr. Glasgow now finds himself without a champion of his own. But as he awaits the grand jury\u2019s decision, he has found a new crusade: changing the accomplice law.\u201cI did my time for what I did,\u201d he said, speaking of previous armed robbery and drug convictions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Druse Call New Law a Betrayal.", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALIYAT EL-KARMEL, Israel \u2014 On the edge of this Druse village, perched on a quiet green ridge above the Mediterranean, is a national monument to more than 420 Druse soldiers and security force members who have fallen in battle for Israel.The tiny, Arabic-speaking Druse minority threw its lot in with Jews even before the state was established. In the 70 years since, both groups have called their strategic alliance a \u201ccovenant of blood\u201d and described each other as \u201cblood brothers.\u201dMost divisively for Israel\u2019s Arab minority, which makes up 21 percent of the population of nearly nine million, it also omits any mention of democracy or equality for all citizens.The Druse, a generally quiescent religious group of about 145,000 citizens for whom loyalty to the state is an article of faith, have denounced the legislation as a stinging insult and a betrayal. And now they are spearheading a swelling backlash against the law that is roiling the country and posing a stiff challenge for the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201cIt\u2019s enough of patting us on the shoulder and saying, \u2018You are our brothers, we love you,\u2019\u201d said Shadi Nasraldeen, 45, a native of Daliyat el-Karmel whose brother, Lutfi, an Israeli soldier, was killed during the last war in Gaza, in 2014.\u201cThere has to be full equality in a democratic state,\u201d said Mr. Nasraldeen, who ended a 26-year army career last year and now works at the memorial site, which holds lectures and educational activities. \u201cWe are the first to run into battle and the first to die on the flag.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Israeli people simply abandoned us. They say they didn\u2019t. But according to the clauses of this law, we don\u2019t exist.\u201dLike Jewish 18-year-olds, Druse men are, by law, conscripted into military service. Though small in numbers, the Druse play an outsize role in Israel\u2019s cherished security establishment, and engender deep sympathy in broader Israeli society.The outcry from the Israeli Druse has exposed flaws in the law for many Jews who previously accepted it as a natural outgrowth of Zionism.\u201cThis law has nothing: It does not have equality, it does not mention \u2018all its citizens,\u2019 there is no promise of security for all citizens, no democracy,\u201d Shlomo Aharonishki, one of the former commissioners, said on Army Radio on Tuesday. \u201cIt has nothing besides the Jewish people. They are the only ones, and there is nothing other than them.\u201dThe Druse, a sect that split off from Islam 1,000 years ago, have members spread across Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and northern Israel.

{"Headline": "Former Assistant Professor Wins Retaliation Claim Against Columbia", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter two days of deliberation, a jury determined on Thursday that a Columbia University professor retaliated against a former assistant professor who accused him of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.Ms. Ravina\u2019s lawyers described her as a promising junior faculty member at Columbia and part of a small pool of academics who publish research on investor data in the United States.Her problems began when she was on the verge of accessing data on the investment decisions of workers preparing to retire. Mr. Bekaert, a senior faculty member who has taught at Columbia for nearly 20 years, had ties to the company that owned the data Ms. Ravina needed.Claims of harassment began soon after.The suit describes Mr. Bekaert as a rapacious supervisor who used his authority to delay Ms. Ravina\u2019s research and undermine her attempts to gain tenure. He told her of his sexual exploits and preferences, touched her inappropriately and asked that she call him \u201csexy,\u201d according to the suit.After she took her complaints to Columbia leadership, Ms. Ravina\u2019s tenure process was sped up and a paid leave that the university had granted her for the 2015-16 academic year was revoked. Ms. Ravina was denied tenure.The university\u2019s lawyers attempted to portray Ms. Ravina as a subpar employee who did not get tenure because of her poor performance. Although jurors believed Mr. Bekaert had retaliated, he was not held liable for discrimination.In Tuesday\u2019s closing statements, Ms. Ravina\u2019s lawyer, David Sanford, called for Columbia to bolster the staff in its Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action office and regulate relationships between junior and senior faculty.\u201cColumbia emboldened Professor Bekaert by its inaction,\u201d Mr. Sanford told the jury. \u201cYou would likewise embolden Professor Bekaert if you do not act.\u201dShortly after the eight-person jury delivered its verdict, Ms. Ravina took the stand again as the next phase of the trial began.

Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan, denied Mr. Ng\u2019s request for a two-month delay, but a new dispute has arisen, over whether Mr. Ng may postpone his surrender for medical reasons.\u201cMany kinds of bail conditions favor the rich,\u201d Judge Rakoff wrote, adding that conversely, many defendants were too poor to afford \u201ceven the most modest of bail bonds or financial conditions of release.\u201d\u201cThis is a serious flaw in our system,\u201d the judge said. \u201cBut it is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who, for whatever reason, can provide reasonable assurances against flight.\u201dRuling that Mr. Zarrab posed a risk of flight and that no conditions, including privately funded armed guards, would assure his appearance at trial, Judge Berman also found such a request \u201cunreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.\u201dThe government objected to Mr. Ng\u2019s release under similar conditions. A prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that Mr. Ng had access to private airplanes, foreign passports and was a risk to flee. \u201cFifty-million-dollar bond is meaningless to him; $20 million is meaningless to him,\u201d Mr. Richenthal said.Among other strict conditions, the judge also said Mr. Ng\u2019s guards could use \u201clegal force as they deem appropriate\u201d to prevent him from fleeing.Mr. Ng was convicted in July 2017 of bribery, money laundering and other counts, for which he received the four-year sentence and was told to surrender on July 10.But last month, his lawyers asked for the delay until Sept. 10. They said Mr. Ng \u201chelms a vast network of real estate businesses in China with many employees and a diverse portfolio of holdings worth billions of dollars.\u201dHe had been \u201cworking diligently to arrange for the management of his business while he is incarcerated,\u201d one lawyer, George N. Bauer, wrote.In particular, he said, Mr. Ng was in the final stages of lengthy negotiations concerning a $10 billion real estate project that was expected to create 10,000 jobs and had made \u201csignificant progress,\u201d but was \u201centering the most complex and precarious stage of the negotiations.\u201dObjecting to the delay, Mr. Richenthal, the prosecutor, wrote that Mr. Ng\u2019s \u201cvast network of real estate businesses\u201d did not entitle him to \u201cspecial treatment with respect to surrender.\u201d Mr. Bauer responded that Mr. Ng was not seeking \u201cspecial treatment.\u201dThe judge denied the request on June 25, the same day Mr. Ng\u2019s lawyers reported that Mr. Ng had been taken the evening before to the emergency room, suffering from severe back pain.Recently, Mr. Ng\u2019s lawyers asked that he be allowed to seek treatment for a range of afflictions, including \u201crecent recurrent and unpredictable headaches\u201d and pain in other parts of his body.

{"Headline": "The Most Important Number in Finance Is Going Away. Wall St. Isn\u2019t Prepared.", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the world of finance, there is one number that arguably matters more than any other. You can find it in the small print on adjustable-rate mortgages and private student loans, it is the basis for enormous corporate loans, and it underpins nearly $200 trillion of derivatives contracts.But it is on the way out, and Wall Street has not worked out how to replace it.The number in question is called Libor, which is short for the London interbank offered rate. Published daily, Libor is an interest rate benchmark, or the basis for many other interest rates. If you have heard of it, that might be because it was at the center of a market-manipulation scandal that resulted in jail time for some traders and billions of dollars in fines for many banks.There are other important financial benchmarks, of course \u2014 the Federal Reserve\u2019s fed funds rate and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note among them \u2014 but Libor has emerged over time as the dominant rate for determining interest payments on almost all adjustable-rate financial products.Now, regulators are stressing that the benchmark could be gone by 2021.What will replace it? Nobody knows for sure.As traders speculate about what will happen to financial markets when Libor disappears, regulators appear to be worried that banks are not taking the coming change seriously enough. To move away from Libor requires vast amounts of work, and given how tightly woven it is into the financial fabric, it isn\u2019t the kind of thing anyone wants to see rushed.\u201cI hope it is already clear that the discontinuation of Libor should not be considered a remote probability,\u201d Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech last week.Warning against \u201cmisplaced confidence in Libor\u2019s survival,\u201d Mr. Bailey said that the number of financial contracts with interest rates derived from the benchmark continued to grow. Regulators in the United States, including the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have raised similar warnings.On Thursday, a meeting that is scheduled at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will focus on preparing for a world without Libor: A panel is expected to address crucial details, including the best ideas for language that should be used to replace Libor in contracts for financial products like business loans, derivatives and floating-rate notes.Here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.Libor is calculated by stripping out the highest and lowest estimates and averaging the rest. There are many different versions of Libor, calculated in different currencies and over different borrowing time periods.The most widely used variant applies to borrowing dollars for three months. On Tuesday, that number \u2014 expressed as an annual rate \u2014 was 2.34 percent.If you have taken a loan with a variable interest rate, there is a good chance it is based on Libor. (The interest rate on such a loan is typically Libor plus a certain number of percentage points.) The same is true for loans to big companies and other institutions that borrow money, including cities, pension funds and university endowments.Libor\u2019s biggest use is in financial contracts known as derivatives. Some, like interest-rate swaps, are used by institutions to protect themselves from future swings in interest rates and by traders to place bets on which way rates will move in the future.At the end of 2016, there were more than $190 trillion of these Libor-based contracts outstanding all over the world.With a relatively small number of banks responding to the survey, it did not take traders long to realize they could skew the number higher or lower by coordinating with colleagues at other banks.The market-manipulation scheme started to unravel in 2008 when The Wall Street Journal published an article casting doubt on Libor\u2019s integrity. That prompted government investigations that eventually revealed what was going on.Banks collectively paid many billions of dollars in penalties for their roles in trying to rig Libor. A few former traders have gone to prison, including Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader who is serving an 11-year sentence in England.After all the fines, penalties and prison sentences had been handed out, the only reason some banks still respond to the Libor survey is that British regulators pressed them to do so. The regulators fear that banishing the rate in an abrupt, disorderly way could endanger the broader financial system.Regulators decided they would give the industry time to prepare itself for a world without Libor. After 2021, regulators will not push banks to participate in the Libor survey. Many people expect that absent that prodding, banks will stop responding, and Libor will disappear.For the record, the group that produces Libor \u2014 ICE Benchmark Administration \u2014 says it has held talks with banks about a voluntary agreement to continue submitting rates that would allow some form of Libor to be published into the middle of the next decade. No agreement has yet been struck.\u201cUltimately this is up to the banks,\u201d said Timothy Bowler, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThe banks have got to decide whether they want to keep Libor or not.\u201dThe transition to a post-Libor world would not be painless. Remember those $190 trillion of Libor-linked derivatives? Hardly any of those instruments \u2014 essentially contracts between two parties \u2014 provide a workable option for what to do if Libor were to vanish.\u201cIt\u2019ll be really nasty in terms of costly, difficult workouts,\u201d he said.The scope of the challenge is beginning to make people on Wall Street nervous. In the past few weeks, research reports have been published and conference calls with experts have been convened to consider ways to avert what could be a huge mess.An industry group sponsored by the Federal Reserve has developed a new benchmark rate to replace Libor: the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. It began to be published in April.Contracts must be changed. Computer systems must be updated. Customers must be communicated with. Such costly administrative work does not yield bonus-increasing fees, and it is not generally considered glamorous on Wall Street.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inertia. There\u2019s a lot of reluctance to make the change,\u201d said Richard Berner, a former Wall Street economist and director of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research until the end of 2017. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Ditko, Influential Comic-Book Artist Who Helped Create Spider-Man, Dies at 90", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteve Ditko, a comic-book artist best known for his role in creating Spider-Man, one of the most successful superhero properties ever, was found dead on June 29 at his home in Manhattan, the police said on Friday. He was 90.The death was confirmed by Officer George Tsourovakas, a spokesman for the New York Police Department. No further details were immediately available.Mr. Ditko, along with the artist Jack Kirby and the writer and editor Stan Lee, was a central player in the 1960s cultural phenomenon known as Marvel Comics, whose characters today are ubiquitous in films, television shows and merchandise.Though Mr. Ditko had a hand in the early development of other signature Marvel characters \u2014 especially the sorcerer Dr. Strange \u2014 Spider-Man was his definitive character, and for many fans he was Spider-Man\u2019s definitive interpreter.Kirby\u2019s take was rejected, and the character\u2019s origin was revamped to eliminate those similarities. (Out went a magic ring, among other elements.) Mr. Lee gave Mr. Ditko a synopsis to flesh out.Mr. Ditko ran with the character. Spider-Man made his debut that year in Amazing Fantasy No. 15, and the character\u2019s popularity led to his own title, The Amazing Spider-Man, which Mr. Ditko penciled, inked and largely plotted from 1963 to 1966.Unlike Superman or Batman (characters from Marvel\u2019s chief rival at the time, National Periodical Publications, which later became DC Comics), Spider-Man had humanizing flaws. He was hounded, not praised, by the press and the police. In his secret identity as Peter Parker, he was mocked by his peers. And he struggled with guilt over his uncle\u2019s death, which he felt he could have prevented, and fretted about his aging aunt.Mr. Ditko also helped conceive famous villains, like the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, and supporting characters.Spider-Man\u2019s fight scenes and aerial acrobatics had a spry kineticism that contrasted with the brawny physicality of Kirby\u2019s compositions. Spider-Man, unlike the thunder god Thor and other signature Kirby characters, was not musclebound; he was a slender teenager. While Mr. Lee\u2019s dialogue for Spider-Man could be buoyant, peppered with wisecracks, Mr. Ditko lent mood.Spider-Man\u2019s mask, obscuring his entire face, and his web-textured costume had a slightly morbid aspect. Spider-Man\u2019s pensive moments \u2014 when Peter agonized over sacrifices his alter ego had demanded of him, for example \u2014 echoed the psychological struggles in Mr. Ditko\u2019s earlier horror comics.After graduating from high school in 1945, Mr. Ditko joined the Army and was stationed in Germany, where he drew cartoons for a service newspaper. In 1950, under the G.I. Bill, he attended the Cartoonist and Illustrator School (which later became the School of Visual Arts) in New York.He added, \u201cThey always looked as if they were on the edge of some kind of revelation or breakdown.\u201dIn 1954, tuberculosis forced Mr. Ditko back to Pennsylvania, where he nearly died. After a year, he returned to New York, where he approached Mr. Lee, at the time a writer-editor for Atlas Comics, a precursor to Marvel.Mr. Lee, impressed with Mr. Ditko\u2019s speed and proficiency, hired him. Atlas\u2019s horror line, emasculated by the code, became largely divided between Kirby\u2019s stories, starring generic monsters with names like Groot and Fin Fang Foom, and Mr. Ditko\u2019s agonized character studies.Cutbacks at Atlas brought Mr. Ditko back to Charlton, where he and the writer Joe Gill created the nuclear-powered Captain Atom, before returning to what was now the Marvel Comics Group. Marvel was in a rebirth, starting with the publication of The Fantastic Four in 1961, and continuing with Thor and the Hulk.Spider-Man appeared in 1962. Kirby drew the cover of his debut, but for three years the character was Mr. Ditko\u2019s baby.For Dr. Strange\u2019s occult adventures and battles in alternate dimensions, Mr. Ditko created foreboding expanses of abstract shapes and patterns, ruled by evil sorcerers and supernatural entities.But it was with Spider-Man that Mr. Ditko flourished. Marvel artists generally followed the \u201cMarvel method,\u201d in which artists built on Mr. Lee\u2019s synopses and were encouraged to emulate Mr. Kirby\u2019s outsize style.Mr. Ditko, who focused less on fight scenes and more on Peter Parker\u2019s psyche, had broad license with plotting and drawing \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Many fans regard Issues 31, 32 and 33 \u2014 which climax with the superhero, after reviewing his life, triumphantly upending heavy machinery that has pinned him \u2014 as a Ditko peak.Mr. Ditko bristled at being denied royalties when Spider-Man had his own animated ABC television series and was used in product tie-ins. He left Marvel in 1965 (Spider-Man No. 38 was his final issue) and worked for other publishers before returning to Charlton.Mr. Ditko pursued Randian notions further, particularly with Mr. A, a character he created for Witzend, a black-and-white comic aimed at adults and unconstrained by the Comics Code. Mr. A, attired in a white suit and conservative hat, was named after \u201cA is A,\u201d the idea in Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d that there is one unassailable truth, one reality, and only white (good) and black (evil) forces in society. Unlike mainstream superheroes, he killed criminals.In 1968 Mr. Ditko joined DC, where he created the Hawk and the Dove, superpowered brothers of opposing moral dispositions, and the Creeper, a crime fighter with a maniacal laugh. Another bout with tuberculosis derailed those series, and both ended within a year.Mr. Ditko\u2019s aversion to attending comic conventions and meeting fans was well known. Early unauthorized reproductions of his work in fanzines angered him, as did the failure by some fanzine publishers to return originals he had lent them. By 1964 Mr. Ditko had withdrawn from the public eye, limiting exchanges to mail or telephone. His reclusiveness, and his Randian ideas, lent his work a patina of mystery.The 1970s and \u201980s proved comparatively fallow. Mr. Ditko\u2019s output plummeted, especially after Charlton\u2019s demise in 1978. In the 1980s, there were more stints at Marvel and DC and at the independent publisher Eclipse. However, in 1991, Mr. Ditko co-created Squirrel Girl for Marvel, who remains a fan favorite.There was no immediate information about survivors.Mr. Ditko was inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 1994. In Sam Raimi\u2019s Hollywood feature \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d in 2002, the opening credits read, \u201cBased on the Marvel comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.\u201d The 2008-9 ABC animated series \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d gave similar credit.Celebrities had slightly better luck. In the television documentary, Jonathan Ross, accompanied by the writer Neil Gaiman, visits the Manhattan building housing Mr. Ditko\u2019s studio, hoping for a meeting. The two briefly receive an audience. But on camera? Not a chance.An earlier version of a picture caption with this obituary referred incorrectly to the images shown. They are two full pages from The Amazing Spider-Man No. 33, not one.Sandra E. Garcia contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It has become one of the top European venture capital firms, investing in start-ups like Skype and the food delivery provider Deliveroo.Still, among the big selling points for Index \u2014 both to investors in its funds and to the entrepreneurs it hopes to back \u2014 is its international reach and outlook.

In those situations, what happened in the past \u2014 even if it was in the very near past \u2014 often becomes a marginal factor, said Nicole Sanchez, chief executive of Vaya Consulting, a company in Berkeley, Calif., that advises tech companies on inclusivity.\u201cThe way the big boys do business is that nothing is ever personal,\u201d said Ms. Sanchez. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018Can you make me money?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t really matter who gets hurt.\u201dMr. Cagney said in an interview on Friday that it had been a mistake to lie to SoFi\u2019s board and to have the two relationships with employees. He said it had taken him many months to convince his investors that he had changed.\u201cThere was a relatively long process of them understanding how I thought about it: \u2018Did I really learn a lesson from SoFi? Was I really going to try to do things differently?\u2019\u201d he said.But Mr. Cagney said he had never promised SoFi\u2019s board that he would not enter into any new workplace relationships and he disputed that the board pushed him out last year. He said he had resigned on his own and could rejoin SoFi\u2019s board anytime because he is one of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders.SoFi declined to comment.The two SoFi board members who funded Mr. Cagney\u2019s new company were David Chao of DCM Ventures and Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures. They have both left SoFi\u2019s board.Mr. Anderson did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Mr. Chao, who has joined Figure\u2019s board, said he had pressed Mr. Cagney on what he would do differently and was convinced that the entrepreneur was creating a workplace \u201cwhere all employees are being heard and treated fairly, period.\u201d He added, \u201cWe believe that he genuinely learned from his mistakes.\u201dThere is no clear agreement on how businesses should think about reinstating people after sexual misconduct, and each case presents its own complexities. But Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings\u2019 College of the Law, said the investors who funded Mr. Cagney\u2019s new company despite being aware of his past problems were taking a big risk.\u201cShould someone who just created an incredibly hostile work environment, and lied to his board, after doing what he had explicitly promised not to do, be hired as a C.E.O.?\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like a close one to me.\u201dMr. Cagney helped found Social Finance in 2011 to refinance student loans online. The start-up grew rapidly and has gained a valuation of more than $4 billion, providing big returns on paper for his early investors.The board learned separately that Mr. Cagney was in a relationship at that time with a woman in SoFi\u2019s marketing department, said the people briefed on the deliberations, who declined to be identified because the details are confidential.After Mr. Cagney acknowledged the relationship with the woman in the marketing department, he promised the board he would not do anything like it again, three of the people said. The agreement was referred to by some employees as Mr. Cagney\u2019s \u201cfidelity pledge.\u201dAs part of the investigation, Mr. Cagney\u2019s behavior quickly came under scrutiny. At the time, he denied to board members and staff that he was in an intimate relationship at the company with anyone other than his wife, who also worked at SoFi, the people familiar with the proceedings said.Mr. Cagney reversed himself after Sullivan & Cromwell told the board there was ample evidence \u2014 in emails, hotel receipts and the manifests of private jet flights \u2014 that he had used company resources to pursue a romantic relationship with an employee, the people said. Mr. Cagney said he had previously suggested that employee as a promising candidate for chief financial officer.SoFi has since settled the lawsuit about the satellite office. Mr. Cagney said on Friday that he took responsibility for a \u201cget-it-done culture\u201d that had led to some \u201cuntenable circumstances.\u201d He added that he lied to the board \u201cto protect the people involved.\u201dMr. Cagney returned more quickly. Within weeks of leaving SoFi, he began talking to SoFi employees about a new company, two people who met with him said. When he hired former employees, SoFi sent him letters asking him to cease and desist.Mr. Cagney denied on Friday that he had recruited any current employees at SoFi.When Mr. Cagney began raising money for Figure last year, he approached current and former SoFi board members such as Mr. Chao of DCM and Mr. Anderson of Baseline.Both are prominent Silicon Valley investors, having made regular appearances on the Midas List, the Forbes magazine ranking of the most successful and powerful venture capitalists. Mr. Anderson was one of the earliest investors in Instagram and Twitter, while Mr. Chao had led DCM\u2019s bets on BitTorrent and Bill.com.Both had also been on SoFi\u2019s board during parts of Mr. Cagney\u2019s tenure there and knew at least some of his history at the company, according to five people familiar with the investors and documents reviewed by The Times. DCM and Baseline invested the $17 million in Figure in January.Another recent investor in Figure, RPM Ventures, had also funded SoFi. A current RPM partner, Adam Boyden, was the chief operating officer at SoFi when the problems with Mr. Cagney came up in 2012.Mr. Boyden, who is now also a board observer at Figure, did not respond to a request for comment.Not all investors who Mr. Cagney approached, and who knew of his history at SoFi, agreed to invest in Figure, said three people familiar with the discussions.At the venture firm Ribbit Capital, some employees opposed investing in Figure because of Mr. Cagney\u2019s past, three people briefed on the firm\u2019s negotiations said. Ribbit eventually decided to invest in Figure. Ribbit did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Cagney has now raised a total of $58 million for Figure. He has set up offices in San Francisco\u2019s financial district and hired more than 50 employees. He has told his investors that he sees an enormous opportunity ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bots of the Internet, Reveal Yourselves!", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bill in the California legislature would regulate bots by making them disclose their automated nature. But how?Robert M. Hertzberg\u2019s hatred of bots is personal.Mr. Hertzberg is a state Senator from California and last year, after he introduced a bail reform bill, he noticed that automated accounts on Twitter and Facebook were attacking him and his position. He is currently seeking re-election, and one of his opponents in the Democratic primary was a bail agent.For example, he said, one account rapidly responded to tweets about the bill in real time with the message: \u201cUnconstitutional bail reform doesn\u2019t work and is racist.\u201d So Mr. Hertzberg introduced another bill this year, the first of its kind in the United States, that would compel automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots \u2014 in other words, to disclose their non-personhood. Because bots are only effective if they seem convincingly human. Right? Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them. A law that discourages their use could help, but experts aren\u2019t sure how the one Senator Hertzberg is trying to push through, in California, might work.For starters, would bots be forced to identify themselves in every Facebook post? In their Instagram bios? In their Twitter handles?Oren Etzioni, the chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, applauded the spirit of the law but was not as sold on its letter. \u201cThis is groundbreaking legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on a trajectory where reality, the very fabric of the information we see, can be altered in an unprecedented fashion. When that\u2019s done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201dBut \u201cyou don\u2019t want to measure twice, regulate once,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\u201d \u201cNot only will it not fix the thing you\u2019re trying to fix,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019ll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\u201d But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab. Ms. Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \u201cinfluencing a vote in an election\u201d ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.Mr. Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.\u201cEmbarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I\u2019ve ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\u201d Mr. Calo said.With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.\u201cPolitical commentary comes in different forms,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticize a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\u201d he said, noting that he was not an expert on American political discourse. \u201cGiven that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to \u2018let\u2019s get something because its such an emergency.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\u201d he said. \u201cInventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fact-Checking Pompeo on Iran", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySupporters called his speech, delivered to an Iranian-American audience this past Sunday, a dose of realism that laid bare what they regard as the brazen corruption and hypocrisy of Tehran\u2019s religious hierarchy. Critics called the speech a prelude to attempted regime change by the United States \u2014 and perhaps armed conflict with Iran.Obscured in the debate was how much of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech was accurate, and whether in some instances \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 he may have exaggerated, omitted facts or mixed facts with conjecture. In at least one instance, Mr. Pompeo spoke inaccurately. A look at some of his key assertions:WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cEconomically, we see how the regime\u2019s decision to prioritize an ideological agenda over the welfare of the Iranian people has put Iran into a long-term economic tailspin. During the time of the nuclear deal, Iran\u2019s increased oil revenues could have gone to improving the lives of the Iranian people. Instead they went to terrorists, dictators, and proxy militias. Today, thanks to regime subsidies, the average Hezbollah combatant makes two to three times what an Iranian firefighter makes on the streets of Iran. Regime mismanagement has led to the rial plummeting in value. A third of Iranian youth are unemployed, and a third of Iranians now live below the poverty line.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and conjecture.Iran used at least some earnings from oil, including money impounded by sanctions but released when the nuclear deal took effect in 2016, to fill deficiencies in its budget. Iran also spent enormous sums to attract investment, buy and refurbish airplanes and ships, and provide financing to stimulate the economy. The decline in the rial, the national currency, has been attributed by economists not only to mismanagement but to the negative impact of President Trump\u2019s decision to renounce the nuclear agreement in May and restore the sanctions.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s basis for the wage comparison of Hezbollah fighters and Iranian firefighters is unclear.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cThe bitter irony of the economic situation in Iran is that the regime uses this same time to line its own pockets while its people cry out for jobs and reform and for opportunity. The Iranian economy is going great \u2013 but only if you\u2019re a politically-connected member of the elite. Two years ago, Iranians rightfully erupted in anger when leaked paystubs showed massive amounts of money inexplicably flowing into the bank accounts of senior government officials.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and omission. Mr. Pompeo was correct that corruption in Iran\u2019s government is pervasive, a fact that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has acknowledged. Mr. Pompeo was also correct in describing the popular anger that erupted over the leaked paystubs \u2014 but did not mention that some officials had leaked the information and that Mr. Rouhani ordered an investigation into the pay, which entangled associates that included his own brother.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cTake Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary. He is worth at least $300 million dollars. He got this money from embezzling public funds into his own bank account. The Trump administration sanctioned Larijani in January for human rights abuses, because we aren\u2019t afraid to tackle the regime at its highest level. Call me crazy \u2014 you won\u2019t be the first \u2014 but I\u2019m a little skeptical that a thieving thug under international sanctions is the right man to be Iran\u2019s highest-ranking judicial official.\u201dTHE FACTSFact and conjectureThe basis for Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertions about Mr. Larijani\u2019s supposed wealth and how he obtained it is unclear. But human rights activists corroborate Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that Mr. Larijani is complicit in rights violations. \u201cAs head of the judiciary he is certainly a leading human rights abuser,\u201d said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cFormer I.R.G.C. officer and Minister of Interior Sadeq Mahsouli is nicknamed \u2018the Billionaire General.\u2019 He went from being a poor I.R.G.C. officer at the end of the Iran-Iraq war to being worth billions of dollars. How\u2019d that happen? He somehow had a knack for winning lucrative construction and oil trading contracts from businesses associated with the I.R.G.C. Being an old college buddy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just might have had something to do with it as well.\u201dTHE FACTSTrue, rights advocates say.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cAnd not many people know this, but the Ayatollah Khamenei has his own personal, off-the-books hedge fund called the Setad, worth $95 billion, with a B. That wealth is untaxed, it is ill-gotten, and it is used as a slush fund for the I.R.G.C. The ayatollah fills his coffers by devouring whatever he wants. In 2013 the Setad\u2019s agents banished an 82-year-old Baha\u2019i woman from her apartment and confiscated the property after a long campaign of harassment. Seizing land from religious minorities and political rivals is just another day at the office for this juggernaut that has interests in everything from real estate to telecoms to ostrich farming. All of it is done with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei.\u201dTHE FACTSTrue, according to a Reuters investigation.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cJust earlier this month, an Iranian \u2018diplomat\u2019 based in Vienna was arrested and charged with supplying explosives for a terrorist bomb scheduled to bomb a political rally in France. This tells you everything you need to know about the regime: At the same time they\u2019re trying to convince Europe to stay in the nuclear deal, they\u2019re covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe.\u201dTHE FACTSFact, conjecture and omission.WHAT WAS SAID:\u201cIn response to myriad government failures, corruption, and disrespect of rights, since December Iranians have been taking to the streets in the most enduring and forceful protests since 1979. Some shout the slogan, \u201cThe people are paupers while the mullahs live like gods.\u201d Others choose to shut down the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. The specific grievances do differ, but all those voicing dissatisfaction share one thing: They have been ill-treated by a revolutionary regime. Iranians want to be governed with dignity, accountability, and respect.\u201dTHE FACTSMostly true but one inaccuracy.The protests pale in comparison to the enormous demonstrations and rallies that followed Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s suspiciously lopsided victory in the 2009 election. Millions of Iranians demanded a recount for their candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who was considered far more moderate than Mr. Ahmadinejad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Lenders and Payment Companies Get a Way to Act More Like Banks", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal government began clearing a path on Tuesday for online lenders and payment companies to more easily and directly compete with traditional banks, a change that one regulator said would allow innovative businesses to expand nationwide.Online lenders and other so-called fintech firms \u2014 including the payment processor Square, the online lender Lending Club and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase \u2014 have pressed for regulatory routes that would let them cut through the thicket of state and federal laws that govern financial businesses.\u201cCompanies that provide banking services in innovative ways deserve the opportunity to pursue that business on a national scale,\u201d Mr. Otting said.But legal challenges are almost certain. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors sued the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year to block such an action, but its case was dismissed because a charter had not yet been created. On Tuesday, it said the agency had exceeded its authority.John W. Ryan, the president of the conference, called the charter \u201ca regulatory train wreck in the making.\u201dDecisions on charters would place the federal government in the business of picking \u201cwinners and losers in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd taxpayers would be exposed to a new risk: failed fintechs.\u201dThe new charter is available only to companies that do not take and hold deposits, and it comes with a thick set of rules. Applicants will be required to prove that they have the capital and liquidity needed to carry out their plans and adequate security technology and internal controls to protect their customers and comply with financial laws.The Treasury\u2019s report also endorsed the idea of \u201csandboxes\u201d \u2014 live tests that allow companies to experiment, under a regulator\u2019s supervision, with new products and business models.Industry representatives praised the changes. \u201cThe O.C.C. has recognized that there\u2019s a new era, and they\u2019re updating their supervision and chartering framework to adapt to it,\u201d said Nat Hoopes, the executive director of the Marketplace Lending Association, whose members include Lending Point and Social Finance.Christin Spradley, head of external affairs for OnDeck, an online small business lender, said, \u201cThings are coming up aces today.\u201dTuesday\u2019s announcements \u201ccan provide us with much greater regulatory certainty, which would be a watershed for the industry,\u201d she said.Criticism of the new charter ranged from calling it unnecessary to calling it dangerous.Maria T. Vullo, the superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, said the new charter was an illegal move to undermine state supervision.\u201cA national fintech charter will impose an entirely unjustified federal regulatory scheme on an already fully functional and deeply rooted state regulatory landscape,\u201d she said.\u201cGiving national bank charters to nonbank lenders could open the floodgates to a wide range of predatory actors,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.Change will come slowly, said Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, an investment firm.\u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly going to be a number of companies that climb down the rabbit hole and test out this new charter, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a sudden sea change,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still substantive questions about the requirements, and for some companies it might be easier to just go another route.\u201dSquare, for example, applied last year for an \u201cindustrial loan company\u201d charter from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which would allow it to hold government-insured deposits. The company recently withdrew its application in what it called a \u201cprocedural step,\u201d but said it planned to refile.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the new charter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "McConnell Tries to Nudge Trump Toward Two Supreme Court Options", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, told President Trump this past week that Judges Raymond M. Kethledge and Thomas M. Hardiman presented the fewest obvious obstacles to being confirmed to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, according to Republican officials briefed on the conversation.While careful not to directly make the case for any would-be justice, Mr. McConnell made clear in multiple phone calls with Mr. Trump and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, that the lengthy paper trail of another top contender, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, would pose difficulties for his confirmation.The number of pages is said to run into the millions, which Mr. McConnell fears could hand Senate Democrats an opportunity to delay the confirmation vote until after the new session of the court begins in October, with the midterm elections looming the next month. And while Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial opinions are publicly known, Mr. McConnell is uneasy about relitigating Bush-era controversies, the officials briefed on his discussions with Mr. Trump said.With Senator John McCain\u2019s absence because of brain cancer, Republicans have just 50 votes, and Mr. McConnell does not want to draw the ire of his libertarian-leaning Kentucky colleague, Senator Rand Paul, who opposed hawkish Bush policies. Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell declined requests for comment.Mr. McConnell is similarly wary of imperiling the votes of two moderate Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. He has told Mr. Trump he could lose the two senators, who support abortion rights, if he picks another judge seen as a contender, Amy Coney Barrett, an outspoken social conservative who some observers believe may be more open to overturning Roe v. Wade.On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump was undecided about his pick \u2014 which he has said he will reveal in a prime-time address on Monday night \u2014 according to three people in contact with him. He went back and forth every few hours between the four options in front of him, with Judge Kethledge getting the least attention, people familiar with his thinking said. It is similar to how Mr. Trump has approached most of his self-imposed deadlines for appointees, toggling between choices until nearly the last moment.Mr. Trump, who in recent days has made mocking reference to the #MeToo movement at a rally and in private conversations, is said to be intrigued by the political statement of picking a woman. But he also likes Judge Hardiman, whom advisers say Mr. Trump came close to picking in 2017 before choosing Neil M. Gorsuch to fill his first Supreme Court vacancy.The president\u2019s only public statement about the choice confronting him came in a tweet from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., where he was spending the weekend. \u201cBig decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court!\u201d he wrote.Judge Kavanaugh, who has been seen as the front-runner, has inspired a broad campaign among supporters, but also a round of criticism from some Republicans, who have called his decisions in abortion and health care cases insufficiently conservative. His supporters have scoffed at the notion he is not conservative enough.Mr. Trump\u2019s hurdles with Judge Kavanaugh have been less about his judicial rulings than his proximity to the Bush family, of whom the president remains deeply skeptical, according to two people who have spoken with him.Judge Kethledge is a Midwesterner who has issued strongly conservative rulings on immigration, religion, campaign finance and gun rights. Like Justice Gorsuch, Judge Kethledge served as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy. But unlike most recent Supreme Court contenders, he graduated from a public university\u2019s law school, at the University of Michigan, and he has spent less time in Washington than many.Judge Hardiman has built a reputation as a reliable conservative on the federal appeals court in Philadelphia, where he has served alongside one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sisters, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who is said to have recommended Judge Hardiman for the Supreme Court vacancy last year.Mr. McConnell was originally hopeful that Mr. Trump would select Amul Thapar, a federal appeals court judge who was previously on the bench in Kentucky, but has concluded that the president is unlikely to name him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cynthia Nixon Thinks You\u2019re Underestimating Her", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "The actress-turned-candidate for governor is trying to persuade skeptical New York Democrats to see beyond her political inexperience, as some did with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Supported byEven then, no one was quite sure what to make of Cynthia Nixon.It was 2009, nearly a decade before her campaign for governor of New York, and Ms. Nixon was in Albany lobbying lawmakers on a marriage equality bill. One Republican senator began their meeting clutching a printout that suggested Ms. Nixon had been hypocritical. \u201cMarried people are the enemy,\u201d the senator read, citing a quote attributed to her on the internet.Ms. Nixon cut him off. She had indeed said that. As Miranda Hobbes, her character on \u201cSex and the City.\u201d\u201cHe just kind of folded up the paper and put it away,\u201d Ms. Nixon recalled as she sat in her kitchen in Manhattan, where a birthday card from her in-laws showed Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s face being punched by a golden fist. \u201cSo many people think they know me. They know one slice of me, and the slice that they know is really mostly a fictional character.\u201dFor months now, Ms. Nixon, 52, has been straining to introduce new slices of herself, challenging Mr. Cuomo in a Democratic primary on a platform of boundless progressivism, disdain for squishy centrism and higher taxes on the rich to finance much of her agenda. She is a lifelong New Yorker trying to convey urban authenticity \u2014 surely the only candidate in history who said she had no trouble performing nude on television because she had already breast-fed on the No. 2 train. But she is also a figure with effectively zero government or executive experience asking voters to make her New York\u2019s chief government executive, giving pause even to some who generally agree with her.And if Ms. Nixon\u2019s goal feels more plausible in the Trump era \u2014 if a reality television star can be president, why can\u2019t a worldly and accomplished actor run a state? \u2014 it is also more complicated. Many Democrats see the nation\u2019s government-by-celebrity experiment as a disaster, compelling Ms. Nixon to sell a liberal mass audience on her most challenging role to date: the well-chosen celebrity, the one who can do it right.\u201cI think I\u2019m being underestimated,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the campaign itself is being underestimated.\u201dAnd Mr. Cuomo has supplied Ms. Nixon with a political opening, her advisers believe, after two terms of Clinton-style triangulation that has grated on progressives, and recent guilty verdicts in corruption-tinged cases involving close allies of the governor.She talks passionately about raising taxes on the rich \u2014 a sometimes precarious stance for a statewide candidate whose jurisdiction would include the nation\u2019s financial capital \u2014 arguing that she can speak with authority on the matter \u201cbecause of my privilege, frankly.\u201dShe says she grasps the threat to abortion rights because her mother had an abortion when they were illegal. Ms. Nixon brought a wire hanger to a rally to make her point.\u201cBoth the media and the Democratic establishment, they\u2019re not quite getting this moment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, \u201cand how hungry people are for a change.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s team has alternated between projecting nonchalance about the challenge \u2014 while taking care to highlight his success with left-leaning causes like marriage equality and raising the statewide minimum wage \u2014 and casting Ms. Nixon as a clueless entertainer.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that voters don\u2019t believe she has the chops,\u201d said Lis Smith, a Cuomo campaign spokeswoman.Questions about her experience are both fair, Ms. Nixon said, and plainly gendered.\u201cIf I were a man with exactly the same r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I would not be getting this question to the extent that I am,\u201d she said.She acknowledged that her campaign operation, with a few dozen paid staff members, the majority of them female, is the largest entity she has overseen. In a 40-minute interview, Ms. Nixon initially laughed when asked to describe her management style, before settling on \u201ccollaborative\u201d and \u201copinionated.\u201d Her critics have been less generous, though at times their efforts have backfired. When a Cuomo supporter, Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, called Ms. Nixon an \u201cunqualified lesbian\u201d \u2014 Ms. Quinn is also a lesbian \u2014 Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign printed the phrase across official T-shirts. It became a best seller.But Ms. Nixon seems unsure. Is this the kind of winning that she would consider a success?On the one hand: She declined to name the senator who had confused her for Miranda all those years ago, on the logic that they might be working together soon.On the other hand: She would like to wait before answering the question of what qualifies as Cynthia Nixon winning.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask me,\u201d she said, \u201cat the end of this campaign.\u201dBy her freshman year of high school, Ms. Nixon had reached a conclusion about the sexes.The only child of an actress and a radio journalist who separated when she was 6, Ms. Nixon was raised largely by her mother, Anne, in their fifth-floor walk-up on 75th Street, near the East River.She began acting to save money for school and was by all accounts too talented to stop. While still a teenager, Ms. Nixon achieved an uncommon feat of Broadway stamina and masochism: racing between theaters each night to star in two productions at once.\u201cShe really instilled in Cynthia, \u2018Don\u2019t be so impressed with yourself,\u2019\u201d said Beth Sufian, a close friend since college, when Ms. Nixon, a Barnard undergrad, had a job sorting mail during a semester at sea.After a decade of steady, if not stratospheric, success on stage and screen, Ms. Nixon found a defining character in Miranda Hobbes, the career-minded lawyer on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d earning overnight recognition and a platform that she came to value.She took issue with some of the high-living show\u2019s \u201cconsumer aspects,\u201d she said, recalling her unease when an audience at a premiere cheered at the sight of an expansive closet. But she expressed no regrets about a notable cameo from the second season: Donald J. Trump. \u201cHe was kind of an iconic New York figure then,\u201d she said.\u201cActors are really communicators, right?\u201d she said, making an exception for \u201cintroverted geniuses\u201d like Philip Seymour Hoffman and James Dean. \u201cI\u2019m not introverted, and I\u2019m not a genius.\u201dHer interest in political activism began at the peak of her \u201cSex and the City\u201d fame, as her oldest child was entering kindergarten. Ms. Nixon was arrested in 2002 protesting budget reductions at City Hall and became a spokeswoman for the Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group.Ms. Nixon has framed education as the cause of her life, the biggest reason she ran when no other prominent Democrat stepped forward in the primary against Mr. Cuomo. \u201cThe fish rots from the head,\u201d she told a group of school superintendents in Albany last month, lashing the governor over funding decisions.Supporters have cited her work in education as perhaps her most significant credential. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural and legit organizer,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the director of New York Communities for Change.But some former city and state officials say Ms. Nixon\u2019s prominence in local education fights has been overstated. Marc La Vorgna, a former press secretary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 who himself had a chilly relationship with Mr. Cuomo \u2014 said he was taken aback this year to see Ms. Nixon \u201clabeled as an education advocate.\u201d\u201cIt was the most contested issue during Bloomberg, with 15 to 20 major education flare-ups and moments every year,\u201d said Mr. La Vorgna, who worked at City Hall from 2008 to 2013. \u201cShe was relevant in zero.\u201dRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Ms. Nixon was \u201calways out there with us\u201d early in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure but seemed to be less present at times since then.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t active as we were having the fights against Cuomo a few years ago, when he went after teachers and the union,\u201d she said. \u201cI just assumed she was busy with her acting career.\u201dRebecca Katz, a top adviser to Ms. Nixon, disputed any suggestion that her engagement had wavered, flagging news articles about Ms. Nixon\u2019s education work in recent years and noting that she had spoken at the teachers\u2019 federation national convention in 2014 at Ms. Weingarten\u2019s invitation.Ms. Nixon\u2019s advocacy did introduce her to two people who would prove consequential in her life. One was Ms. Marinoni, a veteran activist whom Ms. Nixon married after a long companionship with a man, Danny Mozes, whom she met in junior high school. (Mr. Mozes is the father of Ms. Nixon\u2019s two oldest children; she and Ms. Marinoni have a third.)\u201cVery generous,\u201d Ms. Nixon said in the interview. \u201cI mean, you know, I don\u2019t want to dispute.\u201dMs. Nixon said she had not spoken to the mayor since her campaign began. Mr. de Blasio, who has feuded loudly and frequently with Mr. Cuomo for years, declined an interview through a spokesman.Ms. Nixon threw her right shoulder into the closing door of the No. 6 train, and hoped.\u201cThat takes chutzpah,\u201d Vicki Schwaid, 60, called out from across the car, after Ms. Nixon\u2019s maneuver kept the door open long enough to get her party aboard. \u201cJust because of that, I\u2019m voting for you.\u201dThough Ms. Nixon\u2019s advisers insist she has much to offer residents upstate, it is here, on the stalled-out subways of her own city, where she has staked much of her candidacy. This is partly a matter of urgent policy substance, given the subway\u2019s dismal performance, and partly a keen bit of political signaling.\u201cCynthia Nixon rides the subway every day,\u201d riders have been told on her bold-type fliers underground.While she has little background in transportation policy, Ms. Nixon has sought the counsel of experts like Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Charles Komanoff, a veteran analyst.\u201cThere are people in New York City and New York State who are doing very well,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, \u201cbut who would not mind, and would actually welcome, the chance to pay more in taxes if it goes to the things that would benefit the great number of New Yorkers.\u201dIn person, Ms. Nixon generally presents as policy-fluent and has mostly avoided notable gaffes with reporters. Some who have briefed Ms. Nixon describe her as a quick study but concede the learning curve is steep.When pressed for a second or third beat on a subject, Ms. Nixon can be vague (though so, too, can many sitting officeholders). Asked how she might reimagine the M.T.A. to improve its function and rein in the cost of capital projects, she focused only on replacing the current chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, a Cuomo nominee who has said that he opposes a millionaire\u2019s tax because his rates would increase.\u201cMaybe that was a joke?\u201d she said, chatting on the train. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure.\u201d (Mr. Lhota, whose term expires in 2021, declined to comment.)Ms. Nixon\u2019s greatest hurdle in September is not necessarily a New York electorate that loves Mr. Cuomo. It is those Democrats who find him tolerable enough to re-elect anyway, concerning themselves more with control of Congress this fall.\u201cLet me put it this way: If Mayor Bloomberg was our governor, I would not be running,\u201d she said, suggesting faint praise for a figure whose reign she helped repudiate with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s election.Ms. Nixon stepped off the train at 103rd Street, bound for an event in East Harlem. \u201cPeople are very angry,\u201d she said of Mr. Cuomo. \u201cAnd people are onto him.\u201dWhen she reached street level, a woman with a cellphone sidled up, recording her day via social media live-stream. \u201cI\u2019m here with Cynthia Nixon, one of the most fashionable-est women in New York City!\u201d the stranger said, angling the phone as Ms. Katz, the Nixon adviser, shouted the primary date, which did not seem to register. \u201cWe\u2019re here doing it up in the city!\u201dMs. Nixon stared into the camera and reintroduced herself.\u201cHi,\u201d she said, smiling slightly. \u201cI\u2019m running for governor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumer Bureau Nominee Could Face \u2018Bumpy Ride\u2019 Over Lack of Experience", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, Ms. Kraninger will be anonymous no longer. After years of working as a career bureaucrat and congressional staff member, she will take a seat in the spotlight when senators from both parties examine her credentials to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency beloved by Democrats and excoriated by Republicans since its inception seven years ago.While Ms. Kraninger, an official at the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to take a much more business-friendly approach to consumer protection than many Democrats would like, her nomination presents something of a Hobson\u2019s choice. Scuttling her confirmation would extend the tenure of Mick Mulvaney, the agency\u2019s acting director and the head of the budget office, who has tried to cripple the consumer bureau by freezing enforcement activity, calling for deep budget cuts and halting new investigations.Critics say Ms. Kraninger, 43, is likely to pursue a similar path as Mr. Mulvaney, with whom she has worked closely at the White House budget office, where she serves as associate director for general government. In her current role, Ms. Kraninger oversees the budgets for a wide swath of government agencies, including the Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.But she has little experience with the consumer finance products and businesses that the watchdog agency was created to police, including lenders in the auto financing, credit card, and payday and student loan sectors.\u201cI had never heard of her because she has no record or experience in financial regulation,\u201d said J. W. Verret, a scholar at the conservative Mercatus Center Working Group on Financial Markets. \u201cI suspect that it will be a bumpy ride.\u201dRepublicans and industry groups have generally praised the choice of Ms. Kraninger, describing her as an effective manager to lead an agency whose ambitions they would like to see curbed. But there has been some hesitation among conservatives, who have questioned both her loyalties and her abilities.Democrats and progressive groups are preparing a fierce attack on Ms. Kraninger in the hopes of either bringing her nomination down or, at the very least, making it clear that she will be held accountable.\u201cWe deserve a consumer champion at the C.F.P.B., not Kathy Kraninger,\u201d said Karl Frisch, the executive director of the progressive group Allied Progress, who said Mr. Mulvaney would most likely be pulling Ms. Kraninger\u2019s strings. \u201cShe has no record of consumer protection or with holding powerful Wall Street special interests accountable.\u201dThis week the group unveiled an advertising blitz on television in the Washington area criticizing Ms. Kraninger\u2019s record and calling on moderate Democrats to oppose her.A spokesman for Ms. Kraninger said that she was not available for an interview.On Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, released a 14-page \u201cRecord of Failure\u201d report that links Ms. Kraninger\u2019s work at the budget office to Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial zero-tolerance immigration policy, the problems with Puerto Rico\u2019s hurricane recovery and affordable housing woes.The report concludes that Ms. Kraninger has demonstrated \u201cconsistent mismanagement, often with devastating results for poor and vulnerable people.\u201dRaised in Philadelphia and Cleveland, Ms. Kraninger graduated from Marquette University in Wisconsin and then joined the Peace Corps in Ukraine. Upon her return, she sought to follow her interest in national politics and joined the first Bush-Cheney presidential campaign as a junior staff member.From there Ms. Kraninger, who was eager to live in Washington, worked for the Transportation Department, focused on maritime and Coast Guard issues, and then switched to the Department of Homeland Security when it was created after the Sept. 11 attacks. Looking for legislative experience, she also worked as a clerk on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.While the choice of Ms. Kraninger to lead the consumer bureau was surprising to many, the decision to pursue a job that will entail extensive congressional oversight does not appear to be out of character for her.\u201cAny room that I go into, I belong there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just go in and look like you belong.\u201d\u201cAnyone involved in overseeing that disaster is not qualified for a promotion \u2014 especially not to a job this important to working families,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who met privately with Ms. Kraninger last week.Those who have worked with Ms. Kraninger before say she is ready for the challenge despite her lack of direct experience with the work of the consumer bureau. They describe her as a sharp intellect and a fair manager who will try to win over the agency\u2019s staff.\u201cI think you\u2019ll see a lot of grace under pressure,\u201d said Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary who hired Ms. Kraninger at the department. \u201cShe goes in with an open mind and a fresh set of eyes.\u201dStewart Baker, who was responsible for policy analysis at the department and worked closely with Ms. Kraninger, said that he did not think that she would simply parrot Mr. Mulvaney and that she did not wear her ideology on her sleeve.\u201cShe\u2019ll want to be a little more of a manager than a revolutionary,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how committed Kathy is to a government that actually functions.\u201dHe added, \u201cI never knew what her politics were.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Most new presidents shift their political operations to their national party committee until launching their re-election campaign after the first midterm election of their tenure.The largest donation in the second quarter came from Andrew Beal, a Texas-based banker who once squared off against Mr. Trump in a bankruptcy case. He donated $339,000 to Trump Victory.The three Trump committees raised more than $17.7 million from the beginning of April through the end of June, the period covered in Sunday\u2019s reports. That was the second-largest quarterly haul since he took office, though it was a drop of nearly $2.5 million from the preceding quarter.The committees spent more than $8.5 million in the second quarter.The three committees also continued spending on legal fees, including paying firms that are representing the Trump campaign and its associates in investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The committees spent nearly $1.2 million on legal fees in the second quarter, bringing their total legal spending to more than $8.6 million since the beginning of 2017.The biggest portion \u2014 nearly $208,000 \u2014 went to the firm Jones Day, which is representing the Trump campaign in connection with the investigations.But the firm, which has been paid more than $3 million since the beginning of 2017 by Mr. Trump\u2019s committees, also represents the campaign in matters related to election and campaign finance law, and litigation stemming from the campaign. It is not clear what percentage of the legal payments relate to those matters, as opposed to the Russia investigations.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign also spent nearly $148,000 at Trump Organization properties, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, bringing the total spending at such properties to more than $856,000 since the beginning of 2017.Major contributions came from the Los Angeles real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer, who donated $2 million, and the casino executive Cherna Moskowitz, who donated $1 million.A company called Global Energy Producers, which listed an address in Boca Raton, Fla., donated $325,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Theresa May Secures Cabinet Agreement Over Brexit Plan", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After nearly two years of bitter factionalism within her governing Conservative party over what terms Britain should seek in its divorce from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May summoned her cabinet to her country home on Friday and told her ministers either to support her compromise plan or resign, turn in their government cars and find their own way home.Her threats appeared to work, up to a point. At the end of the day she announced that she had won agreement from her team to back a negotiating position in talks with Brussels that would keep Britain effectively tied to many European Union rules. In doing so, she faced down supporters of making a cleaner break from the bloc, and gave her country its clearest view yet of how she wants to steer Britain into a post-Brexit future.It is not clear that the truce among Conservatives will last, especially since Mrs. May\u2019s negotiating stance is unlikely to be accepted by European Union leaders in anything like its current form. But her victory allows her to move into a more serious round of talks with Brussels in an effort to reach a deal by March, when Britain will leave the bloc whether or not is has come to terms on a new relationship.In the end, her hard-line rivals, like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, decided that this was not the day for a showdown. The meeting ended with a declaration that the cabinet had agreed to seek \u201ca common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products.\u201dIn effect, that means Britain would sign up for Europe\u2019s rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without being able to shape them. Services, like banking and finance \u2014 big component of the British economy \u2014 would be dealt with under a separate framework that would give Britain much more flexibility to set its own regulations.Mrs. May\u2019s plan envisions that Britain would no longer abide by the European demand for free movement of people across borders, a key demand of the most vociferous Brexit supporters and a position sure to draw intense opposition from Brussels. But it foresees allowing goods to flow more or less unimpeded across the border between Ireland, a member of the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom \u2014 a position that would go a long way toward solving one of the most intractable problems facing negotiators.The statement said Britain would ensure that \u201cno new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament,\u201d though it acknowledged that failing to incorporate rule changes into British law \u201cwould have consequences\u201d \u2014 presumably ending some access to the bloc\u2019s big market.However, for Mrs. May, pushing her proposals through without the cabinet blowing up was a victory. She appeared to have convinced even the most recalcitrant members that economic necessity dictated hewing closely to some of the European Union\u2019s rules.Mrs. May hopes her plan can provide a basis for negotiations with the bloc\u2019s other 27 member countries, which had grown frustrated over the political paralysis in London.Certainly, Mrs. May\u2019s plan represents a big reality check for proponents of Brexit who once argued that Britain would have the upper hand in withdrawal negotiations, gaining all the benefits of current membership in the single market while still enjoying the freedom to conduct an independent trade policy.That sort of deal was never on offer from Brussels, where officials called it delusional on numerous occasions. A succession of warnings from big manufacturers, including Airbus and BMW, have recently underscored the crucial importance to big importers and exporters of keeping goods flowing easily through ports to and from continental Europe.At the same time, Brexit hard-liners know that adhering to European Union rules would amount to the \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d they have been swearing never to countenance.Even a rash of resignations would not have guaranteed Mrs. May\u2019s departure. If they blocked her new plans, they ran the risk that Parliament might then feel constrained to vote later this month to stay in the European Union\u2019s customs union \u2014 an even more distasteful outcome.Earlier, the cabinet office minister, David Lidington, had confirmed leaks in the British news media that Mrs. May\u2019s proposal would include adherence to a common rule book for some sectors like industrial and agricultural goods in order to keep supply chains open and prevent food spoiling if stopped for frontier checks.\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to,\u201d he told the BBC.One person who will take a lot more persuasion is Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s negotiator, who on Friday said that \u201cin the Brexit negotiations there are still too many questions and too few answers.\u201dThe new plan, scheduled to be published as a white paper next week, will be judged by Mr. Barnier both on practicalities and against the European Union\u2019s red lines.Mrs. May\u2019s preferred customs plan is seen by most officials in Brussels as unworkable. More generally, the European Union has insisted all along that Britain will not gain access to the single market without accepting its core principles like the free movement of people, which Brexiteers abhor.Mrs. May\u2019s plans present other difficulties, for example, by differentiating between manufactured goods \u2014 which would be under Europe\u2019s rule book \u2014 and services, which would have a more distant relationship.Distinguishing between goods and services will become increasingly hard, for example, in the auto market as vehicles, which already sometimes come with loans or insurance deals, become increasingly reliant on digital technology.Other thorny issues include the extent to which British manufacturers would be subject to Europe\u2019s state aid rules (to prevent unfair competition), the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice \u2014 another institution loathed by Brexiteers \u2014 and European labor and environmental laws.Friday\u2019s declaration suggested that Britain would accept European antitrust rules but would want to set up new bodies to resolve trade disputes \u201cfounded on the principle that the court of one party cannot resolve disputes between the two.\u201dBrussels has so far insisted that Britain must either opt to stay in the single market fully \u2014 accepting free movement \u2014 or settle for a much more minimalist free trade deal like that with Canada. Mrs. May has always argued for something in between and has, in recent days, visited both the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to try to ensure that her plans are \u2014 if not exactly welcomed then \u2014 at least not dismissed out of hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan, Flush With Victory, Seizes New Powers in Turkey", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours before taking the oath of office \u2014 after 15 years already in power \u2014 Mr. Erdogan published a 143-page decree changing the way almost every government department and public body in the country operates.In the days since, he has issued several equally lengthy decrees and presidential decisions, centralizing power and giving him the ability to exert control in nearly all areas of life with almost unchecked authority.Among the changes Mr. Erdogan has put in place under the new presidential system are these:\u2022 The prime minister\u2019s office has been abolished;\u2022 The military has been brought under firmer civilian control;\u2022 The president will draft the budget and choose judges and many top officials;\u2022 The president can dismiss Parliament and call new elections at will;\u2022 The president appoints the head of the National Intelligence Agency, the Religious Affairs Directorate and the Central Bank, as well as ambassadors, governors and university rectors, among other top bureaucrats;\u2022 Virtually none of the president\u2019s appointments require a confirmation process.The voluminous decrees, analysts say, promise months of administrative upheaval as agencies are abolished and government employees reassigned.Critics have voiced concern at the lack of checks on the president\u2019s increased powers.Many of the changes, analysts point out, merely formalize what was already the case: It is Mr. Erdogan who makes the decisions. But the consolidation of his power is far-reaching.Mr. Erdogan has also amended the counterterrorism law in expectation of lifting the state of emergency, which expires on Thursday and was put in place two years ago after a failed military coup against him.But Mr. Erdogan and his fellow Islamists have long called for a presidential system and for greater civilian control over the military. Turkey\u2019s recent history has been filled with military coups, and the Islamists chafed more than others under military rule.Mr. Erdogan has placed the chief of staff of the armed forces under control of the Defense Ministry, and the Supreme Military Council, which decides senior appointments in the armed forces, has been reconfigured to include more civilian ministers than military commanders.Mr. Erdogan appointed a loyalist, the former chief of staff, Gen. Hulusi Akar, as his first defense minister under the new system. General Akar opposed the 2016 coup \u2014 he was taken prisoner on the night of the failed coup by rogue officers \u2014 and has overseen a comprehensive purge of the armed forces in the two years since.Mr. Erdogan outlined his own powers in one new decree after his inauguration. He will appoint the chief of staff of the armed forces \u2014 along with the commanders of the land, air and naval forces and the deputy chief of staff \u2014 by presidential decision, which needs no confirmation process. The president will also make promotions in the upper ranks of the security forces from colonel upward.Decree 703, issued just before Mr. Erdogan was sworn in to his new term, also removed many of the regulations in the selection process for appointments.For instance, the president will appoint the rectors of Turkey\u2019s public and private universities, without the usual shortlisting procedure by the university and Higher Education Board.\u201cYes, U.S. President Trump can appoint a replacement to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, but he does not appoint a police chief in Massachusetts or a public theater director in Boston,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas commented in Cumhuriyet. \u201cHe cannot appoint a state governor or even a university rector,\u201d she added.The decree also lowers the qualifications for judges appointed to the government\u2019s administrative courts, which regulate government departments. Previously, judges had to hold law or political science degrees, but they can now be drawn from any degree program, as the Justice Ministry sees fit.A presidential circular published in the Official Gazette over the weekend also placed the Central Bank under the responsibility of the ministry.Mr. Erdogan has emphasized that changes are needed to make state institutions more responsive and efficient. But the latest regulations diminish the legal and practical independence of the Central Bank, Umit Akcay, an associate professor of Economics at the Berlin School of Economics and Law, said in emailed comments.Turkish equities and the country\u2019s currency fell in value in the days after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s appointment of a new cabinet that removed two highly regarded officials \u2014 Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and Finance Minister Naci Agbal \u2014 and that promoted Mr. Albayrak.Mr. Albayrak addressed the changes at the Central Bank last week in an effort to calm the markets.\u201cThe policy in the new period aims to render the Central Bank more effective than ever,\u201d he said at a news briefing last week. The Central Bank\u2019s decisions will be driven by market conditions, he said, promising \u201ca more predictable, simple and determined monetary policy in line with the objectives.\u201dYet Mr. Albayrak\u2019s appointment is part of the concern unsettling investors, the credit ratings service Moody\u2019s said in a statement the same day. \u201cSuch appointments will inevitably raise questions regarding the independence and experience of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.Ms. Aydintasbas warned that centralizing power had never worked in Turkey.\u201cI believe that such concentration of power will tire Turkey out, lock out the state and overload the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m mistaken.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Emergency Food Program Gets More Funding, but Will It Be Enough?", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt $24.7 million, the funding for an emergency food program represents a tiny fraction of New York City\u2019s $89 billion budget.But for many of the more than 500 food pantries and soup kitchens that rely on the anti-hunger program, the money is a lifeline.In recent years, the program has faced financial instability and has needed last-minute infusions of money to fill financing gaps. But this year, the City Council raised the amount set aside for the program beyond what the mayor\u2019s office had originally proposed, which was $8 million. Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council who had made additional funding for the program a priority, called the increase \u201ca really big deal for creating more certainty and security moving forward for the organizations that do this work.\u201dThe program distributes food to the Food Bank for New York City, a nonprofit that supplies food pantries and soup kitchens that are part of the emergency food network. Last year, 40 percent of the food pantries and soup kitchens in the network said they did not have enough food to meet demand, forcing them to turn people away or reduce the amount given out.One of the programs that did not have enough supplies was Reaching-Out Community Services, a food pantry in Brooklyn that serves about 4,000 people every month.Tom Neve, the program\u2019s executive director, said that the guarantee of more funds would help him avoid having to make difficult decisions.\u201cIt was either get more food or reject people from coming to get help,\u201d he said.Nadine Joseph, 66, has been traveling to the pantry in the Bensonhurst neighborhood since she retired a few months ago from her job as a home care worker and has had a hard time making ends meet on her fixed income. On this particular day, her haul back home included milk and rice.\u201cWith the food, I have more money to pay my rent,\u201d she said.In recent years, as the cost of living in New York has risen, particularly for housing, more people are having a difficult time feeding themselves, advocates for the poor said. The meal gap, which measures whether households are missing meals for financial reasons, has gone up steadily for the past several years, according to the Food Bank for New York City.Mr. Neve said the emergency food program was not Reaching-Out\u2019s lone source of food. The pantry also relies on another organization, City Harvest, and food drives run by neighborhood groups, like St. Mary, Mother of Jesus Roman Catholic Church. Still, he says that without the program, he would be unable to keep the pantry open.New Yorkers have become increasingly reliant on the emergency food program, which was originally intended to subsidize an individual or family\u2019s monthly food supply when it was created by the city in 1984. That dependence has been exacerbated by cuts to the federal food stamp program, said Triada Stampas, the vice president of research and public affairs at the Food Bank.In New York City last year, $2.9 billion in food stamps was distributed to 1.6 million people and any reduction in benefits would add to the pressure on the emergency food program to fill the void, Ms. Stampas said. In 2017, the emergency food program provided about 12 percent of all meals distributed by soup kitchens and food pantries.New Yorkers who rely both on food stamps and the food they get from either pantries or soup kitchens said they are alarmed at the prospect of more cuts.Benny Bryant, 50, is a volunteer and a client at Neighbors Together, a soup kitchen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He says his $186 in monthly benefits from food stamps typically lasts him about two weeks, forcing him to eat lunch and dinner at Neighbors Together as often as four days per week. He also collects food from the Bedford-Stuyvesant Campaign Against Hunger.Unable to work after having prostate and colon cancer, Mr. Bryant said losing even some of his food stamp benefits would essentially force his wife and their two children into homelessness.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say the word because I don\u2019t believe in putting things in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, it could look bad.\u201dFor now, Ms. Stampas said the increased funding for the emergency food program will help fill some of the gaps in the food safety net, but still leaves many families in dire situations.\u201cWe live in a resource rich country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have food in the United States. What makes a person food insecure is the fact that they can\u2019t afford it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated what the Emergency Food Assistance Program distributes to the Food Bank for New York City. It provides food, not money. The article misquoted Triada Stampas at the Food Bank for New York City when she cited cuts to the food stamps program several years ago. It was $5 billion in 2013, not $8.7 billion in 2014. The later cut was because of the Farm Bill in 2014.An earlier version of this article also misstated the name of a Brooklyn church. It is St. Mary, Mother of Jesus Roman Catholic Church, not Our Mary Mother of Jesus Church.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beauty Is in the Eye of These Beholders", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "Beautycon is the Super Bowl of the beauty industry, where new products are unveiled and celebrities show up to launch their forays into the lucrative makeup business.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Thousands of cat-eyed, contoured-cheeked, glitter-doused women \u2014 and more than a few painted men \u2014 descended on the 347,000-square-foot South Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center earlier this month, gathering at the makeup mecca that is Beautycon. For two days, as they wandered among more than 200 elaborately festooned booths sponsored by brands like Maybelline and Lime Crime, they searched for samples and stars. Some would be instantly familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of reality TV (i.e., Kim Kardashian West). Others clearly had a more specialized fan base. (Nikita Dragun, anyone? How about Gigi Gorgeous or Manny MUA?)Nearly all of the bathrooms at the Convention Center had been converted to gender-neutral. Staff throughout the floor wore T-shirts with a welcome list on the back that read: \u201cAll races, all genders, all ages, all countries of origin, all sexual orientations, all religions\u201d as well as \u201call glamazons, all natural beauties, all unicorns.\u201d\u201cI came for Drew Barrymore,\u201d interjected Ms. Alden, of Denver, her eyes ringed in pink and orange, the only pop of color standing out against her black suspenders holding up her black mini skirt, a black fedora perched on her head. Ms. Alden, who is in the Air Force, had just taken a selfie with the actress on her way to the booth for Ms. Barrymore\u2019s six-year-old Flower Beauty brand. Ms. Tejan nodded in agreement: \u201cMy grandmother loves Drew Barrymore.\u201dAs she participated in a meet-and-greet with fans, Ms. Barrymore said events like this were a particularly useful way to reach out to beauty shoppers. These consumers demand a personal touch \u2014 often literally, in the form of a hug or selfie. The question, she said, is: \u201cHow are you paying attention to me as a loud, confident individual?\u201dA record 23,300 of those loud, confident individuals attended Beautycon LA, an event that is equal parts competitive shopping scene, feel-good festival and marketing bonanza. Described as Sephora meets Coachella, Beautycon is not unlike a theme park, with hourslong lines, expensive food and the occasional chance to scream. Tickets range from $50 for a single-day pass to $1,000 for two days of skip-the-lines VIP treatment.Beauty brands spend anywhere from $5,000 to more than a million dollars on their Beautycon build-outs. From these temporary havens, companies test and sell product, hand out samples, gather email addresses and host appearances with digital influencers.\u201cConsumers are now discovering and experiencing brands in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago,\u201d said Gustavo Andriani, senior vice president and general manager at MAC North America, a division of Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. An ad in a magazine or a presence on social media is not enough, he added. \u201cWe need to physically be where they are.\u201dBoth brands and attendees come with a #picsoritdidnthappen mentality. Shoppers are after social media bragging rights and companies see those same posts as a chance to spread their marketing dollars beyond the convention center\u2019s walls. Dressed-up corporate photo bait filled the hall, including a dozen pink carpets, complete with flattering lighting and a Beautycon backdrop. Swings at Target, Aveda and Rimmel London and shirtless men almost everywhere \u2014 wielding lipstick-tipped power drills at MAC, covered in metallic body paint at Masque Bar \u2014 were the quick pic gimmicks du jour.\u201cYou don\u2019t need lipstick. Lipstick needs you,\u201d one of Beautycon\u2019s hallmark sayings, was stripped in pink block text across the wall behind a pink sofa in the pink-carpeted enclave of Moj Mahdara, the chief executive officer of Beautycon. Clad in a black T-shirt and Nike Air Max 1/97 sneakers, Ms. Mahdara slipped into this relatively quiet space backstage, her 4-month-old son, Neev, leaning against her shoulder.A 40-year-old, gay Persian-American, Ms. Mahdara was born in Lexington, Ky., and grew up in Erie, Pa. She moved to Orange County, Calif., in 1998, then to Los Angeles two years later in search of a way into the music industry. Instead, she found a more viable path as a digital strategist, helping consumer and entertainment brands develop online campaigns with celebrities like Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani. She built and sold a digital agency, and worked with a number of large, consumer-facing brands, including HTC and Lacoste.After briefly toying with the idea of getting an M.B.A., Ms. Mahdara decided instead to take that money and invest it in direct-to-consumer brands like Outdoor Voices and Harry\u2019s razors. In 2013, as she was growing her new digital consulting agency, Ms. Mahdara\u2019s lawyer told her about an upcoming gathering of beauty YouTubers, a group of digital personalities gathering in Los Angeles (IRL, as the kids would say). Although she says, \u201cI\u2019m not a beauty person\u201d \u2014 she does not wear makeup \u2014 Ms. Mahdara was then looking to start her own digital influencer management company, on the hunt for what she said was \u201cthe next gen of QVC.\u201dMs. Mahdara envisioned a new experiential retail model. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff for music and a lot of stuff for gaming and a lot of stuff for sports,\u201d Ms. Mahdara said. \u201cWhat became abundantly clear to me is that there was nothing for young women and people in general who were interested in beauty but not sure how they fit into that world.\u201d Her goal was not just an offline experience but a marketplace, one that would translate into sales for participating beauty companies.\u201cMoj and her team recognize that beauty is about more than just slick advertising,\u201d Debra Perelman, the chief executive officer of Revlon, said in an email. They \u201crealized early that in the digital age you can\u2019t just talk to women, but instead need to build a deep, personal relationship with them.\u201dBeautycon is a festival, yes, but it\u2019s also a data-gathering machine. Two hundred beacons sprinkled throughout the floor in Los Angeles allowed organizers to heat-map the crowds, showing where the largest groups of attendees were congregating. Beautycon held eight focus groups each day that weekend, talking to 320 consumers about their shopping habits and attitudes on health and wellness. Each wristband was equipped with radio-frequency identification (R.F.I.D.) technology, allowing the organizers to monitor the path people took, how long they lingered, and if they visited a booth multiple times.Coupled with registration information, Beautycon can paint a detailed picture of these shoppers. \u201cWe know what she wants, we know what she\u2019s missing, we know what she needs,\u201d said Richelieu Dennis, the chief executive of Sundial Brands, owner of Essence magazine and a Beautycon investor.Beautycon\u2019s connection to customers, paired with the combination of content and commerce, has helped Ms. Mahdara raise $20 million from investors. The most recent round of financing raised $6 million, led by the New Voices Fund, a $100 million fund that invests in businesses owned or managed by women of color and run by Mr. Dennis. \u201cThis is the future of beauty \u2014 this is the future of business,\u201d he said of Beautycon.In Los Angeles, about 60 percent of brands offered attendees a chance to shop on site, either at full price or a discount. Companies at Beautycon also keep close tabs on the e-commerce lift afterward, using special discount codes and tracking conversion rates from follow-up emails. The festival\u2019s implied revenue per square foot, meaning both the dollars spent on site and the resulting online sales, was $4,288 last year, Ms. Mahdara said. (Apple, for comparison, saw sales per square foot upwards of $5,100 last year in its average store, according to eMarketer.) At this point, Beautycon does not take a cut of on-site sales, but organizers say they may revisit that option in the future.Beautycon is expanding, both in the brands it attracts (B-Well, its push toward health and wellness, drew the likes of Kind snacks, Quip toothbrushes and West Elm furniture) and its locations (international dates and cities, beyond London, are in the works). Ms. Mahdara was tight-lipped on a new \u201cexperiential commerce\u201d concept coming this fall, which she said was a \u201creally exciting new format both digitally and experientially.\u201dThe secrecy is tied, in no small part, to the new competition Beautycon now faces. Beauty retail behemoth Sephora, owned by LVMH, is starting its own festival in downtown Los Angeles this fall, dubbed Sephoria. Tickets range from $99 to $449; each level includes a bag of giveaways (Beautycon attendees needed to spend $199 for the \u201cHauler\u201d package to receive such a thing). The overlap in participating brands is minimal. Sephora appears to be using its considerable clout in the industry to attract some of the most popular prestige names, ones that were not at Beautycon in Los Angeles, such as Pat McGrath Labs and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna (Fenty is produced by Kendo, another division of LVMH).A Sephora spokeswoman described its relationship with Beautycon as \u201ccomplementary\u201d and said \u201cthe concept for Sephoria was developed internally long before we shared anything with potential partners.\u201d Beautycon was part of the proposal process, she added, but Sephora \u201cdecided to go with a different partner.\u201dInstead of singing for their supper, Beautycon-goers selfie for their samples. At the recent gathering, staffers in the CoverGirl booth scanned phone after phone to make sure attendees who waited in line to take a photo in front of its branded backdrop (with its new slogan, \u201cI am what I makeup,\u201d in neon lights) also followed the brand on Instagram before they would hand over a full-size mascara sample.The exchange was surprising to watch, if only for how normal it appeared to be for both sides. This younger generation of shoppers knows that in order to get something, you have to give something.An email address is typically the bare minimum. Amorepacific, a South Korean beauty conglomerate of 28 brands, wove attendees through a multistationed testing tour, with a representative explaining the benefits of products at each brand stop. At the end, shoppers received a tote bag with five single-use samples. Those who shared their emails were given an additional travel-size sample.The goal of the booth, which cost \u201cmultiple hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d according to Jessica Hanson, president of Amorepacific US, was to introduce its family of brands to more shoppers. To that end, perhaps more popular than the samples were the headbands Amorepacific gave away: white, flashing branded crowns, which attendees then wore, voluntarily and enthusiastically, throughout the convention hall as a kind of walking advertisement for the company.On its maiden Beautycon voyage, Aveda, a division of Est\u00e9e Lauder, lured attendees to its booth with a towering paper cherry tree next to a swing for photographs. The prop was a popular gathering spot over the weekend, providing ample backdrop for a logo and solving the eternal what-do-I-do-with-my-hands posing question.As people waited in line, Aveda staffers chatted with them about the Cherry Almond collection, which the company introduced the week of Beautycon, handing out scent sticks and samples. The collection was designed to appeal to women with long hair \u2014 73 percent of Millennials have hair that is shoulder length or longer, the brand says \u2014 with promises of \u201ctouchably soft\u201d tresses. It comes in bright-pink packaging and has a sweet scent.Aveda also handed out coupons for 15 percent off a shopper\u2019s first online order if placed by the end of the month and offered 20 percent off all purchases on site, a rarity for the brand. \u201cWe don\u2019t discount very often at all,\u201d said Cydney Strommen, director of marketing communications for Aveda-North America. Unlike the fashion world, which has been plagued by pricing pressure and rampant discounting, beauty brands very rarely go on sale.Nearly three-quarters of Beautycon\u2019s target audience \u2014 Gen Z-ers and younger millennials that Ms. Mahdara calls \u201cpivotals\u201d \u2014 say they are influenced more by \u201ccontent creators\u201d than traditional celebrities, according to Beautycon\u2019s research. Many of the digital stars that were the original draw have catapulted into massive, and massively profitable, operations, some boasting major sponsorship packages with five-figure appearance deals.\u201cFor regular people, you are like, \u2018Who are these people?\u2019\u201d said Ukonwa Ojo, chief marketing officer for consumer beauty at Coty, which had booths for CoverGirl, Rimmel London and Sally Hansen at Beautycon in New York and Los Angeles this year. But beauty junkies \u201cknow them and they love them,\u201d she said.Coty sees Beautycon as a rare chance for consumers to experiment with its products. The three showcased at Beautycon are primarily sold in drugstores and big box chains without a testing option. \u201cFor a lot of people it\u2019s the first time they have ever been to a place where they could try all of our products before,\u201d Ms. Ojo said.These beauty-obsessed consumers are particularly valuable resources for companies, she added, as they are more open to fashion-forward looks and willing to experiment with new products that have yet to go to a wide market.In Los Angeles, Rimmel London introduced 14 new shades of its Stay Matte Liquid Lip Colour, as well as the Wonder\u2019Fully Real Mascara. \u201cIf they love it, you\u2019ve won an advocate,\u201d Ms. Ojo said. And winning an advocate, she added, means that that shopper will share it with his or her followers, who may then want to try it themselves. Every one, after all, is an influencer.From his perch in a hall conference room, one floor up and overlooking the mazelike scene below, Beautycon\u2019s executive vice president, Tripp Mahan, smiled. He considers himself the event\u2019s \u201cconductor,\u201d with the stated goal of \u201ccurated chaos.\u201d\u201cIt has to be a very amped-up atmosphere,\u201d he said.How does one turn a light-filled, cement-floored, 347,000-square-foot hall into a party before noon? With a thumping DJ booth at the entrance and a series of choreographed mobs. Instead of escorting the talent to the booths quickly and discreetly in a golf cart, Mr. Mahan prefers to parade them through the show floor with security detail. The resulting swarm leads to what Beautycon calls \u201cfandomonium.\u201d Ms. Kardashian West was a notable exception; the Beautycon team went to great lengths to remove people from the backstage area where she entered.\u201cIf Meryl Streep walked up to you and me, we would just act cool and move on,\u201d Mr. Mahan said. But the fan-influencer relationship is much more intimate and intense. \u201cStars are just obligated to do a selfie,\u201d Mr. Mahan said.Michael David Magaraci, a 20-year-old from Long Island who trekked to Beautycon by himself, walked into the hall and straight to the main stage, where he snagged a seat in the front row and waited for hours to see Mrs. Kardashian West, who was promoting her KKW Beauty line.\u201cGrowing up, I was always taught, \u2018You don\u2019t wear makeup, you\u2019re a boy,\u2019\u201d he said. He was wearing no fewer than six of Mrs. Kardashian West\u2019s products on his face, including lip gloss and concealer, his thick brows groomed and filled in, and KKW\u2019s blue eye shadow artfully swiped across his lids. \u201cBeautycon is celebrating diversity, and through that diversity comes confidence,\u201d he added. \u201cI feel so amazing here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Theresa May in Fight to Save Government Amid Brexit Rift", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was battling to save her government on Monday after her foreign secretary quit in protest over her approach to withdrawing from the European Union. The resignation deepened a mood of crisis just eight months before the country is due to leave the bloc.The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was the second minister to leave Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet within 24 hours. He stepped down after she pushed ahead with a proposal that would keep Britain more closely tied to the European Union than hard-line conservatives want.\u201cWe are truly headed for the status of colony,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in his resignation letter.It has been two years since Britons voted to leave the European Union in a referendum that rattled governments on the Continent and beyond. But actually severing the intricate economic ties that bind Britain to the rest of Europe has proved far more complicated than merely casting a ballot at the polls.Many Britons remain opposed to leaving the bloc, and even among those who favor it, there are deep divisions. Some, like Mr. Johnson, advocate a clean break \u2014 or, at least, taking that stance in withdrawal negotiations with the European Union. Others, like Mrs. May, support maintaining at least some ties, including abiding by some European regulations.That drew a sharp rebuke from Mr. Johnson, who said, \u201cThis is our opening bid.\u201d It is as though, he said, \u201cwe are sending our vanguard into battle with a white flag fluttering above them.\u201dJust last week, Mrs. May appeared to have won the full cabinet\u2019s agreement on keeping Britain\u2019s economy closely anchored to the European Union. The resignations reopened speculation about a challenge to her leadership, something that Mrs. May\u2019s spokesman said she would fight.With the hard-line supporters of withdrawal, known as Brexit, in the party in full revolt, Conservative insiders predicted further resignations unless Mrs. May dropped her plan.On Monday night, Mr. Johnson was replaced as foreign secretary by Jeremy Hunt, who moved from the health department to take up the job. Although Mr. Hunt argued against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, he has since argued in favor of withdrawal and is likely to support Mrs. May\u2019s position on Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.The turmoil comes days before a scheduled visit by President Trump, a champion of the kind of sharp break with the European Union that Mrs. May and others on her side of the issue believe would seriously harm the British economy.Mr. Johnson, the public face of the 2016 campaign that persuaded Britons to quit the European Union, is perhaps the most high-profile advocate of Brexit, and his departure underscores the depth of the divisions within Mrs. May\u2019s government. His resignation followed that of David Davis, the Brexit secretary, who quit late Sunday night.After Mr. Davis\u2019s surprise resignation, there was an ominous silence from Mr. Johnson on Monday morning, although he was supposed to host a meeting in London of foreign ministers to discuss the western Balkans.Then, around 3 p.m., Mrs. May\u2019s office issued a statement that said simply: \u201cThis afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. His replacement will be announced shortly. The Prime Minister thanks Boris for his work.\u201dOn several occasions Mr. Johnson had undermined Mrs. May\u2019s strategy for withdrawing from the European Union. He described one government Brexit customs plan as \u201ccrazy\u201d and, in leaked comments, accused her government of lacking \u201cguts.\u201d He compared her negotiating style unfavorably with that of Mr. Trump, and he compared her latest Brexit plan to excrement.In his remarks, Mr. Johnson echoed others in the hard-line Brexit camp \u2014 notably Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2014 who have complained that under Mrs. May\u2019s plan Britain would become a \u201cvassal state\u201d of the European Union, a \u201crule taker, not a rule maker.\u201dOn Monday, loyalist Conservative lawmakers appealed to their colleagues not to demand a confidence vote in Mrs. May\u2019s leadership.That would require the support of just 48 of her party\u2019s lawmakers \u2014 but it would take many more to dislodge her were Mrs. May to try to stay on, as her office said she would. In those circumstances, Mrs. May could keep her job if she won the support of a simple majority of the Conservative Party\u2019s 316 lawmakers.Another major drawback of a leadership contest is that it could take as long as three months, something the government can ill afford. It needs to seal a withdrawal agreement with the European Union in October.Mr. Johnson has made little secret of his ambitions to take the keys of 10 Downing Street, and his detractors say he would not hesitate to put his interests first. It remains unclear whether he commands the necessary support.There is little chance that the opposition Labour Party could force a general election. That would require some Conservative votes, and Tory lawmakers have little interest in that, given the very real possibility that they could lose.However, if the Conservatives were to change their leader, and therefore the prime minister, there would be political pressure to call a general election.Mr. Davis told the BBC he was not encouraging a challenge to Mrs. May. But Mr. Johnson\u2019s resignation reignited the debate just as Mrs. May was hoping that she had restored some stability to the government by announcing that Mr. Davis would be replaced by the pro-Brexit minister Dominic Raab.European officials will have noticed that, although it took Mrs. May almost two years to produce a detailed plan for Brexit, the truce in her party lasted only two days. That raises more questions about the government\u2019s ability to negotiate an orderly withdrawal.On Monday, Mr. Davis outlined his objections to Mrs. May\u2019s plan for withdrawal, which was announced on Friday evening and is to be published later this week in a white paper.In effect, Mrs. May\u2019s proposal means that Britain would sign up for Europe\u2019s rules for manufactured goods, food and other farm produce without being able to shape them. Services like banking and finance \u2014 a big component of the British economy \u2014 would be dealt with separately and would not have as much access as at present to the continental European market.No changes to economic rules in the future would take place \u201cwithout the approval of our Parliament,\u201d Mrs. May insisted, rebutting the argument that Britain would simply become \u201ca rule taker.\u201dBut on Monday, Mr. Davis argued that Parliament\u2019s power would be \u201cillusory rather than real\u201d because, if it rejected future changes, the consequences would be too great. Not only could Britain lose access to continental markets, it would also face the prospect of the deployment of a contingency plan \u2014 yet to be finalized \u2014 devised to ensure that frontier controls are not erected on the Irish border.Mr. Davis also foresaw that Mrs. May\u2019s plans are hardly final. He said they would simply be the basis for negotiation with a skeptical European Union that is certain to demand further concessions \u2014 perhaps very substantial ones \u2014 including on the freedom of movement of workers. That is something the British government has pledged to end.At that point Mrs. May could be forced to choose between a Brexit agreement unacceptable to even more of her lawmakers and no deal at all, which would be a disaster for many businesses.If that happens, Mrs. May will face a final reckoning with her fractious party in the fall \u2014 assuming she survives in her job until then.Michael Wolgelenter and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Threatens Tariffs on $200 Billion of Chinese Goods, From Tilapia to Handbags", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration escalated its trade dispute with China on Tuesday, saying it would impose tariffs on roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese fish, petroleum, chemicals, handbags, textiles and other products if Beijing does not change its trade practices.The threat comes just days after President Trump imposed levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, including robotics, airplane parts and ball bearings. Mr. Trump has said he is prepared to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese products.On Tuesday, his administration detailed the next list of products that would face Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath unless Beijing folds to Washington\u2019s demands. The White House is pushing China to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, halt intellectual property theft and open its markets to American companies.Neither side appears eager to blink first. China has responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s initial tariffs with its own equal amount of levies on American goods like pork, steel, cars and fiber optic cable and has said that it is prepared to continue retaliating.The Chinese government said it would take unspecified countermeasures against new tariffs and renewed its threat to take its complaints to the World Trade Organization, which handles trade disputes.\u201cThe American side\u2019s behavior harms China, harms the world and also harms itself,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.With no official discussions scheduled to settle the trade dispute, it is unclear how or when the differences get resolved. A senior White House official said on Tuesday evening that the administration welcomed China\u2019s engagement and had been \u201cextremely clear\u201d with China about its concerns over its trade practices, but that China had been \u201cnonresponsive.\u201d The official said that the process of imposing tariffs on the new list of goods would take roughly two months, with a public hearing on the tariffs scheduled for Aug. 20 through Aug 23.The trade war has already started to raise costs for businesses that depend on international supply chains, from manufacturers to retailers, and consumers that purchase their products. The Trump administration said it intended its first wave of tariffs to target industrial products that the Chinese government subsidizes and to minimize the impact to American households.But as the list of taxed products grows, the number of consumers and businesses that will feel the pinch also increases.\u201cIt gets harder for them to keep it from the shelves of Walmart and Target and Best Buy,\u201d said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cIt also gets harder for them to continue to hide behind this rationale of hitting China for forced technology transfer.\u201dThe administration\u2019s approach has prompted criticism from lawmakers, particularly those from farm states, who say Mr. Trump is approaching a serious issue in an undisciplined way that could backfire.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that he supported the administration\u2019s effort to crack down on Chinese practices, but the decision to use tariffs was not the proper response.\u201cTonight\u2019s announcement appears reckless and is not a targeted approach,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cWe cannot turn a blind eye to China\u2019s mercantilist trade practices, but this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China while maintaining the long-term health and prosperity of the American economy.\u201dThe White House administration disagrees. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the announcement was \u201can appropriate response.\u201d\u201cRather than address our legitimate concerns, China has begun to retaliate against U.S. products,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no justification for such action.\u201dFor now, the limited tariffs combined with a booming economy seem to be having little impact beyond targeted industries.Goldman Sachs economists estimated this week that the initial tariffs on Chinese goods would reduce the size of the United States economy by a minimal amount, and said they did not expect the White House to follow through on Mr. Trump\u2019s latest threatened tariffs.Goldman economists said in a report earlier this month that, if the broader range of tariffs were actually enacted, it would be more damaging because they would hit Americans more quickly in the wallet than the initial round of tariffs.Economists have also cautioned that the potential damage to the economy could grow if the trade conflict grows. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University, said that it was difficult to see a path to cooling off tensions, especially with the highly charged midterm elections approaching in the United States.\u201cWith China in attack mode as well, additional tariffs risk escalating the trade war to a level from which it is becoming increasingly difficult to envision an exit path,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Looks to Crack Down on Airbnb Amid Housing Crisis", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday to significantly restrict Airbnb and other online home rental services, joining a growing movement of cities around the globe in stepping up regulation of the so-called sharing economy.The bill aims to prevent landlords and tenants from illegally renting out apartments for a few days at a time to tourists, a phenomenon that the city says has aggravated the housing crisis by making short-term rentals more profitable than long-term leases.Online rental services like Airbnb and HomeAway would be required to provide the addresses and names of hosts to the city\u2019s Office of Special Enforcement every month, and to note whether rentals are for a whole apartment or just a room.\u201cThe vacancy rate in New York City is very low,\u201d the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said before the vote. \u201cWe\u2019re in an affordable housing crisis. We\u2019re in a homelessness crisis. And Airbnb will not give us this data.\u201dA City Hall spokeswoman said the new restrictions had the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has made affordable housing one of his priorities, and he is expected to sign the bill into law.Companies will face fines of up to $1,500 for each listing they fail to disclose, down from the $25,000 originally proposed.\u201cAfter taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the hotel industry, we\u2019re not surprised the City Council refused to meet with their own constituents who rely on home sharing to pay the bills and then voted to protect the profits of big hotels,\u201d Liz DeBold Fusco, a spokeswoman for Airbnb, said in a statement, adding that the bill would violate the privacy of the sites\u2019 users and subject them to \u201cunchecked, aggressive harassment.\u201dThe question of what would be best for \u201cordinary New Yorkers\u201d was at the heart of the debate.City officials said the bill focused primarily on large-scale commercial landlords who were gaming the system.\u201cYes, sometimes it\u2019s the common New Yorker,\u201d said Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who introduced the bill. \u201cBut many times, especially in my district, these are landlords who are taking rent-regulated units out of the housing stock because they\u2019d rather get a lot more money per night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler Loses Sergio Marchionne With Bumpy Road Ahead", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFiat Chrysler Automobiles was facing an uncertain future even before the man who led its unlikely turnaround became gravely ill.Now, the hard decisions fall to the new chief executive, Mike Manley, who has been running the arm of the company that is easily its best reason for optimism.The Italian-American automaker has reported steady earnings, driven by the Jeep and Ram brands that have been run by Mr. Manley. But the Fiat, Dodge and Chrysler nameplates contribute little to its bottom line.The company lags its rivals in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, and gets three-quarters of its profits from North America, where the entire industry is experiencing a slowdown.Competitors like General Motors and Ford Motor have sped ahead with development of electric vehicles and self-driving technology, while Fiat Chrysler has been slow to do the same. It does not operate its own financing company, a competitive advantage for its rivals who are able to offer attractive discounted loans and leases.And the possibility that President Trump could push for tariffs on imports of cars and auto parts has sent uncertainty rippling through the entire industry.\u201cSergio has done an incredible job revitalizing the company since Chrysler\u2019s bankruptcy in 2009,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm. \u201cBut there\u2019s more work to be done. There\u2019s still a lot that needs to be addressed.\u201dNow Fiat Chrysler, which has seen its stock lose around a fifth of its value since January, must do it without Mr. Marchionne, 66, who has led the company for 14 years. The company declined to comment on Mr. Marchionne\u2019s condition, but the decision to replace him on a Saturday, effective immediately, was a clear sign that his prognosis was poor.The carmaker\u2019s shares fell more than 5 percent at one point in morning trading in Europe on Monday before recovering some of those losses.Fiat Chrysler will provide a fresh glimpse of its finances on Wednesday when it reports its second-quarter results. Wall Street analysts expect a rise in earnings, driven almost exclusively by robust Jeep and Ram truck sales. A year ago, it reported second-quarter net income of 1.2 billion euros on revenue of \u20ac27.9 billion.The company\u2019s profitability is perhaps the central issue that Mr. Manley will have to tackle. Profit amounted to about 6 percent of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s revenue last year, well short of the 11 percent achieved by General Motors. In June, Mr. Marchionne and his executive team laid out a business plan that calls for spending 45 billion euros to develop more than two-dozen new vehicles, including electric models, all while slashing costs by \u20ac9 billion \u2014 a tough balancing act for an automaker. The goal is to more than double its profit margin by 2022.American dealers expressed confidence in Mr. Manley. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with his selection,\u201d said Wes Lutz, owner of a Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise in Jackson, Mich., and chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about product. He\u2019s worked on the retail side, so he understands dealers. Any time you have a C.E.O. who understands dealers, you usually have good market share, so I\u2019m excited about Mike Manley.\u201dMr. Manley, who was not available for an interview, has the unenviable task of replacing Mr. Marchionne, a larger-than-life executive who quoted both philosophers and pop music lyrics with ease and pushed his workers to match his boundless energy.Ms. Lindland said that Mr. Manley \u201cis a different kind of character.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s quieter,\u201d Ms. Lindland said. \u201cNobody has the force of personality that Sergio had, but Mike can motivate people. He\u2019s been doing that at Jeep.\u201dMr. Manley took over Jeep in 2011 and has nearly tripled its global sales. The company expects to sell 1.9 million Jeeps this year, and its models are now produced in 10 plants in six countries. When Mr. Manley took over, Jeeps were only made in four plants, all in the United States.\u201cMike has been one of the major contributors to F.C.A.\u2019s success and he has a remarkable track record of accomplishments,\u201d John Elkann, the great-great grandson of Fiat\u2019s founder, Giovanni Agnelli, said in an email to Fiat Chrysler employees.Mr. Manley will have to rely heavily on the sport-utility vehicle line going forward. Consumers in the United States, China and elsewhere are increasingly opting for roomier models like S.U.V.s, and pricier Jeeps like the Grand Cherokee generate hefty profits. With its heritage dating back to the rugged military vehicles used in World War II, Jeep also has a global appeal that other Fiat Chrysler brands lack. Under the company\u2019s five-year business plan, Jeep is scheduled to introduce a midsize pickup truck next year as well as 14 new hybrid or battery-powered models. In China, Jeep would offer four fully electric models.Mr. Manley \u201chas to grow Jeep in China,\u201d said Tom LaSorda, a former Chrysler chief executive. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201dIn the United States market, the new models can\u2019t come soon enough, especially the seven-passenger Jeep Grand Wagoneer that\u2019s scheduled to arrive in 2020. \u201cWe needed that vehicle yesterday,\u201d said Mr. Lutz, the dealership owner. In the first six months of this year, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s United States sales rose 5 percent, due exclusively to higher Jeep sales.Fiat Chrysler also plans to spend heavily to develop new models for its Ram, Alfa Romeo and Maserati lines, all of which are solidly profitable. But the future for the company\u2019s other brands is uncertain.Chrysler only offers two models and has little presence outside America. Dodge has been reduced mainly to selling big, powerful sports cars, a segment whose sales are declining. Fiat Chrysler also spent billions of dollars to introduce Fiat small cars to American buyers, but so far this year it has only sold about 8,000 Fiats in the United States. The company sells that many Ram trucks in one day.In light of the shift in the market, Mr. Manley will probably eventually have to address the question of whether to kill Dodge or Chrysler, and whether to continue to sell Fiats in the United States, Ms. Lindland said.But the Chrysler brand could have a future in autonomous vehicles, even though Fiat Chrysler has done little to develop its own self-driving cars.Mr. Marchionne long expressed doubt about investing in technology whose future is unknown, but Fiat Chrysler has partnered with Waymo, the self-driving car company that was spun out of Google. It is supposed to produce up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans that Waymo will equip and use for a driverless ride service it is starting.\u201cThey need to make sure they don\u2019t fall too far behind on autonomy, and Waymo may be the way they do that,\u201d Ms. Lindland said.An earlier version of this article misidentified Fiat\u2019s founder and also misstated John Elkann\u2019s relationship to him. Fiat was founded by Giovanni Agnelli, not by Gianni Agnelli, and Mr. Elkann is Giovanni Agnelli\u2019s great-great-grandson, not his grandson. An earlier version of a picture caption with the article misstated the given name of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s new chief executive. He is Mike Manley, not Mark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says He\u2019s a Free-Trader at Heart. He Isn\u2019t Acting Like It.", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBut let\u2019s take his statement at face value.\u201cIf Trump is serious about zero tariffs, then let\u2019s make it part of the agenda,\u201d said Edwin J. Feulner, founder and former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cI\u2019d be all for it.\u201dMr. Trump is correct that economists at Wharton, and at just about every other reputable business school, teach the virtues of free trade. It is one of the few propositions that unites economists across the political spectrum. (Its opponents are also odd allies: the populist, nationalist right and the anti-free-market left.)\u201cIf President Trump would seriously say we want a comprehensive agreement reducing trade barriers among the G-7, there would be a lot of support for that,\u201d said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow and specialist in international trade at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.While free trade can cause short-term disruption to specific industries, in the longer term it redeploys capital and labor to their most productive uses, which benefits consumers, workers and investors.Economists are nearly unanimous that trade between nations isn\u2019t a \u201cwar\u201d in the sense that one country wins and another loses. \u201cEvery president since F.D.R. has acknowledged that free trade is a win-win,\u201d said Daniel J. Ikenson, director of the center for trade policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cBut President Trump sees it as a zero-sum game with the trade deficit the scorecard. That\u2019s an absurd approach.\u201dEven if it is seen as a zero-sum game, the United States would come out substantially ahead in a zero-tariff world. That is because, on average, its tariffs are lower than those of its major trading partners \u2014 so it would be a net winner if all tariffs vanished.Still, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t acknowledged that many United States industries \u2014 not just foreign ones \u2014 benefit from tariffs. Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers still sell so many trucks in the United States, and at such high profit margins, in large part thanks to an existing 25 percent tariff on imports.The United States also has relatively high tariffs on imported food, clothing and building materials, and it maintains large agricultural subsidies. Eliminating those barriers would benefit American consumers, but at the expense of those favored industries. \u201cIt\u2019s basically the most regressive tax imaginable,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said of the American tariffs. \u201cThey hit food, clothing and shelter.\u201dLarry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and a longtime free-trade advocate, has said Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to lower trade barriers is real. The tariff threats, according to Mr. Kudlow, are just a means to that end, a \u201cwake-up\u201d call to America\u2019s trading partners who have long gamed the system to their advantage.If so, that approach has yet to show any results, while drawing fire from economists of all political stripes. \u201cUsing tariffs as a bargaining chip makes no sense,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said. \u201cThey\u2019re just a tax on the consumer. They invite retaliation.\u201dThat Mr. Trump is simultaneously threatening all of our major trading partners is also puzzling. \u201cI was always taught that if you spread yourself over a dozen fronts, you end up losing on all of them,\u201d Mr. Feulner said. \u201cWhy not go after China first, and then turn to whoever you think is the next troublemaker? We\u2019ve caused them all to band together.\u201dMr. Meltzer agreed. \u201cWhy wage war on everyone at once? It shows a complete lack of strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration didn\u2019t have the faintest notion of how other countries would react and wasn\u2019t prepared for it. Trump thought the U.S. was big enough that it could bully people. That has proved manifestly wrong.\u201dIf anything, foreign leaders like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel have gained political stature by standing up to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats.Many free trade supporters have argued that the United States should take the opposite approach and unilaterally lower its own barriers to lead by example. \u201cIf we did it, others would follow suit,\u201d Mr. Ikenson said.There\u2019s been talk in Britain about such an approach after Brexit. Other economies, notably Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Hong Kong and Singapore, have done so with great success. \u201cI\u2019d love to see us do it unilaterally,\u201d said Mr. Feulner, while acknowledging that Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric makes the prospect highly unlikely.Short of that, Mr. Trump could negotiate some bilateral free trade agreements as an incentive to other countries, a carrot in addition to the stick of tariffs. Mr. Feulner said both Switzerland and Taiwan have expressed willingness to reach such agreements, which Mr. Trump could simultaneously hail as victories in the trade war and point to as examples for the European Union and China.For now, \u201cit feels like we\u2019re a million miles from negotiating a productive trade deal with any country, let alone the G-7,\u201d Mr. Meltzer said. \u201cNo country ever launches a trade negotiation if there\u2019s a good chance of failure. It takes enormous amounts of preparatory work, as well as good will and a sense of trust in each other. Trump has none of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Opens Inquiry Into Uranium Imports in Sign That Trade War Is Spreading", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it was starting an investigation into uranium imports, potentially opening another front in an expansive trade war that has shaken alliances with countries around the world.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the department would investigate whether imported uranium ore and related products \u2014 key ingredients in America\u2019s nuclear arsenal, and used in power production and nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers \u2014 threatened national security.Uranium produced domestically now fills only 5 percent of America\u2019s needs, Mr. Ross said, down from half in 1987.The uranium inquiry is the latest of several trade-related steps the Trump administration has taken with an eye toward imposing stiff tariffs on imports. Levies have already been placed on washing machines, solar-power products, steel and aluminum from overseas, and on an array of Chinese goods. The administration is also considering whether to impose tariffs on imported cars and car parts.The investigation announced on Wednesday was requested by two American uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels. The firms say low-priced imports, especially those from competitors supported by foreign government subsidies, had caused them to slash jobs in recent years. Nuclear power producers have responded by warning that sharp restrictions on uranium imports could lead to the closing of plants.The uranium imported into the United States now comes mostly from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia.\u201cIf we did not take this action, this industry would become extinct,\u201d said Jeffrey T. Klenda, the chief executive of Ur-Energy. \u201cAnd if we allow it to die, resurrecting it will be monumentally expensive. We cannot leave the fuel cycle in the hands of Vladimir Putin and his confederates, and increasingly the Chinese.\u201dMr. Klenda said that uranium producers in the United States, as well those in allied countries like Canada and Australia, were suffering, while state-subsidized companies in Kazakhstan have rapidly gained global market share.Shares of Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels both rose on Wednesday.But the nuclear power industry has warned that an aggressive attempt to restrict access to imported uranium could increase the cost of operating America\u2019s nuclear power plants, many of which already struggle to compete with lower-priced natural gas and renewable energy.\u201cMaintaining all the elements of the domestic uranium fuel supply is in our national interest, and we urge the federal government to take appropriate action, without harming the fleet of nuclear reactors,\u201d Maria G. Korsnick, head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.The companies that requested the trade case asked that the Commerce Department limit imports so that 25 percent of the uranium used in the United States would be produced domestically. The companies argue that doing so would pose minimal burdens on nuclear power plants.\u201cWe sympathize with the plight of uranium suppliers,\u201d Ms. Korsnick said on Wednesday. \u201cHowever, N.E.I. does not support the implementation of quotas as described in the petition. Potential remedies could put even more generating units at risk for premature closure.\u201dIt is unclear what the Trump administration will ultimately propose with regard to imported uranium. If it determines that unfair trade practices are hurting domestic mining companies, the Commerce Department can recommend a broad range of remedies, from strict quotas to temporary tariffs. Such a decision would be expected to play out over several months, as the department continues its investigation and holds public hearings.The investigation into uranium imports \u2014 as with those involving steel, aluminum cars and car parts \u2014 is being conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a legal provision that gives the president broad power to impose tariffs on imports that he determines pose a threat to national security.The use of a national security-related law to place tariffs on close military allies like Canada and the European Union has been a source of contention. Multiple countries have retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods and have challenged the Trump administration\u2019s measures at the World Trade Organization.In particular, trade experts say that the administration\u2019s imposition of tariffs for national security reasons \u2014 a matter the World Trade Organization does not closely regulate \u2014 opens a potential loophole that other countries could use to put their own levies on a range of products.\u201cIf the U.S. has rewritten the rules of the W.T.O. system to say you can do anything you want if it\u2019s in your national security interests, be prepared for every country in the world to come up with a new definition of what is its critical national security interest,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters in the United States.Congress has considered taking action to stay the administration\u2019s use of the national security provision to impose tariffs. Republican leaders have shown limited support for such a move so far, but that could change as the administration\u2019s trade measures become more far-reaching.\u201cIf the administration continues forward with its misguided and reckless reliance on tariffs, I will work to advance trade legislation to curtail presidential trade authority,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Tuesday. \u201cI am discussing legislative options with colleagues both on and off the Finance Committee, and I will continue to do so.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How It Got Riskier to Own High-Quality Corporate Bonds", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBonds issued by United States companies with strong balance sheets have been delivering the weakest returns of all major American bond categories this year, adding to the headaches of fixed-income investors.There have been plenty of problems affecting all bonds. Rising interest rates pushed yields higher and bond prices lower.So far, higher yields have not offset the declines in bond prices. (Total return in a bond fund is the combination of a portfolio\u2019s yield and the changes to the price of its bonds.)Even junk funds, which invest in bonds issued by companies on shakier financial footing, managed to lose less than 0.2 percent on average in the first half of the year.\u201cThe way we are framing this for clients right now is that if you are investing in investment-grade corporate bonds, you are likely taking on more credit and interest rate risk than you think,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.That interest rate risk results from the decision by many companies to exploit the low interest rates created by the Federal Reserve after the financial crisis by borrowing heavily, locking in those rates for a long time.The $6 trillion in investment-grade bonds issued in the last five calendar years is 55 percent higher than the borrowing in the five years before the financial crisis. The average maturity of investment-grade bonds issued last year was 15.3 years, down from the high of 17 years in 2015, but still higher than the 13.6 years average of a decade ago.The longer a bond\u2019s maturity, the greater its price drop when interest rates rise, as has happened in 2018. This relationship can be understood through a bond statistic called duration: an estimate of how a fund\u2019s price will change for every 1 percentage point change in interest rates. For instance, a fund with a five-year duration would experience a 5 percent price drop when rates rise one percentage point.The duration of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is now stretched to 5.9 years. The Bloomberg Barclays index of high-grade corporate bonds is even more rate sensitive, with a duration of 7.3 years.While longer bonds are at the heart of recent underperformance, rates are not expected to climb much more this year, which could give a second-half boost to total returns.And the corporate bond market is not yet pricing in a possible recession. \u201cWe are later in the game, but the innings are longer,\u201d said Mary Ellen Stanek, chief investment officer of Baird Advisors, and co-manager of Baird\u2019s suite of bond funds. \u201cWe are now in the second-longest post-World War II economic cycle, with no end in sight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty smart that they have issued a lot of long-term debt at very low interest rates,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cI am not saying they are completely insulated from rising interest rates, but it has been good financial management.\u201dThe other noteworthy shift in investment-grade corporate bonds is a deterioration in overall quality. In 2007, 27 percent of the total value of bonds issued by companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were rated BBB, the lowest rung of investment grade. Today, 50 percent of the market value of S.&P. 500 bonds have that rating.Mariarosa Verde, senior credit officer at the bond-rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Services, said the ratings slide is, for the most part, a result of corporate intent. Companies that once had sterling ratings are \u201cstrategically deciding to take on more leverage,\u201d she said, perhaps to finance a merger or acquisition.Bayer, CVS, General Mills and AT&T are among the deal makers whose investment-grade bond ratings have fallen as they have borrowed more.When bonds are downgraded because of purposeful corporate borrowing, it \u201ccan be a good time to invest,\u201d Ms. Emery said, assuming a company has the will and the cash flow to repay that debt and crawl back up the rating ladder. That value-seeking approach helped Dodge & Cox Income to earn a 4.9 percent annualized return over the last 10 years. That was one percentage point ahead of the benchmark aggregate index.Nonetheless, the bulge of BBB bonds could be a recipe for more volatility at the next downturn. According to Moody\u2019s, in a recession year, 10 percent of investment-grade bonds at that lowest investment-grade tier become fallen angels, the industry term for bonds downgraded to junk status. \u201cIn the next recession, there will be more investment-grade companies at risk of becoming fallen angels than at any other time in the past,\u201d Ms. Verde said.That could hit index funds hardest. Once a bond is booted from investment grade down to high yield, high-grade indexes \u2014 and the funds that track them \u2014 are typically required to dispose of the bond promptly, forcing funds to sell when prices have fallen. Actively managed funds are not typically bound by such a strict sell rule.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developing Countries May Need Their Own Strategies to Cope With Job-Taking Robots", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it\u2019s true that robots are coming for our jobs, developing countries could have a much tougher time coping with the shock.That poses particular concern for developing countries, where there are typically larger pools of unskilled labor working in agriculture or simple manufacturing roles.In the developed world, much of the discussion about how to address the rise of automation has focused on 1) how to constrain it and 2) how to cope with the fallout.Governments could constrain automation through policy measures such as disincentivization \u2014 by, say, taxing the use of robots \u2014 or reducing the cost of human labor through tax breaks or cutting minimum wages.The problem is that disincentivizing automation could just push it into other nations. Developing countries are likely to feel unable to implement those kinds of constraints, for fear of companies or even entire sectors relocating to regions where the use of robots isn\u2019t penalized.Mr. Schlogl told DealBook the impact of automation could be felt acutely by sectors that are labor-intensive in developing countries, irrespective of where robots are put to use. Cheap goods can be built by machines in one location and distributed worldwide; a single country could mechanize agriculture and flood a subcontinent with affordable produce.As for cutting labor costs, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much lower wages can get in many developing countries before they become unethical.The second way for governments to cope with the disruption caused by automation is to implement strategies that deal with the effects. That includes retraining workers to give them skills required for future jobs, or providing citizens with a basic income to make up for stagnant wages or job losses.Retraining would be hard to implement in developing nations, argue Mr. Schlogl and Mr. Sumner, because they typically have limited education sectors in place through which to deliver it. And a universal basic income, they argue, would be hard to finance in developing countries, as it assumes the existence of a highly productive services sector from which to siphon money, which is often missing in such economies.There are some potential routes forward. One idea suggested by Mr. Schlogl and Mr. Sumner is a so-called global universal basic income \u2014 administered internationally, and paid for in developing countries via aid. This plan, says Mr. Schlogl, \u201chas the advantage of being only politically impossible.\u201dAnother might be for developing countries to build out labor-intensive sectors that look set to be resistant to automation over the coming decades \u2014 such as social care, education, health care, tourism or infrastructure construction. But this is a risky approach, requiring large upfront investment without a guarantee of protection from automation in the long-term.That makes the pair\u2019s ultimate conclusion \u2014 that \u201cwe need to ask different policy and research questions\u201d about how automation will affect the developing world \u2014 seem justifiable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How College Sports Killed Summer Vacation", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "Want to play volleyball or field hockey or soccer in college? Say goodbye to your summer.Supported byThe day began for the Clemson men\u2019s soccer team at 7 a.m., with workouts focused on improving agility, sprinting and technique. A weight room session followed. Next came classes. In the evening there was finally time to kick back with friends and video games, and to rest up for the next morning.This was July 23, more than two full weeks before preseason formally begins next Wednesday, and a month before the Tigers\u2019 first regular-season game.And this grueling schedule actually constituted \u201can easier day for us,\u201d the junior Tanner Dieterich said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste any time,\u201d he added.College sports fans are inured to the notion of top-notch football teams spending their summers on campus. After all, football is a strikingly high-exposure sport, worth billions of dollars to the colleges and, eventually, millions to the best of the players if they sign with a pro team.But in recent years, many lower-profile college sports have become virtually year-round affairs, too. Athletes routinely forgo summer break to remain on campus and hone their skills as they work jobs or internships that they do not have time for during the traditional academic year. Others take classes that will minimize their academic burden during their competitive seasons.\u201cI think it\u2019s the norm now,\u201d said Taryn Kloth, a senior volleyball player at Creighton, who is spending her summer on campus in Omaha working on an independent study in finance. \u201cYou almost feel as though you\u2019re behind if you\u2019re not.\u201dIt does not matter whether sports generate profits or much exposure for their athletic departments or their universities, or if the sports typically provide professional opportunities for their athletes after graduation. Coaches demand players who are driven to get the best out of themselves, and such personalities naturally believe only year-round training will produce that.\u201cWe\u2019re expected to come back Sept. 17, the day we report, in our best shape,\u201d said Gracie Kramer, a junior on U.C.L.A.\u2019s gymnastics team.Kramer was on campus last week taking an intensive six-week course in Croatian, strategically getting her language requirement out of the way over the summer rather than spreading it out over three quarters during the school year.\u201cIf you know what to expect for preseason, you know you have to kick your butt in the off-season,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re out of luck: You have to accept the consequences of not making lineups, not being able to compete as much as you want.\u201dSo each day Kramer, whose events include the vault and the floor exercise, arrives at the gym before 8 a.m. and does what she termed, pun unintended, a \u201cflexible\u201d workout for a few hours. She prefers the \u201cnice open gym\u201d at U.C.L.A. as opposed to the gym she would use near her childhood home a couple of hours away, one that she would need to share with local club teams.Peter Roby, formerly Northeastern\u2019s athletic director and a member of the Knight Commission, which works to reform college sports, said the trend had paid dividends, especially in football and men\u2019s basketball, in the form of higher graduation rates, as athletes effectively have more time to take and pass the required classloads. But he also sounded a note of caution.\u201cIf the athletes don\u2019t have the chance to take time off, that\u2019s where they start to get burned out, injuries start to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you may have athletes who feel they should be paid \u2014 because they never get any time off.\u201dThe year-round phenomenon in some of these sports is relatively recent, said Kathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association. These days, she estimated, three-quarters of women\u2019s college volleyball teams have most or all of their players on campus for much of the summer.As college sports expenses have skyrocketed in recent decades (a trend driven at the largest universities by skyrocketing media revenues for football and men\u2019s basketball), athletic departments have been incentivized to encourage athletes to stay on campus as much as possible, DeBoer said. The more time they spend on campus, the thinking goes, the more likely they will take enough classes to graduate in four years. The funding necessary to allow athletes to train over the summer, according to DeBoer, pales in comparison to carrying their scholarships into a fifth year or even a ninth semester, when they may no longer be eligible for intercollegiate competition.\u201cIt makes sense for the athletics department to have them graduate in four years, because that\u2019s the window on their eligibility,\u201d she said.\u201cI think the majority of coaches would probably say they would like to have their team around all year,\u201d said Connie Price-Smith, Mississippi\u2019s track and field coach.DeBoer, who used to be Kentucky\u2019s volleyball coach, explained coaches\u2019 thinking: \u201cIf I\u2019m a volleyball player and I\u2019m in charge of my own conditioning in the summertime, or have 10 teammates also in the weight room or on the track, I\u2019m going to work a lot harder with the 10 teammates.\u201dThis applies even in more individual sports. Bianca Alonzo, a senior from Los Angeles who runs cross-country and track for Columbia, spent nine weeks this summer in Manhattan, interning at a nonprofit downtown by day and running, lifting and cooking with teammates uptown at night.\u201cIt was nice not to be in a rush through my workouts and cross-training, since I didn\u2019t have the pressures of school or other things around me,\u201d she said.Many summer workouts must be informal, because N.C.A.A. rules generally bar contact between coaches and players during long off-season dead periods. (There are also limits on supervised training.)The workouts are supposed to be voluntary. Alonzo said her coaches sent the team sheets with recommended mileages and workouts at the beginning of the summer; Dieterich emphasized that Clemson players made the decision to return by the last week in June and train during the second summer session in player-led practices.Men\u2019s basketball teams are the most notorious exploiters of the international-trips rule: for instance, Kentucky is heading to the Bahamas in early August. Yet teams in other sports see the benefit as well. Creighton\u2019s volleyball squad traveled to \u2014 and played volleyball in \u2014 the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and Italy in June. Upon their return, coaches advised players to step away from spiking for a few weeks, said Kloth, which the players by and large did before returning to informal practices on July 9.\u201cWe\u2019re all really competitive and we don\u2019t want to sit down and give up volleyball,\u201d she said.The summer sports toil even has trickled down to incoming freshmen, some of whom now enroll over the summer to get a jump-start with their new teams even though their nonathlete classmates might not even arrive on campus for a few more months.Kathleen Alcorn said that her daughter, Mikayla, graduated from high school in New York this summer on a Friday, traveled to Pittsburgh the next day and began training with Pitt\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team on the following Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s not mandatory, but the university recommends it for all freshmen athletes, and certainly in the fall sports,\u201d she said.\u201cShe\u2019s talking about next summer now,\u201d Alcorn added of her daughter, \u201cabout how she can take another summer class, maybe an internship in Pittsburgh, or some other solution.

{"Headline": "How Control of Congress Could Swing on a Fight to Repeal California\u2019s Gas Tax", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It was enacted by the thinnest of margins: A 12-cent gasoline tax passed by lawmakers last year to finance a multibillion-dollar campaign to repair California roads and bridges hobbled by years of neglect and disrepair.But the tax, which took effect in November, is now the subject of a major battle with far-reaching implications for the state\u2019s transportation network and the Democratic campaign to seize control of Congress in November. A measure to repeal the gas tax will appear on the California ballot, championed by Republicans opposed to it but looking to drive up Republican turnout in battleground congressional races.Taxes have a long and complicated history in California. The state led the tax revolution in 1978, when voters passed Proposition 13 \u2014 slashing property taxes and requiring a two-thirds vote by the Legislature to raise them. Until now, the gas tax has not been raised for 25 years.The tax, along with increased vehicle fees, would raise $5 billion a year.\u201cThis has nothing to do with taxes,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThis is engineered by the Republican congressional delegation to prop up their vulnerable Republicans in Orange County and the Central Valley. They don\u2019t give a damn about the roads in California.\u201dThe drive to save the gas tax is broadly supported by business and labor leaders, as well as Mr. Newsom, who is likely to succeed Mr. Brown. They argue that a repeal would stop projects already underway, as well as raise questions about how the rest of the nation can find the money to deal with an epidemic of deteriorating roads, highways and bridges.\u201cI drive on our roads every day,\u201d said Allan Zaremberg, the head of the California Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey are in pretty terrible condition and deteriorating. Without this, the roads are going to deteriorate even more.\u201dMr. Brown just signed his final budget, which projects a $6.1 billion surplus, money that Republicans are arguing should be used for road repairs, eliminating the need for a gas tax that forces Californians to pay more at the pump.California Republicans have seized on the issue. Taxes have long been a point of divisions between Republicans and Democrats, and all the more so since Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans enacted a tax reform bill that severely reduced deductions for state and local taxes, posing a particular burden for California homeowners. Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is the House majority leader and looking to become its next speaker, has contributed money to the repeal in an effort to save seven Republican congressional seats.Mr. Cox said he had found a \u201cton of support\u201d for the repeal.\u201cWhenever I am out campaigning, I always talk to working people \u2014 valet parking people, the desk clerks, the people behind the counter,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask people what do they think about the cost of living and the gas tax. And they say: \u2018We can\u2019t take this. We had to move an extra 20 miles away because we couldn\u2019t find an apartment we could afford. And now we are sitting in traffic burning up gasoline at almost $5 a gallon.\u2019\u201d\u201cMr. Brown and Mr. Newsom are being dishonest when they say these projects will come to a halt if we don\u2019t have this tax,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that these road projects could be done if we changed work rules, if we used money more efficiently, if we cut better deals to make the process more efficiently.\u201d\u201cIt has a lot of support in the business community. It\u2019s part of Jerry Brown\u2019s legacy. But to save it, people will have to spend a lot of money and he will have to get personally involved and they will have to change the way it\u2019s talked about,\u201d said Robert M. Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, which conducted the poll.\u201cIf it\u2019s talked about as the gas tax, I don\u2019t see how it survives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to talk about it in terms of safe bridges, a decent road system, the economic future and jobs.\u201dMr. Brown has a long history with California initiatives, giving him what some Republicans say is an advantage.\u201cThey are not voting in favor of taxes,\u201d Mr. Brown said of the repeal, signaling the argument he would use to try to defeat it. \u201cThe proposal is to kill $5 billion in investment in roads, bridges and transit and public safety.

Mueller III \u2014 weighs not just on the prosecution and defense, but on the White House as well.Among the Americans charged so far by Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors, Mr. Manafort not only held the highest position in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, but he also arguably has the deepest connections to Russia-aligned politicians and political forces.Mr. Manafort has given no indication that he wants to help the government or has information that would do so; his friends say he believes he is innocent and will be acquitted.But if he does know something of interest to Mr. Mueller and chooses to enter a plea agreement, his cooperation could help prosecutors put together a clearer picture of how Russian actors intervened in the presidential election and how the Trump campaign, wittingly or unwittingly, interacted with them.A number of events and relationships that have come up in Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry touch on Mr. Manafort\u2019s association with the Trump campaign and help explain why he is still seen as a potentially pivotal figure in the Russia inquiry even if his trial is limited to charges unrelated to the president.In July 2016, just before the Republican National Convention, Mr. Manafort sought to get a message to Mr. Deripaska offering \u201cprivate briefings\u201d about the presidential race.For the previous decade, the three men had worked together promoting pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine and boosting the political fortunes of Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was elected president of Ukraine in 2010. In a filing Monday, the prosecutors said Mr. Manafort earned $60 million from that work.In Kiev, Mr. Kilimnik was sometimes referred to as \u201cManafort\u2019s Manafort.\u201d He has denied that he was ever a Russian spy and said he quit working for Mr. Manafort in 2014 after Mr. Yanukovych was ousted as Ukraine\u2019s leader and fled to Russia.Mr. Manafort said he never knowingly communicated with a Russian intelligence officer but acknowledged that he and Mr. Kilimnik met in May and August 2016. The second meeting took place about two weeks before he was forced to resign as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman because of his Ukraine work.Prosecutors also stated in a court filing that Mr. Gates, Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign chairman, was in contact with Mr. Kilimnik in the two months before the election, even though he was aware of Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s background in Russian military intelligence. Mr. Gates has pleaded guilty in the case, is cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team and is scheduled to testify against Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort was also indicted on charges of money laundering and failing to disclose his lobbying work for foreign interests in a separate case scheduled for trial in United States District Court in Washington, D.C., in September. In that case, prosecutors say, Mr. Kilimnik and Mr. Manafort worked together to influence the testimony of two witnesses in Mr. Manafort\u2019s favor.Mr. Kilimnik will almost certainly not be extradited from Russia to face the obstruction-of-justice allegations, but Mr. Manafort will now face those charges as well at the Washington trial.Mr. Trump\u2019s pro-Russia statements and openness to policy shifts regarding Moscow predated Mr. Manafort\u2019s tenure on the campaign and continued after Mr. Manafort stepped down from the campaign in August 2016.But veterans of such trials say that especially for someone like Mr. Manafort, accustomed to a backyard putting green, suits from a men\u2019s boutique called the world\u2019s most expensive and road trips in a Mercedes-Benz SL 550 convertible, the prospect of years in prison can play an outsize role in a decision to seek a plea deal if the trial does not seem to be going well.Mr. Manafort, 69, already has a taste of what could await him if he is convicted.His bail was revoked over the witness tampering allegations, and he is being held in the Alexandria city jail, where friends say he is permitted only two 30-minute visits a week with his wife, Kathleen. He can walk or exercise outside an hour a day. And unlike a rural Virginia jail where he was incarcerated earlier, which he said treated him like a \u201cV.I.P.,\u201d he is clad in a dark-green jumpsuit like any other inmate.His once-flush bank accounts have been frozen, according to his friends, and they are soliciting online donations to his legal defense fund.Mr. Manafort\u2019s supporters insist that the suspicions about him are vastly overblown. They point out that despite the long list of criminal charges against him, prosecutors have not suggested that he was serving anyone\u2019s interest but his own.His dealings with Mr. Kilimnik and Mr. Deripaska, the Kremlin-connected oligarch, were strictly business-related; his offer to brief Mr. Deripaska on the Trump campaign was just an innocuous courtesy that was never even accepted, they say.They portray him as the victim of a runaway special counsel supervised by a deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who they say should be removed from office. Prosecutors have piled on charges, they say, because they have come up empty-handed in their search for evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to tip the election.The website seeking funds for Mr. Manafort\u2019s defense features headlines such as \u201cStopping Robert Mueller to protect us all\u201d and \u201cThe mess Rod Rosenstein made.\u201dIn the trial that begins Tuesday, prosecutors have told Judge T. S. Ellis III of United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia that they will carefully steer clear of any political inferences that could prejudice the jury. But they do plan to show that a group of Ukrainian oligarchs financed his work to help elect Mr. Yanukovych and promote pro-Russian political interests.They named four Ukrainian oligarchs: Rinat Akhmetov, Andriy Klyuyev, Borys Kolesnikov and Sergei Lyovochkin. Mr. Yanukovych appointed two of them to top government posts when he was elected president.Mr. Manafort\u2019s role in the Trump campaign will be mentioned only in the limited context of a loan that Mr. Manafort obtained, prosecutors have said. One bank chairman knew Mr. Manafort\u2019s application for a loan was based on false documents but approved it because he was promised \u2014 and received \u2014 a position on the Trump campaign, according to the prosecutors. The bank chairman also hoped for a job in the administration, they said, but it did not materialize.Even so, the trial will also be a blunt reminder that while Mr. Trump dismisses the Mueller inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d it has had very real consequences for its targets.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of charges against Paul Manafort. He is charged 18 times in a 32-count indictment; he does not face 32 charges.Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama Moves to Limit Sheriffs From Pocketing Jail Food Money", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlabama\u2019s governor has begun to cut off a gravy train for the state\u2019s sheriffs: the unspent money for prisoners\u2019 meals that the sheriffs have long been allowed to keep for themselves.The practice, born of a bickered-over ambiguity in a state law, has let sheriffs pocket tax dollars that over the decades almost certainly ran into the millions. To curtail the practice, Gov. Kay Ivey ordered in a memorandum to the state comptroller that payments of certain funds related to jail food \u201cno longer be made to the sheriffs personally.\u201d Instead, the governor wrote, the money must be paid to county general funds or official accounts.\u201cPublic funds should be used for public purposes,\u201d Ms. Ivey, a Republican, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201dCritics of the practice welcomed the governor\u2019s action on Wednesday but said it resolved only part of the problem because it did not apply to every type of payment related to jail food.Even so, the move is sure to infuriate sheriffs in at least some of Alabama\u2019s 67 counties, and the governor\u2019s order may be tested in the courts. Economic disclosure forms filed by sheriffs suggest that many do not take the leftover money, sometimes because of local laws. But some do: Records show that the sheriff in Etowah County, in northeast Alabama, for example, has taken more than $670,000 in recent years.The Alabama Sheriffs Association did not respond to a message on Wednesday seeking comment about the governor\u2019s order, and several sheriffs declined to comment.Some sheriffs and their allies have called in the past for changes to a system that critics said was unique in the United States and created a powerful incentive to cut corners and mistreat prisoners. But barring a change in state law, the sheriffs have argued, retaining the unspent funds for personal use was legal and acceptable.At the time, the sheriff had retained more than $200,000, while the breakfast that Morgan County was serving to prisoners was sometimes no more than a slice of toast, part of an egg and several spoonfuls of grits. At one point, prisoners were fed corn dogs at every meal for about three months, after two area sheriffs had bought a truckload of sausages at a bargain price.Ms. Ivey, a former state treasurer who became governor last year, said in her memorandum to the comptroller that \u201crecent events brought this policy to my attention,\u201d and she asked the Legislature to consider changing the wording of the Depression-era statute that sheriffs have relied on to justify their retention of the jail food money.The governor\u2019s lawyers acknowledged in an internal review that state attorneys general in Alabama had reached conflicting conclusions about the leftover funds.In the last two decades, though, two other attorneys general have reached the opposite view, that sheriffs were not entitled to excess food money. In the more recent opinion, in 2011, Luther Strange said that \u201cneither the sheriff nor the county may use the surplus for any purpose other than future expenses in feeding prisoners.\u201dThe governor\u2019s office said it was not clear why the practice of paying the food money to sheriffs personally and letting them keep any surplus had remained in effect after that ruling. In an email on Wednesday, Clinton Carter, the state finance director, said Alabama officials had recently \u201cre-evaluated our interpretation\u201d of Mr. Strange\u2019s 2011 opinion.Advocates for ending the practice called for action by state lawmakers to abolish it completely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Small Bank Became a Go-To Lender to the Trump Family", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Michael D. Cohen needed $17 million to buy a Manhattan apartment building in 2015, he went to Signature Bank.Signature had existed for less than two decades, and compared with some of its New York rivals, it was a small player occupying unglamorous niches.Yet it was a natural place to go for Mr. Cohen, who was Donald J. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Years earlier, he had helped initiate a relationship between Signature and Mr. Trump, and the bank became an unlikely go-to lender for the future president and his extended family.The bank helped finance Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida golf course. It lent money to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and to Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles. It provided Mr. Trump and his business with checking accounts. And Ivanka Trump sat on Signature\u2019s board of directors while the bank was lending to her father and her husband, Mr. Kushner.Signature provides a window into the intersecting financial interests of Mr. Cohen and the Trump and Kushner families. With Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner working in the White House, and Mr. Cohen under criminal investigation, Signature\u2019s interactions with some of its most famous clients are attracting attention from regulators.New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services this year requested information from Signature about its credit lines to the Kushners, according to people familiar with the requests. They said regulators were reviewing whether Mr. Kushner\u2019s White House role could compromise Signature\u2019s ability to collect on the loans.That review of Mr. Kushner\u2019s loan documents led the New York regulators to broaden their inquiry, said one person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the regulator\u2019s activities. The agency is now looking into whether Signature lent money to real estate developers \u2014 including the Kushner family\u2019s business, Kushner Companies \u2014 knowing they planned to use abusive tactics to push out low-rent tenants and then charge more, according to two people familiar with the review. It is focused on whether Signature\u2019s loans were overly risky and violated laws intended to prevent predatory behavior.The inquiry is at an early stage and might include banks other than Signature, the person said.\u201cWe recognize we are not perfect,\u201d Signature\u2019s chairman, Scott A. Shay, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, any allegation that we knowingly or somehow actively abet tenant harassment is frankly a slander against Signature Bank and an unfair impugning of the reputations of many hardworking colleagues who strive to be a positive force for not only our shareholders and depositors but our community as well.\u201dChristine Taylor, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman, said, \u201cAll our business with Signature Bank has been entirely appropriate.\u201d She added that before Mr. Kushner joined the White House, \u201cwe never had these type of inquiries which appear to be solely for political reasons.\u201dAmanda Miller, a Trump Organization spokeswoman, played down the company\u2019s relationship with Signature. \u201cWhile the company has, from time to time, done some business with Signature Bank, those dealings were few and far between and limited in scope,\u201d she said. (Other banks, such as Deutsche Bank, have done more business with the Trump Organization.)Mr. Shay and Joseph DePaolo founded Signature in 1999 with backing from Israel\u2019s biggest lender, Bank Hapoalim. One of Signature\u2019s specialties was financing the purchase of taxi medallions, which authorize holders to operate cabs. Mr. Cohen had amassed a large portfolio of medallions and had borrowed money from bankers who later joined Signature.Signature forged deep political connections \u2014 its board members have included a former Republican senator, Alfonse D\u2019Amato, and a former New York lieutenant governor, Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat. A former Democratic congressman, Barney Frank, joined the board in 2015.The bank also became known for doing more than rivals to accommodate customers.For example, Signature allowed some business clients to withdraw cash even when their accounts were empty, creating overdrafts of tens of thousands of dollars without formal loan agreements, according to a former employee and a client who said he routinely did this. That attracted clients with irregular cash flow.In an interview at Signature\u2019s Fifth Avenue headquarters, Mr. DePaolo, the bank\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that Signature did things that rivals wouldn\u2019t. He said it was part of providing superior services to trustworthy customers. He and Mr. Shay said Signature complied with all banking rules.Mr. Frank said Signature served a valuable role by financing housing for low- and middle-income tenants. \u201cIt\u2019s very well run,\u201d he said.Before Mr. Trump became a Signature client, he fought the bank. The 2007 skirmish involved a construction company that Mr. Trump had hired to help build a golf course. After Mr. Trump refused to pay the company\u2019s bills and sued it for subpar work, the company went bankrupt. It owed Signature money. Mr. Trump\u2019s and Signature\u2019s lawyers argued in court that their clients were both entitled to the same funds from the bankrupt company.Mr. Trump and Signature settled in September 2009. Three months later, the Trump Organization started borrowing from Signature \u2014 thanks, at least in part, to Mr. Cohen.Mr. Cohen had joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as an executive and was on the condominium board of Trump World Tower, across from the United Nations. In December 2009, Signature lent $800,000 to the building, managed by the Trump Organization, to refinance the mortgage on the superintendent\u2019s apartment.A former Signature employee said Mr. Cohen had helped arrange the loan. Signature executives say they have no record of Mr. Cohen\u2019s involvement.A long-term relationship between Signature and the Trump family ensued.In 2010, the year after Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner married, Charles Kushner and his wife opened a Signature account, a bank spokeswoman said. That year, the Trump International Golf Club in Florida received two letters of credit from Signature totaling $212,000. The letters provided a guarantee from Signature that Mr. Trump would be able to pay what he owed in a contract with a third party. Signature said the letters of credit were fully secured by cash that Mr. Trump had at the bank.Signature in 2011 gave Charles and Jared Kushner a credit line from which they borrowed nearly $5 million that year, securities filings show.In September 2011, Signature named Ms. Trump, who was 29, to its board. She was paid $198,875 in 2012 in cash and stock.Mr. Shay said Ms. Trump had been invited onto the nine-member board as part of an effort to recruit younger directors and to give it a second woman.\u201cShe was an active, engaged board member,\u201d Mr. Shay said. \u201cShe read everything and asked questions if she didn\u2019t understand.\u201dGiving seats on the board of a publicly traded company like Signature to people directly connected to large clients is generally frowned on.\u201cDirectors should not have significant commercial relationships with institutions on whose boards they sit,\u201d said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cYou\u2019re there to oversee operations and be objective. Your job is not to guarantee business for the bank or the company but to ensure effective oversight.\u201dSignature nonetheless designated Ms. Trump as an independent director and assigned her to board committees that set executive compensation and monitored risks.The bank continued to do business with her family. It renewed credit lines to the Kushners, who by the end of 2012 owed the bank $4 million.Mr. Shay said that Ms. Trump had recused herself from decisions involving her family and that the transactions hadn\u2019t been large enough to compromise her independence.With the benefit of hindsight, Mr. DePaolo said, \u201cI almost regret that we had Ivanka on the board.\u201d Mr. Shay added: \u201cHad we known the identity of the 45th president, I think we would have thought twice. But that\u2019s not to say she wasn\u2019t a great board member.\u201dMs. Trump stepped down from the board in early 2013 because of \u201cher highly demanding schedule.\u201d A White House spokesman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about Ms. Trump\u2019s role.Five months later, Signature started making mortgage loans to Mr. Kushner\u2019s company. Kushner Companies has received at least 21 mortgages from Signature, totaling more than $210 million. The loans were mostly for buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn where many tenants live in rent-regulated apartments.\u201cAll the lending we\u2019ve done with them has been very conservative,\u201d Mr. Shay said.In February 2015, shortly before Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign got underway, Signature made the $17 million loan to Mr. Cohen.Mr. Cohen said in an email that the loan had been \u201csourced by a mortgage broker and not based upon any personal relationships.\u201dMr. DePaolo said that at the time of the loan, Mr. Cohen wasn\u2019t a public figure. \u201cWe did a background check, and nothing out of the ordinary came up \u2014 he looked fine,\u201d he said.Signature has kept lending to the Kushners. Last year, Mr. Kushner and his father took advantage of the latest in a series of credit lines provided by the bank, borrowing more than $5 million, according to Mr. Kushner\u2019s most recent government ethics filing.Signature executives argue they are being punished unfairly for lending that mostly took place before the election.\u201cWe feel abused,\u201d Mr. Shay said.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the nature of the financial backing that Signature Bank provided to Donald J. Trump\u2019s Florida golf course. Although the bank itself categorized the financing as a loan, it was in the form of letters of credit. Signature did not loan money to the golf course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Take the Senate, Democratic Group Will Spend Big in Red States", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA heavily funded Democratic group will spend tens of millions of dollars to mobilize voters in the Republican-leaning states where control of the Senate is likely to be decided this November, stepping in to fill a void left by years of decay in Democratic infrastructure at the state and local level.Those four races are among the country\u2019s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states.Paul Dunn, a strategist for Senate Majority PAC, said that in those four states, Democrats need both to drive up turnout among left-leaning voters and to make inroads in more conservative communities.Republicans need to win nine senate races to keep a majority, and Democrats need to win 28 to take it away. Here\u2019s a look at the chances of each outcome.\u201cThese are states that you need to do everything to win,\u201d Mr. Dunn said. \u201cYou have to have close margins in areas that are harder for Democrats, but we also need to increase participation in areas where we are strong.\u201dBecause groups like super PACs can take contributions of unlimited size, they are not allowed to coordinate their activities with candidates. As a result, they have tended to dedicate most or all of their money to advertising \u2014 on television, radio and the internet \u2014 while leaving voter turnout to conventional political parties and campaigns.\u201cThis was clearly part of the difference maker,\u201d Mr. Poersch said of the Alabama program. \u201cAnd we wanted to carry it forward.\u201dMuch as many Senate Democrats are competing in red states where their party is weak, House Republicans are defending dozens of seats in Democratic-leaning areas where there is limited party infrastructure to help them.While many of the Senate races that Democrats must win are in largely rural and white states, the four states Senate Majority PAC will pursue most aggressively also include significant minority communities that do not always vote enthusiastically in midterms: mainly black voters in Tennessee, Missouri and Indiana, and Hispanic voters in Arizona.In addition to those four states, the Senate Majority PAC field operation will also cover nine others, including North Dakota, Wisconsin and Montana, where Democratic senators are defending their seats in states President Trump won, and Nevada, where Senator Dean Heller appears to be the lone Republican incumbent at grave risk of losing his seat.The $20 million dedicated for turnout represents a major chunk of the group\u2019s entire budget for 2018. The organization announced separately last month that it had reserved $80 million in airtime for television ads across the country.Mr. Poersch suggested the outcome in at least one historically Republican state could hold omens for the 2020 presidential election.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to believe the presidential map doesn\u2019t go through Arizona in 2020,\u201d Mr. Poersch said. \u201cIt\u2019s growing too quickly not to, and Democrats have been improving from cycle to cycle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is this actually worse than when you defended O.J. Simpson?Today the passions are so strong that if I do anything that is perceived as helping Donald Trump, I am an evil conspirator. I go back to the 1950s, when I was one of the few people at Brooklyn College standing up and defending the right of communists to speak and to teach. I hated communism. They would say, \u201cYou can\u2019t defend communists. They wouldn\u2019t defend your rights. They would take away your civil liberties.\u201d And that\u2019s absolutely true. Every generation I\u2019ve lived through, there has been an excuse for taking away civil liberties. \u201cTrump is going to destroy the country; you can\u2019t defend his civil liberties.\u201d Anything you do to help this man is villainy. You reject the label \u201cTrump supporter,\u201d don\u2019t you?And here, you\u2019re defending Trump\u2019s right to \u2026 To be treated fairly. Not to have it considered a crime when you fire, when you exercise your Article II powers under the Constitution. You enjoy being provocative and contrarian. I\u2019m a teacher and a professor. My job is to provoke and stimulate conversation. The thing I hate most is people who want to shut off conversation.People only hear one word: Trump.You have to pretend to be dumb. Because once you get sophisticated and nuanced you\u2019re politically incorrect. There\u2019s no nuance. There\u2019s no sophistication about this. Don\u2019t try to slice the salami thinly. This is just baloney. I grew up in New York, and I\u2019m a Red Sox fan. So I understand nuance. People often talk of these moments as overcorrecting and then correcting. At what point are we in that cycle now?I think we\u2019re there on university campuses. When I speak on university campuses now, a lot of moderate conservatives and liberals come up to me and say we need to restore the center.What\u2019s it been like for you on the island? It seems like no one is throwing things at you. No one is hissing. It seems pretty civil. You\u2019ve got a nice life here.The perverse result is that the shunners are shunning themselves because people have been supporting me. People come to me and say, \u201cLook. Alan, I have to talk to you. What you\u2019re doing is wrong. And you have to do this, do that.\u201dEverybody has advice. \u201cGo on television, defend his civil liberties but say he\u2019s the most horrible president in the history of the world.\u201d But only about 10 people have decided that it wasn\u2019t just that they didn\u2019t want to talk to me. They wanted to expand it, to get other people not to talk to me. This was \u2026An act of hostility?Look, I\u2019ve spent 55 years teaching nuance. That\u2019s what I do.During Vietnam, in the 1970s, you had thousands of people dying every month, a president who had so clearly broken the law. How is that somehow not as bad today? Because people seem to think today it\u2019s worse.With Trump it\u2019s personal. His personal style is so confrontational. He provokes. He\u2019s a brilliant politician, and let me tell you why. He is pushing Democrats to the left. Because extremism provokes extremism. And the Democrats can\u2019t win from the left. They can only win from the center in a national election. So his fondest hope is that somebody from the left gets the nomination against him. The reaction to him is seen as such an overreaction at times.Advertisement"}

Either way, the development suggests that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are scrutinizing at least some financial dealings of the Trump family business, a line that the president has publicly warned the special counsel in the Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, not to cross.The development set off alarm bells within the Trump Organization, an umbrella company for Mr. Trump\u2019s holdings, because of the scope of Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s responsibilities. He has handled its finances for decades, has been involved with the Trump Foundation, has managed the president\u2019s private trust and has at times reviewed the Trump presidential campaign\u2019s books.The newspaper, whose parent company\u2019s chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, sat on the story, a practice known in the tabloid industry as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201d The president has denied an affair.Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump he needed to form a company to buy those rights from the magazine. Mr. Cohen repeatedly referred to Mr. Weisselberg.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,\u201d Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump. Later, he added, \u201cI spoke to Allen about it, when it comes time to the financing.\u201dThe president, who has long refused to release his tax returns, is especially sensitive to any moves by federal prosecutors to dig in to his business affairs. After his election, Mr. Trump resigned his role in his company but retained his ownership and turned over management to his two oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr.Yet, in some ways, it is harder for the president to criticize the New York prosecutors than it is to attack Mr. Mueller. His most fervent allies portray Mr. Mueller as a runaway prosecutor whose supervisor, Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, should be removed from office. Mr. Trump routinely claims that Mr. Mueller is leading \u201ca witch hunt.\u201dBut the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has no special status, and its investigation into Mr. Cohen\u2019s activities appears to be proceeding like any other criminal inquiry.He started to explain why the checkbook was necessary, saying, \u201cIn case there was any money being collected, which I thought was ... .\u201d Then he broke off, saying simply: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. He\u2019s my boss. I went.\u201dWilliam K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Is Wrong About Trade. So Is Everyone Else.", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American president isn\u2019t alone in misunderstanding how competition actually works in the global economy.Mr. Tooze is an economic historian.In fairness to Mr. Trump, one should add that he made clear that calling the Europeans a foe did not mean to imply that the Europeans were \u201cbad.\u201d What was on his mind was, he said, \u201cwhat they do to us in trade.\u201dOn July 25, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president, will be in Washington to discuss just this topic with Mr. Trump. Mr. Juncker is likely to repeat the familiar European line: When it comes to trade, the United States and Europe are not competitors but partners. To think, as Mr. Trump appears to do, of nations locked in mortal economic rivalry shows a grave misunderstanding of how competition actually works in the global economy. Competition is, of course, an ordering principle. If neoliberalism is about anything, it has been about creating the largest possible economic space for competition. But the protagonists aren\u2019t supposed to be states (or at least not members of the Atlantic club) but businesses, investors and workers. It is the job of trade and investment treaties to regulate what preference can be shown to national firms, what rights will be extended to foreign investors. The European Union boasts of particularly tough internal regulations in this regard. National preference is outlawed as far as possible.This interconnection cuts both ways. We hang together in sickness as well as in health. It is not just manufacturing but finance too that is integrated across borders. When the real estate bubble burst in 2008, European as well as American banks imploded. To keep them alive, the U.S. Federal Reserve provided liquidity running into the trillions of dollars both to their branches on Wall Street and by way of the liquidity swap lines extended to the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank. The Fed took this extraordinary step because previous decades had built a system of integration so close that it would have been lethal for the United States not to act. Saving the American financial system meant saving Europe\u2019s banks, too. But for all this integration, globalization has been haunted by a cognitive dissonance, to which Mr. Trump gives crude expression. In the popular imagination and in the words of politicians, the world economy continues to be thought of like the World Cup: cosmopolitan and transnational, yet made up of discrete national teams competing for a single prize. The lingua franca of policy talk is \u201cnational competitiveness.\u201dAngela Merkel\u2019s Germany, supposedly the last great anchor of the liberal world order, is hopelessly addicted to national competitiveness talk. Berlin measures the success of its economic policy not in terms of domestic investment or domestic well-being, but above all in the scale of its trade surplus.Nor is it merely a German obsession. Competitiveness is an endlessly repeated mantra of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk tweets about it all the time.So what then is so upsetting about Mr. Trump\u2019s latest outburst?One of the president\u2019s favorite taboo-breaking moves is that he likes to name enemies, especially those hiding in what is supposed to be America\u2019s own camp. In doing so, he not only offends Atlanticist decorum but also violates a more specific injunction, which permits politicians to talk as much as they like about global competition but not about specific competitors. Normal talk about globalization and competitiveness is directed inward, to the nation. It serves as a call to discipline and hard work. Mr. Trump is taking the idea and pointing it outward, calling out his supposed foes. In so doing, he deliberately fosters economic nationalism. Conventional competitiveness rhetoric treads a fine line. The point is to stir the pot without causing things to bubble over. With Davos types like Ms. Merkel, you know that whatever rhetoric they employ in public, there are people working behind the scenes who respect international law and global treaties, who understand that blatant national favoritism will blow the system up. The same cannot be said for the Trump administration, which has actually imposed tariffs. They are modest so far, but Mr. Trump has a relish for escalation. And this evokes an even deeper fear. It is one thing to indulge in competitiveness talk in a world fundamentally headed toward integration. But Mr. Trump speaks this way in a world in which the direction of travel is profoundly uncertain.Caught between China and the United States, you can see why the Europeans are feeling nervous. The European Union has little clout with which to sway either Beijing or Washington. Europe\u2019s main options are defensive: It can react to Mr. Trump\u2019s aggression with targeted trade retaliation. The French would like something more vigorous, but Mr. Juncker is hamstrung by German fears about prohibitive tariffs on cars. Brussels can block what look like dangerous Chinese acquisitions and seek to protect property rights of European businesses and European citizens in their Chinese ventures.But if Europe does care about the liberal order in a broader sense, it must go further. It needs to break its own competitiveness obsession, of which its huge trade surplus is the most glaring expression. It is not a matter of kowtowing to Mr. Trump. To think of redressing the surplus as a concession is to continue the habit of competitiveness talk. For its own sake, Europe needs more domestic demand, above all more investment. One should not kid oneself about the difficulties this entails, both political and economic. But that would be a real answer to the deep crisis of the present of which Mr. Trump and his ugly rhetoric are both symptom and cause. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burton Richter, a Nobel Winner for Plumbing Matter, Dies at 87", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cause was heart failure, according to a statement by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif., which Dr. Richter led for 15 years in the 1980s and \u203290s.Dr. Richter was the rare particle physicist who possessed a broad expertise both in the engineering of how accelerators slam together subatomic particles at near-light speeds and in understanding what comes out of those collisions.Dr. Richter\u2019s versatility proved to be a boon in the early 1970s, when he designed the Stanford Positron Electron Accelerating Ring, or Spear, and cajoled the Department of Energy into financing $6 million to build it. The machine accelerated electrons and positrons \u2014 the antimatter version of electrons \u2014 in opposite directions around a circular ring. The physicists hoped that the high-energy collisions would reveal new particles.\u201cHe was the force behind building Spear,\u201d Martin Breidenbach, a professor at SLAC and Stanford University who began working with Dr. Richter as a postdoctoral researcher in 1972, said in a telephone interview.Experiments began in 1973. Dr. Richter was eager to push on to higher energies, where discoveries seemed more likely, but Dr. Breidenbach and others wanted first to sort out some inconsistent readings that they had observed at one particular energy level, 3.1 billion electron volts.\u201cWe were given a weekend to waste,\u201d Dr. Breidenbach said. \u201cWhat happened that weekend became all consuming.\u201dOn that Saturday, Nov. 9, 1974, the physicists figured out that the readings were inconsistent, because the energy of the earlier runs had not been set precisely. No one had thought that that was a crucial parameter.By Sunday, Dr. Richter and his colleagues had homed in on a sharp peak in the number of particles coming out of the accelerator at a particular energy \u2014 the hallmark of a new particle. They started writing a draft of a paper to describe the discovery, naming the new particle psi, the 23rd character of the Greek alphabet.The next day, by coincidence, Dr. Ting was at SLAC attending a program advisory meeting.\u201cWhen I met Sam early that morning, he said to me, \u2018Burt, I have some interesting physics to tell you about,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Richter recalled in an article published in the laboratory newsletter in 1976. \u201cMy response was, \u2018Sam, I have some interesting physics to tell you about!\u2019 \u201dDr. Ting was surprised to learn of the discovery of psi, and Dr. Richter was surprised to learn that Dr. Ting\u2019s team had a few weeks earlier observed the same particle in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. The team had not yet announced the finding. Dr. Ting had named it the J particle.Later that day, the two teams jointly revealed the discovery and gave it the combined name J/psi. That set off what physicists called the \u201cNovember revolution\u201d \u2014 a wave of ensuing excitement in exploring a bounty of new particles that required revising the foundations of physics.\u201cThe new particle is something separate and new, and it has formed the beginning of a new family of its own,\u201d the Nobel committee said in announcing the physics prize for Dr. Richter and Dr. Ting less than two years later. Both men were in their 40s, among the youngest to win the physics Nobel.Theorists figured out that explaining the existence of the J/psi required a new type of quark. (Quarks are the building blocks of particles like protons and neutrons.) At the time, physicists knew of three types of quarks, known as up, down and strange.The new quark became known as charm. The J/psi consists of two quarks: a charm quark paired with a charm antiquark, each circling the other like twirling square dancers.Burton Richter was born on March 22, 1931, in Brooklyn, the oldest child of Abraham Richter, a textile worker, and Fanny (Pollack) Richter. After graduating from Far Rockaway High School in Queens, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 17. He obtained his undergraduate degree in physics there in 1952, and a doctorate four years later.Dr. Richter then joined Stanford\u2019s High-Energy Physics Lab as a research associate and became an assistant professor of physics in 1960. In 1963 he also took a position at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, one of the leading particle physics laboratories in the world. (The name was changed to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in 2008.)As laboratory director from 1984 to 1999, Dr. Richter oversaw the construction of the Stanford Linear Collider, a new type of machine that, instead of guiding positrons and electrons along a circular ring, fired them at each other along straight paths. Construction ran into many difficulties and delays, but ultimately the machine lived up to its promise.Dr. Richter later realized that the next generation of accelerators would not be built at SLAC and so began shifting its focus to high-energy X-ray lasers and astrophysics \u2014 endeavors that would not require large swaths of pricey California real estate.\u201cI really think Burt was a visionary leader at SLAC,\u201d said Persis Drell, the Stanford provost who served as SLAC director from 2007 to 2012. Dr. Drell said Dr. Richter had been careful not to tell her what he would have done if he were still director, but he was also blunt when asked for advice. \u201cIt was kind of refreshing, actually,\u201d Dr. Drell said. \u201cWith Burt, it wasn\u2019t subtle.\u201dDr. Richter turned to energy issues in the latter part of his career, asserting his views with similar bluntness \u2014 as he did when he worked on a Department of Energy advisory committee on nuclear energy.Dr. Drell said: \u201cHe\u2019s quoted as saying in the minutes, \u2018D.O.E. has done an abysmal job of explaining that nuclear energy is part of the nation\u2019s energy mix, and if fossil energy had to pay the cost of garbage disposal instead of pushing its waste products up a smokestack, nuclear energy would be the low-cost option.\u2019 And that\u2019s classic Burt. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s concise. It\u2019s to the point, and it\u2019s not what the audience wanted to hear.\u201dHe was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also a member of Jason, an independent group of scientists that advises the federal government.He is survived by his wife, Laurose; a daughter, Elizabeth Richter; a son, Matthew; and two grandchildren.Dr. Breidenbach fondly remembered the arguments he and Dr. Richter would have every week or so. \u201cWe usually argued about the management of SLAC, what\u2019s important in science, why the place can\u2019t be better and stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was something we both enjoyed.\u201dHe went to visit Dr. Richter the day before he died.\u201cHe was sitting in a chair with oxygen,\u201d Dr. Breidenbach said. \u201cHe was as acute as ever. He was a little down, not surprisingly, and I asked his wife, Laurose, if it was O.K. to argue with him. And she laughed and said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 And so we set off doing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His lawyer, Rudi Krause, confirmed the court appearance, but said he did not yet know what the charges would be.\u201cUnofficially, we\u2019ve heard the case is about Jonas,\u201d Mr. Zuma\u2019s lawyer said.Mr. Jonas has told investigators that Mr. Zuma arranged a meeting at which Ajay Gupta, a member of the Indian business family now at the center of \u201cstate capture\u201d allegations in South Africa, offered him nearly $45 million \u2014 $45,000 of it in cash \u2014 to accept the position of finance minister. Mr. Jonas refused the offer.Mr. Zuma has admitted attending that meeting, but denies that any bribes were offered.After his father was elected president of the African National Congress in 2007 and then president of South Africa two years later, Mr. Zuma began rising within the Gupta family empire, which spanned computer equipment, media and mining. Within three years, Mr. Zuma had been appointed director of 11 Gupta companies.\u201cHe was the pivot between the Zuma and Gupta families,\u201d said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a nonprofit organization in Johannesburg. \u201cHe was the Zuma family rep \u2014 the business side of their whole scheme.\u201d\u201cThese charges are an indication that law enforcement authorities feel more free to do their jobs now,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cIn the past, they were thwarted by leadership.\u201dHangwani Mulaudzi, a spokesman for the police\u2019s priority crimes directorate, declined to comment on the charges, saying that his office would issue a statement Monday.Last week, Mr. Zuma traveled to South Africa from Dubai \u2014 where he lives in a luxury apartment purchased with help from the Guptas \u2014 to attend the funeral of his brother Vusi Nhlakanipho. He was detained briefly at the airport after his arrival on Thursday.Later this week Mr. Zuma will appear in court on unrelated culpable homicide charges: in 2014 he crashed his Porsche into a taxi in Johannesburg, killing two people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From the Poker Table to Wall Street", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTPORT, Conn. \u2014 There is almost nothing on Vanessa Selbst\u2019s tidy, unadorned desk on the second floor of this suburban office building that would suggest its occupant is the most successful female player in the history of professional poker except, perhaps, a neat stack of $5 bills to the left of her three monitors.That\u2019s a collection she has taken from her colleagues at Bridgewater Associates, the hedge fund where Ms. Selbst has worked since last fall, for a gambling guessing game she has introduced to the office on the arguable premise that it somehow might help sharpen their strategic acuity.For a 34-year-old whose nights and days used to be consumed by endless hours grinding at felt tables in casinos from Barcelona to Melbourne, it is evidence that she really can find action anywhere. \u201cI do try to get people gambling as often as I can,\u201d Ms. Selbst said, chuckling.Her bosses at Bridgewater clearly don\u2019t mind; a faux-hawk-sporting poker champ with a Yale law degree probably makes perfect sense for a firm guided by Ray Dalio, Bridgewater\u2019s chief executive, and his philosophy of assembling teams of disparate, iconoclastic people and seeing what happens.Ms. Selbst\u2019s decision to shed her PokerStars hoodie and submit to a 9-to-5 routine in suburban Connecticut is, in many ways, just another surprising choice for a woman known for making unconventional calls.After all, she first came to the notice of the wider poker world in 2006 for a disastrous bluff at her first final table of a World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas. (She went all in with a 5 and a 2 against, it turned out, a pair of aces.) She eventually won $101,000 and seventh place in that contest, but that bust gained her a reputation \u2014 bolstered later by several other awe-inspiringly successful or horrifically failed bluffs now central to her YouTube fame \u2014 as a reckless aggressor.\u201cI\u2019m also anticapitalist at heart,\u201d she added, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t really fit in with my values, I guess.\u201dNow, she said in an interview, she sees it both as a more stable lifestyle as she and her wife expect their first child in October and as an intellectually stimulating challenge.But even more than that, Ms. Selbst said, it\u2019s a means to an end, that end being making as much money as she can as quickly as she can to help finance the progressive causes she supports. She has long been an active philanthropist; her charitable foundation, Venture Justice, for instance, pays for a two-year fellowship for a lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund through a program organized by Equal Justice Works. She has also raised $500,000 for the Urban Justice Center via an annual charity poker tournament and served for a time on that organization\u2019s board.\u201cAm I going and working with clients in prison? No, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re investing money and we\u2019re making money, and that\u2019s important,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who earned her law degree in 2012 and worked part time in recent years for a police-misconduct litigation firm. \u201cHopefully, if I\u2019m good at this and I do well, then that\u2019s probably the most efficient way for me to support the causes that I care about.\u201dMs. Selbst\u2019s pivot also reflects her gimlet-eyed view of poker today.In the early 2000s, she was among the flood of players inspired to play by the 1998 film \u201cRounders\u201d and the out-of-nowhere $2.5 million World Series of Poker championship win in 2003 by a Tennessee accountant and online player, Chris Moneymaker. (Yes, his real name.) Curious, Ms. Selbst started playing online and built her account up to $150,000 by the time she graduated from Yale with a political science degree.After graduation, she worked as a management consultant in the New York office of McKinsey & Company, but the cards kept calling her back.\u201cI was playing poker for one-third the amount of time and making three times as much money,\u201d said Ms. Selbst, who splits her time between the Brooklyn home she shares with her wife and a Westport residence near the Bridgewater offices. \u201cI was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ve got to give this a shot.\u2019\u201dFor elite poker players, it was a golden age. Ms. Selbst found it easy to reliably haul in $500,000 in profit annually \u2014 and often a lot more. More recently, though, an industry of instructional videos and books on how to win has fueled a steep rise in good players even as the available money has remained the same.\u201cYou have no job security, no health insurance. You\u2019re traveling constantly. You have no stability in terms of your life,\u201d Ms. Selbst explained. \u201cAnd there are huge swings because if more people now have a chance to win, it\u2019s very easy to have a losing year.\u201dThe lifestyle was also hard on her wife, Miranda Selbst, who oversees a joint venture between the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Department of Education to improve learning at low-achieving elementary schools.\u201cA lot of poker spouses are put in the awkward position of having to give up their passions to just support this other person,\u201d Miranda Selbst, 37, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain to your friends at home who have 9-to-5 jobs and think you are on vacation all the time. People don\u2019t really know how lonely and boring that can feel.\u201dVanessa Selbst was introduced to Bridgewater by a pro-poker friend, Galen Hall, who left the circuit in 2011 to earn an M.B.A. at Stanford before the hedge firm hired him. As Ms. Selbst expressed frustrations with both poker and her ability to effectuate more good in the world, Mr. Hall urged her to visit Bridgewater.\u201cIf something\u2019s undervalued, does that mean you want to buy? Well, maybe, but if you buy it, how\u2019s it going to go up? Who are the other people who are going to buy? What are they thinking about? What\u2019s their motivations?\u201d she said, offering an analysis that could fit either an investment or a poker hand. \u201cYou have to be thinking about who the other players are and what they\u2019re going to do.\u201dFor now, Ms. Selbst is far too junior at Bridgewater to have a pivotal role in big decisions. She admitted, too, to having struggled through the firm\u2019s intensive nine-month crash course on economics and the company\u2019s trading philosophy. Her poker success relied largely on exploiting a personal image of being intimidating and terse; at Bridgewater, she discovered, she must be approachable and collaborative.\u201cIt was really hard initially, and I wasn\u2019t doing well at all, so it was less about wanting to be the star and more just not being used to doing poorly at something,\u201d she said. \u201cMy defensive mechanism kicked in, and so then people were like, \u2018You\u2019re really defensive.\u2019\u201dAt Bridgewater, she said, she has learned to tame that, but her more obstinate persona re-emerged this month when she was mocked for busting on a wild bluff the first day of the World Series of Poker\u2019s $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Hold \u2019Em Main Event in Las Vegas. (Despite her retirement, Ms. Selbst intends to play in occasional high-profile tournaments.)Mr. Hall, 32, pointed to Ms. Selbst\u2019s counterintuitive play the day before in explaining why she\u2019ll do well in her new job.\u201cHere\u2019s somebody who has won a ton of poker tournaments, so obviously she knows what the standard play is, but she does something different and you say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 instead of taking five seconds to think about what this hyper-intelligent, hyper-successful person is doing,\u201d he said of her critics. \u201cAt Bridgewater, what\u2019s really valuable is people who can think extremely independently.\u201dMs. Selbst expressed relief \u201cthat this is not my life anymore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very insular world,\u201d she said of poker. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to come back and play and see people, but it\u2019s also really nice to know I have somewhere else to get back to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Expected to Name David Solomon as Successor to C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoldman Sachs is expected to name its president, David M. Solomon, as its next chief executive early this week, according to people briefed on the plan. The announcement would formally establish Mr. Solomon as the successor to Lloyd C. Blankfein as one of the most powerful executives on Wall Street.Mr. Blankfein, who presided over record earnings during his 12 years atop Goldman, will stay on for an interim period. Anointing Mr. Solomon, however, most likely makes it easier for him to put his future lieutenants in place.The announcement could be made as soon as Monday, according to people briefed on the plan who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.It was not clear what prompted Goldman, which is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, to decide that it would formalize its succession plan in midsummer.Mr. Blankfein, 63, led the firm through the 2008 financial crisis and reshaped its business model following the downturn. Now, the executive who once joked that he would die at his desk will turn over leadership of a firm that, despite its immense profits, is still adjusting.Mr. Solomon is a longtime investment banker who spent his formative years as a manager at Bear Stearns, where he helped run the bank\u2019s junk bonds division. He joined Goldman as a partner in 1999 to work with its leveraged finance team and in 2006 he was named co-head of its investment bank. He held that job for the next decade before being named co-president of Goldman late in 2016. A little over a year later, he was named sole president and, with that, became the likely successor to Mr. Blankfein.Mr. Solomon has said that priorities for the firm include working toward gender parity among its employees and improving the coordination between different divisions that serve the same clients. He has also been a big proponent of the firm\u2019s nascent push into consumer banking, Goldman officials say.Mr. Solomon, who works on strategy and deals with top executives at companies like Walt Disney Company, Uber and 3M, comes from one of the firm\u2019s mainstay divisions. But his personal interests, which include a side gig as an electronic dance music D.J., would make him an unconventional bank chief executive.Reached on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Solomon declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Announces Progress on Cost-Cutting, but Risks Still Lurk", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe General Electric plan is set. The company said last month that it would shrink to just three major operations: jet engines, electric power generators and wind turbines.Now, investors and analysts are focused on the performance of those industrial businesses and whether the company can avoid further nasty surprises in its trouble-prone finance arm.General Electric\u2019s second-quarter results, which were announced on Friday, showed that the company is making progress in cutting costs and that its aviation business is thriving. But it has not yet reversed its fortunes and halted its decline, as its ailing power-generation unit in particular continues to contract.G.E. reported a 30 percent falloff in net profit to $615 million. After an adjustment for one-time charges, the preferred yardstick of Wall Street analysts, the company reported earnings of 19 cents a share. That was slightly higher than analysts\u2019 average forecast of 17 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue for the quarter rose 3 percent to $30.1 billion, somewhat above the consensus Wall Street estimate of $29.3 billion.In a conference call with analysts, John Flannery, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, said the second-quarter report contained signs of \u201csignificant progress,\u201d including expenses being trimmed by $1.1 billion so far this year against a target of more than $2 billion for the full year. Yet he cautioned that 2018 would be \u201ca reset year\u201d in a longer campaign of corporate renewal.\u201cThe path is clear,\u201d said Mr. Flannery, who became chief executive last August. But he also observed that it would be \u201ca multiyear transformational journey.\u201dIn an interview, Jamie Miller, G.E.\u2019s chief financial officer, said she expected a strong and improving performance across the company\u2019s industrial businesses, except the power unit, in the second half of 2018. Still, G.E. tempered some expectations for the year, saying that profit and cash flow would be toward the low end of the company\u2019s previous forecasts.After the report, G.E. shares declined by more than 4 percent. The value of the company\u2019s shares has been cut in half in the past year.Any turnaround at the company will probably require \u201ca long, hard slog,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS.Since he took over, Mr. Flannery has been cutting costs and shedding operations in a push to create a \u201csimpler and stronger\u201d company.The three remaining businesses \u2014 aviation, power and renewable energy \u2014 accounted for 60 percent of the company\u2019s $122 billion in revenue last year.The jet engine division remains a powerhouse for G.E. In the second quarter, its revenue rose 13 percent, to $7.5 billion, and its operating profit increased 7 percent, to $1.5 billion. Even a cyclical dip in its profit margins was a sign of strength. Margins slipped as the company invested to expand production of its jet engines to meet brisk demand.The health care business also had a solid quarter. Sales increased 6 percent, to $5 billion, and profit rose 12 percent, to $926 million. The division makes equipment that includes M.R.I. machines and products that aid cellular technology research.The big weakness in G.E.\u2019s industrial portfolio is its large power-generation business. It has cutting-edge technology, analysts say.But the power division badly misjudged a decline in demand, far more than its competitors did. The depth of the problem became apparent shortly after Mr. Flannery took over.The power-generation business continued its decline in the second quarter. Revenue fell 19 percent, to $7.6 billion, and operating profit dropped 58 percent to $421 million.\u201cG.E. now has one bad business, and it\u2019s going to take time to fix it, two or three years,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Another problem for G.E. is the uncertainty surrounding its finance unit, GE Capital. It has been pared back sharply in recent years, an initiative begun by Mr. Flannery\u2019s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt.At its peak, when the financial crisis hit, GE Capital had assets of more than $600 billion. That total is now down to about $136 billion, but there are lingering risks.This year, the company took a multibillion-dollar charge and set aside $15 billion to pay for obligations in GE Capital, mainly related to long-term-care policies. The company is also in talks with the Justice Department to settle claims that some of its mortgage-lending practices violated the law.GE Capital remained a drag on the company\u2019s performance, reducing G.E.\u2019s earnings by $207 million in the quarter. For the year, the company said the finance business should break even.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lighting the Way Toward a New Career", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "EntrepreneurshipThe sculptor Margit Wittig finds a new outlet for her art: lamps. And now it has turned into a growing business.Supported byFor Ms. Wittig \u2014 whose lamps also reside in a suite at the Berkeley Hotel in London and at the nearby 20 Grosvenor Square (the first stand-alone Four Seasons-serviced residence) \u2014 success still feels new. Particularly because her art, which was just a hobby filling every corner of her apartment five years ago, is now filling the homes of her clients.Born and raised in West Germany, Ms. Wittig, 52, has always been artistic; as a child, she would cast Christmas ornaments out of wax and sculpt finger puppets. But rather than pursue art, she trained and worked as a physiotherapist.It was in 1998, when she followed her husband at the time to Chicago with their 1-year-old son, that her interest in art re-emerged. Every day, while her toddler napped in his stroller, she walked through the galleries and sculpture garden of the Art Institute of Chicago.\u201cI was drawn to the three-dimensional arts and abstract paintings, but in particular to sculptures by Brancusi and Giacometti,\u201d Ms. Wittig recalled. She added that later she would learn that Giacometti and his brother made lamps in the 1930s and \u201940s to survive.But it was the family\u2019s move to London in 2001, followed by the birth of her second child, and then a divorce, that led her to sign up first for a sculpting course and then a metals course.\u201cIt felt like an outlet for my creativity while I was being a full-time single mother,\u201d Ms. Wittig said of the figurines she had begun sculpting in an East London studio, inspired by her knowledge of the human form as a former physiotherapist.Then, one day, she began stacking her sculpted heads on floor lamps with other shapes of resin and glass. As they took over her apartment (along with abstract paintings she had begun to create on huge canvases), friends started buying them.\u201cBut then someone I didn\u2019t know wanted to buy a lamp,\u201d she said.Enter Ms. Wittig\u2019s friend Emma Bleasdale, a business development consultant with a background in finance. As Ms. Bleasdale recently recalled, \u201cI said to her, \u2018Do you want this to be a hobby or a business?\u2019\u201d When Ms. Wittig answered, \u201cBusiness,\u201d they got to work, creating a website and an Instagram account and pricing her lamps appropriately. (Today, her floor lamps start at $4,900 and a table lap at $3,500.)The next goal was to get them noticed by interior designers. In the spring of 2013, they moved all the furniture out of her living and dining rooms and into her children\u2019s bedrooms, to make the apartment look like a gallery.\u201cThen, we invited some 30 people in the industry to see the lamps,\u201d Ms. Wittig said.The idea worked. Not only did it lead to coverage on social media, but that night, one designer gave Kit Kemp\u2019s email address to Ms. Wittig, who reached out. Within 24 hours, Ms. Kemp, whose company owns eight upscale boutique hotels in London and two in New York, had emailed back asking if Ms. Wittig could come by with the lamps the next week.\u201cWhen I saw a picture, I knew immediately they would be perfect for the Anrep Room, where I needed strong pieces to create a story,\u201d Ms. Kemp said of the two lamps she placed there, each adorned with a sculpted male separated from a sculpted female head by black and gold-leaf resin shapes. Ms. Kemp now hopes to include Ms. Wittig\u2019s lamps in some rooms she is designing for Bergdorf Goodman, as well as other projects.Another major client is Finchatton, which has designed, managed and financed more than 60 major development projects around the world. \u201cShe is a true artisan, and her work enhances any space,\u201d Charlotte Maverley, a senior designer with the company, said of Ms. Wittig.Ms. Wittig is about to move into a larger studio in London to accommodate her growing portfolio. She recently expanded her line to include mirrors, tables and her artwork. (One painting now decorates the wall of an atelier in Tokyo, and a show of her paintings is planned for next year.)\u201cAm I an artist or am I a furniture designer?\u201d Ms. Wittig asked, saying her work is best described as \u201cfunctional art.\u201d She added, \u201cI feel like an artist, but am willing to let my clients decide.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the museum where the artist Margit Wittig once spent time. It was the Art Institute of Chicago, not the Chicago Institute of Art.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Most Soccer-Mad City, Excluded From the World Cup", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKRASNODAR, Russia \u2014 Sitting in a limestone-clad amphitheater, filled with fans watching the Uruguay-France game on a giant screen last Friday, Daniil Shmatkov lamented that this or some other World Cup match was not happening in his hometown.\u201cOf course we deserved it, Krasnodar is a city of soccer,\u201d Shmatkov said, sitting in a white team England jersey only a few hundred feet from the city\u2019s stylish new stadium.\u201cThe atmosphere would be cool, fans would fill the city,\u201d added Shmatkov, 20. \u201cWe love soccer, but this time we have missed it.\u201dThe 2018 World Cup, which closes with matches in St. Petersburg and Moscow this week, has visited 11 Russian cities this summer, a sprawling tour of the country that stretched from Kaliningrad on the Baltic to Sochi on the Black Sea to Yekaterinburg, in the shadow of the Urals. But it skipped Krasnodar, arguably Russia\u2019s most soccer-mad city, and to those who live here, that decision still makes little sense.The stadium, the park, and an ultramodern soccer academy form a vast complex, all of it financed by Galitsky, who made his fortune in retail and who has embarked on an ambitious plan to revolutionize Russian soccer culture.Krasnodar, one of the fastest-growing cities in Russia\u2019s south, was on the proposed host cities list but was removed at the last moment in 2012. Among others, it lost to the city of Saransk, with a population of 314,000 and a scant soccer following.KubanKrasnodarrussiaBlack SeaSochirussiaMoscowkazakh.Area of detail50 milesBy The New York TimesMany locals were bewildered, pointing to the fact that Krasnodar is the only Russian city outside Moscow that had two soccer teams in the country\u2019s top league \u2014 Mr. Galitsky\u2019s Krasnodar and the municipal Kuban, one of the oldest teams in Russia.Stung by the criticism, the Russian authorities went on the defensive, explaining that the final selection had been made by FIFA. They also said that the city of Sochi, which belongs to the same Krasnodar region, already had a stadium, built for the Winter Olympics. And Vitaly L. Mutko, Russia\u2019s sports minister at the time, said that with the capacity of 34,000 spectators, the Krasnodar stadium simply was not big enough.Locals pointed to Krasnodar\u2019s notoriously clogged roads, a direct effect of a village turning into a city of one million, as the reason the city was left out. Others said that the World Cup might have been the opportunity to mitigate the traffic problem by building new highways.But they also whisper that there might have been a more apparent explanation that the authorities were not ready to reveal: Krasnodar\u2019s stadium might have cast too big a shadow over the other new facilities. Also, by excluding Krasnodar, the state had to build one more stadium, spending more public money.The difference between a facility financed by hundreds of Galitsky\u2019s millions and those built on state or regional budgets can be seen with the naked eye. Clad in Italian travertine, Krasnodar\u2019s resembles the Coliseum. Inside, a panoramic screen, one of the largest in Europe, wraps the walls above the stands.Some of the other World Cup stadiums, in contrast, look grand from a distance, but yellow lawns, crumbling concrete floors, and inexpensive materials are among the more obvious flaws, even as the construction budgets were around the same as the $316 million or so spent in Krasnodar.Though the Krasnodar stadium was not built for the World Cup and played no part in the Confederations Cup, Infantino\u2019s enthusiasm was not unique. Whenever people visit Galitsky\u2019s soccer academy here \u2014 Spain lived and trained at the facility during the World Cup \u2014 they show nothing but \u201castonishment,\u201d said Maksim A. Savostin, its sporting director.\u201cMany people when they hear about Krasnodar think that this is just some small city,\u201d Savostin said. \u201cIt is when they come here that they understand how unique this project is.\u201dYet Galitsky\u2019s push for the game was so intense at times that some in Krasnodar began to oppose it \u2014 yet another sign of the city\u2019s vibrant soccer culture. Vyacheslav A. Bogoroditsky, a devoted fan of F.C. Kuban, the city\u2019s other Russian league team, said he had not been to the new stadium and the park surrounding it, and that he doesn\u2019t recognize even the existence of Galitsky\u2019s Krasnodar, which was founded in 2008 \u2014 80 years after Kuban, which had to declare bankruptcy in May.\u201cSome people are interested in comfort at the stadium, in having a bottle of Coke and a pack of popcorn,\u201d said Bogoroditsky, a lawyer by profession. \u201cFormally for me, such a soccer club as Krasnodar does not exist.\u201dKrasnodar\u2019s fans say that there was no other way for Galitsky to move forward with his ambitious plan than by defying traditions and starting from scratch.\u201cYou cannot do this together with the regional administration, they have their own ambitions,\u201d said Yevgeny P. Rudenko, a local entrepreneur, sitting in a bar with jerseys of some of Krasnodar\u2019s most successful players hanging on the walls.Yet soccer fans across the divide in this city get united in their bitterness that Krasnodar was excluded from the world\u2019s biggest sporting party.For Lera M. Lisyanskaya, another Kuban fan, the bankruptcy of her favorite team came at around the same time when she realized how much did her native city miss out without the World Cup.\u201cI was in Rostov-on-Don on the eve of a match day and saw all these foreigners, all these fans,\u201d Mrs. Lisyanskaya, 20, said. \u201cThe atmosphere was completely different than at a Russian Premier League game,\u201d she added.\u201cIt was so cool and it would be really interesting to have this in our own city.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Is Said to Open Tax Inquiry Into Trump Foundation", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has opened an investigation into whether the Donald J. Trump Foundation violated state tax laws, a move that could lead to a criminal referral for possible prosecution, according to two state officials familiar with the inquiry.The attorney general\u2019s lawsuit accused the foundation of violating campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegally coordinating with the Trump presidential campaign. It seeks to dissolve the foundation, recover millions of dollars in restitution and temporarily bar President Trump and three of his children from serving in leadership positions at any nonprofit operating in New York.A criminal inquiry could reveal additional information beyond the scope of the lawsuit, such as the president\u2019s tax returns. If the investigation found possible criminal activity, it could then refer its findings to a law enforcement agency, such as the state attorney general\u2019s office or a district attorney. That agency could present the findings to a grand jury, according to the two officials, both senior members of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect an active investigation.Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a vigorous Democratic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, has been under pressure to issue a criminal referral to Ms. Underwood, without which she cannot independently initiate a criminal case.But the attorney general\u2019s office has suggested that it may not be interested in pursuing a criminal investigation at the moment. In filing the lawsuit last month, the office also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, including potential criminal charges.A criminal referral could, in fact, be counterproductive to the attorney general\u2019s lawsuit, by giving Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers reason to seek a stay in the civil case and thus delay those proceedings.\u201cWe continue to evaluate the evidence to determine what additional actions may be warranted, and will seek a criminal referral from the appropriate state agency as necessary,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, the communications director for Ms. Underwood.It is too early to say whether the tax department\u2019s findings would be referred to the attorney general or a district attorney, one of the Cuomo administration officials said.In the past, when the state attorney general\u2019s office has brought tax-related criminal actions, they have typically related to issues such as tax evasion. And while New York\u2019s tax department refers about 10 cases to law enforcement each month, those referrals have typically gone to district attorneys, rather than the attorney general.And Mr. Cuomo has made attacking Mr. Trump a centerpiece of his rhetoric in recent months, promising a host of lawsuits against the president\u2019s policies and denouncing him in speech after speech.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trying to Flip the House, ZIP Code by ZIP Code", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEthan Todras-Whitehill, executive director of the nascent political action group Swing Left, stood near the staircase inside the lobby of the St. James Theater in Manhattan, home of the musical \u201cFrozen.\u201d It was a Tuesday afternoon in mid-June, and the bearded Mr. Todras-Whitehill was dressed in jeans and a blue blazer, as well as a new shirt bought earlier that day at H & M after the one he\u2019d been wearing was deemed unacceptable for television. (There was a crew from MSNBC in attendance.)Mr. Todras-Whitehill seemed unbothered by the subtle change in attire. Since he and two close friends \u2014 none of whom then worked in politics \u2014 led the formal launch of Swing Left in January 2017 with the aim of flipping the House of Representatives to Democratic control in the 2018 midterms, Mr. Todras-Whitehill has quickly acclimated to his newfound prominence in the world of grass-roots politics.Swing Left\u2019s mission of identifying 78 swing districts, 23 of which would have to be flipped in order to return the Democrats to power in the House, has found a receptive audience. The group has more than 400,000 members and has raised more than $9 million in donations so far.\u201cI like the fact that they come from outside politics,\u201d said Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief and Cond\u00e9 Nast creative director, an early supporter of the group. (At one point, another attendee at the St. James event, the actor Mandy Patinkin, whirled around to take a picture of Ms. Wintour on his smartphone.) \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have very good hearts and are super smart, but they\u2019ve been doing it in the same way for a long time.\u201dIn some ways, Swing Left\u2019s strategy is strictly a numbers game. The group did not vet or support specific candidates based on a set of issues. Instead, it decided to raise money earmarked for whoever won the Democratic primaries in targeted districts, keeping the contributions in escrow \u2014 in so-called district funds \u2014 until general election campaigns began. Mr. Todras-Whitehill wondered whether it was even possible to raise money if the group did not know the identities of the candidates it would ultimately support. Swing Left\u2019s lawyers assured him it was.\u201cYou turn the music off and you have a lot of people who had been drinking,\u201d Ms. Lim said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, when the speeches started, \u201ceveryone just listened. I don\u2019t know if it was an \u2018A-Ha\u2019 moment, but people were engaged.\u201d\u201cI felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want to bother people,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sedgwick said. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not really bothering them. I\u2019m passing along something that\u2019s crucially important for the future of our country.\u2019\u201dIn many ways Swing Left is modeled less on a political organization than on a Silicon Valley start-up. Its founders saw a need for a product \u2014 one that allowed people to easily identify their nearest swing district by simply typing in their ZIP code and seeing what nearby races they might want to get involved in.In a glassy conference room inside a midtown WeWork space the day following the St. James gathering, Mr. Todras-Whitehill, 37, asked, \u201cWhat do tech start-ups focus on?\u201d and then answered his own question. \u201cThey focus on having a clean, appealing product that fills the need of the user,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd one of the big innovations is thinking about our user \u2014 our volunteers as we call them \u2014 almost as a customer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s built into our DNA from the very beginning.\u201d (Swing Left identifies districts to target through a variety of factors including 2016 results, polling, past presidential elections and demographic and geographic indicators.)What began as an all-volunteer organization now has 25 full-time staff members, including one who deals with human resources issues. Two of the original founders have since left the organization, and a professional political organizer has been brought on board: Matt Ewing, a former national field director for MoveOn.org, who is now the group\u2019s chief community officer.It goes without saying that it didn\u2019t take much for Mr. Todras-Whitehill and the others from Swing Left to win over the audience. After the event, sitting in the darkened theater, Mr. Roth joked the location and crowd wasn\u2019t just blue, but \u201cnavy blue\u201d bordering on \u201ccerulean.\u201dMr. Todras-Whitehill\u2019s involvement began on the morning of November 9, 2016, in a coffee shop in Amherst, Mass., close to where he now lives. As he thought about the election results the day before, he began to focus on the midterms two years later. He knew there would be little chance of retaking the Senate in 2018, given how few Republican seats would be at risk, and instead turned his attention toward the House.But the 2016 election results made getting involved feel more urgent, and Mr. Todras-Whitehill began looking for his nearest swing district. With some effort he found it. He then wondered why he had to do that much work. Where was the app?And that was the start. Mr. Todras-Whitehill reached out to a high school friend from his Upper West Side childhood, Joshua Krafchin, an entrepreneur, and his wife Miriam Stone, a branding strategist, both now living in the Bay Area. The couple quickly signed on.They thought about potential names, like \u201cAdopt-a-District\u201d and \u201cMake America Blue Again\u201d before settling on \u201cSwing Left.\u201d\u201cIt sounded like a movement,\u201d Mr. Todras-Whitehill said. \u201cAt that moment in time, we needed more than just a tool. We needed a movement.\u201dWith a cadre of a dozen friends from technology, marketing and media, they developed a website to fill a need they saw lacking: An easy apparatus to let people know which nearby congressional seats could possibly change from red to blue, and potential opportunities to make that happen.For instance, let\u2019s say you type in 80203, a ZIP code in the reliably blue enclave of Denver, Colo. What pops up is a map of the neighboring 6th District, anchored by Aurora, currently held by the Republican congressman Mike Coffman, along with the information that while Mr. Coffman \u201cwon this district by only 31,254 votes (8.3 percent)\u201d in 2016, it was also carried by Hillary Clinton that year and thus should be in play for 2018. (Says the site: \u201cDemocrat Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger and tireless advocate for veterans, can flip this critical seat!\u201d)Though some wanted their site, to go up as soon as possible, Ms. Finocchi preached patience. She had gone to college at Columbia University with Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone and saw Swing Left as an opportunity to act on her frustration over the 2016 vote. But, with most of the others, Ms. Finocchi had no experience in politics, having worked mostly in fashion and the arts.\u201cKnowing people were going to be thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Finocchi, said of the inauguration, \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s give people something to talk about the day before.\u2019\u201dThey had initially hoped to sign up 20,000 people by the end of March. Within a matter of days, however, that number had reached 200,000. This came about thanks to Twitter posts by celebrities like Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, and hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook. Roughly 10,000 people offered up their professional skills and expertise as a way of assisting the group. (Swing Left is technically a \u201cHybrid PAC,\u201d an organization that the Center for Responsive Politics, defines as having \u201cthe ability to operate both as a traditional political action committee, contributing funds to a candidate\u2019s committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures.\u201d)The group was something very real now, something that needed shape and structure. Also it didn\u2019t help that two of Swing Left\u2019s founders \u2014 Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone \u2014 had their second child soon after the organization began, forcing them to retreat from full-time leadership roles.Over the next few months, Swing Left began to build upon that initial fervor. On February 12, 2017, the group held a conference call that drew registrations from 17,000 people. The group encouraged the formation of house parties in different districts \u2014 the first round of which generated 700 across the country.But as Swing Left grew, it also had challenges with staffing. The organization could no longer have people exist in a quasi-volunteer role when the demands on their time demanded real salaries. In late March 2017, Swing Left established a \u201cDonate\u201d button on its home page. To date, Swing Left has raised over $9 million, half of which has been designated to candidates via district funds, with the rest allocated for a massive get-out-the vote effort this fall. That includes the funding of full-time staff salaries that range from roughly $4,000 to $10,000 per month.\u201cIt was a relief to feel that we could put aside our other obligations and make this our full-time focus,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cWe\u2019d all been burning the midnight oil because we had other responsibilities. It was great to be able to go back to my family and say, \u2018That thing? Now it\u2019s my job.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Manufacturers, a Complex Mix Can Determine Location", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Saunders had an unlikely path to becoming a manufacturer.But he was an entrepreneur at heart and had an interest in competitive riflery. He wanted to produce a rifle target that would reset automatically without requiring a sports shooter to venture into the firing range.With some success selling it to military and government agencies, he and his wife moved to Larchmont, N.Y., where he had more room for his equipment.But he knew he needed even more space to become a full-time manufacturer.Despite his years in New York, Mr. Saunders said he was \u201cin hog heaven\u201d building out his manufacturing business, which now concentrates on making fixture plates. He employs six people and has revenues nearing \u201cseven figures,\u201d he said.While Mr. Saunders\u2019 path had some unique twists and turns, it was not completely atypical.Rural manufacturers often stay in their original location because of historic roots, according to Steven Deller, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in economic growth and development patterns.But the rural labor force is not necessarily less expensive.Bob Hess, a vice chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, the global real estate company, explained that labor costs were no longer significantly lower in rural parts of the country.The change is most often the result of a need to hire workers with higher skills than in the past or to entice them to commute longer distances or even relocate.One defense industry client, whom he declined to name, was based in the Los Angeles area and sought to move a new line to a pre-existing Kentucky plant, but found that the California wages were equivalent \u2014 or in some instances slightly lower \u2014 than those in Kentucky, he said.While the cost of complying with California\u2019s strict pollution laws could have tilted the balance, the overall costs of relocation resulted in the company\u2019s decision to expand in its West Coast location instead of moving.These variations make the calculus of factory location difficult, whether the manufacturer wants to expand or cut costs. Site selection can also depend on the industry.Companies working in the energy industry might cluster in more rural areas in Texas or Louisiana, for example. Other influential factors include where the manufacturer is in the supply chain.Food companies often choose to be near their suppliers because of concerns about perishability and the expense of shipping, said Sarah Low of the Economic Research Service of the Agriculture Department.Others who ship globally may focus on proximity to transportation hubs. \u201cUltimately, location is not dependent on whether the manufacturers want to be in a rural or urban area. It\u2019s where they need to be.\u201dEssentially, Mr. Deller said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a start-up manufacturer, it may make more sense to be in an urban area where you have more access to infrastructure as well as industry clusters and thicker labor markets. But the disadvantage is the cost of operation.\u201dWhen it sought to expand, it chose rural Hamlet, N.C., at the behest of a customer. \u201cOne of our customers is in that area, and we were shipping to them from Erie,\u201d said Don Prischak, vice president for sales and marketing at the Plastek Group. \u201cThe cost to the customer was $4 million to $5 million per year, and they wanted us to be closer to save the transportation costs.\u201dPlastek\u2019s solution was to buy a plant in rural North Carolina and invest $10 million to $15 million to develop the site into a fully automated factory, Mr. Prischak said.Apart from historical location, work force availability sometimes drives site selection. With low unemployment and a need for highly skilled employees, competition can be fierce for a relatively small pool of potential workers.Yet, while urban manufacturers may be able to find a larger pool of skilled workers, clusters of related industries sometimes can result in higher wages and the ability of workers to leave one company for another that pays more.The work force shortfall can disproportionately affect smaller manufacturers. To fulfill orders, some, like Dana Jordan, the chief executive of the Cascade Rescue Company in Sandpoint, Idaho, which makes search-and-rescue equipment, have employees work longer hours until they can hire more people.Manufacturers are also watching the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and their effect on costs. The often thin margins of smaller companies can be wiped out if costs rise, but cannot be offset by higher sales prices.For small manufacturers, no matter where they are, volatility is especially troublesome. Many factory owners rely on predictable expenses, and sudden spikes can cause disruption to a consistent cash flow.Other problems can arise when factories have been located \u2014 and grown \u2014 close to a large customer who then retrenches or moves.Mr. Altschuler said the goal was to connect sometimes disparate manufacturers and customers that fills gaps for both.\u201cMany of these companies are second- or third-generation businesses, but they\u2019re scattered throughout the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much capability and capacity, but often there\u2019s no access\u201d to other customers outside of their immediate industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employers\u2019 Hiring Push Brings Workers Off the Bench", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite sharpening trade tensions, a hefty rise in payrolls has provided the latest evidence that the American economy is strong enough to keep pulling benched workers back into action.The number of Americans working part time because of their inability to find a full-time position fell \u2014 as did the number of those too discouraged to bother searching.\u201cI\u2019m really excited to see that the labor force is growing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.Over all, the economy added 213,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent, but Ms. Barrera was unruffled, saying, \u201cThere were some people who weren\u2019t participating in the labor force who are now being encouraged to return.\u201dFor workers, the modest 2.7 percent increase in the average hourly wage over the past year was disappointing; pay raises are a nose behind some measures of inflation. But the slow pace does undercut arguments that the economy is in danger of revving too fast.\u201cThis should take a little bit of pressure off the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of tightening,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, referring to the debate over how quickly to raise benchmark interest rates.\u201cJOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\u201d President Trump said Friday on Twitter after the Labor Department\u2019s data for June was released.For employers, the more immediate challenge has been finding qualified, reliable workers at the going wage rate. In addition to the growing ranks of new job hunters, the quickening competition is giving more employees the confidence to quit in search of a better deal. But the share of prime-age workers participating in the labor force is below the level that prevailed a decade ago. And the number of job openings is striding ahead of the number of workers ready to fill them.\u201cThere\u2019s more jobs than there are people available for jobs \u2014 at every level,\u201d from the factory floor to the executive suite, said Joe Galvin, chief research officer of Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives.Still, as this latest jobs report shows, the lengthening list of help-wanted postings has had only a modest effect on hourly earnings. Several employers said their reluctance to raise prices limited the wages they could offer.Gigi Schweikert, the president and chief operating officer Lightbridge Academy, which operates child care facilities, said the company was moving toward a $15-an-hour minimum over three years, but had to keep its fees affordable.\u201cWe are always looking for job candidates,\u201d she said, acknowledging that her industry is known for high turnover rates, low pay and a predominance of female workers. \u201cWe want to be more aggressive, but we can\u2019t price parents out of the market.\u201dLaid off 11 months ago in Philadelphia, Jim Stallard said he turned down four jobs because \u201cthey were all extremely low paid and didn\u2019t have any benefits.\u201d Mr. Stallard, 57, eventually went to work at a large-format printer for $18 an hour \u2014 far less than the $30 an hour and ample health and retirement benefits he earned previously managing the print and copy shop at Drexel University.\u201cYou just cannot be in this game without being competitive,\u201d Ms. Burke said of salaries.The unemployment rate for blacks also worsened in June from the previous month, rising to 6.5 percent, while the rate among Hispanics improved, falling to 4.6 percent. (Among whites, the jobless rate is 3.5 percent.)Heightening trade tensions are not the only risks over the longer term.As Oxford Economics, an economic research firm, noted in its newsletter, \u201cWhile it may feel like a party in the U.S.A., several risks are building,\u201d including growing consumer debt.Most economists continue to warn that the economic high has been pumped up in part by deep tax cuts financed by ballooning debt.At the moment, though, \u201cthe trends are strong,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan of High Frequency Economics noted, and \u201cthe unemployment rate is going to keep falling.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the value of American tariffs on Chinese goods that went into effect on Friday. It is $34 billion, not $34 million.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

Well-off overachievers are devoting their summer to pursuits like boat building and book writing. And Reed Levine, a physician from Los Angeles, is self-training to be an amateur chef specializing in molecular gastronomy.They\u2019re part of a wave of overachieving taskmasters who are taking a so-called creative hiatus this summer, rather than yet another status vacation to an exclusive hot spot. These roll-up-your-sleeves sabbaticals offer worldly go-getters a fresh laurel in their multi-hyphenate (and, not quite needless to mention, affluent) crowns.\u201cIt\u2019s like my own luxury staycation, except at the end of it I\u2019ll have a boat,\u201d Mr. Preszler, 41, said.It\u2019s also about unplugging and practicing mental self-care. \u201cI\u2019ve committed to vacations in the past and then was thinking about work the whole time and wasn\u2019t fully immersed in the experience,\u201d Mr. Preszler said. \u201cBut in my wood shop, there\u2019s a Zen-like quality to just focusing on one grand mission.\u201dMr. Biren and Mr. Erpelding, who live in Des Moines, have traveled the globe. But this summer they\u2019re grounding themselves to construct \u201cthe Rolls-Royce of enclosures\u201d (as Mr. Biren puts it) for their beloved 20-pound monitor lizard, Vera, complete with a heated pool and basking area. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the Grand Canyon, but we are constantly taking trips to Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot,\u201d Mr. Biren said. \u201cThis is way less stressful than going through an Italian airport. It\u2019s much more bonding. And there\u2019s something meditative about sticking a paintbrush in a can of eco-friendly epoxy and brushing it back and forth.\u201d The men, who call themselves \u201cthe last thing from woodworkers,\u201d see the project as an opportunity for personal growth. \u201cWhat better way to reinvest in yourself than by using power tools?\u201d Mr. Biren said. Such undertakings also offer the ultimate escape fantasy: a chance to slip the surly bonds of social obligations for the entire summer, guilt free.\u201cWe have so many social pressures to be seen and be available 24/7,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong self-care aspect to being able to say, \u2018I\u2019m making this boat my priority because it brings me happiness and contentment.\u2019 It feels liberating.\u201d \u201cI have a hard time saying no, because I don\u2019t like disappointing people or myself,\u201d she said. \u201cFOMO is real, so it\u2019s nice to have a legitimate excuse. Everyone knows I\u2019m working on this big project, completely out of my territory, and I really do have to put everything into it.\u201d That sort of all-encompassing endeavor offers deeper meaning for those eager to test themselves beyond another zip-line course or desert safari. \u201cEven though this project scares me to death, I crave the kind of craziness that comes with trying something new,\u201d Ms. Lieberman said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019ll have to show for it is more rewarding than any vacation photo or shot of me on a waterfall somewhere. This is something I\u2019m building myself.\u201d But these self-imposed summer exiles \u2014 call them the humblebrag of staycations \u2014 are not without their perils. \u201cI really want to go to the Hamptons with my friends today, for instance, but I\u2019m empowered enough to make the choice to stay and write in Red Hook,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more value in being able to say I\u2019m a published author. I\u2019m like a child. I tell myself I can go on vacation next summer.\u201d Not that all creative hiatuses are isolating. Dr. Levine, 40, is a Los Angeles physician who specializes in pain medicine and neurology. But for the next six weeks, his focus is on a 12-course modernist feast that he is fastidiously devising, timetabling and sous-viding for 20 friends (think Parmesan ice cream scooped into prosciutto cones, soups served in edible potato bowls, and a Lilliputian steak dinner).Alexander and Rebecca Lowry, who live in Hamilton, Mass., just outside of Boston, are also in the throes of a big domestic project. In lieu of summer travel or hanging on the beach with friends, they\u2019re tackling a major renovation of their four-bedroom 1964 garrison colonial house.The couple plans to complete their fixer-upper furlough by Labor Day. \u201cInstead of vacation photos, we\u2019ll have before-and-after house photos,\u201d Mr. Lowry said of the project, which he acknowledged is completely outside their wheelhouse. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cyou don\u2019t grow in your comfort zone.\u201dIndeed, for some, the siren song of a challenging sabbatical is habit forming. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a wood-fired Finnish steam sauna in my backyard, so maybe I\u2019ll build that for next summer\u2019s creative hiatus,\u201d Mr. Preszler said. \u201cI mean, why not?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The intensity of the fires has appeared to increase as well; the fires in 2017 were among the most destructive in California\u2019s history, leaving 46 people dead and causing nearly $12 billion in damage.Mike Daw, the executive director of the Firefighters Burn Institute, which works with injured firefighters through the U.C. Davis Burn Unit in Sacramento, said that firefighters often do not report injuries that might sideline them. Those injuries are often exacerbated over time, especially because mutual assistance programs in California mean that firefighters can end up battling fires all over the state.\u201cFirefighters are a unique culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting themselves in danger, and a lot of times they feel like they can endure more than a normal human being can.\u201dMichael Feyh, a captain with the Sacramento Fire Department, said that fatigue and sleep deprivation are significant problems for firefighters and can leave them particularly vulnerable in already dangerous situations.And the emotional trauma after injuries or high-stakes events, he said, is often not discussed enough.\u201cIt\u2019s not just burns, its all the things that come with the trauma \u2014 what people see throughout their careers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get guys to come forward and accept that they could be getting some help and get counseling.\u201dMr. Feyh knows the risks firsthand. In 2010, he sustained second- and third-degree burns on 10 percent to 15 percent of his body, largely around his face, while responding to a report of a gas leak. The house exploded, sending him flying 20 feet and leading to the burns as well as orthopedic injuries that took about a year to heal.\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just the individual, either; we go to work and our families always have in the back of their minds that something can happen,\u201d Mr. Feyh said. \u201cMy wife had her worst nightmare come true.\u201dAshley Iverson lost her husband, Cory, in December while he was fighting the Thomas Fire in Ventura County. Mr. Iverson, a fire apparatus engineer with CalFire, had already worked a 24-hour shift but was helping put out spot fires when he became trapped in a gulch. The fire reached him before he could escape.Thousands honored his sacrifice at a funeral in San Diego, his hometown, just days before Christmas. Ms. Iverson was four months pregnant at the time, and today is caring for their two daughters. Sometimes she is overcome by pain, she said. \u201cHow can I raise my kids without my best friend? Why don\u2019t they get to have him in their lives?\u201dMs. Iverson hopes to turn her husband\u2019s tragic death into something positive. She is laying the groundwork for a foundation in his name that will advocate expanding mental health awareness among fire responders and firefighters. She said she finds comfort in knowing that he had dedicated himself to helping people.\u201cAfter it happened, I took a breath. O.K., the worst has happened. Now what? Where do we go from here?\u201d Ms. Iverson said. \u201cA lot of widows, their life is over. I feel like Cory has given me legs.

{"Headline": "G-20 Finance Ministers, Failing to Halt Trump\u2019s Trade War, Warn of Its Global Risks", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo days of fitful talks at the Group of 20 gathering in the Argentine capital appeared only to raise the odds that the friction will intensify as Mr. Trump threatens more tariffs and other countries vow to retaliate. In their closing statement, or communiqu\u00e9, officials at the G-20 on Sunday pointed to trade tensions as a new risk factor that could depress global growth.\u201cGrowth has been less synchronized recently and downside risks over the short- and medium-term have increased,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said. \u201cThese include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies.\u201dThe International Monetary Fund projected last week that the currently announced tariffs would reduce global economic output by $430 billion, or half a percent, in 2020, if they remained in place and shook investor confidence. It argued that the United States was particularly vulnerable to a slowdown because it would bear the brunt of tariff retaliation from other countries.\u201cI urged once more that trade conflicts be resolved via international cooperation without resort to exceptional measures,\u201d Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, said on Sunday, referring to the message that she delivered to policymakers in meetings.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he disagreed with Ms. Lagarde\u2019s assessment of how the United States would fare. The Trump administration has said the tariffs have hurt certain industries in the United States but, at this point, not the broader economy.\u201cWorld trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle, and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,\u201d said Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister. \u201cWe call on the United States to see sense, to respect the rules of multilateralism and to respect their allies.\u201dMr. Le Maire said Europe would not negotiate \u201cwith a gun to the head.\u201dInternational summit meetings, which once showcased American leadership, have under the Trump administration become awkward affairs in which the United States is increasingly isolated. That remained the case in Argentina, where Mr. Mnuchin traveled on behalf of the United States on a fraught mission of economic diplomacy. Although he said his conversations with other leaders were cordial, he acknowledged that talks on trade were often very \u201cdirect.\u201dOlaf Scholz, the German finance minister, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation, arguing that Europe\u2019s monetary policy is \u201cvery rational\u201d and not geared to create artificial economic success.One of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s goals before the meeting was to encourage the European Union, Japan and other countries to work with the United States to pressure China to change its trade practices. However, the Treasury secretary said that no progress was made on that front in multicountry meetings, and that aside from pleasantries, he had no communication with the Chinese delegation.\u201cAnytime they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a concluding news conference on Sunday.Europe, which is increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump will impose auto tariffs, is taking Mr. Mnuchin up on such an offer this week. European Union officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will travel to Washington for a meeting with Mr. Trump and his economic team in hopes that car tariffs can be avoided.The G-20 meeting also offered the United States an opportunity to jump-start talks with Canada and Mexico about renegotiating Nafta. Mr. Mnuchin and Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s finance minister, expressed hope that such talks could gather momentum now that the Mexican election is over.\u201cMy job is to continue to be optimistic,\u201d Mr. Morneau said, suggesting that he sensed a desire by the United States to preserve the trilateral pact.However, Mr. Morneau added, the United States\u2019 imposition of tariffs has complicated the process. He warned that tariffs would raise prices on Americans and Canadians and that if Mr. Trump levied another round of them, Canada would have no choice but to retaliate again.\u201cThere continues to be anxiety around trade,\u201d he said.Besides trade, officials from the countries discussed issues such as cryptocurrencies, international tax and terrorism financing. Although drafting the communiqu\u00e9 has been a struggle in previous meetings, officials said this one was agreed to with relative ease despite the differences on trade and tariffs.For his part, Mr. Mnuchin pushed back against the premise that the United States had become a pariah in international forums. Participating in more than 20 meetings with his counterparts in two days, the Treasury secretary had little down time in Buenos Aires.\u201cIf requests for meetings is related to popularity, I\u2019m pretty popular here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He added, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel isolated at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smarter Way to Think About Financial Decisions", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s as simple as reframing how you think about your money.For years I had a 401(k) from my first job that sat neglected, quietly collecting meager interest as I willfully ignored it. I wasn\u2019t necessarily scared or intimidated by deciding what to do with it \u2014 roll it over, change the investment allocation, leave it be \u2014 I just never wanted to address it. So I didn\u2019t.Sound familiar?\u201cThere\u2019s something about financial decisions that goes beyond knowledge,\u201d Aner Sela, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Florida whose work focuses on how people make choices, told me. \u201cThey have a unique flavor, and there\u2019s something about that flavor we don\u2019t like. They feel very cold, very abstract and analytical, and it\u2019s something that you just don\u2019t want to do.\u201dMany tend to think that financial decisions require a similarly cold, abstract, analytical mind-set, Professor Sela said. So if we perceive ourselves as the type of people who rely on emotion in our decision-making processes, we\u2019re more inclined to avoid making financial decisions because we think they don\u2019t \u201cfeel like me,\u201d he said.In fact, we\u2019ll avoid making decisions about money even if we think we have the knowledge and ability to do so.\u201cI have a Ph.D. in business and an M.B.A. in finance, on top of a degree in architecture, so I think I can understand financial products pretty well,\u201d Professor Sela said. \u201cBut still, every time I get a letter from my bank, my instinct is to shove it in some drawer.\u201dThe key to getting around those roadblocks is to reframe the way we think about money decisions.\u201cIt\u2019s just a different framing of the same data,\u201d Professor Sela said. \u201cIf you just call it by a different name that brings to mind different things, it certainly makes a difference.\u201dIndeed, Professor Sela found that people were more comfortable making a financial decision after reframing it in lifestyle terms \u2014 for example, a choice about annuities versus a choice about life experiences \u2014 even if the decision was the same in both scenarios.So the next time you\u2019re struggling to do something about your credit report or at a loss for how to go about building your nest egg, think of it as a decision about the type of life you want to have. Future you will thank you.Have a great week!\u2014 TimI dislike being rushed. I leave for the airport early, and I like to be at the movies with time to spare.It\u2019s not because I am a punctual person by nature \u2014 I am not \u2014 but rather because I am both slow and easily stressed. Part of adulthood is knowing oneself, and what I have learned so far is that, under pressure, I am happiest moving at the pace of an arthritic retriever.My boyfriend is the opposite. He loves rushing. The more rushed, the better, he says. He walks at a respectable marathon pace. He loves the thrill of impossibly tight train connections, because it makes him \u201cfeel like Jason Bourne.\u201dFor years, this was a source of tension. Then we discovered the answer: leave at different times. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a head start!\u201d I\u2019ll say, and leave for the restaurant, while my boyfriend is still showering. And then I go, at my pace \u2014 a pace ideal for noticing new storefronts, or attractive dogs \u2014 and he shows up at his pace, and no one is angry or stressed or secretly resentful.When we tell friends about our system, they are often baffled: You leave at \u2026 different times? To go to \u2026 the same place? Yes. That is exactly what we do. And you can, too! It is even (sort of) romantic, in a way. As the old saying goes: If you love something, set it free and then meet it at the movies.Some fights are necessary; what time to leave is not one of them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript: Obama\u2019s Speech Defending Democracy", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn his highest-profile speech since leaving office, former President Barack Obama on Tuesday offered an impassioned defense of democracy and international institutions, including the United Nations and NATO, in a veiled rebuke of his successor, President Trump.Mr. Obama spoke at a cricket stadium in Johannesburg, at an annual event honoring Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid South African leader, who would have turned 100 this week.The following is a transcript of Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, which was provided by his office.________MR. OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you so much.AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!MR. OBAMA: Thank you.To Mama Gra\u00e7a Machel, members of the Mandela family, the Machel family, to President Ramaphosa who you can see is inspiring new hope in this great country, professor, doctor, distinguished guests, to Mama Sisulu and the Sisulu family, to the people of South Africa, it is a singular honor for me to be here with all of you as we gather to celebrate the birth and life of one of history\u2019s true giants.Let me begin by a correction and a few confessions. The correction is that I am a very good dancer. I just want to be clear about that. Michelle is a little better.The confessions. No. 1, I was not exactly invited to be here. I was ordered in a very nice way to be here by Gra\u00e7a Machel.Confession No. 2: I forgot my geography and the fact that right now it\u2019s winter in South Africa. I didn\u2019t bring a coat, and this morning I had to send somebody out to the mall because I am wearing long johns. I was born in Hawaii.Confession No. 3: When my staff told me that I was to deliver a lecture, I thought back to the stuffy old professors in bow ties and tweed, and I wondered if this was one more sign of the stage of life that I\u2019m entering, along with gray hair and slightly failing eyesight. I thought about the fact that my daughters think anything I tell them is a lecture. I thought about the American press and how they often got frustrated at my long-winded answers at press conferences, when my responses didn\u2019t conform to two-minute soundbites.But given the strange and uncertain times that we are in \u2014 and they are strange, and they are uncertain \u2014 with each day\u2019s news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines, I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective. So I hope you\u2019ll indulge me, despite the slight chill, as I spend much of this lecture reflecting on where we\u2019ve been, and how we arrived at this present moment, in the hope that it will offer us a road map for where we need to go next.One hundred years ago, Madiba was born in the village of M \u2014 oh, see there, I always get that \u2014 I got to get my Ms right when I\u2019m in South Africa. Mvezo \u2014 I got it. Truthfully, it\u2019s because it\u2019s so cold my lips stuck.So in his autobiography he describes a happy childhood; he\u2019s looking after cattle, he\u2019s playing with the other boys, eventually attends a school where his teacher gave him the English name Nelson. And as many of you know, he\u2019s quoted saying, \u201cWhy she bestowed this particular name upon me, I have no idea.\u201dThere was no reason to believe that a young black boy at this time, in this place, could in any way alter history. After all, South Africa was then less than a decade removed from full British control. Already, laws were being codified to implement racial segregation and subjugation, the network of laws that would be known as apartheid.Most of Africa, including my father\u2019s homeland, was under colonial rule. The dominant European powers, having ended a horrific world war just a few months after Madiba\u2019s birth, viewed this continent and its people primarily as spoils in a contest for territory and abundant natural resources and cheap labor. And the inferiority of the black race, an indifference towards black culture and interests and aspirations, was a given.And such a view of the world \u2014 that certain races, certain nations, certain groups were inherently superior, and that violence and coercion is the primary basis for governance, that the strong necessarily exploit the weak, that wealth is determined primarily by conquest \u2014 that view of the world was hardly confined to relations between Europe and Africa, or relations between whites and blacks.Whites were happy to exploit other whites when they could. And by the way, blacks were often willing to exploit other blacks. And around the globe, the majority of people lived at subsistence levels, without a say in the politics or economic forces that determined their lives. Often they were subject to the whims and cruelties of distant leaders. The average person saw no possibility of advancing from the circumstances of their birth. Women were almost uniformly subordinate to men. Privilege and status was rigidly bound by caste and color and ethnicity and religion. And even in my own country, even in democracies like the United States, founded on a declaration that all men are created equal, racial segregation and systemic discrimination was the law in almost half the country and the norm throughout the rest of the country.That was the world just 100 years ago. There are people alive today who were alive in that world. It is hard, then, to overstate the remarkable transformations that have taken place since that time. A second World War, even more terrible than the first, along with a cascade of liberation movements from Africa to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, would finally bring an end to colonial rule. More and more peoples, having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism, the repeated mass slaughters of the 20th century, began to embrace a new vision for humanity, a new idea, one based not only on the principle of national self-determination, but also on the principles of democracy and rule of law and civil rights and the inherent dignity of every single individual.In those nations with market-based economies, suddenly union movements developed; and health and safety and commercial regulations were instituted; and access to public education was expanded; and social welfare systems emerged, all with the aim of constraining the excesses of capitalism and enhancing its ability to provide opportunity not just to some but to all people. And the result was unmatched economic growth and a growth of the middle class. And in my own country, the moral force of the civil rights movement not only overthrew Jim Crow laws but it opened up the floodgates for women and historically marginalized groups to reimagine themselves, to find their own voices, to make their own claims to full citizenship.It was in service of this long walk towards freedom and justice and equal opportunity that Nelson Mandela devoted his life. At the outset, his struggle was particular to this place, to his homeland \u2014 a fight to end apartheid, a fight to ensure lasting political and social and economic equality for its disenfranchised nonwhite citizens. But through his sacrifice and unwavering leadership and, perhaps most of all, through his moral example, Mandela and the movement he led would come to signify something larger. He came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all around the world, their hopes for a better life, the possibility of a moral transformation in the conduct of human affairs.Madiba\u2019s light shone so brightly, even from that narrow Robben Island cell, that in the late \u201970s he could inspire a young college student on the other side of the world to re-examine his own priorities, could make me consider the small role I might play in bending the arc of the world towards justice. And when later, as a law student, I witnessed Madiba emerge from prison, just a few months, you\u2019ll recall, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I felt the same wave of hope that washed through hearts all around the world.Do you remember that feeling? It seemed as if the forces of progress were on the march, that they were inexorable. Each step he took, you felt this is the moment when the old structures of violence and repression and ancient hatreds that had so long stunted people\u2019s lives and confined the human spirit \u2014 that all that was crumbling before our eyes.And then as Madiba guided this nation through negotiation painstakingly, reconciliation, its first fair and free elections; as we all witnessed the grace and the generosity with which he embraced former enemies, the wisdom for him to step away from power once he felt his job was complete, we understood that \u2014 we understood it was not just the subjugated, the oppressed who were being freed from the shackles of the past. The subjugator was being offered a gift, being given a chance to see in a new way, being given a chance to participate in the work of building a better world.And during the last decades of the 20th century, the progressive, democratic vision that Nelson Mandela represented in many ways set the terms of international political debate. It doesn\u2019t mean that vision was always victorious, but it set the terms, the parameters; it guided how we thought about the meaning of progress, and it continued to propel the world forward.Yes, there were still tragedies \u2014 bloody civil wars from the Balkans to the Congo. Despite the fact that ethnic and sectarian strife still flared up with heartbreaking regularity, despite all that as a consequence of the continuation of nuclear d\u00e9tente, and a peaceful and prosperous Japan, and a unified Europe anchored in NATO, and the entry of China into the world\u2019s system of trade \u2014 all that greatly reduced the prospect of war between the world\u2019s great powers.And from Europe to Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, dictatorships began to give way to democracies. The march was on. A respect for human rights and the rule of law, enumerated in a declaration by the United Nations, became the guiding norm for the majority of nations, even in places where the reality fell far short of the ideal. Even when those human rights were violated, those who violated human rights were on the defensive.And with these geopolitical changes came sweeping economic changes. The introduction of market-based principles, in which previously closed economies along with the forces of global integration powered by new technologies, suddenly unleashed entrepreneurial talents to those that once had been relegated to the periphery of the world economy, who hadn\u2019t counted. Suddenly they counted. They had some power; they had the possibilities of doing business.And then came scientific breakthroughs and new infrastructure and the reduction of armed conflicts. And suddenly a billion people were lifted out of poverty, and once-starving nations were able to feed themselves, and infant mortality rates plummeted. And meanwhile, the spread of the internet made it possible for people to connect across oceans, and cultures and continents instantly were brought together, and potentially, all the world\u2019s knowledge could be in the hands of a small child in even the most remote village.That\u2019s what happened just over the course of a few decades. And all that progress is real. It has been broad, and it has been deep, and it all happened in what \u2014 by the standards of human history \u2014 was nothing more than a blink of an eye. And now an entire generation has grown up in a world that by most measures has gotten steadily freer and healthier and wealthier and less violent and more tolerant during the course of their lifetimes.It should make us hopeful. But if we cannot deny the very real strides that our world has made since that moment when Madiba took those steps out of confinement, we also have to recognize all the ways that the international order has fallen short of its promise. In fact, it is in part because of the failures of governments and powerful elites to squarely address the shortcomings and contradictions of this international order that we now see much of the world threatening to return to an older, a more dangerous, a more brutal way of doing business.So we have to start by admitting that whatever laws may have existed on the books, whatever wonderful pronouncements existed in constitutions, whatever nice words were spoken during these last several decades at international conferences or in the halls of the United Nations, the previous structures of privilege and power and injustice and exploitation never completely went away. They were never fully dislodged. Caste differences still impact the life chances of people on the Indian subcontinent. Ethnic and religious differences still determine who gets opportunity from the Central Europe to the Gulf. It is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa.And it is also a fact that the accumulated disadvantages of years of institutionalized oppression have created yawning disparities in income, and in wealth, and in education, and in health, in personal safety, in access to credit. Women and girls around the world continue to be blocked from positions of power and authority. They continue to be prevented from getting a basic education. They are disproportionately victimized by violence and abuse. They\u2019re still paid less than men for doing the same work. That\u2019s still happening. Economic opportunity, for all the magnificence of the global economy, all the shining skyscrapers that have transformed the landscape around the world, entire neighborhoods, entire cities, entire regions, entire nations have been bypassed.In other words, for far too many people, the more things have changed, the more things stayed the same. And while globalization and technology have opened up new opportunities, have driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalization has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It\u2019s also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor\u2019s bargaining power. It\u2019s made it easier for capital to avoid tax laws and the regulations of nation-states \u2014 can just move billions, trillions of dollars with a tap of a computer key.And the result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It\u2019s meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, that\u2019s a statistic. Think about that. In many middle-income and developing countries, new wealth has just tracked the old bad deal that people got because it reinforced or even compounded existing patterns of inequality, the only difference is it created even greater opportunities for corruption on an epic scale.And for once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don\u2019t have specialized skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms. In every country, just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries\u2019 political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored.Now, it should be noted that this new international elite, the professional class that supports them, differs in important respects from the ruling aristocracies of old. It includes many who are self-made. It includes champions of meritocracy. And although still mostly white and male, as a group they reflect a diversity of nationalities and ethnicities that would have not existed a hundred years ago. A decent percentage consider themselves liberal in their politics, modern and cosmopolitan in their outlook.Unburdened by parochialism, or nationalism, or overt racial prejudice or strong religious sentiment, they are equally comfortable in New York or London or Shanghai or Nairobi or Buenos Aires, or Johannesburg. Many are sincere and effective in their philanthropy. Some of them count Nelson Mandela among their heroes. Some even supported Barack Obama for the presidency of the United States, and by virtue of my status as a former head of state, some of them consider me as an honorary member of the club. And I get invited to these fancy things, you know? They\u2019ll fly me out.But what\u2019s nevertheless true is that in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. And their decisions \u2014 their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe \u2014 are often done without malice; it\u2019s just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.But too often, these decisions are also made without reference to notions of human solidarity \u2014 or a ground-level understanding of the consequences that will be felt by particular people in particular communities by the decisions that are made. And from their board rooms or retreats, global decision makers don\u2019t get a chance to see sometimes the pain in the faces of laid-off workers. Their kids don\u2019t suffer when cuts in public education and health care result as a consequence of a reduced tax base because of tax avoidance. They can\u2019t hear the resentment of an older tradesman when he complains that a newcomer doesn\u2019t speak his language on a job site where he once worked. They\u2019re less subject to the discomfort and the displacement that some of their countrymen may feel as globalization scrambles not only existing economic arrangements, but traditional social and religious mores.Which is why, at the end of the 20th century, while some Western commentators were declaring the end of history and the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy and the virtues of the global supply chain, so many missed signs of a brewing backlash \u2014 a backlash that arrived in so many forms. It announced itself most violently with 9/11 and the emergence of transnational terrorist networks, fueled by an ideology that perverted one of the world\u2019s great religions and asserted a struggle not just between Islam and the West but between Islam and modernity, and an ill-advised U.S. invasion of Iraq didn\u2019t help, accelerating a sectarian conflict.Russia, already humiliated by its reduced influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, feeling threatened by democratic movements along its borders, suddenly started reasserting authoritarian control and in some cases meddling with its neighbors. China, emboldened by its economic success, started bristling against criticism of its human rights record; it framed the promotion of universal values as nothing more than foreign meddling, imperialism under a new name.Within the United States, within the European Union, challenges to globalization first came from the left but then came more forcefully from the right, as you started seeing populist movements \u2014 which, by the way, are often cynically funded by right-wing billionaires intent on reducing government constraints on their business interests \u2014 these movements tapped the unease that was felt by many people who lived outside of the urban cores; fears that economic security was slipping away, that their social status and privileges were eroding, that their cultural identities were being threatened by outsiders, somebody that didn\u2019t look like them or sound like them or pray as they did.And perhaps more than anything else, the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in which the reckless behavior of financial elites resulted in years of hardship for ordinary people all around the world, made all the previous assurances of experts ring hollow \u2014 all those assurances that somehow financial regulators knew what they were doing, that somebody was minding the store, that global economic integration was an unadulterated good. Because of the actions taken by governments during and after that crisis, including, I should add, by aggressive steps by my administration, the global economy has now returned to healthy growth.But the credibility of the international system, the faith in experts in places like Washington or Brussels, all that had taken a blow. And a politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear, and that kind of politics is now on the move. It\u2019s on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. I am not being alarmist, I am simply stating the facts.Look around. Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained \u2014 the form of it \u2014 but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. In the West, you\u2019ve got far-right parties that oftentimes are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. Many developing countries now are looking at China\u2019s model of authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good?The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media \u2014 once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity \u2014 has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.So on Madiba\u2019s 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads \u2014 a moment in time at which two very different visions of humanity\u2019s future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories, two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond?Should we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba\u2019s release from prison, from the Berlin Wall coming down \u2014 should we see that hope that we had as na\u00efve and misguided? Should we understand the last 25 years of global integration as nothing more than a detour from the previous inevitable cycle of history \u2014 where might makes right, and politics is a hostile competition between tribes and races and religions, and nations compete in a zero-sum game, constantly teetering on the edge of conflict until full-blown war breaks out? Is that what we think?Let me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela\u2019s vision. I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King and Abraham Lincoln. I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multiracial democracy, built on the premise that all people are created equal, and they\u2019re endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. And I believe that a world governed by such principles is possible and that it can achieve more peace and more cooperation in pursuit of a common good. That\u2019s what I believe. And I believe we have no choice but to move forward; that those of us who believe in democracy and civil rights and a common humanity have a better story to tell. And I believe this not just based on sentiment, I believe it based on hard evidence.The fact that the world\u2019s most prosperous and successful societies, the ones with the highest living standards and the highest levels of satisfaction among their people, happen to be those which have most closely approximated the liberal, progressive ideal that we talk about and have nurtured the talents and contributions of all their citizens.The fact that authoritarian governments have been shown time and time again to breed corruption, because they\u2019re not accountable; to repress their people; to lose touch eventually with reality; to engage in bigger and bigger lies that ultimately result in economic and political and cultural and scientific stagnation. Look at history. Look at the facts.The fact that countries which rely on rabid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principle, the thing that holds people together \u2014 eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. Check the history books.The fact that technology cannot be put back in a bottle, so we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we now live close together and populations are going to be moving, and environmental challenges are not going to go away on their own, so that the only way to effectively address problems like climate change or mass migration or pandemic disease will be to develop systems for more international cooperation, not less.We have a better story to tell. But to say that our vision for the future is better is not to say that it will inevitably win. Because history also shows the power of fear. History shows the lasting hold of greed and the desire to dominate others in the minds of men. Especially men. History shows how easily people can be convinced to turn on those who look different, or worship God in a different way. So if we\u2019re truly to continue Madiba\u2019s long walk towards freedom, we\u2019re going to have to work harder and we\u2019re going to have to be smarter. We\u2019re going to have to learn from the mistakes of the recent past.And so in the brief time remaining, let me just suggest a few guideposts for the road ahead, guideposts that draw from Madiba\u2019s work, his words, the lessons of his life. First, Madiba shows those of us who believe in freedom and democracy we are going to have to fight harder to reduce inequality and promote lasting economic opportunity for all people.Now, I don\u2019t believe in economic determinism. Human beings don\u2019t live on bread alone. But they need bread. And history shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly; and that once people achieve more than mere subsistence, then they\u2019re measuring their well-being by how they compare to their neighbors, and whether their children can expect to live a better life. And when economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow \u2014 and that dynamic eats away at democracy. Sometimes it may be straight-out corruption, but sometimes it may not involve the exchange of money; it\u2019s just folks who are that wealthy get what they want, and it undermines human freedom.And Madiba understood this. This is not new. He warned us about this. He said: \u201cWhere globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and the powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and the weaker, [then] we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.\u201d That\u2019s what he said.So if we are serious about universal freedom today, if we care about social justice today, then we have a responsibility to do something about it. And I would respectfully amend what Madiba said. I don\u2019t do it often, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s not enough for us to protest; we\u2019re going to have to build, we\u2019re going to have to innovate, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how do we close this widening chasm of wealth and opportunity both within countries and between them.And how we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new president is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so. But we can learn from the last 70 years that it will not involve unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism. It also won\u2019t involve old-style command-and-control socialism form the top. That was tried; it didn\u2019t work very well.For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system \u2014 one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker \u2014 that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business; that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich but they\u2019re giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.I should add, by the way, right now I\u2019m actually surprised by how much money I got, and let me tell you something: I don\u2019t have half as much as most of these folks or a tenth or a hundredth. There\u2019s only so much you can eat. There\u2019s only so big a house you can have. There\u2019s only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it\u2019s enough.You don\u2019t have to take a vow of poverty just to say, \u201cWell, let me help out and let a few of the other folks \u2014 let me look at that child out there who doesn\u2019t have enough to eat or needs some school fees, let me help him out. I\u2019ll pay a little more in taxes. It\u2019s okay. I can afford it.\u201d I mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more, instead of saying: \u201cWow, I\u2019ve got so much. Who can I help? How can I give more and more and more?\u201d That\u2019s ambition. That\u2019s impact. That\u2019s influence. What an amazing gift to be able to help people, not just yourself. Where was I? I ad-libbed. You get the point.It involves promoting an inclusive capitalism both within nations and between nations. And as we pursue, for example, the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to get past the charity mind-set. We\u2019ve got to bring more resources to the forgotten pockets of the world through investment and entrepreneurship, because there is talent everywhere in the world if given an opportunity.When it comes to the international system of commerce and trade, it\u2019s legitimate for poorer countries to continue to seek access to wealthier markets. And by the way, wealthier markets, that\u2019s not the big problem that you\u2019re having \u2014 that a small African country is sending you tea and flowers. That\u2019s not your biggest economic challenge. It\u2019s also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries, to make sure that they\u2019re providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and hacking our servers.But even as there are discussions to be had around trade and commerce, it\u2019s important to recognize this reality: While the outsourcing of jobs from north to south, from east to west, while a lot of that was a dominant trend in the late 20th century, the biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology. And the biggest challenge for your new president when we think about how we\u2019re going to employ more people here is going to be also technology, because artificial intelligence is here and it is accelerating, and you\u2019re going to have driverless cars, and you\u2019re going to have more and more automated services, and that\u2019s going to make the job of giving everybody work that is meaningful tougher, and we\u2019re going to have to be more imaginative, and the pact of change is going to require us to do more fundamental reimagining of our social and political arrangements, to protect the economic security and the dignity that comes with a job.It\u2019s not just money that a job provides; it provides dignity and structure and a sense of place and a sense of purpose. And so we\u2019re going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our workweek, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level. But we\u2019re going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track. Second, Madiba teaches us that some principles really are universal \u2014 and the most important one is the principle that we are bound together by a common humanity and that each individual has inherent dignity and worth.Now, it\u2019s surprising that we have to affirm this truth today. More than a quarter century after Madiba walked out of prison, I still have to stand here at a lecture and devote some time to saying that black people and white people and Asian people and Latin American people and women and men and gays and straights, that we are all human, that our differences are superficial, and that we should treat each other with care and respect. I would have thought we would have figured that out by now. I thought that basic notion was well established.But it turns out, as we\u2019re seeing in this recent drift into reactionary politics, that the struggle for basic justice is never truly finished. So we\u2019ve got to constantly be on the lookout and fight for people who seek to elevate themselves by putting somebody else down. And by the way, we also have to actively resist \u2014 this is important, particularly in some countries in Africa like my own father\u2019s homeland; I\u2019ve made this point before \u2014 we have to resist the notion that basic human rights like freedom to dissent, or the right of women to fully participate in the society, or the right of minorities to equal treatment, or the rights of people not to be beat up and jailed because of their sexual orientation \u2014 we have to be careful not to say that somehow, well, that doesn\u2019t apply to us, that those are Western ideas rather than universal imperatives.Again, Madiba, he anticipated things. He knew what he was talking about. In 1964, before he received the sentence that condemned him to die in prison, he explained from the dock that, \u201cThe Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights, the Bill of Rights are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.\u201d In other words, he didn\u2019t say well, those books weren\u2019t written by South Africans so I just \u2014 I can\u2019t claim them. No, he said that\u2019s part of my inheritance. That\u2019s part of the human inheritance. That applies here in this country, to me, and to you.And that\u2019s part of what gave him the moral authority that the apartheid regime could never claim, because he was more familiar with their best values than they were. He had read their documents more carefully than they had. And he went on to say, \u201cPolitical division based on color is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one color group by another.\u201d That\u2019s Nelson Mandela speaking in 1964, when I was three years old.What was true then remains true today. Basic truths do not change. It is a truth that can be embraced by the English, and by the Indian, and by the Mexican and by the Bantu and by the Luo and by the American. It is a truth that lies at the heart of every world religion \u2014 that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. That we see ourselves in other people. That we can recognize common hopes and common dreams. And it is a truth that is incompatible with any form of discrimination based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation. And it is a truth that, by the way, when embraced, actually delivers practical benefits, since it ensures that a society can draw upon the talents and energy and skill of all its people. And if you doubt that, just ask the French football team that just won the World Cup. Because not all of those folks \u2014 not all of those folks look like Gauls to me. But they\u2019re French. They\u2019re French.Embracing our common humanity does not mean that we have to abandon our unique ethnic and national and religious identities. Madiba never stopped being proud of his tribal heritage. He didn\u2019t stop being proud of being a black man and being a South African. But he believed, as I believe, that you can be proud of your heritage without denigrating those of a different heritage. In fact, you dishonor your heritage. It would make me think that you\u2019re a little insecure about your heritage if you\u2019ve got to put somebody else\u2019s heritage down. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Don\u2019t you get a sense sometimes \u2014 again, I\u2019m ad-libbing here \u2014 that these people who are so intent on putting people down and puffing themselves up that they\u2019re small-hearted, that there\u2019s something they\u2019re just afraid of.Madiba knew that we cannot claim justice for ourselves when it\u2019s only reserved for some. Madiba understood that we can\u2019t say we\u2019ve got a just society simply because we replaced the color of the person on top of an unjust system, so the person looks like us even though they\u2019re doing the same stuff, and somehow now we\u2019ve got justice. That doesn\u2019t work.It\u2019s not justice if now you\u2019re on top, so I\u2019m going to do the same thing that those folks were doing to me and now I\u2019m going to do it to you. That\u2019s not justice. \u201cI detest racialism,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it comes from a black man or a white man.\u201dNow, we have to acknowledge that there is disorientation that comes from rapid change and modernization, and the fact that the world has shrunk, and we\u2019re going to have to find ways to lessen the fears of those who feel threatened. In the West\u2019s current debate around immigration, for example, it\u2019s not wrong to insist that national borders matter; whether you\u2019re a citizen or not is going to matter to a government, that laws need to be followed; that in the public realm newcomers should make an effort to adapt to the language and customs of their new home.Those are legitimate things and we have to be able to engage people who do feel as if things are not orderly. But that can\u2019t be an excuse for immigration policies based on race, or ethnicity, or religion. There\u2019s got to be some consistency. And we can enforce the law while respecting the essential humanity of those who are striving for a better life. For a mother with a child in her arms, we can recognize that could be somebody in our family, that could be my child.Third, Madiba reminds us that democracy is about more than just elections. When he was freed from prison, Madiba\u2019s popularity \u2014 well, you couldn\u2019t even measure it. He could have been president for life. Am I wrong? Who was going to run against him? I mean, Ramaphosa was popular, but come on. Plus he was a young \u2014 he was too young. Had he chose, Madiba could have governed by executive fiat, unconstrained by check and balances. But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new Constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom.No individual \u2014 not Mandela, not Obama \u2014 are entirely immune to the corrupting influences of absolute power, if you can do whatever you want and everyone\u2019s too afraid to tell you when you\u2019re making a mistake. No one is immune from the dangers of that. Mandela understood this. He said, \u201cDemocracy is based on the majority principle. This is especially true in a country such as ours where the vast majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.\u201d He understood it\u2019s not just about who has the most votes. It\u2019s also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work. So we have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets 90 percent of the vote because all the opposition is locked up or can\u2019t get on TV is a democracy.Democracy depends on strong institutions and it\u2019s about minority rights and checks and balances, and freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press, and the right to protest and petition the government, and an independent judiciary, and everybody having to follow the law. And yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. I know, I promise. But the efficiency that\u2019s offered by an autocrat, that\u2019s a false promise. Don\u2019t take that one, because it leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual and not the other way around. And it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real.So for those of us who are interested in strengthening democracy, let\u2019s also stop \u2014 it\u2019s time for us to stop paying all of our attention to the world\u2019s capitals and the centers of power and to start focusing more on the grass-roots, because that\u2019s where democratic legitimacy comes from. Not from the top down, not from abstract theories, not just from experts, but from the bottom up. Knowing the lives of those who are struggling.As a community organizer, I learned as much from a laid-off steelworker in Chicago or a single mom in a poor neighborhood that I visited as I learned from the finest economists in the Oval Office. Democracy means being in touch and in tune with life as it\u2019s lived in our communities, and that\u2019s what we should expect from our leaders, and it depends upon cultivating leaders at the grass-roots who can help bring about change and implement it on the ground and can tell leaders in fancy buildings, this isn\u2019t working down here. And to make democracy work, Madiba shows us that we also have to keep teaching our children, and ourselves \u2014 and this is really hard \u2014 to engage with people not only who look different but who hold different views. This is hard.Most of us prefer to surround ourselves with opinions that validate what we already believe. You notice the people who you think are smart are the people who agree with you. Funny how that works. But democracy demands that we\u2019re able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they\u2019ll change ours. And you can\u2019t do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can\u2019t do it if you insist that those who aren\u2019t like you \u2014 because they\u2019re white, or because they\u2019re male \u2014 that somehow there\u2019s no way they can understand what I\u2019m feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters.Madiba, he lived this complexity. In prison, he studied Afrikaans so that he could better understand the people who were jailing him. And when he got out of prison, he extended a hand to those who had jailed him, because he knew that they had to be a part of the democratic South Africa that he wanted to build. \u201cTo make peace with an enemy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cone must work with that enemy, and that enemy becomes one\u2019s partner.\u201dSo those who traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy, whether it\u2019s on the left or the right, they make democracy unworkable. You can\u2019t expect to get 100 percent of what you want all the time; sometimes, you have to compromise. That doesn\u2019t mean abandoning your principles, but instead it means holding on to those principles and then having the confidence that they\u2019re going to stand up to a serious democratic debate. That\u2019s how America\u2019s founders intended our system to work \u2014 that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and proof it would be possible to arrive at a basis for common ground.And I should add for this to work, we have to actually believe in an objective reality. This is another one of these things that I didn\u2019t have to lecture about. You have to believe in facts. Without facts, there is no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to cooperate. I can find common ground for those who oppose the Paris Accords because, for example, they might say, well, it\u2019s not going to work, you can\u2019t get everybody to cooperate, or they might say it\u2019s more important for us to provide cheap energy for the poor, even if it means in the short term that there\u2019s more pollution. At least I can have a debate with them about that and I can show them why I think clean energy is the better path, especially for poor countries, that you can leapfrog old technologies. I can\u2019t find common ground if somebody says climate change is just not happening, when almost all of the world\u2019s scientists tell us it is. I don\u2019t know where to start talking to you about this. If you start saying it\u2019s an elaborate hoax, I don\u2019t know what to \u2014 where do we start?Unfortunately, too much of politics today seems to reject the very concept of objective truth. People just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in state-sponsored propaganda; we see it in internet-driven fabrications, we see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment, we see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they\u2019re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. Politicians have always lied, but it used to be if you caught them lying they\u2019d be like, \u201cAh, man.\u201d Now they just keep on lying.By the way, this is what I think Mama Gra\u00e7a was talking about in terms of maybe some sense of humility that Madiba felt, like sometimes just basic stuff, me not completely lying to people seems pretty basic, I don\u2019t think of myself as a great leader just because I don\u2019t completely make stuff up. You\u2019d think that was a baseline. Anyway, we see it in the promotion of anti-intellectualism and the rejection of science from leaders who find critical thinking and data somehow politically inconvenient. And, as with the denial of rights, the denial of facts runs counter to democracy, it could be its undoing, which is why we must zealously protect independent media; and we have to guard against the tendency for social media to become purely a platform for spectacle, outrage or disinformation; and we have to insist that our schools teach critical thinking to our young people, not just blind obedience.Which, I\u2019m sure you are thankful for, leads to my final point: We have to follow Madiba\u2019s example of persistence and of hope.It is tempting to give in to cynicism: to believe that recent shifts in global politics are too powerful to push back; that the pendulum has swung permanently. Just as people spoke about the triumph of democracy in the \u201990s, now you are hearing people talk about end of democracy and the triumph of tribalism and the strongman. We have to resist that cynicism.Because, we\u2019ve been through darker times, we\u2019ve been in lower valleys and deeper valleys. Yes, by the end of his life, Madiba embodied the successful struggle for human rights, but the journey was not easy, it wasn\u2019t preordained. The man went to prison for almost three decades. He split limestone in the heat, he slept in a small cell, and was repeatedly put in solitary confinement.And I remember talking to some of his former colleagues saying how they hadn\u2019t realized when they were released, just the sight of a child, the idea of holding a child, they had missed \u2014 it wasn\u2019t something available to them, for decades.And yet his power actually grew during those years \u2014 and the power of his jailers diminished, because he knew that if you stick to what\u2019s true, if you know what\u2019s in your heart, and you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for it, even in the face of overwhelming odds, that it might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen in the next week, it might not even happen in your lifetime. Things may go backwards for a while, but ultimately, right makes might, not the other way around, ultimately, the better story can win out and as strong as Madiba\u2019s spirit may have been, he would not have sustained that hope had he been alone in the struggle, part of buoyed him up was that he knew that each year, the ranks of freedom fighters were replenishing, young men and women, here in South African, in the ANC and beyond; black and Indian and white, from across the countryside, across the continent, around the world, who in those most difficult days would keep working on behalf of his vision.And that\u2019s what we need right now, we don\u2019t just need one leader, we don\u2019t just need one inspiration, what we badly need right now is that collective spirit. And, I know that those young people, those hope carriers are gathering around the world. Because history shows that whenever progress is threatened, and the things we care about most are in question, we should heed the words of Robert Kennedy \u2014 spoken here in South Africa, he said, \u201cOur answer is the world\u2019s hope: it is to rely on youth. It\u2019s to rely on the spirit of the young.\u201dSo, young people, who are in the audience, who are listening, my message to you is simple: Keep believing, keep marching, keep building, keep raising your voice. Every generation has the opportunity to remake the world. Mandela said, \u201cYoung people are capable, when aroused, of bringing down the towers of oppression and raising the banners of freedom.\u201d Now is a good time to be aroused. Now is a good time to be fired up.And, for those of us who care about the legacy that we honor here today \u2014 about equality and dignity and democracy and solidarity and kindness, those of us who remain young at heart, if not in body \u2014 we have an obligation to help our youth succeed. Some of you know, here in South Africa, my foundation is convening over the last few days, two hundred young people from across this continent who are doing the hard work of making change in their communities; who reflect Madiba\u2019s values, who are poised to lead the way.People like Abaas Mpindi, a journalist from Uganda, who founded the Media Challenge Initiative, to help other young people get the training they need to tell the stories that the world needs to know.People like Caren Wakoli, an entrepreneur from Kenya, who founded the Emerging Leaders Foundation to get young people involved in the work of fighting poverty and promoting human dignity.People like Enock Nkulanga, who directs the African Children\u2019s mission, which helps children in Uganda and Kenya get the education that they need and then in his spare time, Enock advocates for the rights of children around the globe, and founded an organization called LeadMinds Africa, which does exactly what it says.You meet these people, you talk to them, they will give you hope. They are taking the baton, they know they can\u2019t just rest on the accomplishments of the past, even the accomplishments of those as momentous as Nelson Mandela\u2019s. They stand on the shoulders of those who came before, including that young black boy born 100 years ago, but they know that it is now their turn to do the work.Madiba reminds us that: \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart.\u201d Love comes more naturally to the human heart, let\u2019s remember that truth. Let\u2019s see it as our North Star, let\u2019s be joyful in our struggle to make that truth manifest here on earth so that in 100 years from now, future generations will look back and say, \u201cThey kept the march going, that\u2019s why we live under new banners of freedom.\u201d Thank you very much, South Africa, thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lakeith Stanfield Is Playing Us All", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "The new symbol of Hollywood weird, who is starring in \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d refuses to be categorized as part of a movement. \u201cI\u2019m just doing me.\u201dSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Lakeith Stanfield was 20 and working at a marijuana grow house, he concluded that the plants in his care were conscious beings he was exchanging ideas with. That this realization came when he was really high didn\u2019t make it less lasting or less real. Mr. Stanfield loves plants, feels for them, because, he said, \u201cthey are a pure life, and they do not talk,\u201d and laments that his busy work schedule prevents him from keeping any at home. \u201cI travel too much,\u201d he said in a recent interview here, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to put plants through that.\u201dThis sentiment goes a ways to explaining Mr. Stanfield\u2019s singular allure, but it doesn\u2019t go all the way, because no anecdote ever could. It also could have sprung from the lips of Darius, the riveting, tender oddball Mr. Stanfield plays on \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Donald Glover\u2019s groundbreaking television show. In someone else\u2019s hands, Darius could have been limited to the goofy comic sidekick. Played by Mr. Stanfield, he was empathic, nuanced and complex. For audiences, this was a revelation. Empathic, nuanced, complex male black characters haven\u2019t exactly been saturating American screens.\u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d is about a black telemarketer, Cassius Green (Mr. Stanfield), whose sales skyrocket after he begins talking like a white man (voiced by David Cross). Absurdism ensues. Mr. Riley cast Mr. Stanfield after telling him he\u2019d have to appear in a nonsexual full frontal nude scene. \u201cHe cut me off and said, \u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for a film with full frontal nudity,\u2019\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cI said, \u2018O.K., this is the guy. This is the right kind of crazy.\u2019\u201d The scene ended up being scrapped. Mr. Riley had written it to show Cassius at his most vulnerable. Mr. Stanfield was at his most vulnerable every day.Mr. Stanfield, who is 26, met to chat in a cafe not far from his presumably plantless North Hollywood home. His velvety eyes were a dialed down version of the peepers he wields to astonishing effect onscreen, where they seem to bare every twitch of his soul. He had folded his tall, super-lanky self into a corner table, where he was digging into a grilled salmon salad he had greeted with an appreciative Kanye-inspired yip, \u201cNow I shall channel dragon energy!\u201d Around his neck were yellow mala beads, a gift from Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Paper Boi on \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and counts among Mr. Stanfield\u2019s rarefied group of close friends.Mr. Stanfield also brought along rose-colored granny glasses, which he described as \u201cmy soul realized in third-dimensional space.\u201d They put him in the zone, he said, and he planned to wear them for every interview from here on out, so long as he didn\u2019t lose them, which he tended to do with most of his things.The harmless antics are also part of his plan for self-preservation, pushback against the claustrophobic feeling he can get when the news media zeros in. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to come to understand it so I can play with it, without feeling like it\u2019s trying to play me,\u201d he said. He sees the Hollywood hoopla as the shadow side of success, but maybe a necessary one. \u201cThe reason why being pure can be something is because there are things that aren\u2019t that,\u201d he said. Still, he\u2019s a loner who needs seclusion and doesn\u2019t quite understand why anyone would be so interested in his life. \u201cMost of the time when you get into something, it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re human, it\u2019s boring,\u2019\u201d he said.Which may be true, except it doesn\u2019t remotely apply to him.When Mr. Cretton, the director, visited and saw Mr. Stanfield\u2019s Victorville bedroom, he said he knew that Mr. Stanfield would\u2019ve been creative whether Hollywood scooped him up or not.\u201cIt was, \u2018Oh my God, this guy is legit, this is an artist from the core of who he is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cretton said.In high school, Mr. Stanfield joined the drama club (that would be the extent of his acting training), and, after landing a role in \u201cHonk! The Musical\u201d playing the frog, resolved to become an actor. A photographer who took his headshots was encouraging, to a point. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yeah man, I think you\u2019re going to be good. You have this real disenfranchised look and feel about you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stanfield recalled. Mr. Stanfield didn\u2019t know what that meant, so he asked his mom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018it\u2019s not a good thing.\u2019\u201dIf others rolled their eyes at Mr. Stanfield\u2019s acting dreams, his mother believed in him and called him her superstar. Part of their connection was forged by pain. Mr. Stanfield said he would get involved when his mother and stepfather fought, and scream at him to leave her alone. When she could, she would drive him to Los Angeles for auditions. When she couldn\u2019t, Mr. Stanfield tried to hustle up money for the train. And when there were no lawns to mow or cars to wash, he\u2019d panhandle.Around 2012, Mr. Cretton found the financing to make his short into a feature, and put new actors \u2014 among them Brie Larson and Rami Malek \u2014 in every role. But no one felt right for Mr. Stanfield\u2019s old part. And Mr. Stanfield was nowhere to be found. He\u2019d fired his manager, and dropped his old email and phone number. Mr. Cretton eventually tracked him down on a messaging board. Mr. Stanfield drove down with his mom from Victorville, riven with certainty. \u201cNever was I more ready,\u201d he said. He read through a few scenes in Mr. Cretton\u2019s living room, and when he looked up, he saw Mr. Cretton was in tears.And finally, someone did.It\u2019s hard to capture in words the place Mr. Stanfield goes to in his performances, where everything gets stripped away except for something so intense and pure it vibrates off the screen. In acting lingo, he is wide open. Mr. Riley, the director, said Mr. Stanfield feels everything his character feels, and also doesn\u2019t give a fig what that might look like. \u201cHe\u2019s raw, he\u2019s experiencing something that needs to be felt right then,\u201d he said. Hiro Murai, who has directed the majority of \u201cAtlanta\u2019s\u201d episodes, said Mr. Stanfield was the most intuitive performer he\u2019s worked with yet. \u201cHe sort of lets himself free-fall in the moment,\u201d Mr. Murai wrote in an email. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless that way.\u201dMr. Stanfield can\u2019t fully explain his process himself, or how he gets there. That\u2019s why he likes symbols so much, he said, and has them tattooed on his fingers, arms and neck: the sign of Saturn, a fire tetrahedron, a dagger-slash-cross. They mean something and make him feel something that language can\u2019t describe.Armie Hammer, who plays a twisted corporate titan in \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d said he quickly realized during filming that he hadn\u2019t a clue what direction Mr. Stanfield would go with his character next. There were moments when he was so taken with Mr. Stanfield\u2019s performance that he almost fell out of the scene. Off-camera, he found Mr. Stanfield equally mystifying. One day, Mr. Stanfield showed up on set and announced that his Tesla\u2019s windshield had been smashed in. Mr. Hammer\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI said, \u2018You drive a Tesla?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hammer recalled. \u201c\u2018I picture you riding a unicorn to work. Or 300 Pomeranians harnessed to a chariot.\u2019\u201dA few highlights from Mr. Stanfield\u2019s still short dazzler of a career:Mr. Stanfield saw the piece and said he hated being dissected. \u201cI\u2019m not coming in with an intention game,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing me.\u201d If people were surprised by it, he said, it\u2019s more a testament to a narrow-minded perception; because everyone feels strange, whether they admit to it or not. In fact, maybe it\u2019s a little strange not to feel weird, existing in this world. All he knows is that when he\u2019s acting, he\u2019s doing what he feels, which takes him to places that we all go to but rarely reveal.Mr. Stanfield may not want to be the symbol for black weird, or for anything, but people close to him said he was part of a profound shift around black identity.\u201cHe\u2019s interested in being weird and holding that space that, particularly for artists of color, hasn\u2019t always been accessible,\u201d said Tessa Thompson, who plays Cassius\u2019 performance-artist girlfriend in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201d She added, \u201cThe folks that take that and own that, those outliers, are remarkable, and really important culturally.\u201dThose outliers include Mr. Riley, Mr. Glover and Issa Rae (\u201cInsecure\u201d), who have helped create a moment that Mr. Stanfield has met perfectly, even if he won\u2019t embrace what it means for most everyone else. \u201cI\u2019m a black man and I love being a black man,\u201d he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be categorized as being a conscious part of a movement.\u201dMr. Stanfield was dancing drunkenly at a party when Mr. Glover approached him about the part of Darius, a non sequitur-spouting stoner whose bon mots include \u201cCan I measure your tree?\u201d His first thought after reading the script was that this guy was an idiot. \u201cWho\u2019d want to play him?\u201d he asked himself.

{"Headline": "Laos Dam Failure Exposes Cracks in a Secretive Government\u2019s Agenda", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt shows the spirit of humanity,\u201d Yen Saisamon, a 17-year-old Laotian volunteer, said on Friday at a relief center in the town of Attapeu, where cardboard boxes of instant noodles and condiments were labeled in Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese.Yet if foreigners are helping now, they also share a piece of the blame.The accident at the billion-dollar Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric project last week has cast a harsh spotlight on the unspoken compact between the ruling Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party and giant outside financial interests: The companies get access to Lao\u2019s abundant natural resources; Laotian officials get some revenue; and no one will cast undue scrutiny on investment projects that exacerbate rural poverty \u2014 or, in this case, kill innocent villagers.Mr. Barney said the accident at the dam, part of the hydroelectric project, was perhaps the biggest challenge to the ruling party\u2019s legitimacy since its handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, which led to rapid inflation. Officials may now face more pressure to incorporate social and environmental protections for rural people in the push for development, he said.\u201cTheir response could either build confidence in the government or undermine it,\u201d Mr. Barney said, likening the challenge to the one that President George W. Bush faced after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Laos has been promoting hydroelectric power investments since the 1990s, and while initial financing came from the World Bank and other development agencies, the clear trend has been toward corporate funding, said Philip Hirsch, an emeritus professor at the University of Sydney in Australia who has studied hydroelectric power in the Mekong region for decades.The government has said it wants hydroelectric dams to transform Laos into Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cbattery.\u201dLaos\u2019s approach to development has paid off handsomely for domestic elites, while often leaving the rural poor at the mercy of foreign corporations.Analysts see Attapeu Province, where the flooding occurred, as a case study. Even though it is brimming with logging, agribusiness, mining and hydropower projects, villagers \u201cgenerally don\u2019t reap many benefits from these activities\u201d and instead face the most significant social and environmental impacts, said Miles Kenney-Lazar, an expert on Laos at Kyoto University in Japan.Well before the accident last Monday, foreign-funded projects in Attapeu had caused deforestation, loss of access to traditional lands and forests, chemical pollution of waterways and rapidly changing water levels, Mr. Kenney-Lazar said.After the flash floods that the dam failure set off last week, a top Laotian official blamed substandard construction. The main builder of the hydroelectric project, SK Engineering & Construction of South Korea, said on Friday that it would take responsibility if a formal investigation found it culpable. The company has acknowledged seeing troubling signs before the accident, saying it \u201cimmediately\u201d reported damage to the local authorities.But Laos will probably not allow an independent inquiry, in part because the government owns 25 percent of the hydroelectric project and was supposed to have regulatory oversight of its planning and construction, said David J. H. Blake, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of York in England who has written widely on Laos.Mr. Blake said the accident would not threaten the party\u2019s dominance, in part because the government is tightly controlling the narrative in the state-controlled news media. Relief donations in Attapeu Province may even help strengthen the party\u2019s hand in the worst-hit areas, he added, by \u201cgiving more power and control to the state-party machinery.\u201dIn the town of Attapeu, the flood-relief effort is being run partly out of the Hoang Anh-Attapeu Hotel, which is named after the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group, the same Vietnamese conglomerate that advocacy groups accuse of environmental and human rights abuses. The hotel\u2019s seven managers are all Vietnamese, said one of them, Nguyen Chi Cuong.\u201cLaos is pretty undeveloped,\u201d Mr. Cuong, speaking in Vietnamese, said on Friday in the hotel\u2019s high-ceilinged dining room.In the marbled lobby, men in pressed slacks and dress shirts watched as Laotian workers unloaded toilet paper, toothpaste and instant noodles \u2014 supplies for the flood victims \u2014 from a delivery truck in the parking lot. Some of the supervisors wore shirts that said SK Engineering & Construction.A receptionist, Soukkida Senonghiem, said that while foreign investment was generally good for Laos, it was ordinary people who suffered when projects went awry.Still, she said, this particular accident had a silver lining.\u201cIt\u2019s lucky that the dead are our own people, not foreigners,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might have affected our image and caused bigger problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Millennial Prenup", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEngaged? Congrats! Here\u2019s when to consider a prenuptial agreement \u2014 and how to get started.First comes love, then comes \u2026 prenup? If you\u2019re a millennial, maybe. So while prenups traditionally protected the party with money \u2014 which often was the man, and which often led to resentment \u2014 millennials usually tackle the agreements as a team. \u201cI think it\u2019s because they both want to protect their independence and what they\u2019ve been working for,\u201d she said. Though it\u2019s easy to think of a prenuptial agreement as a \u201cdivorce contract,\u201d many legal and financial experts view it as a smart business move. Still, they\u2019re not for everyone. You may want a prenup if you or your partner:Own property or a businessHave children from a previous relationship, or have been married beforePlan to take time off to raise childrenHold significant debtHave robust retirement accountsWill receive stock options during your marriageThough your individual assets \u2014 an investment property, a 401(k) \u2014 will remain separate after you marry, future contributions and appreciation will usually be considered marital property. Feel that a prenup might be a good fit for you? Here\u2019s how to get started. The key to a successful prenup is timing, and most experts suggest broaching the topic before you even get engaged. Ms. Lowry, for example, initiated the conversation five years into dating and a year before getting engaged. By starting early, you\u2019ll allow time for multiple discussions \u2014 and prevent your fianc\u00e9 from feeling forced or rushed into something he or she doesn\u2019t understand or agree with.\u201cCouples are coming into a marriage with as much love as they\u2019ve ever felt for each other,\u201d Ms. Malec said. Those warm feelings, she said, make it easier to determine a fair division of assets \u2014 a task that could be more difficult in the future. When you hire a lawyer to complete your prenup, he or she will request all your financials \u2014 bank and investment accounts, tax returns, insurance policies, debts \u2014 so it\u2019s wise to start compiling that information now. \u201cWhether or not you end up signing, it\u2019s a great exercise to go through,\u201d Ms. Lowry said. \u201cIt forces you to have financial conversations you may not have thought to have, or may have avoided.\u201d That may well \u201cset you up for an even more successful marriage,\u201d she said.While the contents of your prenup will vary greatly depending on your situation, the top three topics, according to Mr. Moore, are protection of separate property, alimony and division of property.You could declare, for example, that certain things will remain separate throughout your marriage: a portion of your income, appreciation of an individual property or even accrual of debt. You could also discuss compensation for a spouse who stays home to rear children, which Mr. Moore noted was \u201coften a contentious issue in a divorce.\u201d He said a prenup could include a prenegotiated settlement that accounts for lost time and income and covers training to re-enter the work force. One thing you must omit: issues of custody or support for future children, as those decisions are made in the best interest of the child at the time. You can, however, select who will get the pets. Ready to make it official? You and your betrothed will each need to hire a lawyer. And it won\u2019t be cheap: Depending on the level of complexity and negotiation, legal representation for a prenuptial agreement can cost $2,500 and up \u2014 per person. For a less expensive option, you can consider filling out an agreement on a site like Rocket Lawyer, where membership costs $39.99 per month and includes unlimited email questions and one 30-minute lawyer consultation. As long as you work with your fianc\u00e9 in a team, a prenup can bring you closer together \u2014 rather than further apart. At her firm, Ms. Marzano-Lesnevich recalled a recent occasion when a couple (one of whom was a millennial) wanted to sign their prenup at the same time. Each brought a lawyer and a bottle of Champagne \u2014 which they uncorked as the ink dried. \u201cIt can be a very friendly encounter,\u201d Ms. Marzano-Lesnevich said. \u201cYou just have to know when you finish the prenup that both sides are comfortable.\u201d\u201cYou never want it to be a sore point during the marriage itself,\u201d she added. Or, as Mr. Moore said, \u201cYou can help protect the romance by taking care of the finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Mulls a Unilateral Tax Cut for the Rich", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress to grant a $100 billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy, a legally tenuous maneuver that would cut capital gains taxation and fulfill a long-held ambition of many investors and conservatives.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month that his department was studying whether it could use its regulatory powers to allow Americans to account for inflation in determining capital gains tax liabilities. The Treasury Department could change the definition of \u201ccost\u201d for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells.\u201cIf it can\u2019t get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we\u2019ll consider that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, emphasizing that he had not concluded whether the Treasury Department had the authority to act alone. \u201cWe are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth.\u201dCurrently, capital gains taxes are determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference, usually at 20 percent. If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable \u201cgain\u201d to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000.The move would face a near-certain court challenge. It could also reinforce a liberal critique of Republican tax policy at a time when Republicans are struggling to sell middle-class voters on the benefits of the tax cuts that President Trump signed into law late last year.\u201cAt a time when the deficit is out of control, wages are flat and the wealthiest are doing better than ever, to give the top 1 percent another advantage is an outrage and shows the Republicans\u2019 true colors,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cFurthermore, Mr. Mnuchin thinks he can do it on his own, but everyone knows this must be done by legislation.\u201dConservative advocates for the plan say that even if it is challenged in court, it could still goose the economy by unleashing a wave of asset sales. \u201cNo matter what the courts do, you\u2019ll get the main economic benefit the day, the month after Treasury does this,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, a tax lobbyist in Washington and former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform.Liberal tax economists see little benefit in it beyond another boon to the already rich.\u201cIt would just be a very generous addition to the tax cuts they\u2019ve already handed to the very wealthy,\u201d said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of tax policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, \u201cand it would play into the hands of their tax advisers, who would be well positioned to take advantage of the loopholes that were opened by it.\u201dThe decades-long push to change the taxation of investment income has spurred a legal debate over the original meaning of the word \u201ccost\u201d in the Revenue Act of 1918, and over the authority of the Treasury Department to interpret the word in regulations.\u201cI think we ought to look at not penalizing Americans for inflation,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who said he would like to see the Treasury Department make the change through regulation.Mr. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department determined that redefining \u201ccost\u201d by regulatory fiat would be illegal \u2014 a conclusion buttressed by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which found that \u201ccost\u201d means the price that was paid for something.But conservatives have disputed this conclusion. Pushing Mr. Trump to make the change, Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has cited a 2002 Supreme Court decision in a case between Verizon Communications and the Federal Communications Commission that said regulators have leeway in defining \u201ccost\u201d to make the case that the Treasury Department can act alone.\u201cThis would be in terms of its economic impact over the next several years, and long term, similar in size as the last tax cut,\u201d Mr. Norquist said, suggesting that making the change would raise revenue for the government by creating new economic efficiencies and faster growth. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s going to be huge.\u201d\u201cIt is unlikely, however, that a significant, or any, effect on economic growth would occur from a stand-alone indexing proposal,\u201d the report said.Michael Graetz, a tax law professor at Columbia University who worked in the Treasury Department\u2019s tax policy office when the department determined that taxing capital gains could not be changed by regulation, said he still thought that the decision to change the law should fall to Congress.He pointed out that the department would have to make decisions about what types of assets would be indexed and that it would essentially be picking winners and losers.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no legal authority for Treasury to choose what assets to treat this way,\u201d Mr. Graetz said.A framework for a second round of tax cuts, released by the Ways and Means Committee last week, did not address taxation of capital gains. It is highly unlikely that Congress will pass another tax bill this year because of the slim Republican majority in the Senate.Democratic senators have written to Mr. Mnuchin, urging him to stand down.\u201cTreasury does not have the unilateral authority to take our tax code and expose it to widespread gamesmanship,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIndexing capital gains under this regime is a boondoggle for the rich, plain and simple.\u201dA Treasury Department official wrote Mr. Wyden a two-paragraph reply this month. \u201cWe appreciate your taking the time to express the thoughts outlined in the letter,\u201d it read. \u201cWe will take them under advisement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Purports to Show Tajikistan Attackers Pledging Allegiance to ISIS", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA day after claiming its first attack in Tajikistan, the Islamic State released a video on Tuesday that purports to show the five attackers joining hands and pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the terrorist group\u2019s leader.The video was released by the Islamic State\u2019s internal news agency and suggests that the attackers had at least a digital connection to the Islamic State, allowing them to send the footage to the group before last weekend\u2019s attack on several cyclists who were run over and attacked on a mountain road in Tajikistan.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, releases a pledge video for only a minority of the attacks it claims. In the past, the existence of the video has provided the first concrete clue of an online connection between the assailants and the terrorist group\u2019s central organization. The fact that the attackers managed to get the footage to ISIS points to an avenue for contacting the group, analysts say.\u201cIt shows the digital connection,\u201d Mr. Hughes added. \u201cThe touchpoint with ISIS is not by proximity to the caliphate but through the relationships they make online.\u201dUsing a Daewoo sedan, the attackers in Tajikistan ran over the group of seven cyclists on a scenic mountain road on Sunday, killing four of them. Two were Americans, one was a Swiss citizen and one was a Dutch citizen.Despite the similarities, the Interior Ministry blamed domestic political opponents, not the Islamic State, for the attack. In its statement, the ministry accused a member of a local party, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, of being the mastermind behind the attack. The government banned the party in 2015, accusing it of plotting a coup.\u201cThis would appear to fit a pattern where the government manufactures illogical allegations against the I.R.P.T.,\u201d Steve Swerdlow, a Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview, referring to the opposition party. \u201cIt\u2019s truly illogical to have all indications of an ISIS-inspired attack, and try to blame the party.\u201dIn the video, which is less than three minutes long, five of the presumed attackers are seen sitting in a half-circle on a stone slab. Behind them is the ISIS flag, hanging from the branches of a tree. At their feet is a single knife. They join hands and then pledge allegiance to Mr. Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State.\u201cO disbelievers, we have come to you with slaughter,\u201d they say, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the activities of extremists online. \u201cWe will eradicate you and make the word of Allah supreme.\u201dRBK, a Russian newspaper, citing the Tajik Interior Ministry, said one suspect was killed after he attacked a police officer with an ax. The police also killed three other suspects who were armed with knives, the ministry said. Four others have been detained on suspicion of being connected to the attack, or of financing it.Rukmini Callimachi reported from New York, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re high. At just over 25 percent of total spending on hospital care (or 1.4 percent of total United States economic output), American hospital administrative costs exceed those of all the other places. The Netherlands was second in hospital administrative costs: almost 20 percent of hospital spending and 0.8 percent of that country\u2019s G.D.P. At the low end were Canada and Scotland, which both spend about 12 percent of hospital expenditures on administration, or about half a percent of G.D.P.At the low end, such activities accounted for only 3 percent of revenue for surgical procedures, perhaps because surgery is itself so expensive. At the high end, 25 percent of emergency department visit revenue went toward billing costs. Primary care visits were in the middle, with billing functions accounting for 15 percent of revenue, or about $100,000 per year per primary care provider.\u201cThe extraordinary costs we see are not because of administrative slack or because health care leaders don\u2019t try to economize,\u201d said Kevin Schulman, a co-author of the study and a professor of medicine at Duke. \u201cThe high administrative costs are functions of the system\u2019s complexity.\u201d\u201cOne can have choice without costly complexity,\u201d said Barak Richman, a co-author of the JAMA study and a professor of law at Duke. \u201cSwitzerland and Germany, for example, have lower administrative costs than the U.S. but exhibit a robust choice of health insurers.\u201dAn additional source of costs for health care providers is chasing patients for their portion of bills, the part not covered by insurance. With deductibles and co-payments on the rise, more patients are facing cost sharing that they may not be able to pay, possibly leading to rising costs for providers, or the collection agencies they work with, in trying to get them to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that billing issues only reflect complex interactions between providers and insurers,\u201d Mr. Chernew said. \u201cAs patients are required to pay more money out of pocket, providers devote more resources to collecting it.\u201dA distinguishing feature of the American health system is that it offers a lot of choice, including among health plans. Because insurers and public programs have not coordinated on a set of standards for pricing, billing and collection \u2014 whatever the benefits of choice \u2014 one of the consequences is high administrative burden. And that\u2019s another reason for high American health care prices.Advertisement"}

Steven Brill Sees Ways to Get It Back on Track.", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.This perceived decline and fall of the United States has inspired a 21st-century cottage industry of books devoted to how things went off course. They range from the journalistic (George Packer\u2019s \u201cThe Unwinding\u201d) to the sociological (Robert Putnam\u2019s \u201cOur Kids\u201d) to the economic (Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the 21st Century\u201d) to the political (Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson\u2019s \u201cWinner-Take-All Politics\u201d). Many of these books tackle similar themes: the rise of economic inequality, the increase in political polarization and the erosion of the mid-20th-century social contract that existed for white men. We are living in a golden age of authors telling Americans that we no longer live in a golden age.In the Age of Trump, the bar for adding something new to this genre is high. Steven Brill, a writer, lawyer and entrepreneur who founded The American Lawyer and Court TV, offers his take in \u201cTailspin.\u201d The book was born when Brill was \u201cstuck in traffic in a taxi one night on the Van Wyck Expressway coming home from Kennedy Airport.\u201d Fortunately, \u201cTailspin\u201d is better than its grumpy origin story. Brill describes a slow-motion process of perverse meritocracy in which, as one law professor tells him, \u201cthe elites have become so skilled and so hardworking that they are able to protect each other better than ever before.\u201d Or, as Brill labels it, \u201cMoat Nation.\u201d\u201cTailspin\u201d distinguishes itself within the America Gone Wrong genre in three important ways. First, it comes to life when Brill focuses on the legal shifts and stalemates that ushered in the country\u2019s current predicament, examining how these changes rippled across the rest of society. The rise of executive compensation practices linked to stock prices encouraged executives to prioritize short-term profits over long-term investments. A series of Supreme Court cases, ending with Citizens United, enabled corporate speech to play a powerful role in national politics. The growth of super PACs and lobbyists in Washington guarantees that any piece of appropriate regulation will be watered down \u2014 first in Congress and then in the implementation stage. The federal government\u2019s approach to fraudulent financial firms has shifted from the criminal prosecution of executives to the levying of fines. All of the book\u2019s chapters on the law crackle with energy. (In contrast, the chapters on globalization and political polarization seem rote.)The third way in which \u201cTailspin\u201d distinguishes itself is the number of times the phrase \u201cunintended consequences\u201d appears in the book. Many of the legal and regulatory changes that Brill excoriates have counterintuitive beginnings. Who helped spearhead the growth of the commercial speech movement? The consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who sued the Commonwealth of Virginia to allow pharmacies to advertise drug prices. \u201cTalk about boomerangs,\u201d Nader told Brill in 2017. \u201cThat case was the biggest boomerang of all time.\u201d Similarly, the very first political action committee was created in 1943 by a labor union. Brill describes efforts to bring more minority members to Congress as \u201canother reform effort that boomeranged,\u201d because minority Democrats allied with Republicans to rewrite congressional districts and eviscerate districts held by white Democrats.Brill describes so many unintended consequences that he may leave the reader skeptical about whether any reform efforts can improve matters. He would have been better served to devote more attention to systems that actually work. While \u201cTailspin\u201d bemoans the recent trend of delayed flights, for example, it does not discuss the improvements to airline and airport safety that occurred during the same period. Similarly, while Brill devotes a few pages to it, a deeper dive into the failure and subsequent success of the Obamacare website HealthCare.gov would have been illuminating.A more serious problem with \u201cTailspin,\u201d however, is that Brill never quite makes the connection between laws and norms. Toward the end of the book he talks a lot about common-sense reforms that would provide public goods, eliminate red tape and still provide reasonable due process. These will sound intuitively appealing to most citizens. But many of the trends that Brill identifies, like political polarization, have their origins in the erosion of norms, not laws, and the real question is whether Americans can trust one another enough not to abuse less legalistic systems. Changing laws is easier than changing norms. On this point, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt\u2019s \u201cHow Democracies Die\u201d is probably more instructive.Nonetheless, \u201cTailspin\u201d adds value. Brill is a keen observer of well-intentioned ideas, like trade adjustment assistance, executed badly. Much of this book makes for depressing reading. Still, the interviews with those trying to fight the powers that be make the book a worthy contribution. The words that stay with me most are from Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. When asked whether she gets frustrated that not enough people care about their focus on dark money in politics, she said: \u201cWe need to be here building the record so that when the opportunity arises, when people of good faith on both sides of the aisle decide that enough is enough, we will have armed them. \u2026 The system has careened off the tracks, and everybody knows it. But I\u2019m impassioned, not discouraged.\u201d In a downbeat era, \u201cTailspin\u201d offers some modest ammunition for hope.Advertisement"}

Mr. Butler, who had lived in Brooklyn since 2009, had been treated for metastic colon cancer.Mr. Butler commanded the syncopated power and splashy filigree of boogie-woogie and gospel and the rolling polyrhythms of Afro-Caribbean music. He could also summon the elegant delicacy of classical piano or hurtle toward the dissonances and atonal clusters of modern jazz. He could play in convincing vintage styles and sustain multileveled counterpoint, then demolish it all in a whirlwind of genre-smashing virtuosity.Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) once described him as \u201cthe pride of New Orleans and a visionistical down-home cat and a hellified piano plunker to boot.\u201dGlaucoma left him blind in infancy, and he attended the Louisiana State School for the Blind in Baton Rouge (now the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired), where he studied piano along with drums and trombone. He also learned to read classical music in Braille notation while picking up popular songs by ear.Although he was surrounded by New Orleans jazz and R&B while growing up, as a young musician Mr. Butler at first disdained those traditions as \u201ctourist music.\u201dHe was 14 when he began playing professionally at dances and clubs. He performed at the first New Orleans Jazz and Heritage festival in 1970 with fellow Southern University students, and appeared at nearly every JazzFest afterward, including this year\u2019s.After receiving his master\u2019s degree, Mr. Butler returned to New Orleans and taught in the vocal program at the Performing Arts High School of the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts.He also found another artistic outlet: photography.Flooding destroyed his home, including not only his piano but also his recording equipment, some album master tapes and his extensive archive of live recordings and Braille music manuscripts. Copies of live recordings survived in the collection of the musician George Winston, who helped Mr. Butler select a compilation of them for Mr. Butler\u2019s 2008 album, \u201cPiaNOLA Live.\u201d\u201cHenry was fiercely independent, and he did not want to be second fiddle to anybody,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cI\u2019d just listen to him play the tunes, and I\u2019d record it, and I\u2019d end up transcribing what he played for the band. So the band was three-dimensional Henry, playing something he had played once. And then he\u2019d be improvising on top of his improvisation.\u201dMr. Bernstein added: \u201cNo one had a left hand like him. No one on the planet. It was so strong and fast, and he had such control of every part of it: the tone, the dynamics, the speed. He did all these things that were so fast that no one else could do them. If you looked at his hands, they were blurs.\u201dBut between medical treatments, he continued to perform worldwide. After appearing at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in April, he performed in Beijing and in Melbourne, Australia, and he was planning European dates in July. His final concert was on June 18 at a Jazz for Justice benefit in New York City.He is survived by his brother, George Leo Butler Jr., and his longtime partner, Annaliese Jakimides.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Headwinds, de Blasio\u2019s Housing Plan Moves Forward as Costs Rise", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday that New York City had financed the creation or preservation of more than 32,000 units of subsidized rental housing during the previous year, an annual total that outstripped those seen under Mayor Ed Koch when a crisis of decay and disinvestment prompted historic city action.The milestone is the result of significant and increasing investment by Mr. de Blasio \u2014 more than $1.6 billion in direct city subsidy over the last fiscal year \u2014 aimed at stemming a different sort of crisis: rising rents and New Yorkers struggling to afford them.It comes in the face of headwinds from Washington, in the form of a less favorable market for tax credits for affordable housing projects nationwide, and in New York City, where the cost of construction has been growing.That is largely because the cost to the city for new construction jumped considerably since last year, to as much as $200,000 per unit from as much as $165,000 per unit in the previous fiscal year, said Molly Park, the deputy commissioner for development at the city\u2019s Housing Preservation and Development Department.The city also revamped its housing plan last year to increase the subsidies for apartments aimed at lower-income New Yorkers, adding to the cost. The plan also grew by 50 percent: The mayor is now pledging to preserve or construct 300,000 units by 2026. At $83 billion, the total price tag for the mayor\u2019s plan is more than double where it was when Mr. de Blasio introduced it four years ago.\u201cWe are paying more, in a very large part, to get more,\u201d said Ms. Park.City officials attributed the surge to a number of factors, including a focus on preserving the affordability of units that were part of the city\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program and in some large developments in Manhattan. In all, the city financed the preservation of 23,000 units over the last fiscal year, and the new construction of another 9,000.But the most significant portion \u2014 nearly 6,000 \u2014 came from maintaining affordable housing in Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn development that President Trump had partially owned. The development was sold in May.The city did not directly spend any money, but it is foregoing the collection of about $460 million in property taxes through 2054, officials said.For Mr. de Blasio, the announcement of new housing numbers has become an annual ritual. He stood on a terrace of a newly built building in Harlem last July. On Thursday, he toured a ninth-floor apartment in a new building in the Bronx, guided by a garrulous 6-year-old named Destin and his mother.\u201cI remind everyone that if we don\u2019t get this right,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, standing at a lectern along Walton Avenue in the summer sun, \u201cit will not be the same New York City anymore.\u201dHe said a number of factors explained the results over the past year and that they could vary in the future.\u201cThere\u2019s the economy, which right now is strong; different economy might yield different results,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut I think one of the reasons we are seeing these new numbers is that a bunch of seeds that got planted finally bore fruit.\u201dFor most casual observers, the newly constructed units are often not evident \u2014 a mix of subsidized units with market-rate housing that is a feature of the mayor\u2019s housing plan. As a result, numbers that might indicate a small town rising in the midst of the city instead melt into the backdrop of New York\u2019s still-hot real estate market.Asked whether his housing plan could alter the city\u2019s housing market and bring down rents, Mr. de Blasio demurred, saying its most direct effect has been to boost the chances of a resident\u2019s success in the city-run affordable housing lotteries.\u201cIt\u2019s better chances of winning the lottery and just using sheer volume,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Takes Consultation to Help a Village", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMs. Cernansky writes about environmental, social justice and health issues.Gabriel Browne, a small farmer in Liberia\u2019s Harlandville Township, thought a biofuel project of Buchanan Renewables, a Liberia-based company that produces fuel for energy plants from biomass, would be life-changing for his family and his community.It was \u2014 but not for the better.Mr. Browne, a father of seven children, is one of more than three million Liberians who depend on farming for subsistence. A majority are still struggling to rebuild their lives since the nation\u2019s brutal civil war ended 15 years ago. He relied on rubber trees for his family\u2019s meager income and to pay for his older children\u2019s schooling.Buchanan Renewables was funded largely by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the United States government\u2019s development financing agency. The project had promised to improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods while bringing a source of renewable energy to a region where most people had no access to electricity. When it failed, OPIC was criticized for having overlooked numerous red flags.Now, small farmers like Mr. Browne who cleared their farms are poorer than they were. They have received no compensation.And though there was a modest public uproar over the project\u2019s failure, news coverage at the time largely missed the main cause: Nobody had asked people in the community what they considered most necessary to improve their lives.This relatively simple step \u2014 consulting the people who would benefit from the project \u2014 is overlooked in a vast majority of overseas philanthropic and development projects, whether they are led by large institutions like OPIC or the World Bank or even small nonprofits. \u201cPeople are well intentioned, but a little bit of good intention with a lot of money can do a lot of harm,\u201d said Natalie Bridgeman-Fields, a human rights lawyer. Her organization, Accountability Counsel, works with communities in developing countries to file grievances in an effort to hold large institutions like OPIC accountable when their projects bring harm rather than improvement to the people to be served.In the Liberia case, Ms. Bridgeman-Fields said, \u201cthey\u2019d never consulted with the community about whether that positive impact was possible, what the negative consequences would be, and there was no awareness of what mitigation measures would be required to address that.\u201dThis is the rule, not the exception. \u201cEvery single case we\u2019ve ever handled with financing from any financial institution involves complaints about consultation,\u201d Sarah Singh, the global communities director for Accountability Counsel, said. \u201cThere are many communities where you get the distinct impression that if that piece had been done correctly, much of the subsequent harm could have been entirely avoided.\u201dThere is a better way. Today, throughout the developing world, new organizations are giving voice to rural communities, enabling them to determine their priorities and decide how to spend investment money. Two modest-size groups that operate with this guiding principle are Village X and Spark MicroGrants, which both work in sub-Saharan Africa and fund projects chosen at the community level. They are finding that when villagers take the lead in development efforts, projects are more likely to identify and achieve goals that will benefit their communities\u2019 particular needs. More important, locals are more likely to take ownership for maintenance or necessary adaptations when projects break down, lose their novelty or need to be updated \u2014 crucial elements for long-term success.In this model, local people decide how to allocate whatever benefits or income are derived from the projects. Michael Buckler, the chief executive of Village X, said that projects have used income from raising goats to finance education for girls. \u201cWe never would have made that connection on our own,\u201d he said. He pointed to another project in Malawi, in which a group of villages wants to build a bridge together because they all lose mobility during the rainy season. Communities that conceive projects themselves, and then see them come successfully to life, develop confidence and skills for further collaboration.It\u2019s important to begin by asking local people about how they envision a better life. When Spark MicroGrants begins working in a village, it asks locals not just to think about the future they want, but also to set specific goals along the pathway ahead. This is \u201cdifferent from asking about what the problems are, because you can lay out a laundry list of problems,\u201d said Sasha Fisher, the organization\u2019s executive director, who was also selected this spring as an inaugural Obama Foundation fellow. It seems obvious. But naming the problem \u2014 like lack of school fees \u2014 doesn\u2019t necessarily bring you closer to a sustainable solution. Unfortunately, development organizations regularly stop at this \u201cneeds assessment\u201d step.\u201cIt\u2019s negative psychology, and it\u2019s very short-term focused,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cWe decided to toy around with asking about the future of the village,\u201d she said. \u201cCommunity members, when we posed this question, came up with all sorts of wonderful ideas about what they want to see \u2014 and then even more ideas for how to get there.\u201dMs. Fisher said that more than 90 percent of Spark-funded projects have been sustained for over two years, 94 percent of community members continue to meet on a regular basis, and nearly as many have started secondary projects. A central element of the process is that the whole community is involved, and that Spark meeting facilitators are not allowed to impose their ideas; they can only help guide the conversation.Now, the goal-setting process guides all of Spark\u2019s work. \u201cThere\u2019s so much talk about the end of poverty, but how does the world look when there is no poverty?\u201d Ms. Fisher said, adding that the communities must be able to envision the future in specific ways.And people enjoy being invited to participate in that process. In Kenya, for example, some local radio stations, like Pamoja in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera region and Wajir in the country\u2019s north, are experimenting with asking listeners to call in with feedback about aid projects in their areas.In response to my questions, OPIC said it has increased its consultation with indigenous peoples, and it has enhanced its monitoring and oversight for projects \u201cthat pose a heightened risk of adverse environmental, labor or human rights impacts.\u201d The agency said that it also requires \u201cmore robust grievance mechanisms that enable those who may be harmed by a project to raise concerns.\u201dHowever, none of the agency\u2019s responses addressed whether it would compensate villagers hurt by the Buchanan Renewables project. Mr. Browne said it has done nothing. Ms. Singh said the International Finance Corporation standards are an improvement, but while they call for more community consultation, in practice the process often falls short. Part of the problem is that community consultation is not easy \u2014 which is why groups like Village X and Spark MicroGrants have much to teach the big organizations.\u201cIt\u2019s time-consuming and it\u2019s hard to go into a community where people may not be educated, may not have access to the internet,\u201d Ms. Singh said. Language differences and logistics may present barriers. More important, genuine humility is required, and that\u2019s something with which experts in development organizations have long struggled. \u201cConsultation\u2019s not just informing people that this is what\u2019s going to happen,\u201c she said. \u201cIt\u2019s asking, \u2018What\u2019s your opinion?\u2019 It\u2019s being open to listening to directly impacted people about their hopes and fears. It\u2019s being open to changing a project\u2019s design.\u201dMyson Jambo co-founded Village X with Mr. Buckler for exactly this reason. He grew up in rural Malawi, where consultation was never the norm. \u201cYou can see this huge amount of money being invested in a project. People in the community \u2014 they don\u2019t want it,\u201d he said.Village X views sub-Saharan Africa as made up of micro-democracies at the village level. Village members know what is practical and feasible and don\u2019t need help choosing projects. They need help acquiring the resources to start them \u2014 which is what Village X helps with, through a crowdfunding platform that anyone can reach online. The group works with village chiefs to choose committees that go around soliciting ideas and opinions from the community. When the community decides on a project, the committee draws up a budget. The community has to provide 5 percent of that budget in cash, which Mr. Buckler said is essential to making sure the community is invested in the project. At that point, the project goes up on the Village X website for crowdfunding.Some projects funded by Spark have prompted local governments to step up and fulfill more of their own long-neglected obligations. (In recent months, Spark has even received requests to work with local governments and community organizations in the United States.) Ms. Fisher said that in one Ugandan village, Spark funded a school building, and not long after, the government started paying teachers\u2019 salaries. \u201cPeople need to be at the forefront of their own change,\u201d she said. \u201cAnywhere in the world.\u201dUntil that happens, communities continue to be vulnerable to calamities like the one Mr. Browne suffered. \u201cThey are all worse off than they were before Buchanan Renewables arrived,\u201d said Francis Colee, a lawyer in Monrovia, Liberia, who served as an advocate for the farmers. He continues to see communities being ignored in the planning of projects that are supposed to be helping them. \u201cCommunities are not being properly consulted and the result is harmful to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the country. It\u2019s a common pattern. It has to change.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated when Liberia\u2019s civil war ended.

His American friends say his politics were moderate, maybe even progressive.Then he returned to India.There, he joined the governing Hindu right political party and became a member of Parliament and then a minister.Across the country, the images of Mr. Sinha draping wreaths of marigolds around the men\u2019s necks have started a conversation about whether the state of Indian politics has become so poisoned by religious hatred and extremism that even an ostensibly worldly and successful politician can\u2019t resist its pull.In this atmosphere, some conclude that Mr. Sinha might actually win votes for his maneuver.\u201cHe\u2019ll get some benefit,\u201d said Rajiv Kumar, a homeopathic medicine salesman and one of Mr. Sinha\u2019s constituents. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with what he did; it\u2019s only going to encourage more lynching. But Jayant was concerned his party would dump him, and this will help.\u201dMr. Sinha says he now feels horrible about garlanding the convicts.\u201cIn a highly polarized environment, this became a spark and I regret giving the spark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201dFor decades, a center-leftist political organization, the Indian National Congress, dominated politics.It didn\u2019t hurt that Mr. Sinha\u2019s father was a senior member of the Indian Parliament and the Bharatiya Janata Party. With Mr. Modi\u2019s backing, Mr. Sinha easily won the election to take over his father\u2019s seat. He was made a finance minister and then a minister for civil aviation, a post he still holds.The territory his life spans is dramatic. Mr. Sinha, 55, owns a beautiful home in Chestnut Hill, an enclave outside Boston where his wife still lives. He has degrees from some of the world\u2019s best universities, including the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, India\u2019s capital, and Harvard Business School.But the area he represents, centered in the bushy town of Hazaribagh (which means \u201ca thousand gardens\u201d), is poor, troubled and socially conservative. Lying more than 500 miles east of New Delhi in the state of Jharkhand, it is home to coal mines, Maoist rebels and land-grabbing gangs.Like so much of India today, Hazaribagh is more polarized between majority Hindus and minority Muslims than it has been in a long time. Many people here support Hindu vigilante groups, especially the so-called cow protectors who hunt down those who break Hinduism\u2019s taboo against killing cows.It was one such vigilante group that swarmed Alimuddin Ansari, a Muslim trader, in Mr. Sinha\u2019s constituency last year. A rumor spread that Mr. Ansari was transporting beef, and a mob dragged him out of his van and beat him. Police officers eventually pulled him away, but he died a few hours later from internal injuries, officials said.His family is now broke.\u201cMy life is doomed,\u201d said Mariam Khatoon, his widow. She sat in a plastic chair in a ramshackle house, the concrete foundation cracking beneath her feet.But a higher court recently granted an appeal, saying the evidence was flimsy. Upon their release on bail, eight of the men went to visit Mr. Sinha at his house, where he was waiting with wreaths of marigolds.There is still doubt about the circumstances of Mr. Ansari\u2019s death. A lawyer representing some of the convicted men said that, yes, the mob had roughed up Mr. Ansari but that it was actually police officers who beat him to death, in custody. The lawyer pointed to photos that have been circulating on social media that show Mr. Ansari looking alert and apparently not badly injured as officers led him away from the mob. The trial court had heard many of these arguments and rejected them.Mr. Sinha said he was helping the convicts because there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that they killed Mr. Ansari. He has actively supported their legal defense, paying several hundred dollars to one of the defense lawyers and connecting this lawyer to an experienced attorney friend to craft a persuasive appeal.He celebrated their release from jail with sweets and flowers, he said, to show how happy he was that they \u201cgot a fresh lease on life.\u201dBut Mr. Sinha concedes that he never made a condolence call to Mr. Ansari\u2019s widow, who is also his constituent. He said it was too dangerous to visit her, an excuse that raises questions. Her scruffy little house sits on a quiet lane. And with his ministerial security detail, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone in that neighborhood bothering Mr. Sinha.National elections are scheduled for next year, and Mr. Sinha might have been feeling vulnerable. He has hewed to the political right since his time in the United States, but in today\u2019s India, his right may not be right enough.Neither he nor his father came up through the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu ideological group that molded Mr. Modi and other top members of his party. Recently, Mr. Sinha had been taking heat from a former lawmaker in his constituency who said he was not doing enough to help the convicted killers.\u201cThere was a lot of resentment toward Jayant,\u2019\u2019 said Abhijit Sen, a senior journalist in Hazaribagh. \u201cThose others forced him to act.\u201dMr. Sinha insisted that he had tried to stay out of the case because it was so divisive. But after he studied the files, he said, he became convinced that there was much more to it than initially reported. He regrets the garlands but not helping the convicts.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s simply a matter of justice,\u201d he said.But the criticism keeps coming.And a recent letter to the newspaper The Indian Express was headlined: \u201cDespicable Act.\u201dThis headline and article have been edited to reflect fairness concerns toward the story\u2019s subject, Jayant Sinha, a politician in India who has been criticized for garlanding a group of men convicted of attacking and killing a Muslim man. An earlier version of the headline was not intended to suggest that he was personally motivated by religious hatred, and the article has been changed to remove any implication that Mr. Sinha\u2019s public wearing of traditional dress and showering supporters with flower petals was a sign of Hindu nationalist intent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan to Exhume Franco Renews Spain\u2019s Wrestle With History", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL, Spain \u2014 After celebrating Mass last month, congregants here at the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos basilica walked to the back of the altar to pay homage to Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator who is buried here.They stood in silence before the tomb. A handful made a fascist salute. Some bent down to touch the stone slab, which is engraved with Franco\u2019s name and was covered with two bouquets of flowers. One person tried to take a photograph \u2014 only to be told off by a security guard.\u201cFranco was a dictator, but a good one,\u201d said Estela Tapias, who attended the Mass with her husband and two children. \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why these Communists want to take him out.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez unexpectedly came to power in June, replacing Mariano Rajoy and his conservative administration. Within days of taking office, he announced that his government wanted to exhume Franco and move him to a more modest burial place, as part of an effort to atone for the crimes of the civil war and the repression that followed the conflict.The basilica and its giant stone cross dominate the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos, or Valley of the Fallen, and were built by Franco to honor those who \u201cfell for God and Spain\u201d in his 1939 victory in the Spanish Civil War.The site, near the town of San Lorenzo de el Escorial, about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Madrid, is one of Europe\u2019s largest mass graves, housing the remains of at least 33,000 people. Most had fought for Franco, but the monument also contains the bones of many of his Republican opponents who were anonymously dumped there, some of which were allegedly gathered from mass graves across the country in order to swell the numbers.Some families have been demanding that their loved ones be returned to them for proper burial. In April, the remains of four men \u2014 from both sides of the civil war \u2014 were extracted from the site at the request of their relatives and after a lengthy legal battle. The ruling could pave the way for hundreds more to be exhumed.Paul Preston, a British historian and biographer of Franco, said that Spain was an anomaly in Europe in keeping a \u201cplace of pilgrimage for its fascist dictator\u201d \u2014 there are no monuments to Adolf Hitler in Germany or in Austria, nor to Benito Mussolini in Italy. Among the more than 250,000 visitors to the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos each year, Mr. Preston said, many are devotees of Franco \u201cbrought up to believe that he was a benefactor for Spain.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez, the prime minister, leads a fragile Socialist government that has only a quarter of the seats in Parliament.Franco decided to carve the basilica into the mountainside shortly after winning the civil war. Construction lasted 18 years, with Republican prisoners among the labor force. The basilica also became the resting place of several nuns and other members of the clergy killed during the civil war \u2014 some of whom were later beatified by the pope \u2014 as well as that of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the leader of the far-right Falangist party, who was killed in 1936 and was considered a martyr by Franco\u2019s followers. His tomb is on the other side of the altar to that of Franco.Last month, Mr. S\u00e1nchez met with Archbishop Ricardo Bl\u00e1zquez of Valladolid, the leader of the confederation of Spanish bishops. After the meeting, the Rev. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil Tamayo, the secretary general of the confederation, suggested that the church would prefer to stay on the sidelines of what it considered to be a political debate over Franco\u2019s remains.The basilica is run by Benedictine priests who live in an adjacent abbey. While the abbot, Santiago Cantera, long opposed any attempt to alter the site, this year he dropped a court appeal to stop the removal of the four civil war victims.Some in Spain echo the feeling that moving Franco would simply be a case of politicians trying to make capital out of the painful events of the civil war. In that view, Franco built the basilica, so he has the right to be buried there. Others say the dictator should be removed because the site was built for those killed in the civil war, while Franco died decades later in a hospital bed.In fact, there are no official records showing what Franco wanted to happen after his death, even though Mr. Preston, the historian, recounts in his biography of the dictator that Franco told the architect that he should be buried at the site.The exhumation plan comes as Franco\u2019s family is already entangled in several disputes after the death of the dictator\u2019s daughter, his only child, in December. The local authorities in Franco\u2019s home region, Galicia, want to block the sale of a family estate because it stands on land he expropriated.Mr. S\u00e1nchez called for the exhumation of the remains to be \u201cimmediate.\u201d Although he has not set a date, the Socialists probably want to avoid a repeat of the protracted debate that took place under Mr. Zapatero\u2019s government, when a commission of experts was appointed to help transform the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos into \u201ca place of reconciled memory.\u201dLuis Casta\u00f1on, a data analyst from Valladolid who was visiting the site with his wife, said that attending Mass in Franco\u2019s basilica allowed him \u201cto pray for the dead, for reconciliation and for the unbreakable unity of Spain.\u201d He argued that the site should be left untouched: \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t like this place isn\u2019t forced to come here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cardinal Theodore McCarrick Resigns Amid Sexual Abuse Scandal", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, from the College of Cardinals, ordering him to a \u201clife of prayer and penance\u201d after allegations that the cardinal sexually abused minors and adult seminarians over the course of decades, the Vatican announced on Saturday.Acting swiftly to contain a widening sex abuse scandal at the highest levels of the Roman Catholic Church, the pope officially suspended the cardinal from the exercise of any public ministry after receiving his resignation letter Friday evening. Pope Francis also demanded in a statement that the prelate remain in seclusion \u201cuntil the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial.\u201dCardinal McCarrick appears to be the first cardinal in history to step down from the College of Cardinals because of sexual abuse allegations. While he remains a priest pending the outcome of a Vatican trial, he has been stripped of his highest honor and will no longer be called upon to advise the pope and travel on his behalf.On Saturday, the former altar boy whose abuse allegations started the unraveling of the cardinal\u2019s lifetime of honors said in an interview that hearing news of the resignation felt like a \u201cgut punch.\u201dThe 62-year-old man, who identified himself only as Mike to protect his privacy, said he believed that Cardinal McCarrick was resigning only because he was being forced to, not because he was accepting responsibility.\u201cI am kind of appalled that it has taken this long for him to get caught,\u201d he said, in the first time he has spoken publicly. \u201cBut I am glad I am the first one that could open the door to other people.\u201dResignations from the College of Cardinals are extremely rare for any reason. The last resignation was of the French prelate Louis Billot in 1927, because of political tensions with the Holy See.Cardinal McCarrick\u2019s resignation comes as Pope Francis faces increased pressure to show he is serious about cracking down on bishops and cardinals found to have abused people or covered up abuse.Victims and their advocates have long held that bishops have not been held accountable for hiding sexual abuse. With his conviction, Archbishop Wilson became the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to be convicted of concealing abuse crimes.Last month, Msgr. Carlo Alberto Capella, a former Vatican diplomat in Washington, was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison by a Vatican tribunal for possessing and distributing child pornography. His sentence was the first in modern history that the Vatican\u2019s own tribunal had handed down in a clerical abuse case. He will now face a canonical trial, which could lead to his removal from the priesthood.As the allegations against Cardinal McCarrick continued to mount in the last month, at least one prominent American cardinal has called for sweeping changes in how the Roman Catholic Church handles sex abuse allegations against bishops and allegations involving adult seminarians, who were not covered in the church\u2019s sex abuse reforms of 2002.\u201cThese cases and others require more than apologies,\u201d Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThey raise up the fact that when charges are brought regarding a bishop or a cardinal, a major gap still exists in the church\u2019s policies on sexual conduct and sexual abuse.\u201dThe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has not responded to calls for broader reform since the allegations against Cardinal McCarrick were made public last month. The president of the conference, Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo, released a brief statement Saturday saying that the pope\u2019s acceptance of the resignation \u201creflects the priority the Holy Father places on the need for protection and care for all our people and the way failures in this area affect the life of the Church in the United States.\u201dTerence McKiernan, president of BishopAccountability.org, which documents the sexual abuse scandal in the church and advocates for victims, called for Pope Francis to make the trial proceedings against Cardinal McCarrick public, and to open an investigation into how Cardinal McCarrick was permitted to advance his church career despite repeated warnings against him.\u201cThe officials responsible must be identified and disciplined, and the investigative file must be made public,\u201d Mr. McKiernan said in a statement.Much remains unanswered about Cardinal McCarrick\u2019s alleged abuses, including who in the church hierarchy knew what and when, and whether, as a supervisor, the cardinal handled abuse allegations appropriately in the dioceses he led.\u201cThe resignation of one man is not the end, it\u2019s really the beginning,\u201d said Patrick Noaker, the lawyer representing the two men who said the cardinal had abused them as minors. \u201cWe now have to go out and find out if others were hurt.\u201dElisabetta Povoledo reported from Rome, and Sharon Otterman from New York.

{"Headline": "Tabloid Company, Aiding Trump Campaign, May Have Crossed Line Into Politics", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal authorities examining the work President Trump\u2019s former lawyer did to squelch embarrassing stories before the 2016 election have come to believe that an important ally in that effort, the tabloid company American Media Inc., at times acted more as a political supporter than as a news organization, according to people briefed on the investigation.It could also spell trouble for the company, which publishes The National Enquirer, raising thorny questions about when coverage that is favorable to a candidate strays into overt political activity, and when First Amendment protections should apply.By burying Ms. McDougal\u2019s story during the campaign in a practice known in the tabloid industry as \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d A.M.I. protected Mr. Trump from negative publicity that could have harmed his election chances, spending money to do so.The authorities believe that the company was not always operating in what campaign finance law calls a \u201clegitimate press function,\u201d according to the people briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That may explain why prosecutors did not follow typical Justice Department protocol to avoid subpoenaing news organizations when possible, and to give journalists advance warning when demanding documents or other information.Prosecutors did not warn A.M.I. before subpoenaing executives there in the spring, people with knowledge of the process said. A.M.I., which has denied any wrongdoing, did not challenge the move.A spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York, which is handling the inquiry, declined to comment.Cameron Stracher, an A.M.I. lawyer, indicated that the company was cooperating with the investigation.\u201cA.M.I. respects the legitimate law enforcement activities by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York,\u201d he said. But he suggested there was some give-and-take in what A.M.I. was willing to share, adding that it \u201chas asserted and will continue to assert its First Amendment rights in order to protect its news-gathering and editorial operations.\u201dMr. Cohen remains the primary focus of the investigation, but A.M.I.\u2019s prominent place in what could become one of the biggest campaign finance scandals in recent years is unusual given the wide latitude news organizations have under the First Amendment.While moves by prosecutors to subpoena journalists usually draw loud protest from groups that advocate press protections, there has so far been no rallying of support for A.M.I.Bruce D. Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said his group hadn\u2019t mounted a staunch defense in part because the publisher had not asked for help. The situation is otherwise too murky for his group to wade into without A.M.I.\u2019s guidance, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for press advocates to get behind it because, one, we haven\u2019t been asked, and two, we just don\u2019t know enough about the circumstances to be out with them on it,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Alexandra Ellerbeck, the North America program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the group had not been focused on A.M.I., but added, \u201cYou don\u2019t want people doing activity that would otherwise be illegal and putting the name of press on it for protections.\u201dThe authorities focused on A.M.I.\u2019s payment to Ms. McDougal early on in their investigation of Mr. Cohen.The company completed the deal with Ms. McDougal in August 2016, paying $150,000 for rights to publish fitness columns under her name and for exclusive rights to her story about the affair, which Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives have denied. (After the campaign she negotiated permission to answer press questions about the alleged relationship, and later successfully sued to break the agreement.)If evidence shows that Mr. Cohen was consulting with A.M.I. about the arrangement, and that the intention of the deal was to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s election prospects, then the publisher and Mr. Cohen could be exposed to election law violations.Corporations are barred from spending money to influence election outcomes in coordination with federal campaigns and candidates. Campaigns cannot accept individual donations of more than $5,400 per election cycle.\u201cIf this money is spent in coordination with Trump or the campaign, then it\u2019s a contribution to Trump and the campaign, and then it\u2019s illegal,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the founder of Democracy 21, a group supporting campaign finance regulation and enforcement.If faced with campaign finance charges \u2014 which would be extraordinary for a news organization \u2014 the company could argue that its executives did not know the ins and outs of the laws they were alleged to have violated. Under criminal provisions, prosecutors would have to prove the violation was \u201cknowing and willful,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign could argue that Mr. Cohen acted on his behalf without his knowledge, as his lawyer rather than an agent of his campaign. Mr. Giuliani appeared to lay the groundwork for such an argument on Friday when he said that the conversation captured on the tape, which took place weeks after A.M.I. completed the McDougal deal, appeared to be the first time Mr. Trump had heard about the arrangement and was therefore \u201cexculpatory.\u201dIt is not clear whether prosecutors have reviewed the recording, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized during a raid of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office this year and which became tied up in a courtroom fight over what materials attorney-client privilege should shield from prosecutors.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis said on Friday, \u201cWhen the recording is heard, it will not hurt Mr. Cohen.\u201dJaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Bill Browder, Kremlin Foe Singled Out in Putin\u2019s Offer?", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kremlin, Mr. Putin said, would allow Mr. Mueller and his team to travel to Russia and be present at the questioning of 12 Russian military intelligence officers the special counsel indicted last week for hacking into the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and the emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.In exchange, however, the United States would have to permit Russian law enforcement officials to take part in interrogations of people \u201cwho have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia.\u201d He singled out one man: William F. Browder.Mr. Putin on Monday detailed on television a variation of some of the allegations that the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, brought to the Trump Tower meeting \u2014 namely that some of Mr. Browder\u2019s associates had funneled $400 million to the Clinton campaign with money illegally moved out of Russia.\u201cBusiness associates of his have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cThey never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amounts of money, $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdditionally, Mr. Putin declared, \u201cwe have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions.\u201dMr. Putin offered no evidence to support his claims about money moving to the Clinton campaign, let alone with assistance from intelligence officers.Yet his claims in some ways echoed allegations that have been leveled by Mr. Trump and his supporters about financial corruption by Mrs. Clinton and her campaign, as well as the contention that sinister forces within a bureaucratic \u201cdeep state\u201d had sought to thwart his election victory.The heads of the national security agencies on Thursday said that Russia was still trying to influence United States elections, contradicting statements made by President Trump.Mr. Trump later called Mr. Putin\u2019s suggestion of an investigative quid pro quo \u201can incredible offer,\u201d though how such reciprocity would work was unclear. Mr. Browder long ago gave up his American passport in favor of British citizenship.In a phone interview on Monday, Mr. Browder said that Mr. Putin\u2019s denunciation was just another sign of the Kremlin\u2019s unhappiness with the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that Mr. Browder championed, in which the United States imposed sanctions against Russia.\u201cIt\u2019s a true affirmation of the fact that we\u2019ve found Putin\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel with the Magnitsky Act,\u201d Mr. Browder said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically lost it, emotionally, because his own money in the West is now being seized under that Magnitsky Act.\u201dOut of safety concerns, Mr. Browder, who holds a British passport, would not say where he was located. But he said he did not believe Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks put him in any greater danger.\u201cAmerica is a rule-of-law country, and I think that the rule of law will protect me,\u201d he said.Mr. Browder expressed puzzlement over what Mr. Putin might have been referring to on Monday when he claimed that Mr. Browder\u2019s associates steered $400 million to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201cThis is just part of their weird non-fact-based emotional reaction,\u201d Mr. Browder said. \u201cHe has become unhinged.\u201dBy Mr. Putin\u2019s first term in office, Mr. Browder, who co-founded Hermitage Capital Management, had risen to become the largest portfolio investor in Russia, with more than $4 billion under management as of 2005. Along the way, he ran afoul of the Kremlin by becoming a fierce critic of weak corporate governing standards.In November 2005, Mr. Browder was turned back after arriving in Moscow for a business trip, and was later declared a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d as a result of his battle against corporate corruption.Russian authorities then raided his offices, seized Hermitage\u2019s investment companies and used them to fraudulently obtain $230 million in tax rebates. When the firm\u2019s tax lawyer, Sergei L. Magnitsky, investigated the crime, he was arrested by the same officers he had implicated and imprisoned. He died nearly a year later at age 37, the result, Mr. Browder claims, of months of torture.Since then, Mr. Browder has devoted much of his life to seeking justice for Mr. Magnitsky. His campaigning led Congress to adopt the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act in 2012, which imposed visa sanctions on and froze the assets of those involved in Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s detention. The legislation was the first time the United States had sanctioned Russia in 35 years; Mr. Browder has urged the European Union to adopt similar legislation.He then faced a new fight, as Russia sought to get British courts to find and freeze his assets and enforce a civil judgment against him in Russia.Reports of the president\u2019s comments prompted outcry from some lawmakers, but they were followed by notable silence from others.Russia has pushed several times to get Interpol to issue arrest orders against Mr. Browder, and it announced this summer that it would try yet again.In the summer of 2016, though, the Kremlin tried another approach. Ms. Veselnitskaya, a lawyer with ties to the country\u2019s powerful prosecutor general, approached the Trump campaign with an offer of help. At a meeting at Trump Tower, attended by Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and the campaign\u2019s chairman, Paul Manafort, Ms. Veselnitskaya presented a memo that detailed the claims against Mr. Browder, and alleged that his lobbying in the United States had gained traction because of the political connections of the principals in one of the firms that invested with him, Ziff Brothers Investments.The memo does not offer any specific data to support those conclusions, and public records do not support the notion that any of the Ziffs, or their firm, were among the leading financial supporters of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.Federal Election Commission records indicate that the Ziffs and their immediate family had donated only about $35,000 to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s various committees over the years. And federal election laws limit the amount that individuals can donate directly to campaigns to $2,700 per election.Taken together, the brothers behind the firm \u2014 Daniel, Dirk and Robert Ziff \u2014 combined with their spouses and parents have donated nearly $5 million to Democratic and Republican campaigns and committees since the 1980s, including $1.1 million to the Democratic National Committee.The Ziff Brothers firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.It was not clear from where Mr. Putin derived the $400 million figure, or whether he was referring to the Ziffs or possibly other donors as well. Former Clinton campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment.Members of the Trump campaign team said they struggled to understand the significance of the information offered by Ms. Veselnitskaya, and the meeting wrapped up quickly. Ms. Veselnitskaya initially denied any ties to the Russian government, but has since said she has worked as an \u201cinformant\u201d for Russian prosecutors.Last month, Russia\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuri Chaika, seemed to foreshadow Mr. Putin\u2019s move in Helsinki.\u201cI think in the near future, stronger efforts will be taken by Russia in the international arena,\u201d he said. Mr. Chaika added that the Russian government would not allow Mr. Browder \u201cto sleep soundly.\u201dIn Helsinki, Mr. Putin said that Mr. Mueller would be welcome to come to Russia. But the price would be William Browder.\u201cWe can meet you halfway,\u201d he said.Michael Schwirtz reported from London, and Kenneth P. Vogel from Washington.

{"Headline": "A Conservative Court Push Decades in the Making, With Effects for Decades to Come", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of the years of vetting and grooming and lobbying and list-making by conservative legal figures frustrated by Republican appointees who drifted to the left arguably has come down to this moment, when they stand on the precipice of appointing a fifth justice who, they hope, will at last establish a bench firmly committed to their principles.\u201cThey\u2019ve been pushing back for 30 years, and, obviously, the announcement tonight is a big step in the right direction,\u201d said Curt Levey, the president of the Committee for Justice, a conservative activist group, who has been working toward this goal full time since 2005. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the first time we can really say we have a conservative court, really the first time since the 1930s.\u201dThat has raised the stakes for groups on the left and the right, guaranteeing an incendiary, ideological, partisan and well-financed confirmation battle in a capital already riven by incendiary, ideological, partisan and well-financed politics. Activists on both sides wasted no time on Monday night issuing their predictable full-throated endorsements or scathing condemnations within minutes of Mr. Trump\u2019s televised announcement.But if the president succeeds in confirming his selection, Judge Kavanaugh, who sits on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is expected to join Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch in forming a much more consistently conservative majority than before.The court has swung from left to right and back again throughout its history, of course, and other presidents tried to muscle their way to friendly majorities, most infamously President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s failed court-packing scheme in 1937. Never before, however, has an entire political apparatus arisen to systematically engineer a more dependable Supreme Court over the course of a generation.Since the 1980s, a network of activists and organizations has worked assiduously to reach this point, determined to avoid the disappointment they felt after Republican appointees like Earl Warren, William J. Brennan Jr., David H. Souter, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Justice Kennedy proved more moderate or liberal once they joined the court.One of the leading figures behind the effort was Ed Meese, who served as attorney general to President Ronald Reagan, two of whose appointees, Justices O\u2019Connor and Kennedy, proved less conservative than supporters originally hoped. Mr. Meese has made it a mission since then to advise subsequent Republican presidents on judicial nominations. In a nod to his central role, Mr. Meese was present in the East Room of the White House for Monday night\u2019s announcement, and Mr. Trump singled him out during his speech.Inspired by Mr. Meese, groups like the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, the Judicial Crisis Network, the Judicial Action Group and Mr. Levey\u2019s Committee for Justice have for years sought to develop a new generation of younger legal conservatives who would go into government and fill out lower levels of the judiciary. \u201cYou have to have that army before you can credential them, and that army just didn\u2019t exist before Reagan,\u201d Mr. Levey said.The idea was to vet and cull potential candidates for the Supreme Court long before vacancies even arose, so that Republican presidents could pick from rosters of would-be nominees whose records were known. No one wanted any more surprises.\u201cYou\u2019re simply not going to get Souters anymore because no one will come up who nobody\u2019s interacted with,\u201d said Steven Teles, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and the author of \u201cThe Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law.\u201dIndeed, the last time a Republican president even contemplated candidates from outside that known universe of conservative talent, he paid a price. President George W. Bush\u2019s nomination of Harriet E. Miers, his White House counsel and longtime adviser, collapsed in 2005 amid a full-fledged revolt by conservative activists who did not consider her one of their own.Among those who argued against her nomination from within the White House? Judge Kavanaugh, who at the time was serving as Mr. Bush\u2019s staff secretary and participated in some of the private sessions preparing Ms. Miers for confirmation hearings, sessions that did not go well. Mr. Kavanaugh instead favored the selection of Justice Alito, then an appeals judge and a known and trusted figure within the conservative legal community. Justice Alito eventually got the nod after Ms. Miers withdrew.Mr. Trump, whatever his other deviations from conservative orthodoxy, seemed to take a lesson from that. He has made it a top priority to restock lower-level courts with judges popular among legal conservatives, and for his two Supreme Court nominations stuck close to the options they presented to him. For Mr. Trump, it is an implicit bargain, a way of keeping his political base in his corner despite misgivings that many conservatives harbor over his other policies or various scandals.\u201cAny judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the D.C. swamp,\u201d Mr. Casey said in a statement.The political left, naturally, has its own advocacy organizations and lists of favored candidates when Democratic presidents have Supreme Court vacancies to fill. For the most part, in fact, the four-member bloc of Democratic appointees on the court \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 has voted more in lock step than the Republican appointees.If Judge Kavanaugh follows Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s example so far, Chief Justice Roberts may become the major swing vote. He has surprised, and disappointed, conservatives on occasion, most notably when he voted to uphold the constitutionality of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care program. But Chief Justice Roberts has still been much more reliably conservative than Justice Kennedy.Still, some longtime legal scholars said it would be a mistake to assume that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment would change the court fundamentally for the foreseeable future. \u201cThe possibility of drift is always there,\u201d Mr. Levey said. And if a Democrat were to win the White House in 2020, a conservative vacancy could still swing the court back.\u201cPeople say this will cement a conservative court for a generation,\u201d said Michael W. McConnell, a former appeals court judge who was considered for the Supreme Court by Mr. Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. The court goes back and forth and, personally, I think it\u2019s rather a good thing that the court have solid representations from both perspectives. This is a divided country.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Violent Extremist or Political Candidate? In Pakistan Election, You Can Be Both", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 Aurangzeb Farooqi is a leader of a political party that is banned in Pakistan for espousing sectarian violence. He faces charges of spreading religious hatred that was linked to the murders of several Shiite activists.He is also a candidate for national political office, running with the blessing of Pakistani courts.Mr. Farooqi is among several candidates with ties to Islamist extremist groups who were the subject of last-ditch petitions by activists seeking to bar them from contesting elections this month. An election tribunal threw out those petitions last month, claiming there were not enough valid complaints to justify barring the candidates.Despite publicly proclaimed campaigns against religious extremism, the ability of candidates like Mr. Farooqi to campaign suggests that far from being curbed, extremists are being encouraged.This month, a new party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik was approved to run on a platform of punishing those who blaspheme Islam, an issue that has been abused to terrorize the country\u2019s minorities.To prevent being blacklisted by the task force, which could lead to international sanctions, Pakistan agreed last month to an action plan to crack down on terrorism at home.But almost simultaneously, Pakistan\u2019s electoral commission was paving the way for candidates with extremist ties to run for office.Some of the petitioners were victims of the terrorism they say was inflicted upon their communities by candidates like Mr. Farooqi. He is a leader of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat, a banned radical group that incites hatred and violence against Pakistan\u2019s minority Shiite population. A.S.W.J. is widely believed to be the political front for Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an even deadlier sectarian militant group with ties to Al Qaeda. The party denies any link.With all obstacles to his candidacy removed, Mr. Farooqi is running for a parliamentary seat representing Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city, and has a good chance of winning after losing the last election in 2013 by 202 votes.\u201cWhy are these terrorists now allowed to become our parliamentarians?\u201d demanded Asad Gokal, 20, in an interview in Karachi. Mr. Gokal was one of the activists petitioning against Mr. Farooqi\u2019s candidacy. His voice shook with anger as he described the Karachi crowds Mr. Farooqi has agitated in recent years, preaching anti-Shiite sermons that Mr. Gokal believes led to the murder of his uncle and friend. In video clips of Mr. Farooqi\u2019s speeches, he can be seen shouting, \u201cShia are infidels!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a university student,\u201d Mr. Gokal said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be my duty \u2014 the Election Commission of Pakistan should be monitoring these groups.\u201d Instead, he said, the government is giving them legitimacy.Altaf Khan, spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s permanent election commission, said the commission simply followed court orders. But activists and politicians say the courts are influenced by the military, which has undertaken numerous coups in the country\u2019s modern history.The military has denied it influences the courts.\u201cThe international community will have to respect the sovereignty and laws of my country,\u201d Mr. Khan said in an interview. If anyone has a complaint against a candidate supported by evidence, he said, \u201cthey should let us know.\u201dOmar Shahid Hamid, the senior police superintendent for Karachi\u2019s southern district, used to conduct regular check-ins with Mr. Farooqi as a member of the police counterterrorism unit. He said he was surprised that Mr. Farooqi\u2019s nomination papers were not rejected, but not that he was running.\u201cFarooqi has always had an interest in electoral politics and a desire to get mainstreamed, to be accepted as a political force and get rid of his baggage as a militant,\u201d Mr. Hamid said. \u201cThey see this as the future, the only way forward with the establishment.\u201dIn Pakistan, \u201cthe establishment\u201d is code for the military, which is accused by both Pakistan\u2019s former government and the international community of supporting extremist groups to achieve its defense and foreign policy objectives.The military in recent years has discussed plans to \u201cmainstream\u201d extremists, allowing them to shed their violent pasts and become politicians, according to cabinet members of the previous government who were involved in those discussions. It is a plan opposed by the incumbent government and activists across the country.Mr. Sharif says the military pressed the courts to disqualify him as prime minister and bar him from future electoral bids.By that time, Mr. Farooqi was already campaigning with confidence in his impoverished Karachi neighborhood, greeting and shaking the hands of dozens one night while sidestepping open gutters clogged with garbage.\u201cTeacher! Teacher!\u201d young voters cried out to Mr. Farooqi, asking to take photographs with him.\u201cWe believe in democratic process,\u201d said Mr. Farooqi, who denies that he is behind sectarian violence. \u201cI am from the area. If I am elected, I will be representative of the people and try to resolve their civic issues.\u201dIn the Khuzdar district of Baluchistan, a neglected northwestern province that has long faced a separatist insurgency, another notorious militant, Shafiq Mengal, is preparing his parliamentary bid.Though Mr. Mengal is not on the fourth schedule, a militant group that he founded, Baloch Musalla Difa Tanzeem, was banned by the government in 2010. Law enforcement officials say he then joined Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the outfit tied to Al Qaeda.\u201cIt is easy to be registered as a candidate, but it was made difficult for me by my political opponents,\u201d Mr. Mengal said in an interview at his home. \u201cThey made false accusations against me.\u201d\u201cI have never supported violence on the basis of ideological differences,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is propaganda.\u201dHis opponent, Akhtar Mengal \u2014 no relation \u2014 disputes this.Akhtar Mengal, a provincial lawmaker and former chief minister of Baluchistan, said Shafiq Mengal was responsible for the killing of dozens of civilians in the province and had worked with the country\u2019s security forces to quell anti-military dissent. He also accused his opponent of running a kidnap-for-ransom scheme and extortion operations, an accusation supported by Mr. Hamid, Karachi\u2019s police superintendent.\u201cWherever you find missing persons in Baluchistan, you find Shafiq Mengal,\u201d Akhtar Mengal said in an interview.But officials have still found such candidates acceptable, he said, and even desirable.\u201cThe establishment,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the military \u2014 \u201cwants to wash them and dry clean them and push them into power.\u201dMaria Abi-Habib and Zia ur-Rehman reported from Karachi, and Shah Meer Baloch from Khuzdar, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

Then came a curious noise, like a strong wind.She knew instinctively what it meant: One of the new dams under construction near her village in southern Laos had failed. She began banging on her neighbors\u2019 doors, she recounted, urging them to flee to higher ground.\u201cThe water is coming!\u201d Ms. Chantamart roared.Within a half-hour, the water in her village, Xay Done Khong, was more than 30 feet deep, and rising.Ms. Chantamart, 35, and many of her neighbors escaped the deadly flood. But others were not so lucky when an auxiliary dam, part of the billion-dollar Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric project, failed Monday evening amid heavy rains, sending more than 170 billion cubic feet of water rushing downstream.At a news conference on Wednesday, the prime minister, Thongloun Sisoulith, said that 131 people were still missing and more than 3,000 were homeless. Many had been rescued from rooftops and trees after villages and farmland were flooded.At least 26 people have been reported killed.Ms. Chantamart said that hundreds of people from her village had escaped, but that 15 people were still missing, nine of them children. She had been unable to reach their homes on Monday because the floodwaters had climbed too high.\u201cI\u2019m very worried about them, from the bottom of my heart,\u201d she said.After she and hundreds of others scrambled to higher ground on Monday, soldiers and local officials moved them to the town of Paksong, west of the dam site, to take refuge in an empty warehouse normally used to store coffee.The official Lao News Agency reported that the dam had collapsed. The main builder of the hydropower project, SK Engineering & Construction of South Korea, said it would investigate whether the dam had collapsed or overflowed because of heavy rains.The group, which seeks to protect rivers around the world, said the disaster showed that many dams were not designed to handle extreme weather events like the rains on Monday.\u201cUnpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change, posing grave safety concerns to millions who live downstream of dams,\u201d International Rivers said.People living below the dam had only a few hours\u2019 warning to evacuate before it failed, according to the group.\u201cCommunities were not given sufficient advanced warning to ensure their safety and that of their families,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis event raises major questions about dam standards and dam safety in Laos, including their appropriateness to deal with weather conditions and risks.\u201dSeven villages in Sanamxay, which is in Attapeu Province, were flooded and more than 6,000 people were displaced by the dam\u2019s failure, officials said.The disaster cleanup may be further complicated by old American bombs and other explosives buried in the area, a legacy of the Vietnam War era that has haunted Laos for decades.Attapeu Province, which borders Vietnam and Cambodia, is heavily contaminated with what disarmament experts call unexploded ordnance, which can detonate on unsuspecting civilians even after decades of lurking undisturbed. The flooding could make the ordnance harder for decontamination teams to find.laosXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamsArea ofdetailWater flowDepletedreservoirMain floodedarea10 MilesDepletedreservoirXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamsWater flowMain floodedareaBy Tim Wallace | Sources: European Space Agency (satellite images), Global Disaster Alerting Coordination System\u201cThere is immediate concern for the safety of personnel from survey, clearance and survivor assistance programs who may have been in the impacted area at the time,\u201d said Mark Hiznay, the associate arms director at Human Rights Watch\u2019s Washington office.The Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy is one of 70 hydropower plants that are planned, underway or have been built in Laos, most of them owned and operated by private companies, International Rivers said.The project consists of major dams on three tributaries of the giant Mekong River as well as several smaller auxiliary dams, or saddle dams, including the one that failed.South Korea and Thailand were mobilizing emergency assistance. Companies from both countries are involved in building and financing the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy project, which was supposed to provide 90 percent of its electricity to Thailand once it began operating.President Moon Jae-in of South Korea instructed his government on Wednesday to dispatch a rescue and emergency relief team to Laos.\u201cThe investigation is still underway to find out the causes of the dam incident, but our government should waste no time in actively participating in the rescue and relief operations at the scene because our own businesses are involved in the construction,\u201d Mr. Moon said, according to his office.Repeated phone calls to the spokesman\u2019s office at SK Engineering & Construction\u2019s headquarters in Seoul went unanswered on Wednesday.Korea Western Power Company, which has a contract to operate the power plant when it is completed, said its officials and workers from SK Engineering & Construction in Laos had joined the rescue and relief efforts. SK deployed one helicopter and 11 boats, and Korea Western Power sent two boats and its local medical staff.On Wednesday evening, a heavy rain was falling on the corrugated roof of the makeshift shelter in Paksong where a few hundred people had found shelter.The sky, cloudy in the afternoon, had turned as murky as gauze. A few ambulances streaked by in the gathering dusk, leaving smudgy trails of red and blue lights in their wake.Inside, adults and children were milling around in sandals and soiled clothes, eating sticky rice from plastic foam bowls. Some sat on blue-and-orange tarps that had been spread on the concrete floor, and many looked on with vacant stares.A makeshift canteen, with steaming pots of sticky rice, had been set up in the warehouse\u2019s covered parking lot.Ms. Chantamart said she had little hope that anything was left of her home or her village.\u201cEvery single house, gone,\u201d she said.Ms. Chantamart said she was not sure whom to hold responsible for the flood. But she said the government and the company behind the dam should take more action to help the victims.\u201cPeople here are shocked, scared and sorry for each other because of our loss,\u201d she said, as children in soiled sweatshirts crowded around her.About 70 percent of the people in her village were from minority ethnic groups, she said. Most grew rice and coffee. Occasionally, they found work as day laborers.Khamla Souvannasy, an official from Paksong, said the local authorities were struggling to support the hundreds of people who had gathered at the warehouse.\u201cThe weather is an obstacle,\u201d he said as a bout of particularly heavy rain lashed the warehouse\u2019s roof. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking for mattresses.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe disaster came so quickly.

{"Headline": "Trump Voters May Be the Biggest Losers From Trump\u2019s Auto Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 President Trump has complained about seeing too many German cars on Fifth Avenue, and threatened heavy tariffs on the companies that produce them. There is a good chance, though, that those Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs were not only made in the United States, but made by workers who voted for Mr. Trump.European companies have turned Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee into auto manufacturing powerhouses in recent years, churning out cars not just for American buyers but also for export to China and Europe. Germany\u2019s three biggest carmakers all have facilities there, and Volvo Cars, which is owned by a Chinese company but based in Sweden, began producing at a new plant in South Carolina just last month.Yet being major employers in regions that voted heavily for Mr. Trump has not protected them.Carmakers, both foreign and domestic, say such penalties would severely damage their lines of supply, interfere with exports and eventually force them to curtail operations in, of all places, Republican strongholds.Mr. Trump won 63 percent of the vote in Spartanburg, S.C., home of BMW\u2019s biggest factory anywhere in the world. But Allen Smith, president of the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce, said the president\u2019s tariffs would threaten the region\u2019s livelihood.\u201cFor BMW and its many, many suppliers scattered across the state and region, you\u2019re talking tens of thousands of jobs,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWe would all agree with the president\u2019s overall aim to improve trade with America\u2019s interests top of mind. But getting to that end by inflicting so much pain on American business is the wrong approach.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose auto tariffs would be the latest manifestation of his willingness to alienate longtime allies and American companies, ostensibly to protect domestic jobs. He has already imposed levies on steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other nations, and on Friday will place tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products.But this new front in the trade war carries substantial risk not just for the auto industry but for Mr. Trump and Republican officeholders nationwide, given the impact that a full-blown trade war could have on American jobs tied to the auto industry.\u201cThe times are gone that a producer was only headquartered in one country with production in that country and exporting from that country to the rest of the world,\u201d said Erik Jonnaert, the secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, in an interview in Brussels.The economic impact would be greatest in a triangle demarcated by BMW\u2019s factory in Spartanburg; Daimler\u2019s Mercedes complex in Tuscaloosa, Ala.; and Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.Beginning in the 1990s, Southern states, desperate to replace manufacturing jobs lost when the textile industry decamped to Asia, wooed carmakers with tax breaks and other sweeteners. When Volkswagen was looking for a place to build a factory in 2008, Chattanooga officials deployed 200 bulldozers, wood chippers and other heavy equipment to clear a potential site after company representatives complained that it was too overgrown. The factory began operating in 2011.Over time, the European carmakers have expanded their operations in those regions not only to build vehicles for American buyers, but also to serve customers in places like China. Last year, Daimler added 900 jobs to its American operations, which also include truck factories, and it is investing $1 billion to expand the Tuscaloosa operation to produce electric vehicles and batteries.Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that these companies may present a threat to American national security, though, has thrown that growth into doubt.BMW exports 70 percent of the vehicles that it makes in Spartanburg, about 270,000, helping to reduce the trade deficit that Mr. Trump often complains about. BMW plans to add 1,000 jobs in Spartanburg as part of a $600 million expansion. If trade tensions continue to escalate, BMW warned in a letter on June 28 to Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, the result could be \u201cstrongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States.\u201dThat argument is unlikely to carry much weight with Mr. Trump. BMW and Mercedes export \u201cmillions\u201d of cars to the United States, Mr. Trump said in a speech in June, \u201cand we hardly tax them at all.\u201dCountries across the globe charge varying tariffs on certain types of automobiles. The United States imported about 1.2 million cars of all brands from Europe last year \u2014 five times as many as were sent the other way \u2014 and imposed a relatively low tariff of 2.5 percent. The European Union charges a levy of 10 percent on car imports from the United States and other countries.But tariffs on larger vehicles are lopsided in the other direction. The United States charges a 25 percent tariff on light trucks and vans from Europe, effectively barring them from the American market. That\u2019s one reason Volkswagen vans made in Hanover, Germany, once synonymous with 1960s flower power, are a rare sight on American roads these days.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs would also apply to car parts, adding another layer of disruption to the companies that supply automakers across the world \u2014 especially if Europe retaliates.Suppliers like ZF Friedrichshafen, a German company that has a transmission factory in South Carolina, say they produce most of what they need locally. But occasionally ZF imports or exports niche products when the market is too small to justify having more than one production site.\u201cWe are vulnerable to further escalations of this conflict because we ship products from the U.S. to Europe and from Europe to the U.S.,\u201d Wolf-Henning Scheider, the chief executive of ZF Friedrichshafen, said in an emailed statement.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for over 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen a more united and aligned response than this one,\u201d said John Bozzella, the president of Global Automakers, which represents foreign automakers operating in the United States.Legislation introduced by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee that would curtail the president\u2019s authority to impose tariffs because of national security has failed to advance, but the idea still has powerful backers. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, who has called the proposed levies \u201cdeeply misguided,\u201d said he planned to move legislation on tariffs through his committee. And representatives including Jackie Walorski, a Republican from Indiana, and Ron Kind, a Democrat from Wisconsin, have gathered more than 70 signatures for a letter expressing concern about the potential impact of the tariffs on the automotive industry.Ann Wilson, the senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents auto parts makers, said her group had met with Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, staff at the Treasury and Commerce Departments, and lawmakers of both parties to convey the dire impact that tariffs could have on the industry.Many smaller manufacturers of auto parts, especially those whose costs have risen because of steel and aluminum tariffs, would not be able to last even three months with a substantial tariff on imports, she said.\u201cWhat is going to play out in the industry is higher costs, lower employment and a massive disruption that could ultimately result in an economic downturn for the country,\u201d Ms. Wilson said.Mr. Trump has shown no signs of backing down.When asked in an interview on Fox News last weekend about his threats of a 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cWell, actually it\u2019s 20 percent. Tell them to get their numbers right.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

It was already the beginning of July, a lot of people are out of town, it\u2019s a holiday week and the deadline was impending in days, but it really was impressive the way they organized almost overnight.\u201dHe needed 1,000 valid signatures from Democratic voters in the district. Ms. DellAquila said that they submitted about 3,000.Mr. Liu, 51, who has spent the last few years teaching public finance at Columbia University and Baruch College, had been approached in recent months about running against Mr. Avella again but he declined. A former Democratic assemblyman, John Duane, had committed to running, but dropped out after the I.D.C. struck its deal with Mr. Cuomo.A similar sequence of events occurred in 2014. Then, as now, angry Democrats vowed to challenge I.D.C. members, and Mr. Liu entered the race. But once the I.D.C.\u2019s leader, Senator Jeff D. Klein, responded by pledging to return to the Democratic fold after the elections, much of the momentum behind challenges like Mr. Liu\u2019s \u2014 as well as union support for them \u2014 disappeared.Mr. Liu said that experience contributed to keeping him on the sidelines this time. But after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory, a coalition of progressive groups renewed efforts to draft him as a candidate.In 2014, when Mr. Liu ran against Mr. Avella, he was endorsed by the Queens County Democratic Party, which Mr. Crowley leads. This time the county machine has endorsed Mr. Avella, the incumbent. Mr. Avella and his staff did not respond to requests for an interview.Advertisement"}

We analyzed his acceptance speech.Below is an annotation of his speech by Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent at The Times, and Alan Blinder, a Times national reporter based in Atlanta. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.I was going to ask y\u2019all how it\u2019s going out there, Athens!I also want you to know how excited that we are to be moving on to November! I wanted to thank Marty and the girls for their hard work, for their commitment and obviously for the love that they\u2019ve shown to this family and this state over the last 15 months.Those miles that we have traveled for 15 months have brought us closer. The attacks have made us stronger. Vice President Pence said it best: We are Kemp strong.I want these girls to know that I am forever grateful. I want y\u2019all to quit crying, too. We\u2019re just celebrating. I also want to take just a moment and thank those local and state elected officials that are in attendance tonight. They\u2019re from all over the state, and ladies and gentlemen, these folks believed in me when no one else did. They put their reputation on the line for us. They put their political futures on the line for us, for what many considered a long-shot candidate, and I will never forget. I will never forget that.It\u2019s packed in here, as you can see, so it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s here and who\u2019s not. But speaking of endorsements, I also want to thank Senator Michael Williams, former candidate for governor; Navy SEAL and businessman Clay Tippins; and State Senator and Army Ranger Hunter Hill. I\u2019m grateful that they joined Team Kemp after the May 22 primary. These men are great leaders, they\u2019re great husbands and they\u2019re great public servants, and I was honored to gain their support. But we cannot forget that tweet that we heard around Georgia. I want to give a big thanks to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. I want to thank President Trump and Vice President Pence for standing with us in these final days and standing with me.And tonight, we celebrate, folks. There\u2019s no doubt about it, and it\u2019s been well-earned for many of you, and I\u2019m grateful. But this campaign is far from over. It\u2019s not the end. It\u2019s only the beginning. Hillary Clinton, George Soros and Nancy Pelosi all have Georgia on their mind. For months, they\u2019ve been campaigning with Stacey Abrams: the out-of-touch radical liberal who cares more for her billionaire backers than for you all, you hard-working Georgians.Hillary is already on the campaign trail, and Stacey\u2019s money is coming from California, New York and Massachusetts \u2014 not Georgia. These liberal special interests, even socialists, are getting behind Stacey Abrams, and they\u2019re willing to spend whatever it takes to get her across the finish line.The fake-news media machine will do everything in their power to prop her up. Their attacks on me will be vicious, baseless and constant \u2014 you can count on it. But that\u2019s what this election is all about, folks. This election is going to be for the soul of our state. It\u2019s going to be about our values and it is going to be literally a fight for the future of the great state of Georgia.Make no mistake: There is a crystal-clear contrast as we march toward November. Stacey Abrams wants to grow state government \u2014 I want to grow your paycheck.On the other hand, I want to lower tax rates for hard-working Georgians like you all. She is a career politician and a liberal activist who wants to double down on big government education programs that fail to deliver. I am a proud father of three teenage daughters and I want to put students ahead of the status quo.So here\u2019s the question: Do you really want a governor who\u2019s bought and paid for by liberal billionaires and out-of-state socialists? Do you want a governor who is going to answer to Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton? Do you want a governor who thinks that government is the answer to every challenge that we face?Of course you don\u2019t. I figured that out, of course not. This is the state of Georgia: We are a red state.We will have good weeks, and we\u2019re going to have bad ones, too. But let me tell you the truth: We will not be outworked, we won\u2019t give up and we will not lose stake of what\u2019s in sight for our state. I\u2019m Brian Kemp. As you all know, I\u2019m a tell-it-like-it-is conservative who is ready to take on Stacey Abrams and the radical left. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Buildings Rise in Flood Zones", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne in eight new residential units in New York is being built along the riskiest waterfront. The buildings may be resilient, but what about the neighborhoods? 13 Photos\u201cThis was built specifically with Sandy in mind,\u201d said Jason Muss, one of the developers, on a tour of the new luxury tower, where units range from $995,000 for a two-bedroom to $3.71 million for a four-bedroom penthouse \u2014 prices that rival more expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods, testing the limits for the area. About two-thirds of the 56 condos have sold since last June, he said.In addition to an outdoor bocce court, a dog run and poolside cabanas, there are less obvious comforts. The mechanical systems are above ground to prevent power and heating malfunctions in the event of flooding, and the lobby was built far above the flood plain \u2014 luxuries most of the homes in the area can neither adopt nor afford. Rather than retreating from flood-prone neighborhoods after Hurricane Sandy, some developers are wading deeper into waterfront markets, especially in Queens and Brooklyn, where they are finding large parcels of land close to mass transit. These are calculated risks, bolstered by years of flood-zone price growth and unwavering demand.The largest share of these buildings is on the southern tip of Brooklyn, in areas like Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Gravesend, where a total of 45 projects \u2014 about a third of all flood-zone buildings \u2014 are rising. They represent a combined 1,571 units. Pricier precincts near Manhattan, like Long Island City in Queens, and Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, had the most units overall, with a total of 5,561 apartments in 20 buildings, accounting for 45 percent of new flood-zone units. Localize.city used Department of Buildings records and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 2015 preliminary map to identify flood-zone projects with four or more units. The most serious flood zone is known as the 100-year flood plain, which has a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year. That may sound low to home buyers, but over the course of a 30-year mortgage, that means there is a 26 percent chance of having at least one flood. \u201cI think we have short-term memory,\u201d said Patrick W. Smith, an agent with Stribling & Associates who lives and works in Long Island City. So the construction continues. Along the Anable Basin, an artificial inlet on the East River, a 14.7-acre swath of industrial waterfront could soon be rezoned to include up to 5,000 residential units, an esplanade and 335,000 square feet of light industrial space (think breweries and furniture fabricators). \u201cNew York is desperate to find more places for people to live,\u201d said Matt Quigley, an owner of the site, noting that 25 percent of the units, up to 1,250, would be reserved for affordable housing with below market-rate prices. Some portion of the residential space could also be shifted to commercial use, he said, depending on the market. And post-Sandy building requirements will make the area more resilient to storms, he added, because Plaxall\u2019s project will create a buffer against storm surge, and the proposed green space will help absorb and redirect water.Some longtime residents, however, are unconvinced. Ernie Brooks, 68, a musician and a member of the Long Island City Coalition, a neighborhood group, who has rented near the proposed site for 41 years in an industrial loft conversion, said he believed flooding has become a greater threat. During Sandy, his unit lost power for three weeks and the basement flooded at least four feet. \u201cIt was like the early days of loft living, when the heat would go off,\u201d said Mr. Brooks, the original bassist for the Modern Lovers. More recent, less severe storms have also been troubling, he added: \u201cWhenever there is rain, the storm drains back up. You often have to wade through a foot of murky water to get to the car.\u201d Jonathan Drescher, who is managing the Plaxall project, said the group would create a new drainage plan to account for added stress on the sewage system, and that the site will be engineered to mitigate flooding, not exacerbate it. In Rockaway Park, on a peninsula in southern Queens, Mark Caller is building an 86-unit condo and townhouse project less than a block from the Atlantic Ocean. The project was unusual for Mr. Caller, the chief executive of Marcal Group, which specializes in medical and commercial real estate. The company originally envisioned a similar use for this site, a former catering hall that it bought for $5 million in 2016.The new development arrives at a time when some buyers are turning away from co-ops, which are more common than condos in the area, said Melissa Leifer, an agent with Keller Williams TriBeCa. \u201cCo-ops need a lot more paperwork, and it\u2019s a stricter financial profile,\u201d she said, noting that many self-employed people and cash buyers are willing to pay a premium to avoid the scrutiny. The experience hasn\u2019t soured him on the waterfront. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for the next Sandy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever happen.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go down a street without seeing a house getting knocked down and a big building going up,\u201d said Tom Paolillo, 65, a lifelong resident of Sheepshead Bay, adding that it is making the neighborhood less affordable.As new development raises property values, longtime residents face another obstacle: mounting insurance costs. The vast majority of homes in the neighborhood were built before stricter building regulations went into effect in recent years, said Elizabeth Malone, a program manager at Neighborhood Housing Services Brooklyn, a nonprofit housing organization. That means their flood risk is significantly higher than that of new buildings, and flood insurance, which is mandated for homeowners with a mortgage in high-risk zones, is poised to jump. Since raising a house several feet above the flood plain is prohibitively expensive for many homeowners, they would be required to pay far higher insurance premiums once a revised FEMA map is approved, said Zachary Paganini, a student at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York who has studied the topic. Because of federal subsidies and grandfathered status that are being phased out for these older homes, some owners\u2019 rates could eventually rise from $400 a year to roughly $4,000, he said. Neighborhoods where flood insurance could balloon include lower-income areas, like Canarsie in Brooklyn, where many residents are already cost burdened.\u201cIn effect, it\u2019s gentrification by water,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, a New York real estate appraiser, who noted that the burden of higher flood insurance could hasten the flight of longtime residents who can\u2019t afford monthly costs.Not all new development along the waterfront will be luxury apartments. On Coney Island, in a once blighted area near the boardwalk, a nine-story rental project that will house homeless veterans is under construction. \u201cThe whole block was vacant,\u201d said Ralph Fasano, executive director of the Concern for Independent Living, which is developing the project with Georgica Green Ventures. \u201cJust securing a site where we could do a project this large was very appealing,\u201d he said, and the landowner was patient in allowing them to finance the project. Out of 135 apartments, 82 will be allotted to homeless veterans, while the rest will be reserved for renters making up to 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income; a single applicant would need to make up to $43,860 a year to qualify, while a family of four would need to make no more than $62,580. Building in a high-risk flood zone did, however, mean higher costs. The project\u2019s investors stipulated that the project must pay for $5 million additional coverage beyond the standard $500,000 flood insurance coverage, Mr. Fasano said. And the building will be elevated three feet above the sidewalk. That market-rate apartments are going up around the project is encouraging, he said, and a boon to his prospective tenants. Above all, though, they will be able to appreciate the water view. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a healing environment,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to walk on the beach a block away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Brazil Crashes Out, the Magic Appears to Be Gone, Too", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAZAN, Russia \u2014 It is a fine line between respect and deference, and in the days before they came face to face with Brazil, Belgium\u2019s players and staff did all they could to navigate it.A World Cup quarterfinal against Brazil was a challenge, defender Vincent Kompany said, but he and his teammates would not be \u201closing sleep\u201d over the identity of their opponents. There was \u201cno weakness\u201d in Brazil\u2019s team, according to striker Romelu Lukaku, although \u201cdefensively, they can be taken\u201d on.Belgium\u2019s coach, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, would concede only one advantage to his opponent before his team beat Brazil, 2-1, on Friday. \u201cThe difference is, we have not won the World Cup, and they have won it five times,\u201d he said. \u201cBrazil has got that psychological barrier out of the way.\u201dThat weight of history, of course, is what lends Brazil its magic. It is what makes Brazil the world\u2019s most prestigious national team, a byword not just for taste and style but for success, too. That ultimate marriage of style and substance is what makes the sight of those canary yellow jerseys, blue shorts and white socks so enchanting, what makes the colors gleam just a little brighter.To see them is to remember Pel\u00e9 and Jairzinho, Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo, all of the single-name stars who emerged, every four years, to light up a tournament and so many childhoods. It is to recall the goals they scored and the World Cups they won, the stories of their indelible greatness the world was told when it was young.It is the same whether you are a fan or a player: Brazil is different; Brazil is special. Mart\u00ednez is quite right \u2014 that effect must count for something, at some level, however deep in the subconscious. It must bewitch those who find themselves tasked with stopping the thing that so inspired them.And yet if those jerseys are intimidating to see, they are surely no less daunting to wear. All those greats, all those ghosts, on your shoulders and on your back, reminding you of what you are supposed to achieve, who you are supposed to be, that only victory counts as success and everything else is failure.But Mart\u00ednez was also quite wrong. Brazil might have won five World Cups, but this Brazil team \u2014 this Brazil generation \u2014 has not won any, and it will be painfully, crushingly aware of it.There are five stars on Brazil\u2019s jersey representing those championships, but the last one was added in 2002. After this defeat, the soonest a sixth can join it is in 2022, a wait of two long decades for a nation that \u2014 for all the romance of jogo bonito \u2014 values only victory. This team, like the three that have gone before it, has failed.Every time, the rhythm of the country\u2019s reaction has been the same. There is a bout of soul-searching; the manager is sacked; a new coach promises to make the team more resilient, more tenacious. He does this by playing with more defensive midfielders. It does not work. The cycle begins again.This time, it is even harder to believe such a response would be proportionate. Brazil was not embarrassed by Belgium: Tite\u2019s team created more than enough chances to have forced extra time, at the very least. It can regard itself unfortunate not to have been awarded a penalty for a foul on Gabriel Jesus. It can believe itself cursed that, in the first half in particular, Belgium defended so effectively by accident, rather than by design.Not every defeat is proof of some spiritual failing. Not every defeat means everything is wrong. Certainly, there is no shortage of talent on this Brazilian squad, just as there was no shortage of talent in any of the squads since 2002. Neymar is not a mirage, and neither are Jesus, Philippe Coutinho, Douglas Costa and the others.There are some aging legs in the back line, and something of a dearth of young, dynamic fullbacks, but this is a country that exports thousands of players every year. It is a place where players will continue to grow.That is what has allowed Brazil to build its history, that endless flowering of talent, one star replaced smoothly by another, year after year, cycle after cycle, decade after decade.What has happened since 2002, though, suggests this is no longer the advantage it once was. The playing field has been leveled: Brazil is no longer pre-eminent in the way it once was, possessed of enough raw brilliance to carry it through. The explanation for that does not lie in Brazil\u2019s shortcomings, but in someone else\u2019s strengths.It is not a coincidence that all four of this year\u2019s World Cup semifinalists, whatever happens in the second set of quarterfinals, are from Europe. This is, increasingly, a European competition. All four of the most recent world champions have been European. Since 1990, what might be broadly termed soccer\u2019s modern era, there have been eight World Cups. Brazil has won two. Europe will have picked up the rest.At least one manager here has confided privately that Europe\u2019s power \u2014 in terms of finance, influence, and physicality \u2014 has become almost impossible to compete with, certainly for Africa, Asia and North America, and increasingly for South America, the game\u2019s other traditional stronghold.The major nations of the Old World have industrialized youth development so effectively that France, Germany and Spain can now rival Brazil and Argentina as a source of players. Its smaller countries have such easy access to best practices that their size is no longer an issue. Their players and coaches can be exported easily to the best leagues in the world. The latest developments in coaching, sports science, nutrition and the rest can be imported rapidly. It is that process that allowed Iceland to draw with Argentina, and be a little disappointed it did not win. It is that process that has left Belgium in the World Cup semifinals, and Croatia and Sweden with hopes of joining them.And it is that process that has seen Brazil come and go from four World Cups, all without success. Each one, each failing, simply adds to the pressure that awaits the next team to try to end the wait, to try to overcome all of the advantages that Europe can call on.The players in those yellow jerseys know as well as anyone that Brazil has won five World Cups. They know more than everyone that they have not contributed to any of them. Increasingly, those victories are not a psychological barrier that lies broken at their feet, but one that towers above them, standing in their way, casting them into shadow.\u2014Here\u2019s how Belgium eliminated Brazil (by Andrew Das):Final moments here \u2026 Is Brazil going out?Oh Courtoiiiissssssssss .....He dives to palm a Neymar curler over the bar. Did he just save the day?!?!?Marcelo tees up Coutinho again \u2014 but he shoots directly into Fellaini\u2019s backside. That\u2019ll leave a welt, but at least it\u2019s not a goal.Five minutes of added time for Brazil to save itself \u2026.We tick over 90 minutes with a long ball to Neymar at the back post \u2014 and HE GOES DOWN IN A HEAP. Meunier shoved him ever so slightly, but he\u2019s not getting a single call today. And that\u2019s just one more.Yellow to Fagner for a wrestling takedown of Hazard at midfield. Hardly matters who gets a yellow for Brazil now. They\u2019re minutes from missing the semifinals at this point, and they can\u2019t allow a goal.Neymar turns Alderweireld beautifully in the area \u2014 and then promptly dribbles straight over the end line. Oops.Belgium sub: Lukaku is sacrificed for Tielemans. This is a lockdown move. Also wastes a little time, and that helps too.Fernandinho gets a yellow for taking down Hazard after he\u2019s beaten to the inside. Tick...tick...tick...tick.Oh dear. Neymar does everything right down the left, turns Meunier like a tree stump and puts the ball on a tee for a late-arriving Coutinho \u2014 who sends it a mile high.Feels like there\u2019s a moment here for someone to do \u2026 something. Neymar? Coutinho? Hazard? Lukaku? De Bruyne? This game\u2019s still there to be saved, or won.We appear to be in an unofficial water break here. Everyone drinking, a few guys looking at tablets, while poor Chadli gets some treatment. He\u2019ll come off, and be replaced by Thomas Vermaelen.A gorgeous feed sends him up the gut all alone and he yanks his shot wide of a dead-to-rights Courtois. What a miss. Is that the one they\u2019ll play over and over on Globo for the next week?A four-man bust out by Hazard falls apart when he short-legs a pass across the field and Fagner steals it. Here comes Brazil again.Firmino now! He collects from Neymar in the area, turns and JUUUUUSTT misses the top corner. Brazil is buzzing now, maybe for the first time since the opening five minutes.THERE\u2019S THE GOAL! Renato Augusto with a header off a Coutinho lollipop and HERE. WE. GO.That was a SUPER ball from Coutinho to Renato Augusto, the substitute, and probably the only way to get it to him. He took it at the spot and nodded it past a flat-footed Courtois.First Costa on the right, saved by Courtois, and then Neymar takes a swing at the rebound, but it\u2019s cleared by a defender.Final sub for Brazil: Renato Augusto comes on for Paulinho. That\u2019s the last play of the cards for Tite, who hears the tick, tick, tick that we all hear now.It goes without saying that a Brazil goal here would make the final 15 minutes or so THRILLING.Hazard down again after a rough collision at midfield on a give and go with Chadli. Fagner just ran right through Hazard there.Game is really getting wide open now. Marcelo slides in to prevent a ball that would have sent Meunier in free, and as Brazil comes back upfield, Neymar gets sandwiched and goes down. That\u2019s a yellow for Meunier, his second of the tournament, so he\u2019ll miss the semifinal if Belgium hangs on here.Costa pulls up again, this time after cutting across the top of the area. But his shot hits Kompany in the forehead.A small break to get some blood off Fernandinho\u2019s face gives Brazil a chance to talk things over. \u201cWell, this stinks.\u201d \u201cNo kidding.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d \u201cBeats me.\u201dOne obvious problem for Brazil is that they\u2019re losing every physical confrontation they come across. Fellaini\u2019s too big. Kompany\u2019s too big. Lukaku and Witsel and Vertonghen are too big. Either that or they\u2019re just not contesting them, which is probably more troubling if it\u2019s the case.Brazil springs Neymar in behind, but it\u2019s him and seven \u2014 SEVEN!!!!! \u2014 Belgians back there so he has to pull the ball out.Belgium with a chance for three! Eden Hazard, fed by Kevin de Bruyne and with Romelu Lukaku open in the center, drags a shot wide past Alisson. Brazil comes upfield and gets a shot of its own, but like so many of their attempts, the space closes down and Courtois dives to punch away Douglas Costa\u2019s effort from a tight angle.Thirty minutes to go for Brazil, and they\u2019ll need to be a lot better than they\u2019ve been for the first hour.Hazard down, screaming, with what can only be described as a Suarez.Another sub for Brazil: Douglas Costa on, Jesus off.We\u2019re paused here as Mazic is listening for a V.A.R. review here. And they see what we saw: no penalty. We play on.Jesus nutmegs Vertonghen beautifully, but Kompany comes over to collect the ball and shove it out of bounds, while Jesus falls theatrically.Good bit of sustained Brazil pressure here. But it\u2019s not translated into a good shot, I don\u2019t think. Everything just collapses at the key moment.Nope. On replay, it\u2019s Neymar who kicks out at Fellaini\u2019s leg, trying to draw contact and go down. But Fellaini stayed away, and the call is correct. No V.A.R. on the field.He sure looked like he got tripped by Fellaini there, but Mr. Mazic waves him up again. He seemed to make the V.A.R. signal though, as if to say, \u201cIF that was a penalty, they\u2019ll tell me in a minute.\u201d Seems an odd way to defer on a call right in front of him though \u2026 \u2026Beautiful turn in the box by Marcelo, who leaves Meunier standing still in the area. But his cross is a bit too swift for Firmino, who gets there a beat late, and it rolls through the goal mouth and out.Neymar just got pickpocketed \u2014 again \u2014 by Kompany at the top of the box. He just doesn\u2019t seem willing, or able, to fight these Belgians off.Brazil presses forward and Firmino tries a nifty backheel. To no one, since no one had any idea what he was doing nor bothered to follow him to find out.Our first yellow goes to Toby Alderweireld, who breaks up a Paulinho counter with a hip check at midfield.It takes Belgium all of 30 seconds to win a dangerous free kick on the left. They play it short, though, and settle for some possession.One change at halftime, and it\u2019s by Tite and Brazil: Roberto Firmino is on, and Willian departs.The unfortunate problem for Brazil right now is that the player they need, the one who might give them some order and some bite, is Casemiro. And he\u2019s suspended today.That was not how anyone expected that to go, except for maybe Roberto Martinez. His decision to start Fellaini and Chadli in a more rugged midfield has paid off. Martinez could not have predicted an own goal, or De Bruyne\u2019s long-range second (O.K., maybe we were overdue for one of those).But Brazil definitely doesn\u2019t like the more physical game Belgium is playing, and it\u2019s going to have to sort out a way to change that. Maybe stretching the field a bit more will get Neymar, Coutinho and Jesus a bit more room to work. But what Brazil needs now is a goal \u2014 any goal \u2014 and a belief that it\u2019s got a couple more inside it.Brazil played the first half like a team that arrived at the stadium thinking it had the win in the bag. And teams that do that often run into trouble.Seconds later it\u2019s Meunier taking him down just inside the elbow of the area. But no call from Mr. Mazic again, and Neymar quickly gives up his penalty appeal. One minute of added time.Fellaini takes the ball from Neymar easily again. And now Witsel AND Fellaini take down Neymar over the ball. Sensing a theme?Neymar just gave up on the ball after a shove from Witsel. Not a vicious one, or even a rough one. But the kind that just knocked him off the ball momentarily, and the kind he hates.Seeing a lot of that from him and Fellaini, and it\u2019s worked so far. Neymar hasn\u2019t been much of a factor in this half.Chadli finds Kompany at the near post on the corner, and he tries a nifty first-touch backheel. But its right at Alisson, who is more than happy to catch it.Free kick for De Bruyne on the left ... SAVED by Alisson, who pushes it over the bar.Belgium looks alternately confident and panicky, largely depending on when Brazil is defending on its back foot or its front one. When Brazil lays back, Belgium seems eager to take the action to them. But whenever they hesitate, and bring the ball back out, Brazil suddenly pounces and before you know it Courtois is standing over it again.Marcelo goes close \u2014 accidentally! He runs deep and tries to cross, but a defender blocks it and Courtois has to punch it wide. Brazil comes back through Coutinho, but his shot from the top of the area is punched by the giant Belgian goalkeeper.Brazil did everything right there: stretched out the Belgians, split the ball out wide to Marcelo, he served it back in to an open Gabriel Jesus on the spot \u2014 and he missed badly on a header from there.Here\u2019s an odd stat: Belgium has two goals, but only one shot on net. That\u2019s because its first goal came courtesy of Fernandinho\u2019s own goal. For the record, Belgium has five shots: De Bruyne\u2019s went in, two were off target and two were blocked.Wow. I haven\u2019t seen Brazil this flustered since the Germans tore them apart in 2014. They just can\u2019t believe they\u2019re behind, and they really need to sort out what the heck\u2019s gone wrong \u2014 and fast.De Bruyne delivers! Mazic stops play briefly to lecture about corner-kick behavior, but no one\u2019s listening to him. Doesn\u2019t matter, Belgium clears and breaks out \u2026.. AND SCORES! IT\u2019S 2-0!Brazil is stunned. Lukaku started that in his own half and fed De Bruyne out to his right as he left the center circle. De Bruyne calmly controls and, with FOUR Brazilians in front of him, fires a right-footed shot through the square they made and beats Alisson inside the left post.More danger for Brazil after they win a free kick yards from the corner flag, but Belgium throws bodies in front of two shots to force an actual corner from the other side.Neymar is off getting some sort of treatment in front of the Brazil bench. His left sock is down, but don\u2019t worry: they\u2019ve got the magic spray. That fixes everything.Marcelo wins a foul merely by challenging Lukaku for a header. The big guy always loses the whistle there.Brazil trying to back down Belgium like a center in the low post, but Vertonghen fights off Willian, and then a cross finds no one.Now it\u2019s Brazil in a little cool-down at the back. Their coach, Tite, has preached patience all along, and it\u2019s worked. Brazil simply wears down its opponents. But that\u2019s a lot easier to do when you\u2019re not a goal down. And when Belgium isn\u2019t running at you with Hazard, De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku again and again.Brazil\u2019s movement peters out with the ball at Coutinho\u2019s feet, so he tries a screened shot from 22 yards. But he\u2019s probably not beating Thibaut Courtois with anything like that from out there.A careless giveaway by Neymar sends Brazil back to regroup, and when Coutinho comes back and tries to spring Jesus over the top, Kompany just grabs him and throws him to the ground. The Serbian referee thinks that\u2019s totally fine.This is the first time Brazil has trailed in Russia and they clearly don\u2019t like it. They also don\u2019t think it\u2019s deserved, and to prove it they\u2019re back to squeezing Belgium at the back, trying to force turnovers.Two good chances for Brazil quickly, with a ball driven deep and then cut back to Gabriel Jesus. But he got stuffed in close and then couldn\u2019t get his feet sorted to bury the rebound before Courtois and help arrived.That was, um, unexpected. But the corner Fellaini won is fired in. Kompany rises and misses at the near post, but the ball hits Fernandinho on the shoulder and beats Alisson from close range.Oh dear, what an error. And it breaks a scoreless streak of more than 320 minutes for Brazil\u2019s defense, which had been rock solid so far. But we said Belgium would have an advantage in the air, and sometimes that pays off in strange ways.Brazil is still hunting up front, but Belgium is trying to calm things (and maybe themselves) down by passing it around a bit in their own end.Another ball through the six on a corner! But fortunately for Belgium it falls to Paulinho, catching him off guard, and he can\u2019t put much behind his shot.The first corner goes to Brazil. Belgium should have the advantage on most of these, with its back three and the towering Fellaini and Witsel \u2014 but SOMEHOW THEY LET IT THROUGH. Gabriel Jesus flicks a header and Thiago Silva manages to bundle it toward goal and off the left post!That was very close, and not a great sign if you\u2019re Roberto Martinez.First bit of flash from Neymar, who, under pressure from Alderweireld, backheels to Marcelo. The joy doesn\u2019t last long, though: seconds later Fellaini lands a forearm to the back of Neymar\u2019s head, and he\u2019s down for what surely will be the only time tonight. (Kidding.)That one hurt though.Now it\u2019s Kompany with a panicky ball out of the back. It lands about 15 rows up at midfield, and he signals a \u201csorry\u201d to Meunier.Brazil\u2019s front four is ball-hawking in force whenever Belgium\u2019s back line has the ball. I bet that three-man defense feels a little lonely when that happens.Belgium with the first probe, a looooong ball from Alderweireld over Lukaku. But by over, we mean, well over. Belgium quickly wins it back after the goal kick, and De Bruyne dispossesses (and decleats) Fernandinho, but his shot is safely left of Alisson.Brazil in yellow with blue shorts, Belgium all in red. Enjoy.The team\u2019s are out of the tunnel. Two anthems, a few photos and a coin toss and we\u2019re off. Remember: the winner tonight gets France in St. Petersburg on Tuesday.Brazil and its fans are back to singing the second verse of the national anthem a cappella after the music stops. They did that in 2014, seemingly spontaneously, and it was terrific. It also helps when the majority of fans in the stadium are Brazilian, and know the words.Belgium\u2019s anthem is a quickie. The giant flags come off, the teams shake hands: \u201cGood luck, good luck, good luck, Hi Fernandinho! good luck, good luck \u2026.\u201dWe have a Serbian referee tonight, Milorad Mazic, which is kind of interesting since Brazil sent Serbia packing in the group stage. Conspiracy theorists love that kind of connection. The video-assistant referee tonight is Italian.Yellow cards are wiped clean at the World Cup but only after the quarterfinals. That means a handful of players in the starting lineups today need to be careful if they want to play in a potential semifinal: Neymar and Philippe Coutinho for Brazil, and Jan Vertonghen, Kevin De Bruyne and Thomas Meunier for Belgium.Brazil\u2019s tenacious defensive midfielder, Casemiro, is a big reason the Selec\u00e3o has gone 310 minutes and counting without a goal. But he\u2019ll watch the Belgium game: he\u2019s suspended for accumulation of yellow cards. The likely replacement is Fernandinho, slightly older and slightly less physically-imposing, but still a solid second choice. And in some ways Fernandinho may be the perfect fit against his Manchester City teammate Kevin De Bruyne and two other Premier League rivals in the Belgium attack, Eden Hazard (Chelsea) and Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United).Messi\u2019s gone. Ronaldo\u2019s gone. Germany\u2019s long gone. But Spot the Ball has survived the World Cup knockout round! To celebrate, we\u2019ve pulled some photos from the round of 16 and made one very important change \u2014 we removed the ball. See if you can guess where it was.Advertisement"}

I could get a leather interior and heated seats without a problem, but there was one glaring oversight: accessibility. As a wheelchair user, I\u2019ve found that no major automaker offers an accessible vehicle as standard. For this recent purchase, I had to pay more than $25,000 \u2014 on top of the car\u2019s list price \u2014 for features like hand controls, a ramp and locks for my chair.So after the floor drop, adding in the removable seats, and putting in a ramp, how much will that cost me?            Your entirelife savingsSir... glad wecould help!So after the floor drop, adding in the removable seats, and putting in a ramp, how much will that cost me?            Your entirelife savingsSir... glad wecould help!This month marked the 28th anniversary of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. For those of us who had endured exclusion because of a disability, that moment in 1990 felt like the arrival of a long-delayed justice. But despite the power of that landmark legislation, and the profound benefits it has delivered, remnants of exclusion remain stubbornly in place.Millions of people with disabilities or restricted mobility still struggle to find reliable and affordable transportation options that empower them to lead active, independent lives. Roughly four million Americans depend on wheelchairs and 11 million more use a cane, walker or crutches (estimates in a new unpublished study bring the numbers to 5.7 million and 15.7 million, respectively), but the ability to afford and drive a motor vehicle has  historically been out of reach for far too many.With the development of autonomous vehicles, a better day is in sight. Once the stuff of the imagination, this innovation is now a reality: Self-driving cars are here. Now, as the vehicle design and development continues, the entire industry has a rare opportunity to create a cutting-edge product that can be used by everyone, including wheelchair users, without the unfair and exorbitant cost and effort now required for customization. Automakers should seize that opportunity.So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this one.Uh... ramp?So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this oneUh... ramp?So is there a different model I can test drive? Because I don\u2019t see a ramp on this oneUh... ramp?At best, these supposedly futuristic vehicles lack an appreciation for the need of those who rely on wheelchairs. At worst, they continue the auto industry\u2019s legacy of exclusion.This does not have to be the case. Since autonomous vehicles will not have traditional pedals, there will be no need to add hand controls for acceleration and braking. And manufacturing wheelchair-accessible autonomous vehicles should cost less than retrofitting conventional vehicles. Without the need for a human driver, the interior of these vehicles can be rethought to accommodate anyone, regardless of ability.Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!Honey is my scooter ok?Yep!It\u2019s still there!To meet the challenge and keep the promises enshrined in the Americans With Disabilities Act, automakers must make accessibility integral to the design of self-driving cars. The people who stand to benefit most from this innovation need to be heard.Automakers should sit down at the table with disability advocates, engineers, designers, transportation planners, transit agencies, policymakers and other stakeholders, so we can use our collective passions and brainpower to address this vital issue. We know that these companies have at their disposal the talent and the resources to change the future of mobility, and we challenge them to partner with people with disabilities, whose lives and livelihoods are at stake, and hold themselves accountable to the goals they have set.If automakers can shake off the exclusionary thinking of the past, and rise to meet this challenge, they can deliver on the true potential of self-driving cars \u2014 to benefit all people, not just those who can get around without a wheelchair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill de Blasio Is a Progressive. But Is He Progressive Enough?", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe anticipation for many of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s supporters was particularly keen because it built on the sense that his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had presided over the city\u2019s growth in a way that benefited the well-off and left the poor behind.But midway through his fifth year in office, Mr. de Blasio has disappointed some of his most loyal backers, who point to a range of issues, from criminal justice reform and homelessness to the protection of immigrants, where the mayor has fallen short of his promises.On Monday, Mr. de Blasio found himself having to explain why, after enacting a policy to end solitary confinement in city jails, the city Department of Correction increased the number of inmates shipped upstate, where they were put in solitary. He defended the actions as rare and necessary for safety.Other promises have also run up against reality.The city has not succeeded in opening new neighborhood-based homeless shelters as fast as Mr. de Blasio had vowed.His recurring pledge to raise taxes on high-earners has been dashed in Albany, where the mayor holds little sway and has been embroiled in a yearslong feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.And Mr. de Blasio has been resolute in his opposition to congestion pricing as a way to finance much-needed mass transit improvements, frustrating many progressive advocates who see his position as inconsistent with his goal of narrowing inequity.\u201cI think he\u2019s run into the mechanics of governing, where you have to deal with the restraints of law and City Council and dealing with the practicalities of things like union negotiations,\u201d the Rev. Al Sharpton said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s had a problem of commitment. I think he has a problem of having to govern, restraints that sometimes are troubling to those that are nongovernmental activists.\u201dOffered a list on Thursday of frequent criticisms from progressive advocates of his record, including expanding the secrecy surrounding certain Police Department records and failures at the New York City Housing Authority, Mr. de Blasio said: \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the world upside down.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been a progressive my whole life, know a lot about the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a whole lot of progressives about what we\u2019re doing, activists, elected officials, issue experts. And I have found a lot of agreement with our agenda.\u201dMr. de Blasio defended his record as a progressive leader, saying that there will always be advocates \u201cwho want us to take additional steps, and we intend to.\u201d He said that on balance, his efforts to improve police discipline, end solitary confinement for young inmates and create neighborhood homeless shelters were \u201cprogressive and tangible\u201d actions that affect \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of people\u2019s lives.\u201cThere may be a few advocates who see it differently,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut the vast majority of New Yorkers if you ask them, \u2018Hey, this guy ended solitary confinement for these many thousands of inmates versus all the people before who tolerated it.\u2019 What\u2019s more progressive?\u201dTo be sure, the mayor has made good on many of his commitments, including pursuing an aggressive affordable housing plan, launching a city-subsidized ferry service and the expansion of early childhood education.His push to build new affordable units or preserve those that were at risk of shifting to market-rate rents has been met with criticism from housing advocates who say not enough of the apartments are affordable for the poorest New Yorkers.Ms. Nixon, for example, backs marijuana legalization; Mr. de Blasio refuses to go that far, although he has taken steps to end the practice of arresting most people caught smoking marijuana in public.The City Council, too, has pressured the mayor from the left. In his first term, Melissa Mark-Viverito, then the Council speaker, pushed him to endorse the eventual closing of Rikers Island; in his second term, the new speaker, Corey Johnson, forced him to fund discounted subway and bus rides for poor New Yorkers.Similarly, his effort during the 2016 campaign to spearhead a national movement around left-of-center policies faltered.

And if there are no practical steps, then adjust the goals.\u201dMr. Sharpton said that some of the frustration with Mr. de Blasio among his far-left base may stem from unrealistic expectations.\u201cA lot of people expected him to be more of what they projected on him than what he was,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI knew when he was coming in that he was a deliberate, very careful type of guy.\u201dHe added, \u201cI never expected him to be Al Sharpton.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its price must each day rise or fall within a strict range set by the central bank. That range has been steadily lowered.The recent slide, which took the renminbi back to last year\u2019s levels, began as the trade-war talk was heating up.While a weakening currency can soften economic blows, it also comes with costs.But for China, letting the renminbi slide may have advantages over other responses to American tariffs. Since China exports far more to the United States than it imports, it cannot respond with tariffs on anywhere near the same amount of American products.Devaluations carry a legion of risks, though.And a big slide could hurt China.Individuals and companies in China dumped renminbi and bought other currencies, to protect their wealth against further decreases in the value of the Chinese currency. The selling, known as capital flight, suggested that the Chinese had little faith in their own economy, and raised questions about the Chinese central bank\u2019s handling of the devaluation. The other big fear at the time was that the prices of Chinese goods in other countries would fall, forcing producers there to also cut their prices and hurt the wider economy in the process.\u201cCarrying out a controlled depreciation is one of the most difficult maneuvers a central bank can pull off,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cChina, through using capital controls and its reserves, could pull it off again, but there is a risk that a weaker currency is taken as evidence that China can\u2019t assure financial stability.\u201dAnd the factors that perhaps slowed the selling of the renminbi no longer exist. Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, noted that the dollar weakened substantially in 2017, which, he said, helped stabilize the value of the renminbi.\u201cIf the dollar picks up again, it is an open question how well capital account restrictions will work to stem the potential capital flight,\u201d Mr. Brooks wrote in an email.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia Seeks to Complete a $10 Billion Project Rocked by Scandal", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "Square FeetExchange 106 tower is the centerpiece of a project meant to be a global finance center in Kuala Lumpur, but it has been overshadowed by charges of fraud.Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 With its reflective blue glass facade and 12-story clear glass crown, the 1,615-foot Exchange 106 tower is meant to make a commanding statement about this fast-growing capital\u2019s readiness to be regarded among the world\u2019s great cities.The four-million-square-foot office and retail skyscraper, expected to be completed before the end of the year, is the centerpiece of the $10 billion Tun Razak Exchange, an office, retail and residential development sponsored by former Prime Minister Najib Razak to turn 70 acres of the central business district into a new global finance center.Among the world\u2019s 15 tallest buildings, the tower stands 133 feet higher than the Petronas Twin Towers, which have been landmarks on the Kuala Lumpur skyline since they were opened in 1998.But the building\u2019s significance has been overshadowed by charges of government corruption, embezzlement and money laundering.On May 9, Malaysians elected lawmakers to Parliament from the Pakatan Harapan opposition coalition. Their leader, Mahathir Mohamad, a reform candidate and former prime minister, replaced Mr. Najib and his ruling Barisan Nasional party.In June, the finance minister, Lim Guan Eng, told reporters that $750 million was \u201cmisappropriated\u201d by 1MDB from the Tun Razak Exchange, known as TRX. The Mahathir administration, he said, had nevertheless decided to invest almost $700 million more to complete the project.\u201cThe Malaysian cabinet has decided to support the TRX project to recoup all misappropriated funds, repay all borrowings, recover all funding investments and opportunity costs as well as potentially achieve a small surplus return,\u201d Mr. Lim said in a statement.The Exchange 106 tower and the new financial center were particular favorites of Mr. Najib. The Tun Razak Exchange is named for his father, Abdul Razak Hussein, Malaysia\u2019s second prime minister. Mr. Najib\u2019s allegiance to the project helped persuade the Mulia Group, a big developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia, to spend $166 million for the 3.4 acres in the exchange, enough room to build the tower. Mulia owns 49 percent of the tower; the Malaysian Ministry of Finance owns the other 51 percent.The Tun Razak Exchange was included in a $100 billion infrastructure construction campaign started by Mr. Najib in 2009 to elevate Malaysia from a middle-income country to what he called a \u201cTop 20 nation.\u201d Those projects included new rail lines and stations, mixed-use real estate developments, ports, highways, pipelines and energy plants.Since the May 9 election, Mr. Mahathir, the new prime minister, has canceled or suspended most of the big projects, including two pipelines, a Kuala Lumpur metro line and two national train lines. But with the Mahathir administration\u2019s new investment in the Tun Razak Exchange, the Exchange 106 tower will be finished on schedule before the end of the year, and the entire 70-acre development appears on a clear path to completion by the early 2020s.Until the corruption scandal broke into public view in 2015 and its assets and responsibilities were restructured, 1MDB was responsible for land sales and development in the Tun Razak Exchange. The Ministry of Finance assumed 1MDB\u2019s share of the project last year.Mr. Mahathir has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit 1MDB accounts. Malaysian auditors previously reported the fund\u2019s losses at $14 billion, according to government reports. Those losses and other government obligations from the concrete and steel infrastructure projects started by Mr. Najib contributed to more than doubling the national debt \u2014 to $250 billion \u2014 since he was elected in 2009.Since 2012, according to Malaysian officials, 1MDB spent about $925 million to guarantee loans, provide advances and purchase land at the Tun Razak Exchange. 1MDB recouped a portion of its expenses from selling land parcels within the project\u2019s boundary.Both the tower and the larger exchange are hives of active construction. More than 2,000 workers, laboring around the clock, swarm the site. Other projects under construction include a $2.8 billion, 17-acre Lifestyle Quarter, which includes a hotel, six apartment towers, a two-million-square-foot shopping mall and a landscaped park on the roof of the mall. Lendlease, a construction and project management company based in Sydney, Australia, is developing the quarter.Several more office towers are under construction, and the Malaysia division of Prudential Insurance has leased space in one of them.The announcement that the government would continue to invest in the Tun Razak Exchange relieved anxiety about finishing one of Asia\u2019s largest public-private projects.Christine Yeap, the Mulia Group\u2019s senior manager for marketing and leasing, said the company was working with the Mahathir administration to avoid any market disruption. The Exchange 106 tower is about 60 percent leased.\u201cMulia Group is optimistic that the government will guide this development on the best way forward,\u201d she told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.Mulia markets the Exchange 106 tower as the \u201cworld\u2019s most luxurious\u201d office building.The tower includes 100,000 square feet of retail space on two lower floors, a lobby on the 57th floor for sightseeing and 92 floors of office space.Lobby areas are trimmed in English burl wood and marble. The onyx bathrooms are designed with $1,300 custom toilets from Japan that operate with digital controls. The floor plates stretch 28,000 to 34,000 square feet and are unobstructed by support columns. And views of the city and metropolitan region are magnificent.\u201cWhen we agreed to build this project, our chairman said it won\u2019t be just another building,\u201d Ms. Yeap said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the best building in the world. When it opens, people will see that we reached that goal.\u201dThe big tower fills a dire shortage in top-tier office space in Kuala Lumpur, said Michael KC Yam, a prominent developer in Kuala Lumpur.\u201cThere are only one or two buildings that are truly Class A,\u201d he said. \u201cThese new buildings at the exchange will have big demand.\u201dThe Exchange 106 Tower and the other Tun Razak projects under construction follow a master plan that stresses energy efficiency, environmental sensitivity and access. The development will be served by a new underground station on the $5 billion, 31-mile MRT1 driverless subway line that opened last year.And the landscaped central park is a green roof. Veolia Water Technologies, a French contractor, is building a 30,000-square-foot plant to treat 3.5 million gallons of wastewater daily for use in toilets, cooling and landscaping. The plant is capable of cutting water demand in half by treating and recycling at least 80 percent of all the fresh water used in the exchange.\u201cThe development still consumes potable water from the city,\u201d Sandrine Guendoul, a Veolia spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cThe large degree of internal reuse reduces the load on the city network considerably.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "BBC Closes Gender Pay Gap, but Men Are Still Its 12 Highest-Paid Stars", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite a narrowing of the BBC\u2019s gender pay gap, the list showed that the publicly financed broadcaster\u2019s 12 highest-paid stars were men. The revelation prompted accusations that the British broadcaster was actually moving backward considering that last year only the seven highest paid were men. This year, only two women ranked among the 20 highest paid.Claudia Winkleman, at No. 13, was the highest-paid woman on the list, earning 370,000 to 379,999 pounds ($489,000 to $502,000). Last year, she ranked No. 8, with a salary of \u00a3450,000 to \u00a3500,000.The BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, said the new figures showed that the broadcaster was taking positive steps, and he emphasized that the overall goal was to get to a 50-50 split on the list. That, he acknowledged, could \u201ctake some time.\u201d\u201cClosing the gender pay gap is a priority for the BBC. We must lead the way,\u201d Mr. Hall said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s figures show we are making good progress, but we are not there yet and that is why we will keep pressing to deliver change.\u201dThe corporation, whose budget largely comes from license fees paid annually by most British households, was required to disclose the salaries of its top celebrities as part of a negotiation with the British government related to the renewal of its Royal Charter.The radio and television presenter Chris Evans, who made \u00a32.2 million to \u00a32.25 million in 2016-17, was the No. 1 earner on last year\u2019s list.This year, Gary Lineker, the host of the soccer program \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d and one of the faces of the BBC\u2019s World Cup coverage, overtook Mr. Evans as the highest-paid host, earning \u00a31.75 million to \u00a31.76 million in 2017-18.Several BBC hosts, including Mr. Evans, took pay cuts as the corporation moved to close the gender gap, which was reduced by nearly one-fifth over the past year, the BBC said.Since last year, the BBC said in a statement, the number of women paid more than \u00a3200,000 by the BBC has risen from seven to 14, while the number of men paid more than \u00a3500,000 has fallen, from five to three. Eight women joined the list of top-paid celebrities this year.The median pay gap between men and women doing comparable jobs has fallen to 7.6 percent from 9.3 percent since last year amid a series of initiatives that included introducing simpler job descriptions and repositioning people within pay ranges.Despite the apparent progress, some critics accused the BBC of slipping since the number of highest male earners has increased.The remaining gap, according to the BBC\u2019s analysis, resulted from structural issues, with too few women in senior leadership roles and more women than men in the work force\u2019s lowest quartile.Ms. Gracie resigned as the broadcaster\u2019s Beijing bureau chief after learning that her male counterparts earned at least 50 percent more than her. She remained at the BBC, however, saying that she would return to her post only when she was paid equally.The BBC apologized to Ms. Gracie for paying her less than her male colleagues and offered her a financial settlement that she said she had donated to a charity for women seeking legal advice on equal pay claims.After consulting extensively with BBC staff members, the corporation set out new initiatives meant to support women interested in moving up to leadership roles.\u201cThis report sets out a true reflection of everything we\u2019ve heard from those who\u2019ve contributed to the work,\u201d said Donalda MacKinnon, the director of BBC Scotland. \u201cWe commit to taking forward the recommendations that will bring a step-change in gender equality at the BBC.\u201dBut women\u2019s rights advocates said that the broadcaster still had work to do.\u201cThe organization is clearly still a long way from valuing women as much as it values men,\u201d said Sophie Walker, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, a British feminist political party. \u201cTackling pay inequality means not just equal pay for equal work and talent, but also understanding the structural barriers that stop women from equally accessing work.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the director of BBC Scotland.

Lately, attention has focused on Horst Seehofer, another Bavarian and the German interior minister whose threat to resign over a border issue created a political crisis this week.But Mr. S\u00f6der as much as anyone is the reason Chancellor Angela Merkel, who once staked her legacy on welcoming hundreds of thousands of migrants to Germany, finally capitulated and agreed to turn back migrants already registered elsewhere in Europe at the Bavarian border with Austria \u2014 something Mr. S\u00f6der has been demanding for months.The \u201copinion\u201d Mr. S\u00f6der has voiced on behalf of Bavaria is that he wants to put a stop to what he calls \u201casylum tourism\u201d and to \u201cdefend\u201d Bavarian and Christian values. Last month he ordered Christian crosses to be hung in all state government buildings in Bavaria. This month he launched a Bavarian border force even though migrant numbers are sharply down.Next are the \u201ctransit camps,\u201d a term first coined by Victor Orban, Hungary\u2019s semi-authoritarian prime minister, along the border with Austria (although there is talk now of holding them in ordinary police stations).To his critics Mr. S\u00f6der is Germany\u2019s Trump, a fear mongering populist who is taking Bavaria\u2019s conservative Christian Social Union, the longtime ally of Ms. Merkel\u2019s centrist conservative party, to the far right and colluding with nativists in neighboring countries to overthrow Europe\u2019s liberal order.To his fans, he is a man of the people, the son of a builder and a father of four who likes to eat at McDonald\u2019s, understands the anxieties of ordinary Bavarians and has what it takes to win back voters from the real populists, the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD.Mr. S\u00f6der, who holds regular citizens\u2019 office hours to hear from voters directly, has made it his mission to lure back voters from the AfD, which has been gaining ground in Bavaria ever since its 500-mile land border with Austria became the main gateway for migrants into Germany in 2015 and 2016.Though the number of new arrivals is back to pre-crisis levels, Mr. S\u00f6der, sounding a lot like the AfD, is warning that Germany\u2019s migration crisis is coming back and that vast areas of the country have already become lawless no-go areas.\u201cPeople expect the state to show strength,\u201d he said in an interview before his recent beer tent appearance. \u201cMigration and the question of cultural identity have posed a new question and you can\u2019t answer that with old recipes.\u201dHis new recipe \u2014 ahead of hard-fought state elections in the fall \u2014 includes a striking disregard for facts. He sides with President Trump (rather than official German crime statistics) when he claims that migration is producing a crime wave. In fact, crime in Germany is at a 25-year-low.Lies, Mr. S\u00f6der scoffs.\u201cWe have whole cities where law and order has withdrawn from neighborhoods,\u201d he said, citing Berlin and cities like Duisburg in the old industrial heartland in northwestern Germany.\u201cHow can the state judge crime statistics in Duisburg when there are no police anymore?\u201d he said.But Mr. S\u00f6der insists that \u201cthe numbers are going up,\u201d though, again, he cannot cite any supporting data.\u201cNew alternative routes are being planned, for example via Albania,\u201d he said.How did he know?\u201cEveryone is reporting this, you can sense a revival.\u201dHad he actually seen an increase in migrants at the German border?\u201cNo, not yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only a question of time.\u201dThe world Mr. S\u00f6der paints is the same one Mr. Orban and other European populists have been sketching out \u2014 a world where mostly Muslim immigrants are threatening to undermine Christian Western culture, and where a conservative revolution is needed to unseat the liberal governments that have allowed them in.\u201cGermany made a historic mistake in 2015, by leaving the borders open,\u201d Mr. S\u00f6der said. \u201cGermany split Europe.\u201d Germany, not Bavaria, he stressed. \u201cBavaria was against it,\u201d he said.\u201cWe talk about Islam all the time and don\u2019t realize how insecure we are about our own roots,\u201d Mr. S\u00f6der said. \u201cIn Bavaria, we stand up for our values.\u201dBefore taking the top job three months ago, Mr. S\u00f6der ran a number of ministries in Bavaria, most recently the Finance Ministry, which includes the \u201cheimat\u201d brief, an attempt at celebrating identity and a sense of cultural belonging, as well as diverting public investment from urban centers to rural areas to combat globalization fears.It proved to be a good fit for Mr. S\u00f6der, who was applauded even by some opponents for several tangible successes: He moved several government offices out of big cities (the ministry itself ended up in his native Nuremberg), invested millions in faster internet for rural areas and helped struggling communities pay the bills for public services.\u201cHeimat,\u201d he says, \u201cis the antidote to globalization.\u201dIn a state where folklore is politics and politics is folklore few disagree.But some are uneasy about a revival in ostentatious celebrations of Bavarian customs at a time when the language about migrants has hardened. \u201cIt has a feel of exclusion,\u201d said Wolgang Jirschik, the mayor of Baierbrunn, who listened to Mr. S\u00f6der in the beer tent the other night.\u201cHe says he wants to calm people\u2019s fears and at the same time he fans them,\u201d Mr. Jirschik said. \u201cMarkus S\u00f6der has the ability to go right up to the limit of what is sayable before it becomes far-right ideology.\u201dOthers see it differently. \u201cS\u00f6der is no Trump,\u201d said Thomas Dopfer, an accountant, who was also listening. \u201cHe has a sense of what preoccupies people, and most think being tough on migration is the only way to fight the AfD.\u201dHe has always been a shrewd communicator. In the beer tent recently he spoke for nearly an hour without notes. A near-teetotaler, he drinks diet soda or water, unless there is a camera \u2014 then he will nip on a beer as well.Strikingly tall \u2014 he stands about 6 feet, 6 inches tall, he is famous for his elaborate and themed disguises during carnival every year. One year he went as Marilyn Monroe, this year as a Bavarian king.Mr. S\u00f6der, who once worked in television, knows how to tell a good story, including his own. He talks often about his modest roots in a working-class district of Nuremberg, less often about marrying the daughter of a wealthy businessman, according to German reporters following him on the campaign trail.He became a conservative at 16 out of \u201cconviction,\u201d in a neighborhood that had historically voted left. While his friends worshiped soccer players and pop stars, Mr. S\u00f6der hung a poster of the arch-conservative Bavarian leader Franz Josef Strauss on the wall of his bedroom. Growing up near American Army barracks, Mr. S\u00f6der says he has always been a fan of the United States, \u201cthe land of unlimited opportunities.\u201d\u201cIn school you were either for Strauss or against Strauss, for America or against America,\u201d he recalled. He was always, as he put it, \u201cpro-Bavarian and pro-American.\u201dLong before migration became a hot-button issue, Mr. S\u00f6der built his reputation of a provocateur.These days he expresses \u201crespect\u201d for Mr. Orban, a regular guest of honor in Bavaria, and for the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, a fellow conservative who leads a coalition with the far right Freedom Party in Vienna.Mr. S\u00f6der thinks that is not a big deal. Germany, he said, should stop being the \u201cworld champion of political correctness,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was a time when the Austrian government was sanctioned temporarily because it has a coalition with the Freedom Party,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s normal.\u201dThe Freedom Party is an ally of the AfD and other far-right parties in Europe. So, could an alliance between the conservatives and the AfD become \u201cnormal\u201d in Germany, too?\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Mr. S\u00f6der, who then paused, and added more firmly: \u201cNever.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misattributed statements to Markus S\u00f6der. While he has a reputation for making provocative statements, he did not say that German children should be called Klaus, not Kevin, nor did he propose having the entire Green Party sent for a drug test.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Twitter Threat vs. Iran: Loud but Hardly Clear", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s vituperative tweet against Iran late on Sunday showed his determination to use the same approach that he took to engineer a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. But Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers are far more united in their hostility to engaging with Iran, and Iran is far less likely to bend to such pressure.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat that Iran would \u201csuffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before,\u201d delivered before midnight in all capital letters, succeeded in changing the subject after a week of bad headlines about his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.But it only deepened questions about the long-term direction of Mr. Trump\u2019s Iran policy. While the White House on Monday did not rule out direct talks between the president and Iran\u2019s leaders over its nuclear program, Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish national security team has put the focus more on toppling the Iranian government than striking a new deal with it.A few hours before Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed in a speech that the United States would work with the Iranian people to undermine their clerical leaders, whom he described as \u201chypocritical holy men,\u201d guilty of looting their country to enrich themselves and finance Islamist terrorism around the world.The White House scrambled to lend a veneer of coordination to Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst. Officials said it had come after consultations with the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and in response to statements by Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani. A senior administration official said it augured a \u201cmore aggressive, comprehensive approach\u201d to Iran.Other people who know Mr. Trump said his decision to respond in such fiery terms was driven almost entirely by his search for a distraction from questions about Russia. Mr. Rouhani\u2019s words were hardly unusual, they noted: He warned the United States against the \u201cmother of all wars\u201d with Iran, but also opened the door to the \u201cmother of all peace.\u201dThere was nothing in Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet to suggest he is looking to talk anytime soon. But his words carried a distinct echo of his threat last summer to North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, whom he said faced \u201cfire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201dEight months later, Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet, and after spending a few hours with him in Singapore, Mr. Trump declared that he and Mr. Kim had ended the nuclear crisis with North Korea. He has stuck to that assessment despite the fact that North Korea pledged to do nothing beyond what it has long promised, and that subsequent negotiations have bogged down in mutual recrimination.When Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in May, he told aides and foreign leaders that his policy of maximum pressure had forced Mr. Kim to the bargaining table, and that a similar policy of overwhelming pressure would enable the United States to extract a better deal from Iran.He has even taken credit for what he says are changes in Iran\u2019s behavior in the region since he pulled out of the deal \u2014 an assertion that baffles Iran experts, who say there is no evidence of changes in how Iran is operating.Experts and former officials who have negotiated with Iran listed at least three reasons Mr. Trump would find it difficult to replicate his North Korea breakthrough with Iran.First, Iran\u2019s leadership is more complex and multifaceted than the one-man state of North Korea, making it harder for Tehran to reverse course like Mr. Kim did, and reach out to Mr. Trump.Second, there are well-financed, powerful constituencies at home and abroad \u2014 like the Israeli government and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a Washington-based lobbying group \u2014 which will mobilize against any new diplomatic overture to Iran.Third, Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal gives the Iranians little incentive to negotiate with the United States, especially since the other five signers \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 are still adhering to it.\u201cThe bet they\u2019re making is that all those countries will knuckle under, and that Iran will come crawling back to the table,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, who took part in secret talks with Iran in 2012 as an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that led to President Barack Obama\u2019s deal.But Mr. Sullivan said the Trump administration had set an impossible standard for any successor agreement: that it settle all of Iran\u2019s other issues in the Middle East, from Syria to Yemen.\u201cTheir entire strategy is the pressure itself, with the hope that it brings down the government,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.For more than a decade, Mr. Bolton advocated \u201cthe overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran.\u201d But he recently told Voice of America that leadership change was \u201cnot the objective of the administration.\u201d Mr. Pompeo likewise stopped short of calling for regime change, though he did not mention diplomacy in his speech Sunday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.By contrast, Mr. Pompeo is heavily invested in diplomacy with North Korea, where, as C.I.A. director, he helped lay the groundwork for the Singapore summit meeting and, as secretary of state, has led the negotiations with Mr. Kim\u2019s subordinates. Mr. Bolton took a lower profile on North Korea, in part because he nearly sabotaged the meeting by declaring that the United States should use Libya as a model for ridding North Korea of its nuclear arsenal.On Iran, however, Mr. Bolton has helped set the tone. On Monday morning, he issued a statement that was every bit as bellicose as Mr. Trump\u2019s, except for being in lowercase letters.\u201cI spoke to the president over the last several days,\u201d he said, \u201cand President Trump told me that if Iran does anything at all to the negative, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid before.\u201dVali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said: \u201cThe endgame for Trump is different than it is for hawks like Bolton and Pompeo. Trump is much more interested in what comes out of it for him personally, in terms of a Nobel Peace Prize.\u201dEven if Mr. Trump overcame the objections of his staff to pursue a diplomatic opening, experts said it was unlikely Iran would be receptive. His decision to pull out of the nuclear deal has strengthened the hand of hard-liners there. Leaders like Mr. Rouhani, who was once viewed as a moderate, have become more hawkish.\u201cThe Iranians have a more complex political environment than North Korea,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert and deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy for Kim Jong-un to turn on a dime and take advantage of an opportunity; it\u2019s much harder for them to turn on a dime.\u201dIran, Ms. Maloney noted, reacted relatively calmly to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. The country\u2019s leaders, she said, believe that the president is trying to bait them to breach the nuclear deal, which they do not want to do. But his threats are rattling the Iranians, who worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s aides might goad him into a confrontation.\u201cThis is moving quickly,\u201d she said, \u201cand the president has an establishment around him that seems eager for some kind of dust-up with Iran.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Gold, Actuary Who Warned of Pension Crisis, Dies at 75", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeremy Gold, an actuary who more than 25 years ago warned of the financial debacles now slowly playing out among the cities and states that sponsor pension plans for their teachers, police officers, bus drivers and other workers, died on July 6 in Manhattan. He was 75.The cause was myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, his son, Jonathan, said.In 1985, Mr. Gold became one of the first American actuaries to work on Wall Street, straying from the profession\u2019s typical career track in insurance and consulting.It was the heyday of the corporate raid, when high rollers like Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens were buying up companies, firing the managers, turning everything upside down and reveling in the shareholder value they claimed to have created.Often, the raiders went after companies with pension funds, which happened to be Mr. Gold\u2019s m\u00e9tier. They said the funds held far more money than they needed, grabbed what they said was the surplus and used it to finance their takeovers. When the dust settled, the money was gone, and workers\u2019 hopes for a decent retirement were dashed.The raids inspired books, movies, Broadway productions like Ayad Akhtar\u2019s \u201cJunk\u201d and, eventually, a federal law slapping a punitive tax on any raider who looted a pension fund again.But for Mr. Gold, they raised big questions about the advice actuaries gave employers on how to run their pension plans.Why did the raiders keep finding overstuffed pensions to exploit? Could actuarial practices be making employers vulnerable? What if it was not just a few wrong numbers here and there, but a bedrock flaw in the actuarial standards that could lead to a systemic disaster?Mr. Gold eventually concluded that the standards were indeed dangerously flawed, and embarked on a 30-year mission, as he put it, \u201cto save my profession.\u201dPension mishaps, he knew, would be devastating as baby boomers aged and retired, because the amounts of money involved would be vast. Much like lawyers and accountants, actuaries have a professional duty to protect the public and to serve the greater good. If instead they were putting their clients in harm\u2019s way, even unintentionally, he thought, the public would eventually catch on, actuaries would be blamed, and the whole profession could go down in a cascade of ignominy and lawsuits.If the problem lay in weak actuarial standards, he concluded, the solution would be tighter standards.\u201cWithin the actuarial profession, Jeremy has done more than anyone to move this forward,\u201d said Ed Bartholomew, a former chief financial officer of the Inter-American Development Bank, who led a reform of the bank\u2019s pension management following the recent financial crisis.Mr. Bartholomew, now an independent consultant, said he thought work on new actuarial standards was \u201cgoing in the right direction.\u201d\u201cFor that,\u201d he said, \u201cI give credit to Jeremy, who has been pushing these ideas for 20 years.\u201dBut even as Mr. Gold won converts, he antagonized many colleagues, who believed the traditional actuarial methods were sound and thought he was harming the profession\u2019s credibility.He also earned the enmity of union officials, who thought his campaign threatened their members\u2019 benefits. In fact, Mr. Gold was a lifelong liberal Democrat, the son of high school English teachers who knew firsthand the value of traditional pensions.He came to his understanding of the pitfalls in actuarial science during his work on Wall Street in the 1980s. It wasn\u2019t just the corporate raids; the 1980s were also a time of groundbreaking theoretical advances in financial economics, a specialty that concentrates on trading, pricing, hedging and risk.From his vantage point as the head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s pension division, Mr. Gold could see the lessons of financial economics being applied to everything around him \u2014 except pensions.Financial economists were concerned with accurately measuring the cost of transactions that would happen in the future. Actuaries were focused on estimating pension costs and then spreading out the cost as smoothly as possible over time. Their clients wanted slow, steady funding schedules that would pay for their workers\u2019 benefits over the years without surging every time the markets soured or interest rates spiked.That meant actuaries were not terribly concerned about up-to-the-minute asset values, or measuring pension obligations the way the markets would. Their numbers made sense to them, but not to anyone else. They often told clients to make bigger contributions than current market conditions called for, knowing it would result in excess funding, which would fill the hole later on when the markets changed.That was why the raiders of the 1980s found troves of pension money that seemed to be just sitting there, waiting to be captured.In 1995 Mr. Gold applied to the doctoral program at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, saying he wanted to research how pension finance had come to be so muddled.\u201cI would look to the principles of modern finance for guidance in the design of a more rational pension finance of the future,\u201d he wrote.By the time he emerged with a doctorate in financial economics, the big stock run-up of the 1990s was ending and the rich pension surpluses of the 1980s had disappeared. The baby boomers were retiring, the markets were gyrating, companies were trying to get out of the pension business, and state and local pension plans were struggling.Those conditions intensified the opposition to Mr. Gold\u2019s calls for sweeping change, but they made him all the more certain that change was needed.Mr. Gold was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 28, 1942, to Sarah and Edward Gold, and grew up on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. He was accepted at M.I.T. at 16 but flunked out after three years as a math major. He ultimately received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Pace College (now Pace University). Before joining Morgan Stanley he worked at the consulting firms Alexander & Alexander and Buck Consultants.His two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, Jonathan, and a granddaughter.Advertisement"}

He was 64.His death was announced by RT America, which did not specify a cause. His stepdaughter Megan Espelien said he had heart problems.Mr. Schultz, a burly former college football quarterback with a booming voice, ranged across the political spectrum during his radio and television career, achieving his highest visibility as a blunt-spoken liberal and champion of blue-collar America as host of \u201cThe Ed Show\u201d on MSNBC.In the 1990s, he had his own conservative radio talk show broadcast regionally from Fargo, N.D. But by 2000, when he announced he was a Democrat, he, and his show, had begun turning to the left, gaining listeners even while others may have dropped him.While it had nowhere near the listenership of shows hosted by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, the Schultz show grew in popularity as he established himself as a sharp critic of President George W.

It was at least the 10th such assault on civilian targets this year.The assault was part of a series of attacks attributed to the Islamic State against \u201csoft targets\u201d in or near the city of Jalalabad, where the extremists have been particularly active, mostly attacking civilians rather than confronting Afghan security forces.Officials were so concerned that a decision was made to hand over security for the area to the Afghan National Army, beginning on Wednesday, according to Attaullah Khogyani, the spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar Province.The attack on Tuesday began with two midday explosions outside the Department of Refugee Affairs, with several gunmen then entering the building and its compound, Mr. Khogyani said.Special forces engaged in \u201cintensive fighting\u201d against the attackers, Mr. Khogyani said, and rescued several people trapped inside the building.Mr. Khogyani said the Islamic State was probably responsible for the attack, which he said had begun as refugee officials were meeting with donors\u2019 representatives, although no foreigners were present.The 15 people killed included a woman and a police officer, Mr. Khogyani said. The International Rescue Committee, a global relief organization that has operated in Afghanistan for 30 years, said an Afghan staff member also was among those killed.At least 15 others were injured, some of them as a result of injuries sustained when they jumped from the building during the attack. All three attackers were killed.The Islamic State\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan, which calls itself the Islamic State in Khorasan, did not immediately claim responsibility, but normally it makes such claims only after an assault is over, and often the following day.Abdul Rahman Mawen, a civil activist in Jalalabad, blamed the extremists\u2019 declining battlefield fortunes for the attacks on soft targets. \u201cISIS was fighting against security forces in the first stages, but when they were beaten and suppressed by the security forces, they started attacking women, children and civilian targets,\u201d he said.A Nangarhar Provincial Council member, Zabihullah Zamarai, said it had gotten so bad that in many areas of the province, children were afraid to walk to school. \u201cEvery government institution in the city has been attacked.

{"Headline": "How Rare Earths (What?) Could Be Crucial in a U.S.-China Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUANTAN, Malaysia \u2014 Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium.Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze\u2019s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply.Right now, she can\u2019t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals \u2014 known as rare earths \u2014 that China produces. And even that source isn\u2019t a sure thing: The work is so volatile, complex and expensive that Lynas once came close to collapsing.\u201cThere were times where we were sitting there and I\u2019m saying, \u2018Can we really afford to put coffee into the staff rooms?\u2019\u201d Ms. Lacaze said.The Trump administration amped up its trade fight with China on Tuesday when it threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, ranging from frozen catfish fillets to copper wires to piston engines. China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar.But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market.And in one of its more strategic weapons, Beijing could use its dominance to cut off key parts of the global supply chain. China is the major supplier of a number of mundane but crucial materials and components needed to keep the world\u2019s factories humming. They include obscure materials like arsenic metals, used to make semiconductors; cadmium, found in rechargeable batteries; and tungsten, found in light bulbs and heating elements.They also include rare earths. A trade war risks putting those minerals in the middle of the conflict, potentially giving China a way to get back at the United States by cutting off supplies to American companies. Already rare earths have become embroiled in the conflict \u2014 they were among the long list released on Tuesday of Chinese-made goods that the Trump administration wants to tax.\u201cThere is a hole in the western supply chain,\u201d said Ryan Castilloux, the founder of Adamas Intelligence, a research firm.It is hard to go a day without using rare earths. They are found in personal electronics like smartphones, televisions and hair dryers, and electric and hybrid cars.They aren\u2019t actually rare \u2014 they are made up of 17 elements found together in the ground all over the world. But turning individual minerals into useful material is complicated, messy and costly, as Lynas well knows.Rare earth refining is done on a large scale in only two places on earth: China, and Lynas\u2019s plant here in Kuantan, Malaysia, a sprawling industrial area on the coast of the South China Sea. The company mines rare earths out of a collapsed volcano in Australia and ships them to Kuantan to be refined.With the business hemorrhaging cash, Ms. Lacaze slashed costs. She negotiated with impatient lenders, including hedge funds and a Japanese government agency that had backed Lynas because it was unsettled by China\u2019s hold over the industry. She reduced rent and overhead by closing the company\u2019s Australian headquarters and moved the company, her husband and herself to Lynas\u2019s facility in Kuantan.On a recent visit, Lynas technicians mixed rare earth concentrate, which looks to the untrained eye like unremarkable dirt, into chemical tanks that extract elements like lanthanum and cerium. Through a series of steps that take place in more than a dozen buildings, the resulting pinkish powder was funneled through oversize sieves into boxes on a conveyor belt and baked at 1,000 degrees Celsius.\u201cIt\u2019s just like a giant pizza oven,\u201d Ms. Lacaze said.Next door to the oven, more than 150 bags of neodymium and praseodymium and cerium sat on a warehouse floor to be shipped to customers around the world. These bags are precious goods \u2014 each one filled with neodymium and praseodymium is worth around $50,000.\u201cJust don\u2019t hit the bag!\u201d Ms. Lacaze said she likes to tell the forklift operators. \u201cIt\u2019s like hitting a BMW.\u201d\u201cWomen more often get to do jobs like mine, where you clean up other people\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said Ms. Lacaze, wearing her signature pink work boots. She is one of fewer than a dozen women running the 200 biggest companies in Australia, where Lynas is publicly listed.She has looked to elevate women at Lynas, often out of necessity as well as virtue. Unable to expand payroll during the the slump, Ms. Lacaze turned to current employees \u2014 often women \u2014 who worked in support roles like human resources and finance and shifted them to the factory floor to be operators, technicians and shift supervisors.China is her most immediate challenge. Lynas is now profitable, but Ms. Lacaze sees a potential trade war between China and the United States as more of a threat than an opportunity. Beijing could keep rare earths off the market, depriving many American and European manufacturers of the minerals they need.Lynas couldn\u2019t compensate for it all. It accounted for only about 12 percent of world output of rare earths last year, according to Adamas, the research firm. Chinese companies accounted for more than four-fifths.\u201cIf there is a full-blown trade war, I can\u2019t believe that the Chinese wouldn\u2019t use rare earths as part of that,\u201d Ms. Lacaze says. If China wanted to restrict the supply of rare earths by sticking tariffs on rare earth products or stopping exports outright, \u201cthey could do it, literally overnight.\u201dUnder that scenario, companies would look for alternatives to rare earths. Tesla Motors, for example, briefly turned to engines that don\u2019t use rare earths after the 2010 price surge. That could hurt Lynas\u2019s business.The Association of China Rare Earth Industry, an industry group controlled by the Chinese government, did not respond to a request for comment.Even if it doesn\u2019t disrupt the supply, China will likely keep its grip over the market for rare earths for a long time to come. It also dominates research and development of these minerals, giving it a leg up on the future, Ms. Lacaze said.\u201cI think there\u2019s about 100 Ph.D.s in rare earths working in applications inside China and working in technology development,\u201d she said. \u201cTo my knowledge, do you know how many Ph.D.s there are outside of China?\u201d With the fingers of her right hand, she made a zero.For other countries, that means depending on China for a long time to come, she said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d Ms. Lacaze said, \u201cbut it should scare policymakers.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

The I.R.S. could still request donor information from groups in the rare event that it was needed for tax scrutiny.\u201cAmericans shouldn\u2019t be required to send the I.R.S. information that it doesn\u2019t need to effectively enforce our tax laws, and the I.R.S. simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement on Monday evening.But critics denounced the measure, saying it would encourage political donations from both domestic and foreign contributors who want to skirt the law or keep their influence secret.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear signal that the I.R.S. and now the Treasury Department are not interested in any significant oversight of nonprofits,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer and former director of the I.R.S. division for tax-exempt organizations. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is excusing them from filing information that is of material importance for determining whether organizations are operating appropriately and within the boundaries of the rules.\u201dLloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, said it would further diminish reporting requirements for the groups. \u201cThis will make so-called dark money a bit darker,\u201d he said.Nonprofit groups that exist primarily to influence political campaigns, including so-called 527 organizations, will still be required to report the names of large donors, as will charities that accept tax-deductible contributions.Conservative groups and donors had been lobbying the Trump administration to make the change, partly by arguing that the reporting requirement made their funders vulnerable to exposure by the I.R.S. and state regulators.\u201cThe requirement to report such information increases compliance costs for some private parties, consumes I.R.S. resources in connection with the redaction of such information, and poses a risk of inadvertent disclosure of information that is not open to public inspection,\u201d the guidance said.The ruling noted that the state had posted more than 1,700 confidential donor lists on the internet, including the names and addresses of hundreds of donors to Planned Parenthood.The I.R.S. will now be able to see those groups\u2019 lists of big donors only if it specifically requests them. Those lists are not open to the public under existing rules.Steven M. Rosenthal of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said the change effectively ends the agency\u2019s oversight. \u201cThe I.R.S. audits tax-exempt organizations once in a blue moon and only after many years,\u201d said Mr. Rosenthal, noting that the agency has been starved for resources and has had to cut back enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible challenge\u201d to follow the money trail at that point.Republicans hailed the move, with Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, on Tuesday calling the decision \u201cparticularly welcome news to those of us who intently are focused on defending the First Amendment, for those of us who over the years have raised concerns during the last administration about activist regulators punishing free speech and free association. It\u2019s a straightforward, common sense policy decision.\u201dDemocrats shot back, with Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and the ranking member on the Finance Committee, saying the decision would allow \u201canonymous foreign donors to funnel dark money into nonprofits.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Housing Costs Rival New York\u2019s, but Boom May Be Ending", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY \u2014 The home wasn\u2019t perfect. The two-bedroom townhouse lacked parking and a backyard. Its proximity to a major road and a train station made for noisy evenings.But like many young Australians, Georgia Blackie felt she needed to buy it or rent for the rest of her life.Lately it has cooled off, though, and people like Ms. Blackie may pay the price.She and her partner closed on the townhouse last August for 720,000 Australian dollars, or about $533,000. But since the market\u2019s peak in November, neighborhood home values have slipped about 6 percent.\u201cIf property prices do go backward,\u201d said Ms. Blackie, a 31-year-old lawyer, \u201cwhere does that leave you?\u201dNobody is predicting an American-style housing crisis just yet. In fact, many economists predict that housing prices will soon rebound.If many households are forced to sell, \u201cto me that\u2019s the biggest match that could ignite things,\u201d said Richard Holden, a professor of economics at the University of New South Wales.While price increases elsewhere in recent years have been more modest, Sydney and Melbourne account for the lion\u2019s share of Australian real estate. They make up about 40 percent of the population and a majority of the property market value. Home values in both cities dropped last year, in some places in Sydney by more than 10 percent, according to Corelogic, a property data provider. So far this year they have dropped more than 2 percent in Sydney and almost 2 percent in Melbourne.The decline has a number of causes, including new restrictions on foreign buyers, which hindered wealthy \u00e9migr\u00e9s and investors from China. But a major factor is that Australians probably could not take much more. Prices, many experts say, simply rose too high too quickly.\u201cWe are on the edge of a precipice,\u201d said Martin North, principal analyst for Digital Finance Analytics, an independent research and advisory firm. \u201cAll of the forces that have driven the home sector and the debt sector higher in the last 20 years are all coming to a critical inflection point.\u201dAll of this has taken some air out of what some experts describe as a bubble, as a recent Saturday-morning auction in the Sydney suburb of Ryde showed.When the auctioneer asked for an opening bid, he received only tight-lipped smiles and an awkward silence. A kookaburra cackled. No sale was made that day.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit nerve-racking,\u201d said Chris Jabbour, a young real estate agent who welcomed people through the door before the auction. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what\u2019ll happen next.\u201dSo far, the economic damage has been minimal. Mortgage delinquency rates were largely stable last year, according to S & P Global, a ratings firm, though they are expected to rise this year. Moody Analytics, a financial intelligence firm, forecasts that home prices will resume rising by year\u2019s end.Still, signs of stress are showing. Mr. North, the analyst from Digital Financial Analytics, estimates that of 3.5 million mortgages where the owner lives in the home, almost a third of the households have incomes close to or less than their expenditures. He predicts that at least 50,000 homeowners may default in the next 12 months.The long run-up in housing prices mirrors Australia\u2019s boomtime economy, which has not seen a recession in more than a quarter-century. Demographics helped Sydney and Melbourne in particular, as the cities attracted both Australians and immigrants.Domain, an Australian real estate website, found in June that the average Sydney couple would take nearly nine years to save for a 20 percent deposit on an entry-level home near the city\u2019s central districts.\u201cAlmost everywhere you look, you can see icebergs,\u201d Mr. North said.Australian officials have taken notice. Last year, financial regulators announced new lending restrictions aimed at mortgages that allow borrowers to pay only interest and put off repaying the loan itself. A government-backed banking commission this year has unearthed questions about mortgage vetting practices at some banks, prompting a few to review their policies.That has helped tame prices. Some middle-class suburbs in Sydney have seen declines of more than 10 percent and in Melbourne more than 6 percent since the market\u2019s peak late last year, according to CoreLogic. According to data from the R.E.A. Group, which operates Australia\u2019s largest real estate website, the average number of people looking per listing has dropped by nearly a quarter over the last year.\u201cI think it\u2019s just hit a price point that people were uncomfortable with,\u201d said Nerida Conisbee, the chief economist of the R.E.A. Group.\u201cThe air comes out of the bubble slowly,\u201d said Terry Rawnsley, an economist for SGS Economics and Planning, an urban planning firm.Real estate agents are preparing for a tough road ahead. \u201cIt used to be a cash and dash,\u201d said Charles Baynie, a real estate coach, referring to the ease at which properties were snapped up. \u201cNow it\u2019s not.\u201dMeanwhile, some first-time buyers are wondering whether housing will become affordable again.\u201cI guess I\u2019ve just taken that thought of eventually having my property and put that in a box in my mind that says \u2018unattainable,\u2019\u201d said Siobhan Kranz, 30, who lives in Melbourne.\u201cThere\u2019s a level of resentment that\u2019s grown with that,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I find hard to shake.\u201dIsabella Kwai reported from Sydney, and Adam Baidawi from Melbourne.

{"Headline": "Laos Dam Collapse Leaves Hundreds Missing and Homes Washed Away", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 The wall of water, unleashed by a dam failure, roared through a half-dozen rural villages in Laos, sweeping away hundreds of people in its torrents.On Tuesday, many of those people were nowhere to be found, and while only several people have been confirmed killed, Laotian officials feared the worst.The dam, which was still under construction, gave way on Monday, forcing nearly 7,000 people to flee their homes.Photos and videos from the scene showed murky, brown water covering a vast area, with residents seeking refuge on rooftops that barely remained dry. Others could be seen walking knee deep in water out of the flooded area or escaping on boats with only a few possessions in hand.The dam was part of a billion-dollar hydropower project that the Laotian government sees as critical for economic development. Opponents argued that the risks to local people and to fisheries did not justify the economic benefits.The failure of the structure, one of the smaller of more than a half-dozen dams being built on three tributaries of the Mekong River in Laos, released about 175 billion cubic feet of water, washing away homes in the southern province of Attapeu, near the border with Vietnam and Cambodia.The state news agency did not give an exact death toll, but it is feared the number will grow, with the search for victims in the devastated area still in its early stages.Though the flooding was widely described as a result of a dam collapse, the South Korean company building the dams, SK Engineering & Construction, said it was investigating whether the structure failed or whether water swept over it as a result of heavy rain. The rainfall was three times heavier than normal, according to the Yonhap News Agency in South Korea.The company sent helicopters, boats and personnel to aid rescue operations, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement.The project \u2014 which includes three major dams in addition to at least three smaller auxiliary dams, or saddle dams, like the one that failed \u2014 is designed to generate electricity from the water of three rivers, which all ultimately flow into the Mekong.laosXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamOther damsAttapeuMain floodedareaAttapeulaos10 MilesXe-Pian Xe-Namnoy DamOther damsAttapeuMain floodedarealaos10 MilesBy Tim Wallace | Source: Global Disaster Alerting Coordination SystemThe electricity is to be produced in southern Laos, but 90 percent is to be purchased by Thailand. The project, begun in 2013, was scheduled to begin operation next year.The damming of the Mekong and its tributaries has been highly controversial.The Mekong stretches about 2,700 miles from the Tibetan Plateau in China to the vast Mekong Delta of Vietnam, passing along the borders of Myanmar and Thailand and flowing through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam before spilling into the South China Sea.China, Laos and Cambodia have begun massive hydroelectric development programs, with more than a dozen dams planned, under construction or completed on the main river and many more dams on tributaries.Laos, a landlocked, communist state that is largely isolated from the rest of the world, is one of Asia\u2019s poorest countries. Its leaders see harnessing hydroelectric power as key to growth.Opponents fear that damming the Mekong River will cause greater economic harm than good by destroying fisheries and damaging the delta\u2019s rich farming region, which depends on the flow of sediment from the upper stretches of the river.The electricity the dams generate can serve growing urban populations and provide a financial boon for provincial officials, powerful militaries and giant conglomerates. International development agencies often agree to partially finance the dams, despite concerns about corruption, in part because hydroelectric power is seen as preferable to coal-power plants and other fossil fuel projects that contribute to global warming.But many independent studies have demonstrated that hydropower projects in Southeast Asia \u2014 especially large ones \u2014 directly contribute to erosion, the decimation of fish stocks and biodiversity, and the further impoverishment of rural communities that are forced to leave the dam sites and move to less-fertile land.The collapse of the dam Monday was not the first in Laos. Last year, a dam on the Nam Ao River that was being built as part of a hydropower project burst, although no deaths were reported after that accident.The 410-megawatt dam is being built by the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company, a joint venture that includes two companies from South Korea, one from Thailand and one from Laos.SK E & C, one of those South Korean companies, is an affiliate of SK Group, one of South Korea\u2019s largest business conglomerates, and has built power plants at home and abroad.The phone lines of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company\u2019s two offices in Laos were either busy or rang unanswered on Tuesday.Some residents whose villages were in the way of the hydropower project have resisted moving, saying the compensation they were offered was too small and the land they were offered was unsuitable for farming.\u201cIn addition, families have found that the shallow soil around their homes is inappropriate for growing vegetables, fruits or staple crops, and consistently attest to going hungry,\u201d the letter said.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Muktita Suhartono from Jakarta, Indonesia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health Care\u2018Pragmatic trials\u2019 differ from most research studies by focusing on effects in the real world. Promising health studies often don\u2019t pan out in reality. The reasons are many. Research participants are usually different from general patients; their treatment doesn\u2019t match real-world practice; researchers can devote resources not available in most physician offices. Moreover, most studies, even the gold standard of randomized controlled trials, focus squarely on causality. They are set up to see if a treatment will work in optimal conditions, what scientists call efficacy. They\u2019re \u201cexplanatory.\u201d Efficacy is important. But what we also need are studies that test if a treatment will work in the real world \u2014 if they have effectiveness. A pragmatic trial seeks to determine if, and how, an intervention might work in practice, where decisions are more complicated than in a strictly controlled clinical trial.Why do we need all this? Let\u2019s take chronic pain as an example. Those who suffer from it want relief, and they want it now. Because people know that opioids exist, it\u2019s hard to get them into a trial where they might take less powerful pain medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. It\u2019s also hard to do the long-term studies we need, because patients often want to try other options if the first one doesn\u2019t work.In a purely explanatory randomized controlled trial, patients would be assigned to one medication or the other, in a blinded fashion. They would be required to take their assigned option (and most likely only their assigned option) for the entire study period. If they failed to stay on protocol, they might be deemed a \u201cfailure\u201d in the study.Under these conditions, it\u2019s hard to get patients to participate, and the same with doctors. They know that opioids are thought to be stronger, and many already prescribe them.The medications were adjusted based on patient preferences and responses. Providers could switch patients to different drugs at the same level; change the dose or frequency of doses; add other drugs to manage side effects; and move patients up or down levels of intensity. They were also allowed to use any nonpharmacological pain therapies they liked.That\u2019s how actual care occurs. This way, you can measure how treating someone with opioids might compare with treating someone without opioids for a sustained period. Purists will argue, correctly, that this doesn\u2019t prove that any one medication is better than another, or that some specific opioid might not outperform some specific non-opioid drug for certain conditions in certain settings for certain patients. They\u2019re right. But what this study does prove is that you can treat patients with non-opioid analgesics in clinical practice just as well as you can with opioids to control pain and improve function.As a side benefit, patients don\u2019t become addicted to opioids.Moreover, studies like these are difficult to design and expensive. They\u2019re logistically much more complicated than simple head-to-head trials. They involve complex protocols, significant education of providers, and lots of oversight.Randomized controlled trials are great for certain things. They absolutely have their place in determining efficacy and causality. But sometimes pragmatic trials are better. If we want to see improvements in care in the real world, not just the lab, we may need to push for more of them. Advertisement"}

Yes, I know they\u2019re thrilled about tax cuts and judges.

And some are just cowards, afraid of mean tweets or base blowback.This week, however, a new possibility came into focus. Perhaps, rather than covering for Trump, some Republicans are covering for themselves.Last Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, indicted 12 members of Russian military intelligence for their interference in the 2016 election.

Jessica Bowman, a public information officer for the Lexington Fire Department.Cooking, in particular, he sees as \u201c100 percent therapy.\u201d In making bread, for example, \u201cthere is something magic about kneading the dough side by side with someone else, not making eye contact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very tactile and freeing.\u201d\u201cMy guess is that they wanted to meet people where they were,\u201d Mr. Perez said, but \u201cI didn\u2019t see a spark in people\u2019s eyes, or pride in the food. I didn\u2019t see professional behavior. I could always tell who the heroin addicts were.\u201d Many of these places, including one of the couple\u2019s favorites, Blochead Pizza in Cincinnati, ended up closing.The couple also hire from and work directly with treatment centers, adding an additional level of accountability for employees.\u201cWe are not certified experts on this, nor do we claim to be,\u201d Ms. Perez said. \u201cWe are just providing the piece of the puzzle that is giving people a job right away when they are getting clean.\u201d The menu is simple \u2014 sandwiches, salads, eggs, baked goods \u2014 and intended to teach widely applicable cooking skills. Employees greet every guest, bus every table, learn to cook sous vide, and bake their own bread for the sandwiches.Initially, business at DV8 Kitchen was slow: The restaurant, which proclaims its mission on its website and on the front of each menu, lost $30,000 in its first five months. \u201cWhen people heard \u2018second chance,\u2019 they were either concerned with their personal safety, or they were thinking second chance means second rate,\u201d Mr. Perez said.The couple soon realized that they couldn\u2019t offer dinner service, since most of their employees \u2014 18 out of 23 are in what Mr. Perez calls active recovery \u2014 had to attend support meetings at night. The Perezes leaned into breakfast and lunch, pushing the homemade breads and baked goods. By March, they said, the restaurant was turning a profit. It started selling the bread wholesale to other restaurants, and DV8 was one of a few places in town that catered breakfast. The hefty cinnamon rolls, made with croissant dough to add more labor to the process, have drawn a cult following.Marsha Elliott, an office manager at Berea College, south of Lexington, said she originally stopped by DV8 because she had heard the food was good; she only later learned about its purpose. Now, she visits whenever she is in the area. On a recent afternoon, she carried a box containing two cream cheese muffins (her favorite) and four cinnamon rolls.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t pay $4 for a cinnamon roll anywhere else here, but I don\u2019t mind paying a little extra to help people get back on their feet,\u201d she said.Another regular, Jason Johnston, the director of teaching and learning at the University of Kentucky College of Social Work, had the opposite experience: He came because of the social mission, then discovered that \u201cthe food was actually really good,\u201d he said. (Mr. Johnston had two cinnamon rolls on his table for one.)He said he brings friends to DV8, but often doesn\u2019t tell them that the place is staffed by workers recovering from addiction. When he reveals the truth, \u201cthey are always surprised,\u201d he said.After nine months in business, DV8 seems to be serving its dual purpose as restaurant and recovery setting.Dan Rison, 29, who greets customers and serves dishes, among other tasks, said he first started taking pain medication when he was 14, after an operation intended to correct a birth defect. He eventually became an alcoholic, was arrested and pleaded guilty to cashing a forged check, and went to jail.When he got out, he was unable to hold down a job for more than a few months, and once he did find one that he liked, at an antique store, \u201cthere was a lot of drug and alcohol abuse during the workday,\u201d he said. \u201cI stopped caring whether or not I lived.\u201d This is his first restaurant job, and the environment at DV8, he said, builds camaraderie.\u201cIn the darkest part of my addiction, I isolated myself,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, if you withdraw, the guest will notice you aren\u2019t bringing their food or asking how they are doing. Your co-workers will notice if you don\u2019t have a smile on your face.\u201d At DV8, he added, he doesn\u2019t have to hide his past \u2014 everything is out in the open.Mr. Rison is 19 credits away from earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, and would like to earn his master\u2019s in the same subject, so he can give others with addictions the kind of help he received.Jennifer Ratliff, 42, a cashier and cook, used to work at a Cracker Barrel and a Waffle House, \u201cbut a lot of people came in high,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no understanding or togetherness.\u201dWorking the grill, she said, \u201cis a huge coping skill for me.\u201d Making burgers, \u201cadding the spices, the egg on top, making the homemade Dijonnaise,\u201d and then seeing customers\u2019 reaction when they take a bite, brings \u201ca sense of accomplishment,\u201d she said.Hoang Dong, DV8\u2019s general manager, who worked with Mr. and Ms. Perez at their Saul Good restaurants, said he was concerned at first \u201cabout whether or not these people were going to be aggressive, or trainable, or relapse,\u201d he said. Instead, \u201ceveryone is wanting to turn their lives around, and they hold each other accountable.\u201dThe most difficult part, he said, is that the restaurant doesn\u2019t have enough jobs to keep up with the number of applicants. \u201cThere was a guy I had to turn down from employment because we were full, and he died of overdose a week later,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there is not much we could have done, but I felt horrible. What if I had hired him, and he had a chance?\u201dLocal treatment centers are thrilled about their members\u2019 progress, and how closely they are able to work with DV8.Several local restaurateurs who have also had workers with addictions said that approach seemed difficult to sustain.The low turnover rate at DV8 Kitchen suggests it can be otherwise. Only five of the 25 or so recovering people they have hired have left because of a relapse or firing. (The national turnover rate for the hospitality industry, by comparison, was 70 percent in 2016, according to the National Restaurant Association.)Mr. and Ms. Perez have been lobbying the state government for money to help open other DV8 restaurants, and for incentives for businesses to hire people in recovery from addictions.Every Tuesday at 3 p.m., the restaurant holds a mandatory workshop for employees. Lawyers explain how to get criminal convictions expunged from records, accountants talk personal finance and professional athletes discuss teamwork.At one recent workshop, Vitale Buford, a transformational coach who was addicted to prescription drugs, quizzed workers about the everyday troubles they take for granted. \u201cWhat are you tolerating?\u201d Ms. Buford asked.The employees scribbled down their answers: not getting custody of their children, being 50 pounds overweight, having strained relationships with parents. Then Ms. Buford told them to write all their excuses for tolerating these problems on a piece of paper, and toss it into the garbage.As they turned, one by one, toward the trash bin to discard their worries, the backs of their uniforms became visible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Successful Investing", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfIt really is a shame that Taylor Larimore chooses to use the word \u201cBoglehead\u201d in the title of his compelling new book: \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio\u201d (Wiley, $24.95.)There is nothing really wrong with the word. It refers to people who follow the investment principles of John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, the huge mutual fund company known for offering index funds.Mr. Bogle passionately believes in paying the absolute minimum when buying and selling stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds, investing for the long haul \u2014 to minimize both trading costs and capital gains \u2014 and diversifying your holdings.Mr. Larimore, who has been described by Mr. Bogle as \u201cking of the Bogleheads,\u201d accepts these ideas as gospel. And then he goes further, arguing convincingly in this short \u2014 112-page \u2014 engaging book that you can create a solid performing diversified portfolio with just three index funds.One fund invests in just about all United States stocks. Another holds almost every international equity. A third fund is made up of bonds from thousands of United States companies and government agencies. All three are what is typically known as total market index funds \u2014 one for domestic stocks, one for international stocks and one for bonds.So what\u2019s my problem with the word Boglehead? The word, coupled with Mr. Bogle\u2019s introduction to the book and the fact that three funds Mr. Larimore uses as his primary example come from Vanguard, can lead people to think they can only create a three-fund portfolio using Vanguard funds.That is simply not true as even Mr. Larimore \u2014 94 and a self-taught investor \u2014 points out.For many years, \u201cVanguard was the only mutual fund company where total market index funds were available,\u201d he writes. \u201cInvestors are now able to construct the three-fund portfolio with whichever company they prefer.\u201dStill, Mr. Larimore is a \u201cBoglehead\u201d and a co-author of two other \u201cBoglehead\u201d books (\u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing,\u201d Wiley, $26.95, and \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Retirement Planning,\u201d Wiley, $16.95), so we are stuck with the word.But that it is not unique does not minimize the appeal of Mr. Larimore\u2019s idea. People who think investing is difficult and time consuming tend to put it off, and this could get them to act.That is a good thing, as is the fact that Mr. Larimore advocates using index funds, which not only come with lower costs than actively managed ones but typically outperform them.In addition, using only three distinct funds eliminates potential overlap. When you own many mutual funds, the odds are that the same holding (say Apple) will appear in two or more of them, which could reduce the overall diversification of your portfolio.And, of course, having only three funds makes rebalancing your portfolio easier, when stock market gains, for example, leave you with a greater percentage of your wealth in equities than you want.As much as I like this book, I have two and a half bones to pick.The half first. I could have done without the constant praise from his fellow Bogleheads \u2014 who are known only by their initials in the book \u2014 for the three-fund idea. It\u2019s a good idea. Fine. No need to keep saying so.But after repeating that old investment chestnut that you should hold a percentage of stocks equal to 100 minus your age \u2014 for example, if you are 35, your portfolio should be 65 percent stocks and the rest bonds \u2014 he doesn\u2019t really say more.The problem with that is twofold. One size does not fit all. And second, subtracting your age from 100 produces what I think is a fairly conservative portfolio. My rule of thumb, if you need one, would be to subtract your age from 110 to establish a baseline for your stock holdings.My second problem with the book is that the three-fund portfolio he advocates includes no corporate bonds or government bonds from countries other than the United States. If you are going to have international stocks in your portfolio, shouldn\u2019t you have foreign bonds as well?I have been writing and talking about personal finance as part of my living for more than 30 years, and one thing I believe passionately is that people like me \u2014 those who want to help you manage your money better \u2014 tend to make things more complicated than necessary.We do it, I think, not to show off but because we find the subject fascinating. And so we go on at interminable length talking about basis points (one hundredth of 1 percent), inverted yield curves (when long-term debt pays a lower interest rate than short-term borrowings), and decumulation (how you use your savings to fund your retirement.)As a result, we often scare or confuse people.Mr. Larimore\u2019s prose won\u2019t scare anyone.It\u2019s accessible and his tone is friendly. And if it prompts people to create a diversified portfolio that keeps fees and taxes to a minimum and gets them to invest for the long haul, he will have performed a great service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Troubled Cameroon, U.S. Envoy Is Accused of Election Meddling", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 When the American ambassador took up his post in Cameroon late last year, he stepped into an increasingly troubled nation, locked in battle against Islamist militants in one part of the country and armed separatists in another.And then there is the matter of its leader.Cameroon has not had a new president since Michael Jackson released \u201cThriller\u201d in 1982.The remarks caused an uproar among officials in Cameroon and in the local media, which accused him of trying to influence a foreign election. The minister of foreign affairs summoned the ambassador for a scolding. Mr. Barlerin even received death threats.The ambassador, a career diplomat, noted that his comments were made following a discussion with the president about the need to stop the violence in areas where the military is battling a bloody separatist uprising.\u201cWe do not have a preferred outcome for the election,\u201d Mr. Barlerin said in a recent interview, emphasizing that he has stressed that to government officials. \u201cWe want a strong and stable Cameroon.\u201dThe matter seemed to quiet down, temporarily, until late last month when Mr. Barlerin\u2019s photo was plastered across the covers of at least three local newspapers, which accused him of paying nearly $5 million to opposition candidates in the presidential race.The United States Embassy strongly disputed the claim, releasing a statement that described the story as \u201centirely false.\u201dOpposition members also denied the reports and speculated they had been planted by the president\u2019s supporters, who know that the population would be appalled at any foreign attempt to influence elections.\u201cAll this agitation is simply that the officials are looking for the sympathy of the people,\u201d said Hilaire Kamga, one of the candidates running against Mr. Biya.The controversy stirred by the American ambassador is a sign of just how deeply entrenched Cameroon\u2019s current government is. Critics say his loyalists operate with impunity, creating nothing more than a charade of a democracy.The storm caused by Mr. Barlerin\u2019s remarks about Mr. Biya\u2019s legacy is not the first time American diplomats have become entangled in election controversy on the continent.Cameroon\u2019s opposition is fractured, and, like in past elections, no candidate with a mass following has emerged. Analysts fear that many voters who most likely would cast a ballot for someone other than the incumbent probably will not be able to vote because of violence that will keep polls from opening.Some Cameroonians are so fed up with the government that they may withhold their vote in protest, said Hans De Marie Heungoup, a Central Africa senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Some protests could turn violent, he said, and the military has a record of firing on unarmed protesters.Past elections won by Mr. Biya have been called flawed and full of irregularities.Even though victory for Mr. Biya seems likely if he formally joins the race, his supporters were still miffed at what they interpreted as an attempt at a foreign government to urge him to step down.\u201cThe American ambassador is not an enemy of Cameroon,\u201d said Saint-Eloi Bidoung, a first deputy mayor in Yaound\u00e9, the capital, and a member of the governing party. \u201cBut he should know that the departure of President Biya from power depends solely on the will of Cameroonians, and not from a foreign power, even the United States of America.\u201dEmmanuel Simh, a founding member of the opposition Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon, called the ambassador\u2019s remarks \u201cnormal diplomacy\u201d and said they caused a stir only because Mr. Biya\u2019s supporters are panicked about losing power.Mr. Biya was absent in 2016 when a train overloaded with passengers derailed, killing dozens. And last year when protests by separatists turned violent, the president was in Switzerland.Critics call him the President of the Hotel Intercontinental, for his preferred accommodation in Geneva.That Mr. Biya can spend so much time abroad with few implications at home demonstrates his grasp on power.Government officials have benefited from Mr. Biya\u2019s long tenure. Like many nations in the region, Cameroon is a place of haves and have-nots. Outside Yaound\u00e9, golden painted homes sit atop lush hillsides while beaten-down shacks line the roads at the bottom.\u201cMinisters,\u201d locals sigh and shrug when asked who lives on the hilltops.Any plans for a post-Biya nation are murky. If he wins the presidency again, Mr. Biya would be in his 90s by the end of his seven-year term. If he were to die in office, the Senate president would take over until an election is held two months later. But analysts question whether Mr. Biya\u2019s powerful loyalists would stand by idly.\u201cThe institutions there are so weak,\u201d Mr. De Marie Heungoup said.Unlike other countries in the region that rely on oil revenues to finance most of their budgets, Cameroon has a more diverse economy that includes agriculture and manufacturing, which allowed it to weather a drop in oil prices better than neighboring Nigeria.Cameroon is in the middle of an unstable region. Conflicts abound in nearby Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the region\u2019s war with Boko Haram has spilled across borders. Cameroon has welcomed tens of thousands of refugees from those conflicts and has been a key partner with foreign militaries in fighting Boko Haram.Mr. Barlerin said his office recently had emphasized, as a precaution, to the Cameroon government that the military equipment Americans have provided for the fight against Boko Haram must not be used to fight separatists.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful country and we\u2019ve had a lot of good cooperation from the government,\u201d Mr. Barlerin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it go up in smoke.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe only thing we want is for elections to be free, fair and credible and that the will of the Cameroonian people be heard.\u201dDionne Searcey reported from Dakar, Senegal, and Francois Essomba from Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in Local Business to Get an Even Break", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMs. Martin is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Better Off: Reinventing the American Dream.\u201dRodney Foxworth, the executive director of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (known popularly as Balle), explains it this way: \u201cBy localism, we don\u2019t mean parochialism. We mean creating direct relationships within the context of capital. In other words, when Wall Street bankers in New York or London can make important decisions that deeply affect the lives of people in Jackson, Miss., or rural Oklahoma, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t be alone if you associate localism with white hippies of the 1970s who liked their granola homemade and their T-shirts tie-dyed. Mr. Foxworth\u2019s entry point is anything but them.The son of a court clerk from Baltimore, Mr. Foxworth remembers his mother reading Langston Hughes\u2019s \u201cMother to Son\u201d \u2014 \u201clife for me ain\u2019t been no crystal stair\u201d\u2014 to him almost every night and exposing him early on to the criminal justice system and all the havoc it was wreaking in black communities. After graduating from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, he worked as a journalist before finding himself pulled into the world of community-minded black entrepreneurs in his hometown \u2014 people who created jobs for formerly incarcerated citizens and incubated new businesses started by local residents.Now 34, Mr. Foxworth explains: \u201cI didn\u2019t think about being part of a localism movement, but I was completely enmeshed in the place where I grew up and valued the set of relationships that I knew were required to move anything forward.\u201dWhen some of the most interesting leaders he knew became Balle Fellows, he became intrigued by the organization. Founded by a Philadelphia business owner, Judy Wicks, it began as a membership organization in 2001 \u2014 a 21st-century sort of chamber of commerce for people trying to raise public awareness of the power of buying locally. But by 2010, the members began to think more deeply about how capitalism in the United States had evolved in a way that discriminated against people like the Foxworth family, people of color in urban centers, indigenous folk and poor rural Americans when they tried to buy homes or create small businesses.Any attempt to encourage local economies, they reasoned, would have to acknowledge that history and embrace the under-resourced talent across the country. The Balle Local Economies Fellowship program, created in 2011, focused on bringing the \u201cunofficial mayors of their towns\u201d together to share best practices on building local, more equitable economies and gaining knowledge of alternative economic models like worker-ownership, land trusts and community-driven investment.Mr. Foxworth became the executive director of Balle last year. To date the organization has had 101 fellows from 43 states and provinces, collectively serving 121,650 small businesses. People of color now make up a majority of both the board and the staff.Balle is working on many of the United States\u2019 most excruciating pain points \u2014 economic inequality, racial animosity, partisanship and rural vs. urban divides. They don\u2019t do it by just making unusual allies of people like Mr. Foxworth and Ms. Smith, who have historically been excluded from the mechanisms that build wealth (like mortgages and business loans); they also seek to raise the awareness and change the practices of those with a disproportionate amount of privilege.The other level is tactical \u2014 by systematically analyzing where their investments are held and how they are giving away money, leaders learn how to get ruthlessly honest about where their foundations are failing to live up to their values. Sarah Kinser, the chief program officer of the Arkansas Community Foundation, was surprised by the process: \u201cI expected to find a step-by-step recipe for transitioning our portfolio, but the Foundation Circle helped me realize that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach.\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t mean the Circle\u2019s members can\u2019t be helpful to one another; to the contrary, they create a support group as they go back to their home institutions and try to change them. This, not the accounting, is often the hardest work. It often involves a lot of pushback from boards, attorneys and others who are accustomed to the old ways. Ms. Kinser explains: \u201cThe members of my cohort are supporting one another in discovering ways forward that are specific to the needs of the communities we serve and the organizations we represent. It\u2019s more difficult, but it\u2019s more authentic and, I believe, will be more effective in the long run.\u201dMany of the leaders go back to their institutions and do an audit of where their endowments are invested, then disinvest from companies that don\u2019t align with their values and invest instead in local efforts like affordable housing developments, work force development programs and small businesses. To date, foundations involved in the program have committed to reallocating over $100 million into their communities and mission-aligned investing.Typically, foundations have operated with a sort of church-and-state mentality about their money and how it is handled \u2014 one set of people (finance guys) manages the money according to one set of values (creating profit), while a different set of people (do-gooders) donates the money according to another set of values (an equal start for everyone). Foundation leaders are evaluated, in large part, on the growth of their assets. But members of the Local Economy Foundation Circle are questioning whether growing, or even maintaining, wealth is even ethical.The Heron Foundation has gone on to fund Balle\u2019s Local Economy Foundation Circle because they are intent on helping other foundations take these same steps. If even a fraction of the $865 billion that foundations currently invest in Wall Street were reallocated to Main Street, the country would look and feel profoundly different \u2014 particularly to those who have been left out.\u201cThe people and communities most adversely impacted by economic extraction and wealth inequality are resilient and have long innovated solutions to enduring systemic challenges,\u201d Mr. Foxworth explains. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the hard work. Now it\u2019s time for policymakers, philanthropists and investors to follow their lead.\u201dCourtney E.

{"Headline": "Trump Blasts Fed, China and Europe for Putting U.S. Economy at a Disadvantage", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump accused China and the European Union on Friday of manipulating their currencies to gain an edge in global trade and escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying those moves were putting the United States at a disadvantage.Mr. Trump appears ready to blame the Fed for trying to slow down a booming economy that he wants to make a centerpiece of the midterm elections. The president\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut, along with federal spending increases, have injected new stimulus into an economy that is finally shaking off the last vestiges of the recession.He also doubled down on his trade fight with China, vowing in an interview with CNBC that aired Friday that he was ready to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese imports \u2014 roughly all the goods China sends to the United States each year.But behind Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism is an economic paradox of his own making: The very policies he has pushed, like tax cuts, increased government spending or protectionist tariffs, are fueling many of the global changes that he finds so troubling.A booming United States economy is strengthening the dollar against other currencies, and Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs are prompting some countries, like China, to take steps to protect their exporters. The Fed, concerned about too rapid an expansion that is fueled in part by the enormous fiscal stimulus ushered in by the White House, is slowly raising rates to keep the economy from overheating.White House aides said that Mr. Trump was not trying to influence the Fed, the nation\u2019s central bank, but added that he would prefer if officials paused their plans for rate increases to avoid dampening economic growth. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is on track to raise them twice more by the end of the year, officials indicated after the Fed\u2019s meeting in June.Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the president\u2019s tweets displayed \u201ca breezy ignorance of facts and limited understanding of basic principles of economics.\u201d\u201cThe dollar is strengthening against other currencies because the U.S. economy is doing well and is implementing a fiscal expansion through a massive tax cut, both of which Mr. Trump has claimed credit for,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. He added that condemning rate increases as \u201cimplicitly aiding the enemy in U.S. trade wars is a dangerous and destructive strike against the Fed\u2019s independence.\u201dThe dollar, as measured by the United States dollar index, fell sharply. Prices of 30-year United States Treasury bonds, which are highly sensitive to changes in inflation expectations, also dropped, pushing yields \u2014 which move in the opposite direction \u2014 higher. Prices for gold, a traditional hedge against inflation risk, rose.\u201cTrump clearly doesn\u2019t accept that a strong dollar and a widening trade deficit are the natural result of his own fiscal expansion,\u201d said Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said in an interview that the president strongly believed that his policies would increase investment and draw workers into the labor force.\u201cThe United States is the hottest economy and investment destination in the world right now,\u201d thanks largely to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cMoney is flowing in from everywhere, and that\u2019s terrific.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s sharp words come ahead of a gathering in Argentina this weekend of finance ministers of the Group of 20 countries, where Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is expected to participate in a dozen bilateral meetings and broader multilateral meetings. The chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, will also be in attendance and will participate in a discussion on global economic risk, the Treasury Department said.In a slew of trade actions, the president has already imposed tariffs on about 4 percent of American imports, including foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar-power products, and a variety of goods from China. But he has threatened to greatly escalate those measures, expanding tariffs to cover about a quarter of all United States imports.A senior Treasury official who previewed the event said that Mr. Mnuchin does not have a meeting scheduled with Chinese officials in Buenos Aires. They are expected to interact during the multilateral discussions, but one-on-one negotiations are currently stalled.The Treasury secretary will meet separately this weekend with counterparts from Group of 7 countries to discuss ways to coordinate \u201cconcrete action with regard to China and its economic aggression,\u201d the official said.In the interview with CNBC, the president described the tit-for-tat threats on China as a poker game, saying the trade conflict was \u201cthe right thing to do for our country.\u201d\u201cI raised 50, and they matched us,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t match us. You can\u2019t match us because otherwise we\u2019re always going to be behind the 8-ball.\u2019\u201dDerek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that China would be able to offset the effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs through changes to its currency. However, any changes would have to be made gradually to avoid alarming investors and prompting capital flight, which could destabilize Chinese markets.\u201cFarmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers.\u201dFarmers have been struggling with lower commodity prices in recent years, but the price of soybeans has plummeted sharply since the beginning of May, as China, the United States\u2019 biggest foreign buyer, threatened to curtail its purchases.Though Mr. Trump has a strong base of support among American farmers, many insist that exporting is vital for their livelihoods and that trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president has heavily criticized, have benefited them. American agricultural exports have nearly tripled since Nafta went into force in 1994, reaching $140.47 billion in 2017. They continue to outpace agricultural imports, which have also risen.\u201cTrade has been the one bright spot for farmers,\u201d said Joseph W. Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cUntil the tariffs were put on, farm exports have been near record highs in value.\u201dRon Moore, the chairman of the American Soybean Association and a farmer in Illinois, said that tariff threats had appeared to have caused the market to collapse in recent months. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme amount of volatility in the marketplace right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really makes farmers nervous. We\u2019ve all got bills to pay.\u201dAna Swanson and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Alan Rappeport from Buenos Aires. Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

So he turned the floor over to a colleague who discussed the benefits of operating customer call centers for additional hours on Sundays.For a company that has had just nine chief executives in its 149-year history, the announcement that Mr. Solomon would succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein in the top job on Oct. 1 marked an important milestone. Yet inside and outside the bank, it was anticlimactic \u2014 a reflection of the fact that the succession plan has been on public display for months and the expectation that the bank\u2019s strategy won\u2019t change radically under Mr. Solomon.\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a revolution, there\u2019s going to be evolution at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Solomon told The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good place.

Schwartz, Mr. Solomon moved to expand Marcus \u2014 the consumer-lending platform that Mr. Talwar runs \u2014 as well as broaden investment-banking services into new markets in the United States and offer additional services to corporations, including managing their cash.Goldman has gone through waves of tumult in recent decades. A closely held partnership that specialized in providing discreet financial advice to powerful institutions, the bank morphed into a publicly traded, risk-taking powerhouse whose traders were known for pushing the envelope. Since the financial crisis, the pendulum has been swinging in the other direction. As its securities-trading business became less profitable, Goldman returned to its client-focused roots.That is the world that Mr. Solomon, a longtime investment banker known for his ability to charm both employees and clients, comes from.The need to refocus on clients has been clear from Goldman\u2019s recent financial results. The combination of post-crisis regulations and new technologies has gutted the trading business and blunted Goldman\u2019s competitive edge. Investment banking, while Goldman dominated in market share, has never been the engine of its profits. And its investment management business, despite substantial growth, is still catching up to its competitors.So Goldman has emphasized the opportunities created by new technology and jumped into consumer lending and deposit-gathering by starting Marcus.The initiative would have been unimaginable at the start of Mr. Blankfein\u2019s reign in 2006, when Goldman prided itself on being a hard-nosed Wall Street aggressor. But since then, the bank has embraced the consumer business. It believes its brand and blank slate give it an advantage in figuring out how to tailor \u2014 and make money from \u2014 loans and other financial services to people who previously wouldn\u2019t have been Goldman clients.\u201cI would say that the consumer business has moved to us,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said. \u201cIt\u2019s become mathy, algorithmic, platform, distribution, digital, all the things we\u2019ve been historically good at.\u201dWhen Mr. Solomon takes over, the biggest changes will most likely be attitudinal. For example, Goldman executives say that Mr. Solomon \u2014 who moonlights as a dance-music D.J. \u2014 wants to improve the bank\u2019s financial transparency in order to help analysts, investors and the news media better understand how the bank makes money. He may hold the firm\u2019s first-ever \u201cinvestor day\u201d in 2019. He also has vowed to significantly increase the number of women the bank hires and promotes.Inside Goldman on Tuesday, there were a few modest signs that a power change was afoot.Elsewhere in the skyscraper, executives gathered to field analyst and investor questions about the leadership change and the bank\u2019s second-quarter results. It wasn\u2019t until 40 minutes into the conference call that someone asked about what will be different under Mr. Solomon.Marty Chavez, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, brushed aside such questions, describing the announcement as nothing more than \u201canother step in the unfolding of the board\u2019s plan.\u201d He added that \u201cLloyd and David and all of us have worked together for years and decades.\u201dOn Wednesday morning, it will be back to normal for Mr. Solomon, who remains the No. 2 executive for another few months. First on his to-do list: speaking to Goldman\u2019s summer interns.Emily Flitter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Trump Decision Revealed a G.O.P. Memo\u2019s Shaky Foundation", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump declassified a memo by House Republicans in February that portrayed the surveillance of a former campaign adviser as scandalous, his motivation was clear: to give congressional allies and conservative commentators another avenue to paint the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference as tainted from the start.But this past weekend, Mr. Trump\u2019s unprecedented decision, which he made over the objections of law enforcement and intelligence officials, had a consequence that revealed his gambit\u2019s shaky foundation. The government released the court documents in which the F.B.I. made its case for conducting the surveillance \u2014 records that plainly demonstrated that key elements of Republicans\u2019 claims about the bureau\u2019s actions were misleading or false.On Sunday, Mr. Trump nevertheless sought to declare victory. In a series of early-morning tweets, he claimed without evidence that the newly disclosed files \u201cconfirm with little doubt that the Department of \u2018Justice\u2019 and FBI misled the courts\u201d to win approval to start wiretapping the former adviser, Carter Page, shortly after he had left the campaign amid criticism of his ties to Russia.Mr. Trump\u2019s portrayal, which came as the administration is trying to repair the damage from his widely criticized meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, revived the claims put forward in February by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. But in respect after respect, the newly disclosed documents instead corroborated rebuttals by Democrats on the panel who had seen the top-secret materials and accused Republicans of mischaracterizing them to protect the president.The records again cast an unflattering light on Representative Devin Nunes, the committee\u2019s chairman, who led the attack on the F.B.I. surveillance, though he admitted in February that he had not read the application documents. Mr. Nunes has taken repeated steps to try to bolster Mr. Trump and undercut the Russia investigation.In his tweets, Mr. Trump left unmentioned the nature of the concerns the F.B.I. raised about Mr. Page in the court applications. The documents said that the bureau \u201cbelieves Page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government,\u201d that he had \u201cestablished relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers,\u201d and that he had been \u201ccollaborating and conspiring with the Russian government.\u201dHe also played down a letter he wrote in 2013 in which he described himself as \u201can informal adviser to the staff of the Kremlin,\u201d saying he had merely \u201csat in on some meetings.\u201dMuch of the dispute in February over the surveillance of Mr. Page centered on the fact that the F.B.I.\u2019s court application included unverified information it had obtained from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who had been hired to research Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia by a firm that was in turn being financed by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.One central issue was whether the F.B.I. gave the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court sufficient information about the funding of Mr. Steele\u2019s research to understand that he had been commissioned to dig up information about Mr. Trump\u2019s links to Russia by someone with a political motive, even though he had been a neutral source in the past.The Republican memo issued in February said the F.B.I. had failed to \u201cdisclose or reference the role of the D.N.C., Clinton campaign or any party/campaign in funding Steele\u2019s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior D.O.J. and F.B.I. officials.\u201d But Democrats at the time contended that the court had been told that the research had politically motivated origins.The application contains a page-length explanation that does alert the court that the person who commissioned Mr. Steele\u2019s research was \u201clikely looking for information to discredit\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. It goes on to explain why, notwithstanding Mr. Steele\u2019s \u201creason for conducting the research,\u201d the F.B.I. believed it was credible.Republicans had also faulted the application for not explicitly identifying Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee by name. But that criticism ignored the fact that law enforcement officials were following a general policy not to name Americans, even referring to Mr. Trump only as \u201cCandidate #1\u201d in renewal applications despite noting that he was now the president-elect and then the president.David Kris, an expert on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act who served in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, dismissed the notion that the intelligence court judges had been misled.Another issue in dispute was Republicans\u2019 suggestion that a September 2016 Yahoo News article about Mr. Page\u2019s ties to Russia was cited in the application as corroboration for Mr. Steele\u2019s information even though it later emerged that he had been a source for that article. Democrats at the time said that was misleading because the purpose of including the article was instead to tell the court that Mr. Page had denied the allegations about his meetings in the July 2016 trip to Moscow.The application dovetails with the Democrats\u2019 account. The article is described in a section that discusses how the allegations about Mr. Page became public, prompting him to deny them but still leave the Trump campaign as it distanced itself from him. That section of the application is titled: \u201cPage\u2019s Denial of Cooperation With the Russian Government.\u201dThe application materials also identify the four judges who approved the wiretap and its extensions; all are appointees of Republican presidents. And while much of the material is redacted, it shows that the number of pages included in each application grew significantly, suggesting that the government was likely adding new information, such as discussing the information it obtained from the wiretap, to justify its request to prolong the surveillance.Asked whether Mr. Nunes wanted to comment on the release of the surveillance materials and the ways they appeared to contradict his February statements, a spokesman for the Intelligence Committee said in an email that the materials did not do so.But Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said the documents affirmed that law enforcement officials had acted appropriately in obtaining the wiretap order in the face of \u201ca profound counterintelligence threat\u201d from Russia. He said the materials put the \u201cconspiracy theories to rest,\u201d while criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to declassify their existence during a pending investigation.\u201cThese national security considerations were cast aside by President Trump, whose decision to declassify the Nunes memo \u2014 which misrepresented and distorted these applications \u2014 over the fervent opposition of the Department of Justice, was nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to interfere with the special counsel\u2019s investigation,\u201d he said.And Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s insinuation that the wiretapping of Mr. Page equated to surveillance of the campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that them looking into Carter Page means they were spying on the campaign,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\u201cThe only plot is to interfere in the election by the Russians,\u201d he added.An earlier version of this article gave an imprecise description of a brief email response from a spokesman for Mr. Nunes to a request for comment. The spokesman meant that the court filings did not contradict Mr. Nunes\u2019s February statements. He did not mean that Mr. Nunes did not want to comment.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington, and Katie Rogers from Berkeley Heights, N.J.Advertisement"}

Ms. Jones spent eight months searching for a job with living wages and benefits, after being laid off from a paper company where she had worked for nearly 13 years.

Since the recession ended in 2009, corporate profits have grown at an annualized rate of 6.5 percent. Several sectors have done much better. On Friday, for example, banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported outsize double-digit earnings in the second quarter.Workers\u2019 paychecks account for much less of the nation\u2019s total income since the last recession, and the profits of businesses account for more.68%6766656463RECESSIONS6261601970\u201980\u2019902000\u201910\u201918%1514131211109871970\u201980\u2019902000\u201910\u20191868%6766656463RECESSIONS6261601970\u201980\u2019902000\u201910\u201918%1514131211109871970\u201980\u2019902000\u201910\u201918Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis | By The New York TimesAs Fed policymakers have explained, allowing the economy to run too hot \u201ccould lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.\u201d And persistent wage increases, unlike growing profit margins, are considered a signal that the heat is on.The bank\u2019s primary method of cooling the economy is to dampen spending and investing by raising interest rates and making it more expensive to borrow money \u2014 an antidote that could hurt profits in some sectors as well as trim payrolls. The thinking goes like this: Better to inflict some pain now, in the form of higher joblessness and sluggish wage growth, than to allow more pain later.After keeping benchmark interest rates at near-zero levels during the recession, the Fed has been gradually nudging them up. So far this year, it has raised rates twice.Discomfort with a tight labor market and growing worker bargaining power is to some degree baked into the Fed\u2019s makeup. Pressure to raise wages during expansions will inevitably be seen as precursors to insidious inflationary pressure.The conventional wisdom that higher wages inevitably lead to higher prices, however, is flimsy, some economists argue.Regardless, there is plenty of evidence that workers have yet to receive their fair share of this most recent expansion \u2014 or even the previous one.If workers\u2019 share had not shrunk, they would have had an additional $532 billion, or about $3,400 each, said Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And at this point in the recovery, shifting some of those corporate profits to workers would have no effect on inflation, he noted.In the tug of war between workers and investors, Americans living on a paycheck have seldom been left with a shorter end of the rope.Fredy Amador has spent years working for various temporary help agencies, packing boxes of baby clothes, quality-checking packages of popcorn and doing other work at warehouses across the Chicago area. Despite what he says are frequent promises of permanent work, he has never been able to escape temp status.Recently, his situation got worse. He used to receive holidays and paid vacations, he said, but the agency that offered them lost its contract to another firm that did not. \u201cThey want to avoid all the benefits,\u201d said Mr. Amador.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.Mr. Amador, 34, said he earns $12 an hour, far less than the $20 an hour or more earned by permanent employees doing similar work. For extra money, he drives for the ride-hailing service Lyft on the weekends. \u201cEven if you have really good skills, you have to start as a temp,\u201d said Mr. Amador, who moved to the United States from Honduras 12 years ago. \u201cThey never give you an opportunity to move on.\u201dThe recent tax overhaul has further pumped up corporate earnings. Promises that lower tax bills for businesses would translate into higher wages have yet to materialize. Higher gas and medical care costs have eaten away at whatever gains most workers have made.Nor are those extra profits going into business expansion. Since the first of the year, American companies including Apple, Wells Fargo and McDonald\u2019s have announced nearly $680 billion in buybacks of their own stock, according to the research firm TrimTabs. In essence, they are directing a majority of the windfall to investors and chief executives, who tend to have large stock-based compensation packages.Profits are also financing foreign mergers and acquisitions. \u201cA lot of U.S. businesses are looking abroad to see what they can buy,\u201d said Jason Gerlis, managing director of TMF Group U.S.A., a global consulting firm, \u201cbecause it\u2019s easier to finance or capitalize offshore.\u201dWhen the economy was struggling, employers became accustomed to inboxes flooded with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and snaking lines of eager applicants. Many may have forgotten, or never learned how, to compete for workers.When it comes to complaints of a labor shortage, as Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, has said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not raising wages, then it just sounds like whining.\u201dBen Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}

He and Trump walked into the trap thinking they could get away with lying.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani disputed that the tape had damaged the president, suggesting that Mr. Davis was out of his depth and that Mr. Cohen had sacrificed credibility by recording Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s basically destroying his client as a witness because he really isn\u2019t a criminal lawyer. He\u2019s playing it like a shill as opposed to a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Davis. \u201cHis whole theory \u2014 \u2018you bring it all out\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s great, but now the guy\u2019s ruined as a witness. What prosecutor is going to use him?\u201dMr. Giuliani said an analysis of the audio showed Mr. Trump had said \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d before \u201cpay with cash.\u201d \u201cI had to play it three times,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of tapes. Hours of them \u2014 Mafia people. Experts slow it down a little bit, it becomes clearer.\u201dSome Republicans, including defenders of Mr. Cohen, have questioned Mr. Davis\u2019s intentions, sensing in his re-emergence a desire to exact vengeance on Mr. Trump for the Clintons. Though Mr. Davis served for only about a year in the White House, leaving just as the Monica Lewinsky scandal was breaking, he has long established himself as a reliable Clinton-friendly talking head, nearly five decades after meeting Mrs. Clinton at Yale Law School.\u201cPeople just write him off as, \u2018Oh, God, a Clinton hack,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t say crazy stuff.\u201dHe cast doubt on the value of the recording\u2019s release, asking if Mr. Davis cared more about simply embarrassing Mr. Trump. \u201cIs he using Michael for his own purposes?\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who loves publicity stunts. I give that one a \u2018C.\u2019\u201dMr. Davis said his only loyalty was to his client, insisting this was \u201cnot a crusade against Trump.\u201d\u201cExpectations are way too high,\u201d he said. \u201cOne man isn\u2019t going to bring down Donald Trump.\u201dAnd yet, he hastened to add, something unusual had been happening this week: strangers recognizing him \u2014 Lanny Davis from television \u2014 asking him to keep on it.Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.

The court has no powers of enforcement and the United Arab Emirates, in response to the verdict, insisted it was already in compliance with it.\u201cThis sends an early, strong signal that there will be no tolerance shown to countries that take arbitrary measures against Qataris,\u201d Lulwa al-Khater, a spokeswoman for Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry, said in comments published by Qatar\u2019s state media.The ruling may have its biggest impact in the battle for influence in Western capitals and international bodies, where Qatar and its foes have spent tens of millions of dollars in the past year on conferences, lawyers, news media advertisements and Washington lobbyists.The court order \u201cmarks another blow to the blockade, which has failed from the beginning to gain support from the international community,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the Middle East at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Qatar\u2019s foes initially enjoyed loud support from President Trump, who appeared to side with their accusations that Qatar was financing Islamist terrorist groups and was secretly in league with Iran. Qatar denied the charges, saying it was being targeted for its outspoken TV network, Al Jazeera.In the complaint filed to the International Court of Justice last month, Qatar argued that the United Arab Emirates breached an international convention on racism when it expelled thousands of Qatari citizens in the opening weeks of the embargo in June 2017.The orders do not constitute a final ruling, and it could be years before the full case is heard and decided.The United Arab Emirates minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, attempted to put a positive spin on the decision, saying in a Twitter post that the judges had refused six other Qatari demands.Mr. Gargash said his government had already met the \u201cconditions required\u201d by the court ruling.Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vulnerable Species in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Roman is a conservation biologist and author of a book on endangered species. Mr. Li is director of biodiversity at the Environmental Policy Innovation Center.The administration\u2019s proposal joins legislative efforts to retool the law. In examining them, we should ask two questions: Will these changes increase populations of endangered species, or at least slow their decline? And will they advance cooperation and reduce conflicts between the federal government and states, industries and landowners? Almost none of these recent proposals pass this test.But under the Barrasso plan, the agency would be required to give more weight to state-produced data \u2014 regardless of whether it is the best science. The federal government would also have to consult with every governor, state agency and county across the butterfly\u2019s 49-state range in developing a recovery plan. It would be the death of the monarch\u2019s recovery by a thousand bureaucratic cuts. This is not to say that the law should not be updated, or that its critics don\u2019t have legitimate complaints. Congress last revised it 30 years ago, and there are many ways to improve the law to reduce the compliance costs to industries like mining and logging, as well as developers and landowners. But specific answers to these concerns are largely unaddressed in this push to weaken the law.So what should be done?Some positive things are already happening. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service developed a plan to manage its program that lists species for protection, the most litigated part of the law. It specifies dates for the agency to make listing decisions for more than 350 species through 2023. Support for this is broad, ranging from environmental groups to ranchers to energy developers because it adds certainty to the process. The Barrasso bill would codify it, creating a listing program that is less controversial and more science-based. This is common sense.In addition, Congress should give states and landowners financial and legal incentives to help species recover. It should also direct federal agencies to develop clear standards for listing species, with objective and legally defensible criteria, such as population size and rate of decline. Incentives could be created to attract private capital to finance large-scale restoration projects and engage pharmaceutical companies to develop cures for diseases that threaten species, like white-nose syndrome in bats. We should celebrate these successes, as well as the economic benefits that can result from saving species. When the law was passed in 1973, few whales were left along the East Coast after centuries of whaling. Humpbacks have since returned to the waters off New York City, and whale-watching cruises leave Rockaway almost every summer day. In Massachusetts, the whale-watching industry contributes about $111 million to local economies each year, more than the commercial catch of finfish in the state. Saving rare species was never going to be easy, but it doesn\u2019t need to be as hard as Congress and others have made it. Protecting vulnerable plants and animals should always be the priority. But we also need to develop incentives to encourage the law\u2019s critics to become supporters. If that were to happen, innovation would follow, benefiting both the public and the species the law is intended to protect.Advertisement"}

Is That Why We Vote for It?", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsAt one of the last rallies of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, I found myself speaking with a pair of middle-aged women who emigrated years ago from the Philippines. We got to talking about Rodrigo Duterte, the belligerent strongman who was elected president there six months earlier, and I asked them if they thought Duterte and Trump would get along. \u201cOh, my gosh!\u201d the first woman said. \u201cProbably \u2014 they are the same!\u201d\u201cI came from the Philippines, right?\u201d the second woman said. \u201cWhen corruption sets in, it doesn\u2019t stop at the top. It goes down. Every appointee will be somebody that is corrupt or can be corrupted, can be silenced. Look at now. If you have a corrupt judicial system \u2014 I think the only thing that\u2019s standing now in America that isn\u2019t so very corrupted is the military.\u201d\u201cAnd you think Trump can stop that?\u201d I asked.\u201cI will take him,\u201d she replied. \u201cBecause I know what Hillary did already.\u201dYou could argue that Americans have been well served by this anxiety. By international standards, we live in a cleanly run country, and always have. For all but two of the 23 years that Transparency International has published its index, the United States has appeared in the Top 20 least-evidently-corrupt countries. It\u2019s true that we have had our share of spectacular episodes: the Whiskey Ring and Boss Tweed in the 19th century; Teapot Dome and Abscam in the 20th. In 2006, the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff was convicted of felony corruption, bringing 20 people, including a congressman, down with him. In 2011, Rod Blagojevich, the Democratic former governor of Illinois, went to prison for trying to auction off Barack Obama\u2019s old Senate seat. But the fact that these incidents remain so memorable is the point; they were seen as unacceptable aberrations, with consequences in the courts of law and public opinion. People went to prison, lost elections and, in Abramoff\u2019s case, were played by Kevin Spacey in a biopic.Is it even worth distinguishing between this unseemly-but-legal stuff and true corruption if the outcome is, arguably, not much different? It\u2019s an interesting question, but one you would only think to ask in a country, like the United States, where illegal corruption is relatively rare. The true cost of illegal corruption, in countries where it is rampant, is rarely the direct one; it is the way even the most banal and minor forms of it erode the rule of law, introducing uncertainty into every dealing with the state and reducing it to the self-interest of its human agents: not just politicians but also customs inspectors, permit issuers, police officers, anyone vested with enough power to extract a dollar.Eventually the idea of reforming institutions starts to seem bewilderingly difficult \u2014 harder than just tearing them down. This is why anti-corruption crusades are expedient platforms for demagogues and authoritarians who, like Duterte, have no serious interest in corruption \u2014 the Philippines had generally improved under his predecessor and has slid back down the rankings during his presidency \u2014 but are eager to tear down institutions for very different reasons.Advertisement"}

Mr. Vald\u00e9s is a community organizer.The Trump administration\u2019s decision to separate migrant children and their parents at the border and its anemic efforts to reunite families since the reversal of that policy have been widely condemned as cruel. But the president\u2019s so-called solution \u2014 to imprison immigrants as families in detention centers \u2014 is equally abhorrent.In recent decades, private prison operators have opened facilities that detain immigrants and their children. This means that many times, when a mother escapes life-threatening dangers in her home country and arrives in the United States only to be imprisoned in one of these facilities, they profit. When a family seeking refuge in this country is put behind bars, they profit. When a new center needs to be opened because law enforcement officers are arresting more immigrants, they profit.This industry has turned human suffering into a billion-dollar business.They also explain why New York City was proud to be the first city in the country to divest from private prison companies in its pension fund investments.Pension funds have a fiduciary duty to make sound investments that grow their portfolios and help fund retirement benefits for their members. That means constantly evaluating the long-term viability and risk of investments across the pension funds\u2019 portfolios, which is what the New York City Comptroller\u2019s Office does every day.Private prisons fail that basic risk assessment. That\u2019s because the industry\u2019s bottom line depends on locking people up. And when you imprison people for money, it means you have to choose between padding the bottom line and spending the money needed to create safe and healthy conditions. Too often, the bottom line wins out. These companies have a financial interest in perpetuating the inhumane \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies whose consequences we now see on the front page of the news each day. Consequently, as an investment, they\u2019re at the whims of a seesawing political climate. This combined with the moral issues surrounding private prisons has convinced us that they are imprudent for investors to own and for banks to finance.Leaders across the country should recognize that in addition to their human costs, private prison companies are part of an industry that poses major financial risks to cities and states.

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Secretly Taped Trump Discussing Payment to Playboy Model", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, secretly recorded a conversation with Mr. Trump two months before the presidential election in which they discussed payments to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump, according to lawyers and others familiar with the recording.The F.B.I. seized the recording this year during a raid on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office. The Justice Department is investigating Mr. Cohen\u2019s involvement in paying women to tamp down embarrassing news stories about Mr. Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Prosecutors want to know whether that violated federal campaign finance laws, and any conversation with Mr. Trump about those payments would be of keen interest to them.The recording\u2019s existence appears to undercut the Trump campaign\u2019s denial of any knowledge of payments to the model. It further draws Mr. Trump into questions about tactics he and his associates used to keep aspects of his personal and business life a secret. And it highlights the potential legal and political danger that Mr. Cohen represents to Mr. Trump. Once the keeper of many of Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets, Mr. Cohen is now seen as increasingly willing to consider cooperating with prosecutors.The former model, Karen McDougal, says she began a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump in 2006, shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, gave birth to their son, Barron. Ms. McDougal sold her story for $150,000 to The National Enquirer, which was supportive of Mr. Trump, during the final months of the presidential campaign, but the tabloid sat on the story, which kept it from becoming public. The practice, known as \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d effectively silenced Ms. McDougal for the remainder of the campaign.Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, confirmed in a telephone conversation on Friday that Mr. Trump had discussed payments to Ms. McDougal with Mr. Cohen in person on the recording. He said that it was less than two minutes long and that Mr. Trump did not know he was being recorded, and he claimed that the president had done nothing wrong.Mr. Giuliani said there was no indication on the tape that Mr. Trump knew before the conversation about the payment from the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., to Ms. McDougal.\u201cNothing in that conversation suggests that he had any knowledge of it in advance,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. The recording cuts off, according to three people familiar with it, and it is not clear how the discussion ended.Mr. Giuliani initially indicated the men discussed a payment from Mr. Trump to Ms. McDougal \u2014 separate from the Enquirer\u2019s payment \u2014 to buy her story. Later, he said Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen had actually discussed buying the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story from the Enquirer. Such a move would have effectively reimbursed the newspaper for its payments to her, though Mr. Giuliani disputed that characterization.That payment was never made, Mr. Giuliani said, adding that Mr. Trump had told Mr. Cohen that if he were to make a payment related to Ms. McDougal, to write a check rather than send cash, so it could be properly documented.A person close to Mr. Cohen disputed Mr. Giuliani\u2019s description of the discussion over how to pay A.M.I. for the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story and suggested the tape would back up Mr. Cohen.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers discovered the recording as part of their review of the seized materials and shared it with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, according to the three people briefed on the matter.\u201cObviously, there is an ongoing investigation, and we are sensitive to that,\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, said in a statement. \u201cBut suffice it to say that when the recording is heard, it will not hurt Mr. Cohen. Any attempt at spin cannot change what is on the tape.\u201dMr. Cohen rejected repeated requests for comment. Mr. Trump ignored shouted questions about it from reporters as he left the White House on Friday afternoon and departed for a weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.David J. Pecker, the chairman of A.M.I., is a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and Ms. McDougal has accused Mr. Cohen of secretly taking part in the deal \u2014 an allegation that is now part of the F.B.I. investigation.\u201cIt can\u2019t be more than a minute and a half,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the length of the conversation. \u201cTwice someone walks in \u2014 someone brings soda in for them. It\u2019s not some secret conversation.\u201dHe added: \u201cNeither one seems to be concerned anyone would hear it. It went off on irrelevant subjects that have nothing to do with this. It\u2019s a very professional conversation between a client and a lawyer and the client saying, \u2018Do it right.\u2019\u201dBecause the tape showed Mr. Trump learning about the A.M.I. payment, it actually helps Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani argued. \u201cIn the big scheme of things, it\u2019s powerful exculpatory evidence,\u201d he said. The person close to Mr. Cohen disputed that claim but would not elaborate.The recording is potential evidence in the campaign finance investigation, but became tied up in a legal fight over what materials are protected by attorney-client privilege and thus off limits to prosecutors. It is not clear whether a federal judge has ruled on whether prosecutors can listen to the recording.For a decade, Mr. Cohen served as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most trusted fixers, aggressively taking on journalists, opposing lawyers and business adversaries. He frequently taped his conversations, unbeknown to the people with whom he was speaking. New York law allows one party to a conversation to tape conversations without the other knowing.Mr. Cohen used to say he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump, but the relationship soured in the aftermath of the F.B.I. raids in April. In one conversation, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers inquired whether Mr. Trump planned to pardon him, but Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers gave no indication that the president would do so, according to two people familiar with the discussion.\u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cI put family and country first.\u201d The words got Mr. Trump\u2019s attention, and he asked people if they thought Mr. Cohen was trying to send a message, either to him or the Justice Department.The Cohen investigation began with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s links to Russia. But as the Cohen case became increasingly focused on Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal business dealings and his campaign activities unrelated to Russia, Mr. Mueller referred it to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who are now leading the investigation.The wide-ranging search warrants served on Mr. Cohen this spring show that prosecutors are investigating Mr. Cohen\u2019s involvement in payments to silence women about their relationships with Mr. Trump. In addition to Ms. McDougal\u2019s arrangement, prosecutors also sought evidence of payments to the adult film star Stephanie Clifford, who is better known as Stormy Daniels.Mr. Cohen\u2019s case is unusual because the payment to Ms. McDougal was made by American Media Inc. In August 2016, A.M.I. bought the rights to her story about Mr. Trump for $150,000 and a commitment to use its magazines to promote her career as a fitness specialist.Among the matters prosecutors are investigating is whether A.M.I. considered selling or reassigning Ms. McDougal\u2019s contract to a third party, a person with knowledge of the matter said.Federal agents are also scrutinizing Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal financial dealings and whether he committed fraud by lying about his assets on bank forms. In particular, the authorities are scrutinizing taxi medallions that Mr. Cohen owned, and whether he accurately accounted for their value, according to several people close to the case.Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Developers Fight Efforts to Make Them Pay for Public Art", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetReal estate developers often agree to finance neighborhood improvements, like a sidewalk or a park or a bus stop, to help secure approval for their projects, but many are drawing the line in a new fight: paying for public art.A growing effort to make developers include public art in their private projects or contribute to a public art fund is meeting angry resistance. Municipal leaders facing tight budgets are looking for alternative funding, but builders say the new ordinances are an \u201cart tax\u201d that increase the cost of a project.\u201cAmong other cost drivers are the additional expense of hiring art consultants and attorneys to present proposed works to an art board,\u201d said Truly Burton, executive vice president of the Builders Association of South Florida. \u201cAll this factors into how much someone pays in rent or a mortgage payment every month.\u201d\u201cThere is a general understanding that art in a community elevates that community, making it safer, healthier and more fun to live in,\u201d said Sarah Conley Odenkirk, a Los Angeles lawyer specializing in transactional matters related to the arts in the private and public realms.The Builders Association of South Florida and the Miami Downtown Development Authority are both battling a proposal before the Miami City Commission that would require developers whose construction projects cost more than $3 million to spend up to 1.25 percent on publicly accessible art.The specific percentage depends on the construction costs, although developers could spend a bit less by contributing up to 1 percent of the cost to a city-managed fund for public art. Without proof that this requirement has been met, building owners would not receive a certificate of occupancy.If the ordinance is adopted, it would generate approximately $14 million annually in public art around the city, said Efren Nu\u00f1ez, a Miami city planner and a principal author of the measure.But there is a debate over which neighborhoods should benefit from the regulation. The aim of the Miami Planning Department is to enhance neighborhoods through the installation of works of \u201cart all over the city, not just in the wealthier areas,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said.He said many developers of Class A commercial office buildings and luxury residential high-rises already incorporated works of art into their designs. However, the City Commission voted last year to exempt from the proposal developers of affordable housing projects.\u201cEveryone should have access to art, regardless of their social and economic status,\u201d Mr. Nu\u00f1ez said.But opponents complained that the ordinance would increase costs and that developers would not have a free hand in picking art they liked. Alyce M. Robertson, executive director of the Miami Downtown Development Authority, stated in a letter to the city manager that the legislation provided a \u201cdisincentive for investing in art, because any art commissioned by the property owner would be subject to review by an advisory committee.\u201dThe problem for local governments is that \u201cpublic dollars have gotten much tighter\u201d since the recession of 2008, Ms. Odenkirk said.\u201cThere is a need for public-private partnerships,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need more public art.\u201dThere is no database of the number of municipalities with percent-for-art requirements for private developers, although Ms. Odenkirk estimated the number at 80 to 100. She stressed the societal need for the ordinances, saying that art \u201cincreases tourism, decreases vandalism and increases property values and thereby the tax base.\u201dSome cities have found success. Scottsdale, Ariz., expanded its 1985 percent-for-art law to include art in private development because \u201cfunding for capital projects was declining,\u201d said Kim Curry-Evans, director of Scottsdale Public Art.Developers in the city were among the strongest supporters of the law, Ms. Curry-Evans said. \u201cIt is not seen as taking money away but as enhancing and beautifying these building projects,\u201d she said.Catclar Investments in Scottsdale installed a half-million dollars\u2019 worth of art, including large-scale photographic murals and a sculpture resembling a Lego brick, at its Soho Scottsdale condominium development. \u201cPutting art in new developments all over town is a brilliant idea, because it gives life to projects,\u201d said Irene Catsibris Clary, principal at Catclar.But in other areas across the nation, developers are fighting back.In Oakland, Calif., the Building Industry Association of the Bay Area sued to block an amendment that added developers of commercial and residential properties to the city\u2019s percent-for-art statute. The group argued that the law violated both the First Amendment, by requiring speech in the form of purchasing works of art, and the \u201ctakings clause\u201d of the Fifth Amendment, which limits a public entity\u2019s ability to take control of private property for public use.\u201cThe First Amendment\u2019s free-speech guarantees include the right not to give voice to someone else\u2019s message,\u201d the association said in a statement.Judge Vince Chhabria also ruled that \u201cthe ordinance does not require a developer to express any specific viewpoint, because developers can purchase and display art that they choose.\u201dDespite the increased resistance, some municipalities have found ways to negotiate with builders to sweeten the requirement.St. Louis Park, Minn., for instance, has no ordinance for public art, but city officials are \u201cable to require it when the developer is getting something in return from the city,\u201d said the city\u2019s community development director, Karen Barton. The negotiations may include public financing or flexibility in land-use requirements, she said.In Portland, Ore., the building code states that developers may obtain \u201czoning bonuses,\u201d such as additional square footage, by incorporating public art into their projects. Suwanee, Ga., \u201cwill not issue building permits\u201d until developers at least meet with the Public Arts Commission to hear a pitch about spending 1 percent of construction costs on public artwork.That requirement to meet with the commission seemed less \u201ccombative\u201d than ordering a 1 percent art expenditure, said Toni Shrewsbury, special projects coordinator in Suwanee\u2019s economic development office.\u201cDevelopers we talked to said that requirement wouldn\u2019t be met with opposition if the percent-for-art rule weren\u2019t mandatory,\u201d she said.What these percent-for-art ordinances do not address is what happens to the public artwork after it has been installed.Ms. Odenkirk noted that some building owners in Los Angeles had removed them \u2014 selling them, junking them or just putting them in storage or somewhere else \u2014 \u201cwhich has the effect of undermining the process.\u201d\u201cThere is no enforcement mechanism within these ordinances, and city officials don\u2019t want to irritate the developers who are putting resources into a community,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re people who love eating and love cooking.\u201d That self-effacement almost obscures the high levels of creativity and skill required to make everything at King appear so simple.As Ms. Shi put it, \u201cTo be able to do simple to high standards, it has to be intentional.\u201d\u201cWe had this idea of a restaurant as a magical space where the food doesn\u2019t get in the way,\u201d said Ms. de Boer, describing the three partners\u2019 vision for King. \u201cWhere the food doesn\u2019t detract your attention from the real reason you\u2019re there: to commune with people you enjoy.\u201dAs the chefs prepped for lunch back in the kitchen \u2014 browning rabbit legs and pur\u00e9eing warm beans with their cooking water and olive oil \u2014 Ms. Shi set up in the dining room. She tasted a few new bottles of ros\u00e9 that she was considering, and jotted notes on the table\u2019s paper.\u201cYour wine by the glass is a weird kind of calling card,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it should be symbolic of the list, and the heart of the wine program.\u201d\u201cThat wine is just everything we wanted to be,\u201d she said. \u201cA beautiful sunny day under olive trees, drinking a glass of Tempier and having grilled toasts with butter and anchovies.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s so simple, it really matters,\u201d said Ms. Shi, whose approach in the dining room mirrors the one in the kitchen. (The chefs pluck out the green germ from inside every single clove of garlic, to mellow its flavor. \u201cWe don\u2019t do much to the food, so that kind of thing is so important,\u201d Ms. de Boer said.)Tables at King are deliberately set without silverware. This is to encourage diners to use their hands to pick up salami slices and pieces of a crackerlike flatbread called carta di musica, which usually arrive first to the table.The kitchen buys boxes of that flatbread from Italy, and each piece is warmed right on the flames of the grill until its edges char. Like most dishes at King, the carta di musica is finished with big glugs of olive oil \u2014 never drizzles. Sometimes, the server carrying it to the table will place a cupped hand on one side of the plate to catch the green and gold drips before they hit the floor.\u201cWe want to see olive oil running down your chin!\u201d Ms. Shadbolt said.In the basement prep space, Angeles Chavarria, who has cooked at King since January, rolled out fresh pasta and cut it with a knife into wide, flat ribbons.The pasta would be tossed with melted butter at dinnertime, and twirled on top of wine-braised rabbit legs, still on the bone. This dish would appear on the menu as \u201crabbit au riesling with buttered noodles.\u201d On another day, the pasta might go with rabbit saddles braised in milk, described as \u201cpappardelle con coniglio al latte with lemon peel and sage.\u201dMs. Chavarria would not be prepping pasta tomorrow. In fact, she said she had no clue what she\u2019d be doing tomorrow. She likes it that way. \u201cAs a cook, you have this idea that it\u2019s by making something the same way over and over that you can get to perfection,\u201d said Ms. Chavarria, dusting the pasta with semolina, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true anymore.\u201dIn the kitchens she had worked in before, chefs kept the same dishes on the menu for months, years even. Uniformity and consistency were valued. At King, where the menu changes from lunch to dinner, presentations can transform and evolve rapidly throughout a single service. Every kitchen has its own fundamental way of doing things, from prepping garlic to blanching. At King, the cooks don\u2019t boil vegetables for just a moment or two and then transfer them, still crunchy, into a bowl of ice water to halt the cooking and preserve the color. Here, blanching is typically long and luxurious: Vegetables are pulled from the water and drained when they\u2019re cooked through and tender. While still warm, inclined to soak up flavors, they are left to marinate in aromatics, or braised again until creamy.\u201cMaybe the vegetable is like mush,\u201d said Ms. Chavarria, who was initially startled by the technique. \u201cBut you taste it and it\u2019s stupid sweet. It tastes like what it is.\u201d As Ms. Shadbolt put it, \u201cWe prize flavor over aesthetics.\u201d The kitchen avoids most of what might be considered luxury ingredients, though bottarga, the salt-cured mullet roe, is a year-round staple. It is grated onto fennel and celery salads and that warm, buttered carta di musica. And there is always Tenuta di Capezzana olive oil on hand, along with Maldon sea salt, which the kitchen uses for almost everything, including seasoning raw meat and fish. At the staff meeting before dinner, one server had a question about that. \u201cIs it structured? Is it layered?\u201d he asked. \u201cMore like, it\u2019s all bashed up and then dumped in a bowl and mixed up together,\u201d said Sade Zimmerman-Feeley, the sous-chef.She was describing an ideal way to meld the flavors of ripe strawberries, crumbly meringue and softly whipped cream, of smearing them into one another so that every spoonful would hold the best of each. \u201cIt looks like a blob,\u201d said Maya Rucker, another cook. A few servers nodded. They knew that on a summer night at King, it would be the first dessert to sell out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Seeks Release of Woman Accused of Being Covert Agent", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia\u2019s foreign minister told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday that charges against a woman accused of infiltrating American political organizations as a covert Russian agent were \u201cfabricated\u201d and she should be released.The State Department had no immediate comment on Saturday\u2019s exchange, though it\u2019s unlikely that the United States would suddenly release Ms. Butina. In a detailed indictment, the Justice Department has accused her of engaging in a series of deceptions over a number of years.The phone conversation on Saturday also touched on what the Russian Foreign Ministry described as efforts to improve conditions in Syria.The call came after a week in which Moscow seemed to move forward with what officials here said were \u201cagreements\u201d reached at Monday\u2019s summit meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump.With Mr. Trump slow to offer an account of his closed-door discussion with Mr. Putin, details have instead flowed from Moscow on issues involving the security of Israel and the wars in Syria and Ukraine. The trickle of statements, hints and leaks from Moscow gave the impression that Russian officials were taking the lead in following up on the summit meeting.Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, for example, said on Friday that it had sent to the United States a proposal to expand cooperation in Syria beyond military \u201cde-conflicting\u201d \u2014 ensuring Russian and American forces do not inadvertently target one another \u2014 to include the repatriation of refugees and the financing of reconstruction.\u201cProgress in this area was enabled by an agreement, reached by the presidents of Russia and the United States, during the meeting in Helsinki,\u201d Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev told journalists in a briefing at the Russian general staff headquarters.The Russian proposal calls for creating a Russian-American group to work on the return of Syrian refugees from Jordan and Lebanon. General Mizintsev said the \u201cAmerican side is now working on the Russian proposal\u201d though there was no immediate response to the idea from Washington.The flow of statements from Moscow at times appeared to catch United States officials unaware, and in some instances seemed at odds with American positions.The American general overseeing operations in Syria, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, said on Thursday that he had received no new directions from Washington. And the United States and its European allies have long insisted they will not pay for postwar reconstruction in areas controlled by the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Russian officials have also spoken openly of a diplomatic effort to manage the defeat of rebel groups in southern Syria that were once backed by the United States. Mr. Trump has offered only hints about that effort.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe discussed Israel and the security of Israel, and President Putin is very much involved now with us in a discussion with Bibi Netanyahu\u201d \u2014 Israel\u2019s leader \u2014 \u201cin working something out surrounding Syria.\u201dMr. Assad\u2019s army, with Russian backing, has pushed into a southern region of Syria along the border of the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Russians have suggested the diplomacy has focused on excluding troops and proxies of Iran, another ally of Mr. Assad, from newly seized land along that border.Russia\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Anatoly Viktorov, said Friday that Moscow and Israel had discussed the border region and had \u201creached an understanding on how it will look\u201d after the rebels\u2019 defeat. He said the agreement specified that \u201ccertain units will abandon the territory,\u201d an apparent reference to Iranian paramilitaries.In the run-up to the summit, Mr. Putin and his diplomats met the leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Qatar; senior diplomats from Oman and Jordan; and two close advisers to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.But it was unclear what assurances Mr. Putin could have offered Mr. Trump. Russian Middle East experts said Moscow\u2019s leverage in the messy Syrian civil war was limited despite its efforts to position itself as a broker.Russian officials also described a proposal by Mr. Putin to hold a referendum on the future of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, a coal mining and steel-smelting region that has been gripped by four years of war between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government.The Ukrainians say any such vote would be manipulated and meaningless as long as Russian troops and Russian-backed paramilitaries control the territory. An election in the war zone would also have to address a thorny issue of voting rights for refugees and internally displaced people.While American officials were silent about the proposal until Friday, there seemed to be little effort to keep it under wraps in Moscow.Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, told a conference in Moscow on Friday that Mr. Putin had offered Mr. Trump, \u201cspecific proposals for resolving this question,\u201d and a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said it was time to \u201cdiscuss other options\u201d in Ukraine, apparently a reference to a referendum.In a sign of how unnerving Russia\u2019s statements had become, Ukrainian politicians pleaded publicly with the administration to take a stand against the referendum.\u201cPresident Putin\u2019s proposals are always deceptive,\u201d Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a former prime minister, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is a negotiating trap.\u201dOnly on Friday did a spokesman for the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis, finally dismiss the idea. \u201cThe administration is not considering supporting a referendum in eastern Ukraine\u201d he said.Tymofiy Mylovanov, a professor at the Kyiv School of Economics, said the proposal and initial American silence on the matter was dangerous for Ukraine by allowing Russia to appear to \u201ccontrol the narrative,\u201d in Ukraine as elsewhere.Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fresh Proof That Strong Unions Help Reduce Income Inequality", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIncome inequality began its steep rise in the 1970s. Economists have been arguing about the origins of this trend since, with the primary explanations falling into two camps.But another explanation for increasing income inequality centers on the erosion of the minimum wage and the decline of unions. Economists in this camp emphasize changing norms, institutions, and politics \u2014 not just market forces \u2014 as important drivers of the widening gulf between rich and poor.The debate has real-world consequences.If market forces are primarily responsible for the growing inequality, then the best we can do, from an economic standpoint, is to try to buffer their negative effects on low-skilled workers through \u201cpost-market\u201d policies like taxes and social welfare programs. But if institutions matter more, then we can reduce inequality with market-oriented policies that, for example, bolster the minimum wage or ease the formation of unions.Until now, the study of unions\u2019 effect on inequality has essentially started with the \u201970s, because good data has been hard to come by for any time before then. But it was hard to tell a complete story about how the rise and fall of unions affected economic inequality because the data is confined to a time during which unions were already in decline.The four economists painstakingly cleaned and coded hundreds of these surveys spanning nearly 90 years. The data encompass the growth of unions during the 1930s and \u201940s, their heyday in the \u201950s and \u201960s, and their slow decline to the present.Union workers now earn about 20 percent more than nonunion workers in similar jobs. Remarkably, this union premium has held steady since the 1930s.Throughout this period, the biggest boost from union membership has gone to the least educated workers, who have, in turn, driven the rise and fall of union membership. The decades following World War II, when unskilled workers formed the union movement\u2019s backbone, marked the most rapid decreases in income inequality. Wages for nonwhite workers were particularly strong then.To capture such effects, the researchers broadened their lens to include the entire distribution of workers and their wages beyond those who are in typically unionized jobs and industries. They found that, going back to the 1930s, more unions meant more income equality. During years and in states where workers were more likely to be unionized, income inequality was lower.I will admit freely that I\u2019m predisposed toward unions. I\u2019ve seen their effects in my own life. My father was a high school dropout, but as a unionized mechanic at the United States Postal Service he earned a solid wage. His union paycheck (along with my mother\u2019s low paid, nonunion job), financed a house, a car, and Catholic school educations for three daughters.Before I trained as an economist, I spent six years as an organizer, forming unions among secretaries, library workers, and lab assistants at Harvard and the University of Minnesota. I saw firsthand the increased economic security that unionization brought these predominantly female workers, in the form of higher wages, more generous pensions, and paid maternity leave.Thanks to the new research, evidence going back nearly a century now shows that unions have formed a critical counterweight to the power of companies. They increase the earnings of the lowest skilled and sharply reduce inequality.But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will curtail the capacity of unions to organize and represent workers. The court ruled that unions can no longer collect \u201cagency fees\u201d from those government workers whom they represent but who have chosen not to join. These fees have helped pay for contract negotiations as well as prevent the free-rider problem that arises when only some pay for benefits enjoyed by everyone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have a Cryptocurrency Company? Bermuda, Malta or Gibraltar Wants You", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hedge funds go to the Cayman Islands to incorporate. Big companies are generally domiciled in Delaware. And online poker companies often set up their bases in Gibraltar and Malta.Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia.In small countries and territories including Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, officials have recently passed laws, or have legislation in the works, to make themselves more welcoming to cryptocurrency companies and projects. In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval.\u201cWe are 65,000 people, and 20 square miles, but we have a very advanced economy,\u201d the premier of Bermuda, E. David Burt, said in an interview at a cryptocurrency conference in May in New York, where he was trying to pitch companies on the island\u2019s charms. \u201cWe want to position Bermuda as the incubator for this industry.\u201dVolatility and uncertainty have deterred some countries and caused others to hesitate in embracing crypto companies. In China, the government banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings after many of its citizens were swept up in the frenzy and bet their savings on digital tokens. And the Japanese authorities halted the operations of several crypto exchanges this year after one of the biggest licensed exchanges was hacked.Bermuda has been a leading player. Apart from passing the law to allow for fast approval of initial coin offerings, the British territory has a law in the works to open the doors to cryptocurrency exchanges and related services. Mr. Burt said his government was modeling its approach on one it had taken with the insurance industry, in which Bermuda has become a major player.Bermuda\u2019s measures have attracted Will McDonough, the founder of a new cryptocurrency called iCash. He said he had decided to base his company there because of the island\u2019s experience in international finance and the government\u2019s willingness to listen to the company\u2019s input.\u201cThe largest issue blockchain companies have is not knowing how they\u2019ll be governed or regulated,\u201d said Mr. McDonough, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThose markets that have made the rules clear have found many companies coming to play by the rules.\u201dMr. McDonough is planning to raise $35 million by selling iCash tokens to investors around the world, including some in the United States. The iCash tokens are initially designed to be the method of payment for an online gambling site. He said he would still be based in Florida, but would have an office and a head of operations in Bermuda, which the island requires of all companies.That prompted Malta\u2019s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to post a congratulatory tweet and proclaim the island\u2019s intention to be the \u201cglobal trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses.\u201dMr. Zhao did not respond to requests for comment.Many of the countries passing the new laws have said they are not interested in becoming a home for illicit activity. Albert Isola, Gibraltar\u2019s finance minister, said his government was accustomed to making hard decisions after regulating online gambling companies for the last 25 years.\u201cFor every one license we\u2019ve issued, we\u2019ve probably said no to 10,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re considering a new sector, to bring in big names is extremely attractive, but they\u2019ve got to be good names. So you\u2019ve got to be willing to say no to even some of the bigger ones.\u201dOnline gambling is responsible for around 3,000 jobs on Gibraltar, or about 10 percent of the territory\u2019s population. Mr. Isola said he saw a similar possibility in the blockchain, calling it \u201cthe next significant new flow of business.\u201dGibraltar is in the final stages before voting on regulations that, similar to Malta\u2019s, would let companies issue and trade digital tokens. Already, 35 companies have applied to the government for licenses to operate blockchain businesses.Liechtenstein, the Alpine nation between Austria and Switzerland, is also among the newer entrants to the race, with the prime minister circulating a Blockchain Act this summer to allow companies to sell tokens.The activity has spread to other areas, too. Wyoming and Delaware have passed laws aimed at welcoming certain blockchain businesses, though they have been less focused on ones that trade in tokens. In 2014, New York created a so-called BitLicense, which initially drew businesses to the state, but it has since been viewed as a deterrent because of the government\u2019s wide-ranging requirements and slow approval process.In Switzerland, the canton of Zug has also sought out crypto business, labeling itself Crypto Valley. Zug\u2019s top economic official who has worked on the effort, Guido Bulgheroni, flew to the cryptocurrency conference in May that Mr. Burt also attended.At a cocktail party for Crypto Valley, Mr. Bulgheroni said his first job was to make sure that anyone with a crypto project was happy being in the Zug area.\u201cHow many other jurisdictions have that?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wives and Children of ISIS: Warehoused in Syria, Unwanted Back Home", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROJ CAMP, Syria \u2014 When her husband uprooted their family from Morocco to live under the Islamic State in Syria, Sarah Ibrahim had little choice but to go along. After he disappeared \u2014 she believes he was killed in an airstrike on a prison \u2014 she fled with her two sons.Their home countries do not want them back, fearing they could spread radical Islamist ideology. The Kurdish authorities that administer this stateless war zone do not want them either, and say it is not their job to indefinitely detain citizens of other countries.\u201cYou told us to leave ISIS and we left, but we are still considered ISIS,\u201d said Ms. Ibrahim, 31, her frustration dissolving into tears. \u201cSo who is responsible for us? Who will determine our fate?\u201dThe so-called caliphate of the Islamic State, which once stretched across large swaths of Syria and Iraq, drew tens of thousands of partisans from around the world who came to fight or to live in what was billed as a pure Islamic society. Among them were many women, some who were brought by their husbands or fathers. Others came alone and married, or were forced to marry, after they arrived.But as the caliphate collapsed under a military campaign by Kurdish militias backed by a United States-led military coalition, many of the men were killed or captured. The wives and children who survived ended up in camps like this, unwanted by anyone.\u201cWe are working responsibly, but the international community is trying to flee from its responsibilities,\u201d said Abdul-Karim Omar, an official in the local administration charged with persuading governments to take their citizens back, an effort he acknowledges has not been very successful.\u201cThis is a ball of fire that everyone is trying to get rid of and threw to us,\u201d he said.In Syria, they are effectively prisoners in dingy camps in an area under the control of no internationally recognized authority that might be able to press their home countries to take them back.On a rare visit to the largest of these camps, known as Roj, Kurdish officials allowed us to interview Arab women held there but refused to let us interview or photograph Western women for fear it would complicate negotiations with their governments about their return home.But during a walk through the camp, we spoke informally with women from France, Germany, Denmark, Holland and a number of Arab countries. Kurdish officials did not let us ask the Western women their names.Some said their husbands had forced them to go to Syria. Others said the trip had been a mistake that their children were unjustly paying the price for.\u201cOf course we made mistakes, but anyone can make a mistake,\u201d said the German woman, a dark blue head scarf around her pale face.She was 24, had come to Syria with her German husband and had three children, she said. Like many women in the camp, she acknowledged that she had come voluntarily, but said that life under the jihadists had been worse than she expected and that once there it was impossible to flee.\u201cThere was no way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cEither you go to prison or they would kill you.\u201dOne of the Frenchwomen, a 28-year-old mother of three, called her Syria adventure an enormous mistake.\u201cDon\u2019t we deserve, what do you call it, redemption?\u201d she asked.Foreign governments, including the United States, provide some aid to the local administration, but it is a pittance compared with what they spent on the military campaign. And the issue of detainees is particularly thorny, given the security risks of holding seasoned jihadists and the women and children who lived with them in a war zone.But the administration has received little help in dealing with the women and children who are now held in three camps.It has established ad hoc courts to try Syrians for crimes committed under the Islamic State, but it does not try foreigners. And the women and children in the camps have not been accused of crimes.The roughly 1,400 foreigners at Roj Camp are from about 40 countries, including Turkey, Tunisia, Russia and the United States, said Rasheed Omar, a camp supervisor. The women are generally well behaved, he said, although it is hard to determine what roles they may have performed under the jihadists and how much of the ideology they still endorse.\u201cThere are some of them who are still following the ideology, and there are some who came because they thought they were coming to heaven and found out it was hell,\u201d he said.Ms. Ibrahim, for instance, said she was horrified by the jihadists\u2019 public executions, their dictates about women\u2019s dress and their ban on listening to music, even in her own home.The biggest concern, however, is the children, many of them toddlers, who did not choose to join the jihadists. There are more than 900 children at Roj Camp, many with health problems, who have been out of school for years and lack any kind of official citizenship.Most of the Europeans want to go home, even if that means standing trial, but few of the Arabs do, fearing that they will be tortured or executed.Nadim Houry, director of the terrorism and counterterrorism program for Human Rights Watch, said the women and children were stuck in a \u201clegal void.\u201d While international law would require their countries to take them in if they made their way home, it does not oblige their governments to actively repatriate them.Meanwhile, they were not awaiting trial for crimes they may have committed, nor were they free to leave.Mr. Houry dismissed as excuses the reasons governments have given for not taking their people back, such as a lack of consular facilities or security concerns, saying that it was really a lack of political will. If the women were accused of crimes, they could be tried at home and imprisoned if needed, he said.\u201cSome of them may have committed crimes, but most of them were probably housewives, so you can\u2019t just lump them together with people who committed beheadings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is troubling is that lots of them are children, and young children at that.\u201dSo far, few countries have taken back their citizens.Russia repatriated about 35 women and children, and Indonesia took back a family of about 15 people, said Mr. Omar, the local official. He said he was talking to Canada and Denmark about their citizens, but no returns had been finalized. Many other countries just ignored his overtures.Dua Mohammed, 44, said she had come from Egypt to Syria with her husband, who had been attracted to the idea of the Islamic state. \u201cBut what we saw there in reality was not what we expected,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we lived there was not what we had come for.\u201dLast year, her family managed to flee and was detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led militia that is working with a United States-led coalition to fight the jihadists.She ended up in the camp with her four children, ages 6 to 15, and her husband was thrown in prison, she said. She hasn\u2019t heard from him since.\u201cWe made a mistake, but everyone in the world makes mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cHow long can we pay the price for a mistake? For our whole lives?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Soros Bet Big on Liberal Democracy. Now He Fears He Is Losing.", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "FeatureHis enemies paint him as all-powerful, but the billionaire philanthropist believes that his political legacy has never been in greater jeopardy.Supported byWearing a dark suit, tieless and with the collar of his blue shirt outside the lapel of his jacket, Soros took the stage with the determined stride of an 87-year-old who still plays tennis a few times a week. But there were some concessions to age. He gave his speech sitting down and used a desk lamp to illuminate the text. (In fairness, the hotel conference room hosting the event was morosely dark.) He turned the pages with his right hand while keeping his left hand on his left knee, as if propping himself up. There were moments when he seemed on the verge of losing his place, although he never did.In person, Soros is quite charming, with a wry sense of humor. But his writings \u2014 he has published 14 books \u2014 and speeches can be a little wooden, and this occasion was no exception. He barely acknowledged the audience, which included the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Albania, except to say, \u201cI think this is the right place to discuss how to save Europe.\u201d But apart from urging the European Union to direct more aid to Africa, which he said would ameliorate the refugee crisis that has led to so much of the recent political upheaval in Europe, his remarks were more descriptive than prescriptive. The European Union, he said, faced an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201dBriefly touching on Europe\u2019s economic outlook, he said, \u201cWe may be heading for another major financial crisis.\u201d Partly in response to his warning, the Dow fell nearly 400 points that day. Soros is generally considered the greatest speculator Wall Street has known, and though he stopped managing other people\u2019s money years ago, the reaction was a real-time display of his continued ability to move markets. The attention given to that comment also underscored, in a subtle way, an enduring frustration of his life: His financial thoughts still tend to carry more weight than his political reflections.Yet the political realm is where Soros has made his most audacious wager. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, he poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the former Soviet-bloc countries to promote civil society and liberal democracy. It was a one-man Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, a private initiative without historical precedent. It was also a gamble that a part of the world that had mostly known tyranny would embrace ideas like government accountability and ethnic tolerance. In London in the 1950s, Soros was a student of the expatriated Austrian philosopher Karl Popper, who championed the notion of an \u201copen society,\u201d in which individual liberty, pluralism and free inquiry prevailed. Popper\u2019s concept became Soros\u2019s cause.It is an embattled cause these days. Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has reverted to autocracy, and Poland and Hungary are moving in the same direction. With the rise of Donald Trump in the United States, where Soros is a major donor to Democratic candidates and progressive groups, and the growing strength of right-wing populist parties in Western Europe, Soros\u2019s vision of liberal democracy is under threat in its longtime strongholds. Nationalism and tribalism are resurgent, barriers are being raised and borders reinforced and Soros is confronting the possibility that the goal to which he has devoted most of his wealth and the last chapter of his life will end in failure. Not only that: He also finds himself in the unsettling position of being the designated villain of this anti-globalization backlash, his Judaism and career in finance rendering him a made-to-order phantasm for reactionaries worldwide. \u201cI\u2019m standing for principles whether I win or lose,\u201d Soros told me this spring. But, he went on, \u201cunfortunately, I\u2019m losing too much in too many places right now.\u201dParis was the first stop for Soros on a monthlong spring trip to Europe. He normally would have visited Budapest, but not this time. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a former Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was re-elected in April after running a campaign in which he effectively made Soros his opponent. Orban accused Soros, who is an American citizen, of plotting to overwhelm Hungary with Muslim immigrants in order to undermine its Christian heritage. He attacked Soros during campaign rallies, and his government plastered the country with anti-Soros billboards. In the aftermath of the election, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office because of concerns for the safety of its employees. The fate of the Soros-founded Central European University, based in Budapest, was also in doubt.Soros said he couldn\u2019t visit Hungary under present circumstances: \u201cIt would be toxic,\u201d he said. He told me that Orban\u2019s campaign was \u201ca big disappointment,\u201d but quickly added, \u201cI think I must be doing something right to look at who my enemies are.\u201d Last autumn, he signaled that same sense of defiance when he announced that he was in the process of transferring the bulk of his remaining wealth, $18 billion in total at the time, to the O.S.F. That will potentially make it the second-largest philanthropic organization in the United States, in assets, after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It is already a sprawling entity, with some 1,800 employees in 35 countries, a global advisory board, eight regional boards and 17 issue-oriented boards. Its annual budget of around $1 billion finances projects in education, public health, independent media, immigration and criminal-justice reform and other areas. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood are among its grantees.Soros originally planned to close the O.S.F. in 2010. He didn\u2019t want it to outlive him, because he feared it might then lose its dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit. But he changed his mind when he realized that, as he put it, \u201cI had more money than I can realistically or usefully spend in my lifetime.\u201d He also saw that, with liberal values and civil society fragile in so many places, the O.S.F.\u2019s work was becoming ever more essential. \u201cI found a mission, a niche, that I felt could be carried on,\u201d he said as we finished dinner.A few minutes later came an unexpected reminder of what he and the O.S.F. are up against. A Soros aide and I took the elevator back down together, and when we stepped into the Bristol\u2019s lobby, we found ourselves in the middle of a reception line that stretched the length of the room. It had formed there to greet one of Africa\u2019s longest-serving autocrats, Denis Sassou Nguesso, the president of the Republic of Congo. The next day, a few hours after Soros spoke to the European Council on Foreign Relations, Roseanne Barr went on a Twitter rant that served as a vivid demonstration of what he is up against personally. Soros was maneuvering to bring about \u201cthe overthrow of us constitutional republic,\u201d Barr tweeted. She also claimed that Soros, a Holocaust survivor, had actually been a Nazi. Among those who retweeted the Nazi gibe was Donald Trump Jr.In 1946, as Communists were rising to power in Hungary, Soros fled to England. He earned a degree from the London School of Economics, where Karl Popper was a professor. In 1945, Popper published a political treatise, \u201cThe Open Society and Its Enemies,\u201d a fierce assault on totalitarianism, in both its fascist and Marxist forms, and a ringing defense of liberal democracy. Soros left Popper\u2019s classroom with not only the idea that would later animate his philanthropy but also the desire to live a life of the mind. He had to make money first, though. When he moved to New York in 1956 to take a job on Wall Street, his goal, he told me, was to sock away $100,000 in five years, which would allow him to quit finance and turn to scholarly pursuits. But instead, he quipped during our dinner, \u201cI overperformed.\u201dIn 1969, Soros formed what would become the Quantum Fund. It was one of a new breed of investment vehicles known as hedge funds, which catered to institutional investors and wealthy individuals and which used leverage \u2014 borrowed money \u2014 to make huge bets on stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Quantum was wildly successful from its start, delivering 40 percent annual returns. Soros would later attribute his knack for playing the markets to what he called his \u201ctheory of reflexivity\u201d \u2014 basically, the idea that people\u2019s biases and perceptions can move prices in directions that don\u2019t accord with the underlying reality. Soros claimed his strength as an investor was in recognizing and acting on what he referred to as \u201cfar from equilibrium\u201d moments. (His oldest son, Robert, once claimed the \u201creflexivity\u201d explanation was bunk; he said the tip-off for his father that the market was nearing a major move was when his bad back flared up.)By the late 1970s, Soros had become a very wealthy man. Now he had the means to make himself an agent of history. He was frank about his ambition, though also self-deprecating. As he wrote in his 1991 book, \u201cUnderwriting Democracy\u201d: \u201cI was a confirmed egoist but I considered the pursuit of self-interest as too narrow a base for my rather inflated self. If truth be known, I carried some rather potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me into trouble. But when I had made my way in the world I wanted to indulge my fantasies to the extent that I could afford.\u201dHe decided that his goal would be opening closed societies. He created a philanthropic organization, then called the Open Society Fund, in 1979 and began sponsoring college scholarships for black South African students. But he soon turned his attention to Eastern Europe, where he started financing dissident groups. He funneled money to the Solidarity strikers in Poland in 1981 and to Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia. In one especially ingenious move, he sent hundreds of Xerox copiers to Hungary to make it easier for underground publications to disseminate their newsletters. In the late 1980s, he provided dozens of Eastern European students with scholarships to study in the West, with the aim of fostering a generation of liberal democratic leaders. One of those students was Viktor Orban, who studied civil society at Oxford. From his Manhattan trading desk, Soros became a strange sort of expat anticommunist revolutionary.In the meantime, Quantum grew into a multibillion-dollar colossus. Soros made his most famous trade in 1992, when he bet against the British pound. The currency was vulnerable because it had been pegged at what seemed an unsustainably high rate against the German mark; with Britain in recession, Soros reasoned, the British government would ultimately choose to see the pound devalued rather than maintain the high interest rates needed to defend it from speculative investors. Soros\u2019s terse command to his head trader, Stanley Druckenmiller, was to \u201cgo for the jugular.\u201d Druckenmiller did, and on Wednesday, Sept. 16 \u2014 Black Wednesday, as it came to be known \u2014 the Bank of England stopped trying to prop up the pound\u2019s value. It promptly sank against the mark, falling out of Europe\u2019s Exchange Rate Mechanism and dealing a setback to the push for greater European integration. The sterling crisis turned hedge funds into the glamorous rogues of finance and demonstrated the punitive power that they could wield against policymakers in a world of free-flowing capital. The trade made $1.5 billion for Quantum, and Soros, whom the British tabloids dubbed \u201cthe man who broke the Bank of England,\u201d became a household name.By then, the Soviet empire had collapsed, and Soros was devoting huge sums of his own money to try to smooth its transition from Communist rule. For example, he donated $100 million to support Russian scientists and keep them from selling their services to countries hostile to the West; he spent $250 million on a program to revise Russian textbooks and train teachers to promote critical thinking. While the era was one of Western triumphalism, when it was widely assumed that Russia and other newly freed countries would inevitably embrace liberal democracy \u2014 a view most famously expressed in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1989 essay, \u201cThe End of History\u201d \u2014 Soros did not share that certitude. This part of the world had little tradition of civil society and liberal democracy, and in his view these needed to be nurtured if the region was to avoid backsliding into autocracy. \u201cI generally have a bias to see the darkest potential,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt is something that I have practiced in the financial markets to very good effect, and I have transferred it to politics.\u201dDuring the 1990s, Soros toggled between his day job and his philanthropy, and it was not always easy to disentangle his dual roles. For a time, Quantum and O.S.F. were run out of the same offices. In December 1992, three months after his bet against the British pound, Soros announced a $50 million donation to build a water-treatment facility in war-ravaged Sarajevo, and it was hard not to see that money as having been sucked straight from the British treasury. Soros once described his bifurcated existence rather graphically, writing that he \u201cfelt like a giant digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other.\u201dIf that was the case, indigestion was inevitable, and it came in 1997, when Quantum was at the center of a speculative attack on the Thai baht. The episode was a nearly identical reprise of what happened to the British pound. (Quantum made roughly $750 million this time.) There was one critical difference, however: While Britain was a major industrialized country that ultimately had little trouble absorbing the blow to its currency, Thailand was an emerging economy for which the consequences were devastating. Economic output plunged, banks and businesses folded and huge numbers of people were thrown out of work. The baht crisis rippled into other Asian economies. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, called Soros and other speculators \u201cunscrupulous profiteers\u201d whose immoral work served no social value. Soros publicly rejected the criticism, but when investors took aim at the Indonesian rupiah in the fall of 1997, Quantum was not among them. Nor did it join other hedge funds when they targeted the Russian ruble the following year. Having already invested hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stabilize Russia, Soros would have been undercutting his own work by betting against the Russian currency. He ended up taking a $400 million loss.\u201cThat was where the crossroads between the philanthropist and the investor became difficult,\u201d says Rob Johnson, a longtime Soros associate who worked as a portfolio manager at Quantum in the 1990s. But by then, according to Johnson, the only reason that Soros was still running a hedge fund was to generate more money for his causes.During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soros also cultivated a number of young activists he believed could advance his dream of remaking Hungary as a place he would never again feel compelled to leave. Among them was Viktor Orban, a bright, charismatic student who was ardently pro-democracy, or so it seemed. In addition to providing Orban with a scholarship at Oxford, Soros donated money to Fidesz (the Alliance of Young Democrats), a student organization that Orban helped found and that evolved into his political party.But during the 1990s, Orban drifted to the right. Elected prime minister in 1998, he governed as a mainstream conservative, emphasizing patriotism and traditional values. Outwardly, he remained pro-Western. Under his leadership, Hungary entered NATO, and he also laid the groundwork for its admission to the European Union. But a shock defeat in the 2002 election seemed to radicalize Orban. When he reclaimed the prime minister\u2019s office in 2010, he began ruthlessly consolidating power. He packed the courts with Fidesz loyalists, and various independent media were bought out by Orban supporters. At the same time, he turned away from the West and drew close to Vladimir Putin. Orban was re-elected in 2014. The following year, the European refugee crisis hit. Tens of thousands of refugees passed through the Balkans and arrived on Hungary\u2019s border. Orban\u2019s government erected a 109-mile fence in order to keep them out, and it later refused to comply with a European Union quota plan that would have required it to take in asylum-seekers.Groups that received financial support from the O.S.F. were providing assistance to the refugees massed along Hungary\u2019s border, and this became a pretext for Orban\u2019s war on Soros. The Hungarian Parliament enacted legislation requiring NGOs to register with the government and disclose foreign sources of income above a certain threshold; it passed a bill that would have stripped Central European University of the right to award diplomas in Hungary. Orban\u2019s government introduced what it called the \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill making it a crime to assist illegal immigrants. (Parliament passed the bill last month.)In one campaign rally in Budapest, Orban referred to Soros as \u201cUncle George,\u201d telling tens of thousands of supporters that \u201cwe are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the world.\u201d Along with the fiery speeches, there were the billboards, which featured a picture of a smiling Soros and the message, \u201cLet\u2019s not let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d The laughing Jew had been a trope of Nazi propaganda, but Orban denied that the billboards were anti-Semitic.Orban\u2019s coalition won 49 percent of the vote, enough to give it a supermajority in Parliament. But the anti-Soros campaign didn\u2019t end with the election. Days after the vote, a magazine owned by a pro-Orban businesswoman published the names of more than 200 people in Hungary that it claimed were Soros \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The list included representatives of human rights groups, anticorruption watchdogs and Central European University faculty members and administrators. In mid-May, the O.S.F. announced that it was closing its Budapest office, which was responsible for almost half its international grants. Patrick Gaspard, the O.S.F.\u2019s president, says that the language and imagery Orban used to go after Soros was \u201cnothing short of violent\u201d and that the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s threat to turn the country\u2019s intelligence services on the O.S.F. made it impossible to remain in Budapest. \u201cI have the habit of taking autocrats at their word,\u201d Gaspard says. \u201cWe have to protect the security of our staff and of our data.\u201d The office is relocating to Berlin.In recent years, governments throughout Eastern Europe have attacked Soros. But why Orban, personally popular and facing hopelessly divided opponents, chose to make Soros-bashing the centerpiece of his campaign puzzled many observers. Orban \u201cis extremely successful,\u201d Michael Ignatieff, the president of Central European University and the former leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal Party, told me in London in April. \u201cHe\u2019s a much better politician than any of his opposition. He has intelligence and charm. He\u2019s funny and reads a room well. What\u2019s crazy is that he feels he needs to delegitimize Soros in order to win an election.\u201d Some observers offered a psychological explanation: Noting that Orban had had a turbulent relationship with his own father and a tendency to chafe under authority, they suggested that bludgeoning Soros was a form of patricide, a way of slaying his political godfather. But Thomas Carothers, a senior vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes that Soros was simply a useful cudgel for Orban. Civic groups were the last source of potential opposition, he says, and because some of them were backed by the O.S.F., going after Soros was a way to undermine their credibility. \u201cStrongman leaders want to de-universalize human rights and civic liberties,\u201d says Carothers, who has served on various O.S.F. advisory boards. \u201cIt is much harder for Orban to say that he rejects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is much easier to say, \u2018I push back against this intrusive man sitting in New York.\u2019 Soros is a very convenient bogeyman.\u201dBut Fukuyama went on to say that it takes events and skillful manipulators to rouse the forces of intolerance. In Hungary, the global financial crisis and the refugee crisis were the fuses, and Orban proved very adept at providing the spark. Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., made a similar observation. He said resentment of the European Union, which came to be seen as an \u201cemasculating force of Hungarian identity,\u201d as he put it, coupled with economic anxiety, left Hungarians receptive to Orban\u2019s appeal. \u201cHungarians are not irredeemably racist,\u201d Benardo said. \u201cEthnic entrepreneurs like Orban play upon the darkest fears of people to produce political support and an us-versus-them mentality.\u201dIn contrast to Benardo, my grandfather was not a social scientist. But like Soros, he was a Hungarian-born Jew who ended up in the United States, and he believed that anti-Semitism was a habit of mind that Hungarians would never kick. He admired Soros, but thought he was wasting his money in Hungary. When I told Soros about my grandfather, he smiled and shook his head knowingly. He said that his brother, a shipping magnate, had felt the same way. Soros did not.\u201cI don\u2019t blame the Hungarian people at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I admire them for their willingness to stand up to oppression and to fight for their freedom.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to distinguish between the people and the government.\u201dHe then told me a story from 1944, about a Nazi officer his father met in a cafe. During the course of the conversation, the officer quietly admitted to misgivings about the orders he was obliged to carry out. His father, a Jew in hiding and virulently opposed to the Nazis, tried to comfort the officer, telling him that it was a difficult situation. Throughout his life, the elder Soros shared this story to make the point that circumstances matter and that how people act isn\u2019t necessarily how they feel, a lesson that his son was now applying to Orban\u2019s Hungary. I asked him if he expected to visit Hungary again in his lifetime. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, but without much conviction.Two weeks later, President Trump called Orban to congratulate him on his re-election.Soros was an early backer of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. In Paris, Soros told me that Obama was \u201cactually my greatest disappointment.\u201d Prompted by an aide, he immediately qualified himself, saying that he hadn\u2019t been disappointed by Obama\u2019s presidency but felt let down on a professional level. While he had no desire for a formal role in the administration, he had hoped that Obama would seek his counsel, especially on financial and economic matters. Instead, he was frozen out.After Obama was elected, \u201che closed the door on me,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.\u201d He suggested that he had fallen victim to an Obama personality trait. \u201cHe was someone who was known from the time when he was competing for the editorship of The Harvard Law Review to take his supporters for granted and to woo his opponents,\u201d Soros said.During the 2016 election cycle, Soros contributed more than $25 million to Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates and causes. While he had foreseen the possibility of a Trump-like figure emerging (\u201cThe American public has proven remarkably susceptible to the manipulation of truth, which increasingly dominates the country\u2019s political discourse,\u201d he wrote in The Guardian in 2007), he was as surprised as everyone else that the Trump-like figure turned out to be Donald Trump. Soros told me that he had known Trump casually and had even socialized with him (about 30 years ago, a friend of Soros\u2019s dated one of Trump\u2019s senior people, and they all went out for dinner a few times). \u201cI had no idea he had any political ambition,\u201d Soros said. Trump had tried to coax him into becoming the lead tenant in one of his commercial buildings, he said. \u201cI told him I couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Soros recalled with a chuckle.He said that he had been \u201cvery afraid\u201d that Trump would \u201cblow up the world rather than suffer a setback to his narcissism\u201d but was pleased that the president\u2019s ego had instead led him to reach out to North Korea. \u201cI think the danger of nuclear war has been greatly reduced, and that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d In his annual state-of-the-world speech in Davos this year, Soros said Trump \u201cwould like to establish a mafia state, but he can\u2019t, because the Constitution, other institutions and a vibrant civil society won\u2019t allow it.\u201d He also characterized Trump as a \u201cpurely temporary phenomenon that will disappear in 2020, or even sooner,\u201d and predicted a Democratic landslide in the 2018 midterm elections. Five months on, he was sticking by those predictions. \u201cFor every Trump follower who follows Trump through thick and thin, there is more than one Trump enemy who will be more intent, more determined,\u201d Soros told me. He is doing his part to shorten the Trump era: In advance of the midterm elections, Soros has so far contributed at least $15 million to support Democratic candidates and causes.Asked if he would support Bernie Sanders if the Vermont senator won the Democratic nomination in 2020, Soros said it was too soon to say. He expressed displeasure with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, another possible candidate, over her role in ousting Al Franken from Congress: \u201cShe was using #MeToo to promote herself.\u201d He said his main goal as a political activist was to see a return to bipartisanship, a surprising claim in light of his lavish support for the Democrats. It was the extremism of the Republican Party that had prompted him to become a major Democratic donor, he said; he wanted the Republican Party to reform itself into a more moderate party. He said he was not especially partisan himself: \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to be a Democrat.\u201d He spoke of his respect for John McCain. He even said he would be inclined to give financial support to moderate Republicans like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, although he quickly walked back that comment: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say that. That would hurt them.\u201d And while the Republicans had made bipartisanship impossible, he didn\u2019t want to see the Democrats become more ideologically rigid and confrontational.If Soros views his relationship with the Democratic Party as mostly transactional, for some Democrats the feeling appears to be mutual. While his money is welcome and needed, there seems to be a certain ambivalence about Soros within Democratic circles. It is partly because of his outspokenness. As Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a longtime Democratic strategist, puts it, \u201cThe best donors are silent donors; not talking is good.\u201d A bigger issue is that the Democratic Party remains committed to campaign-finance reform and abhors the effect that the Citizens United decision has had on American politics. That 2010 Supreme Court ruling gave billionaires like Soros the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns. Kamarck says that in the post-Citizens United world, Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t unilaterally disarm\u201d and spurn donations from plutocrats like Soros, but they are conflicted about billionaire donors in a way that the Republicans are not.Although Soros is squarely on the left on many issues \u2014 he supports a single-payer health care system and is a longtime advocate of criminal-justice reform \u2014 some on the left have long been dubious of him. In the 1990s, he was portrayed by the far left as an agent of American imperialism, helping to foist the so-called neoliberal agenda (mass privatization, for example) on Eastern Europe. For some critics, Soros\u2019s Wall Street background has always been a mark against him. There is also discomfort with his philanthropy \u2014 not its goals, certainly, but what it is seen to represent. Soros is at the vanguard of what has come to be known as \u201cphilanthrocapitalism,\u201d essentially large-scale social investing by billionaires like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Soros. (Last year Forbes magazine ranked Soros the 20th-richest American.) To those who object, this represents the privatization of social policy and, through the substantial tax benefits that charitable donations receive, it deprives the public sector of money that could be used to promote social welfare.When I asked Soros to describe himself ideologically, he laughed. \u201cMy ideology is nonideological,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the club of nonclubs.\u201d When I suggested that \u201ccenter-left\u201d might characterize his views, he demurred; he said it wasn\u2019t clear where he stood now because the left had moved further left, a development that did not please him. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to the extreme left,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should stop trying to keep up with the extremists on the right.\u201dBut Soros\u2019s Jewish identity, coupled with his status as a Wall Street billionaire, gave those disinclined to support his agenda an easy means to foment suspicion and resentment, and from the moment that he became involved in Eastern Europe, he was confronted with anti-Semitism. The dog-whistling has not abated with time; some would argue that anti-Semitism directed at Soros has become, at least under Orban, a state-sponsored contagion. But it has also lately taken some bizarre twists. Last year, a son of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, posted an anti-Semitic cartoon of Soros on his Facebook page. (Netanyahu has frequently disparaged Soros because of his financial support for groups critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians.) And, of course, Soros is also routinely accused of having been a Nazi.Anti-Soros sentiment is a more recent phenomenon in the United States. Soros became a focal point of right-wing vitriol when he started contributing to the Democrats. In an appearance on Fox News in 2004, Dennis Hastert, who was at the time the speaker of the House, suggested that Soros was involved with drug cartels, telling Chris Wallace that \u201cI don\u2019t know where George Soros gets his money. I don\u2019t know where \u2014 if it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes from.\u201d The effort to demonize Soros has been unrelenting and quite successful. In suggesting that Soros was plotting a coup against the American government, Roseanne Barr was repeating a claim made by, among others, Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who had posted a meme on her Facebook page suggesting that Soros was conspiring to topple President Trump and \u201cour constitutional republic.\u201dSoros is regularly portrayed as the deus ex machina of American politics, a vast left-wing conspiracy unto himself. His wily hand \u2014 and wallet \u2014 have been blamed for the national-anthem protests in the N.F.L.; the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.; and the violence in Charlottesville. On Twitter, Soros haters trace virtually every national trauma, as well as every setback for conservatives, to him, or anything with the flimsiest connection to him. This stuff isn\u2019t confined to the digital fringes either. The claim about Charlottesville, for instance, was leveled by Paul Gosar, a Republican member of Congress. After news broke of a sex scandal involving the former governor of Missouri, Eric Greitens, that state\u2019s Republican Party issued a statement claiming that he had fallen victim to a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d orchestrated by Soros.At this point, it is fair to say that \u201cSoros\u201d has eclipsed even \u201cHillary\u201d as a trigger for a certain large subset of Republicans and conservatives. In April, conservative media outlets reported that Kimba Wood, the judge presiding over the case of President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had officiated at Soros\u2019s third wedding, in 2013. None of them attempted to explain why this was a problem; it was apparently self-evident. In 2014, Mark Malloch-Brown, a former United Nations deputy secretary general and a longtime Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9, became head of a company called Smartmatic, which specializes in electronic voting technology. Soros obsessives eventually seized on this as proof that he was now intent on manipulating election outcomes. In response, the company felt obliged to post a disclaimer on its website stating that Soros had no stake in Smartmatic and that its technology was not used during the 2016 United States presidential election. When I spoke with Malloch-Brown, he told me that this was the price of being associated in any way with Soros. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge I wear with honor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it attaches to everything I do.\u201dMuch of what is said about Soros on Facebook, Twitter and in right-wing media outlets is not overtly anti-Semitic, and it is possible that some of the people pushing these views are not even aware that he is Jewish. But the echoes are there. Glenn Beck used his show on Fox to peddle wild conspiracy theories about Soros. In 2010, he aired a multipart special called \u201cGeorge Soros: The Puppet Master,\u201d which was widely condemned for its anti-Semitic overtones, beginning with its title (the Jew as puppet master, pulling the strings of humanity, is another age-old anti-Semitic trope). In recent years, the so-called alt-right has become a key driver of Soros paranoia. Breitbart portrays him as an arch-\u201cglobalist\u201d who backs unrestricted immigration and a border-free world. (Neither claim is true.) Soros was one of the prominent Jews featured in the last ad of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, which many regarded as anti-Semitic. Steve Bannon, formerly the head of Breitbart, led Trump\u2019s campaign at the time. On a trip to Europe in March, Bannon lauded Viktor Orban as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cthe most significant guy on the scene today.\u201dAlthough the broadsides at Soros are often highly suggestive, the people behind them are usually careful to maintain a degree of deniability when it comes to the question of anti-Semitism. But not always. On his radio show last year, Alex Jones, who runs the conspiracy website Infowars, told listeners, \u201cthere is undoubtedly a Jewish mafia\u201d and that it was headed by Soros. Offering the same twist that would later appear in Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet, Jones said that \u201cone of the biggest enemies of Jews was the Jewish mafia\u201d and that Soros was \u201cout to get Jews.\u201dIn April, I met with Lamont. Now a member of the House of Lords and an ardent Brexit supporter, he insisted that he bore no ill will toward Soros because of Black Wednesday. But he regarded Brexit as a domestic political matter in which foreign money should play no part. That Soros had a home and office in London was irrelevant. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote here,\u201d Lamont said. In his view, Soros\u2019s effort to get a do-over vote was undermining British democracy. \u201cI think there would be incredible disillusionment with the political process if this vote was annulled,\u201d he said.During my dinner with Soros, I pointed out that some political observers drew a straight line from Black Wednesday to Brexit, in that the 1992 crisis strengthened the position of the Euroskeptics in Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, the faction that ultimately pushed for and prevailed on the vote to leave the European Union. I asked Soros what he would say to a Brexit supporter puzzled by his seemingly contradictory roles in Black Wednesday and Brexit. His reply suggested he thought the answer was obvious. \u201cThis is the difference between my engagement in the markets, where my only interest is to get it right and make money, and my political engagement, where I stand for what I really believe in,\u201d he said.It is a comment that gets to the heart of the Soros conundrum. Even if you concede that policymakers are ultimately to blame for the income inequality that has fueled so much of the current backlash against globalization, the financial sector has had a major role in worsening it, and hedge-fund titans like Soros are powerful symbols of that inequality. And while Soros has written very candidly and persuasively about the pitfalls of casino capitalism \u2014 most notably in a 1997 Atlantic essay, subsequently expanded into a book called \u201cThe Crisis of Global Capitalism,\u201d in which he acknowledged the destabilizing effect of financial markets \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make him any less of a symbol. When pressed, Soros has said that if he hadn\u2019t gone after the British pound or the Thai baht, someone else would have. That is unquestionably true (and in fact, Quantum was not the only hedge fund targeting those currencies). But that is not a particularly satisfying answer, and certainly not after the Great Recession, in which investment banks and hedge funds played such a destructive role. The industry that made him a billionaire contributed significantly to the circumstances that now imperil what Soros the philanthropist has tried to achieve.On the other hand, if Soros\u2019s riches had gone to someone else, would that person have put the money to the same use? It might have gone to a noble cause, but almost certainly not to something as ambitious and quixotic \u2014 or as dangerous \u2014 as the promotion of liberal values and democracy. (As Putin and Orban have shown, independent civil society is inevitably regarded as oppositional by governments that don\u2019t want their powers checked.) Most plutocrats measure progress in numbers, but the kind of work that Soros, through the O.S.F., has done generally defies quantification. And as Leonard Benardo, the vice president of the O.S.F., noted when we spoke a few months ago, that work can be unpopular in the countries where it is done.Soros\u2019s efforts on behalf of one group in particular, the Roma, seem especially germane right now. In June, the new Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League party, commissioned a census of the country\u2019s Roma. As an \u201canswer to the Roma question,\u201d as he menacingly phrased it, Salvini vowed to expel all non-Italian Roma and added, \u201cUnfortunately, we will have to keep the Italian Roma.\u201d Even in the age of Trump, his words were shocking, but he has refused to disavow them or back down. Improving the status of Europe\u2019s estimated 10 to 12 million Roma has been a major priority for Soros and the O.S.F. since the early 1990s. The organization has contributed more than $300 million to projects combating discrimination against the Roma and providing them with greater education, employment and civic opportunities. It is a struggle because anti-Roma sentiment remains a potent force, a reality underscored by Salvini\u2019s actions and statements. Given the political currents in Europe, this is another battle that Soros may well be losing. Salvini\u2019s popularity has soared.But it is also a clarifying battle. Setting aside all of the complications that come with being George Soros, would you rather live in the world that he has tried to create, or in the world that Salvini and Orban (and, for that matter, Trump) seem to be pushing us toward? In the aftermath of the Great Recession, it can certainly be argued that how Soros earned his money, and the fact that he accumulated such wealth, ought to carry more moral opprobrium in 2018 than maybe it did in 2008. But there is also a case to be made that in the present moment, with its echoes of the 1930s, how he amassed his fortune matters a lot less than what he has chosen to do with it.There have been mistakes; by his own admission, Soros erred in championing Mikheil Saakashvili, the mercurial former president of Georgia, and also became too directly involved in the country\u2019s politics in the early 2000s. He clearly misjudged Orban. But as Victoria Nuland, a former American diplomat who worked for both Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, put it when I spoke to her recently, \u201cGeorge is a freedom fighter.\u201dA household employee showed me to a table in the dining room and offered me some ginger tea: \u201ca specialty of the house.\u201d A few minutes later, Soros walked in. He was dressed in a white linen shirt, dark trousers and sandals. He hadn\u2019t been on the tennis court that morning; he was busy with phone calls instead.In the five weeks since I had seen Soros in Paris, the Trump administration had slapped new trade sanctions on China and imposed tariffs on goods from Canada and the European Union. I asked why the markets and the broader economy were holding up so well in the face of a possible global trade war, the breakdown of the trans-Atlantic alliance and the political turmoil in Washington. Soros said these developments would eventually drag down the market, but he couldn\u2019t say when. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my capacity to anticipate the markets,\u201d he said, adding with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m an amateur now.\u201d It was like hearing Roger Federer saying he had lost his touch around the net. Soros claimed that because the financial world was no longer his main focus, he was unable to time the markets the way that he used to. Politics now commanded his attention.Soros was in a reflective mood. He said democracy was in trouble because in many countries it had become sclerotic, insufficiently responsive to the public\u2019s needs. \u201cIt\u2019s losing out,\u201d he said. Illiberal democracy, of the sort that Orban had fashioned in Hungary, was proving to be \u201cmore effective,\u201d for the time being at least. The new-age autocrats had shown themselves to be particularly cunning in going after civil society as a means of consolidating their power. \u201cIt\u2019s a less abrasive way of exercising control than actually killing people who disagree with you,\u201d he said.It had become clear to him that his mentor and inspiration, Karl Popper, had been wrong in one critical respect. In a democratic society, politics wasn\u2019t ultimately a quest to arrive at the truth; it was about gaining and holding power and manipulating public sentiment in order to do that. \u201cHe was a philosopher of science, and science is a search for reality,\u201d Soros said. \u201cHe did not understand politics. In politics, you are spinning the truth, not discovering it.\u201d I asked what Popper, who died in 1994, had thought of his political philanthropy. \u201cHe was very supportive, which means he didn\u2019t take me seriously,\u201d Soros said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Popper would be so happy with my current position, because I\u2019m critical of him.\u201dSoros acknowledged that he had said things in the past that he now regretted \u2014 not necessarily the sentiments, but the way he had expressed them. Referring to the Nazi comments that he made during the Bush years, he said, \u201cThat was probably a mistake.\u201d He told me that he was now choosing his words more cautiously, eschewing comparisons to the Third Reich and the use of the word \u201cfascism\u201d to describe political conditions in the United States and Europe.In Paris, Alex Soros had told me that his father, while an excellent parent, had been emotionally distant. It was, he said, a defense mechanism born of his wartime experience: \u201cTo be emotional, to give off emotion, could be a sign of vulnerability.\u201d But he said his father had started to open up in recent years.As my conversation with Soros in Southampton drew to a close, I thought I picked up a little vulnerability. He was talking about his wealth and the opportunities it had given him. \u201cFor me, money represents freedom and not power,\u201d he said. For a long time, money had given him the freedom to do and say what he pleased, and also the freedom not to care what other people said and thought about him. But he conceded that he had started to care. \u201cI have become a bit more concerned about my image, because it is disturbing to have those lies out there,\u201d he said, citing Roseanne Barr\u2019s tweet as an example. He also admitted that being the anointed villain for so many people around the world was unpleasant. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to have that many enemies,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I had more friends.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Viktor Orban was elected to a second term as prime minister of Hungary. It was 2010, not 2009.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia warned on Thursday that certain political forces in the United States \u2014 a formulation that usually refers to a supposed anti-Russian cabal in the American national security establishment \u2014 were trying to undermine what he called a successful meeting this week with President Trump.\u201cWe see that there are forces in the United States that can easily sacrifice Russian-U.S. relations for the sake of their own ambitions,\u201d Mr. Putin said in a foreign policy speech to Russian ambassadors. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the events develop, especially considering that certain forces are trying to disavow the results of the meeting in Helsinki.\u201dRussia, while developing its foreign policy toward the United States, should consider the efforts of a \u201cquite powerful\u201d group in Washington that seeks to undermine good relations between the countries, Mr. Putin said on Thursday.The comments were some of the most extensive to date by Mr. Putin about the Russian view about whether a \u201cdeep state\u201d of national security elites dominates American politics and is conspiring to thwart Mr. Trump.Other Russian officials have for months spoken of plots in America against Mr. Trump, echoing the American leader\u2019s own criticisms of the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion with members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team as the work of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d\u201cWe see that there are forces in the United States that put their own group and narrow partisan interests above the national ones,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cOur renowned satirists once wrote very well about such people: \u2018Pathetic, paltry people.\u2019 But this is not so in this particular case: These people are not pathetic and not paltry. On the contrary, they are quite powerful and strong if they can, excuse my crudeness, force-feed millions of their people various stories that are hard to digest in normal logic.\u201dMr. Putin has also responded to criticism stemming from the news conference after the summit meeting, issuing a clarification of his own comments.He suggested on Monday that Moscow might allow American law enforcement agents to question 12 Russian men identified by the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, as military intelligence officers who hacked the Democratic National Committee and other targets during the 2016 election, if the United States allowed Russia to question American intelligence agents and others suspected of illegal activity in Russia.Mr. Trump called it \u201can incredible offer.\u201dBack in Washington, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday that the idea was under consideration, though a State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, called the idea \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d On Thursday, Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump disagreed with the proposal.No such donations were made, campaign finance records show. The figure, in fact, would amount to roughly half of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign budget in 2016. On Wednesday, the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office issued a clarification, saying Mr. Putin had meant to say $400,000.\u201cOur president asked us to correct the sum,\u201d said a spokesman, Aleksandr Kurennoy.In another Russian effort to clarify the record from Helsinki, the transcript of Mr. Putin\u2019s comments posted on the Kremlin website omitted the second portion of a two-part question that had been posed to Mr. Putin.A reporter had asked: \u201cDid you want President Trump to win the election? Did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s answer is also edited. The transcripts cites him saying only, \u201cBecause he spoke of normalizing Russian-American relations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ridgefield Park, N.J.: A 21st-Century Mayberry ", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving inWith its vintage housing stock and close-knit community, residents say making a life in this village of 13,000 is \u201clike living in the \u201950s.\u201d 11 PhotosAt this spring\u2019s Earth Day celebration in Ridgefield Park, N.J., a bluegrass guitarist strummed the theme from \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d \u2014 a fitting anthem for a Bergen County community easily compared to the fictional Mayberry. The trappings of small-town life are evident in working-class Ridgefield Park, one of four official villages in New Jersey. Front porches and fluttering flags abound on cozy, tree-canopied streets, many one-way. The elaborate Fourth of July parade, first staged in 1894, is the state\u2019s oldest. The supermarket, with four aisles and a painted tin ceiling punctuated by spinning fans, is more like the grocery where Aunt Bee shopped. Even Ridgefield Park\u2019s most famous native \u2014 strait-laced Ozzie Nelson, from another black-and-white TV classic, \u201cThe Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\u201d \u2014 underscores the suburb\u2019s old-fashioned, unhip, Starbucks-free image. \u201cIt\u2019s like living in the \u201950s here,\u201d said Karen Purpura, a 69-year-old flutist who moved to Ridgefield Park with her partner, Tom Olcott, from nearby Englewood last year after inheriting a house from a friend. \u201cPeople look out for each other; the neighbors even snow-blow our property. It\u2019s a family town. You feel grounded.\u201d The couple\u2019s rambling 1908 colonial, with its wraparound porch, is representative of the housing stock, 60 percent of which is at least a century old. Ms. Purpura said she and Mr. Olcott, a 66-year-old musicians\u2019 union official, put more than $100,000 into repairs and upgrades. \u201cWe retained the integrity of the house, restoring it back to the original wood floors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to live any other place. This is our home, where the grandkids come. We love the house and we love the neighborhood.\u201d Beyond ambience, home buyers have pragmatic reasons for choosing Ridgefield Park, which has 13,000 residents in less than two square miles. Located at the nexus of highways, the village offers a short commute to New York, just five miles from the George Washington Bridge and 11 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel. And home prices are markedly lower than in other Bergen County towns like Ridgewood, with which Ridgefield Park shares village status and an inventory of turn-of-the-century houses.Ayse and Firat Okcu paid $400,000 for a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath colonial in Ridgefield Park in 2016 after considering two towns farther north in Bergen County, Emerson and Oradell, for their strong school systems. But accessibility won over the couple, parents of a 1-year-old. Mr. Okcu, 41, has a 35-minute early-morning bus ride to Manhattan, where he works at a Times Square hotel, and Ms. Okcu, 37, has a reasonable drive to the Weehawken hotel where she works. \u201cPlus, the type of house we bought would have cost $50,000 to $100,000 more\u201d in the other towns, said Ms. Okcu, who described Ridgefield Park as friendly and secure. Janice Cima, a broker associate with Keller Williams Village Square Realty in Ridgewood, grew up in Ridgefield Park and said locals have long invoked Sheriff Andy Taylor\u2019s idyllic hometown when describing their own. \u201cRidgefield Park is similar to Mayberry in that it\u2019s picturesque and tight-knit,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople move here and stay through multiple generations. You can\u2019t say that about many towns.\u201d While many prize Ridgefield Park for its proximity to Manhattan, Ms. Cima said, the vintage homes \u2014 the oldest of which was raided by the British during the Revolution \u2014 are also a draw. \u201cBuyers appreciate the uniqueness of the houses \u2014 the crown moldings, the original woodwork,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come to Ridgefield Park for new construction.\u201dSituated just north of the Meadowlands, Ridgefield Park occupies a peninsula bordered by the Hackensack River to the west and Overpeck Creek to the east. Interstate 80 is the northern border, with Teaneck and Bogota on the other side; Route 46 slices through the village\u2019s southern flank. Mayor George Fosdick described his town as \u201cever-changing, yet eternally the same,\u201d and said commercial development east of the turnpike keeps things that way. Homeowners benefit, he added, because \u201cour future, in terms of economic development, lies in the area of Ridgefield Park where people don\u2019t live,\u201d ensuring that the village proper maintains its traditional appearance.Between June 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018, 70 single-family houses sold at a median price of $324,500, up from $310,000 during the previous 12-month period, according to the listing service. The median price of a co-op was $83,500, and that of a condominium or townhouse, $184,950.\u201cRidgefield Park has always had a countrified air about it,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cCompared to other places, we\u2019ve maintained our small-town character.\u201dStudents in kindergarten through sixth grade attend one of three neighborhood elementary schools: Grant, Lincoln or Roosevelt. Ridgefield Park Junior-Senior High School enrolls 1,240 in grades seven through 12. Average SAT scores for 2016-17 were 515 in reading and writing and 511 in math, compared with 551 and 552 statewide. Sixty-nine percent of the class of 2017 went on to college, versus 71 percent statewide. Mark Hayes, the interim superintendent, said the school district is \u201cturning a corner\u201d three years after a $2.5 million budget shortfall necessitated the appointment of a state fiscal monitor.There is no train station in Ridgefield Park; most commuters take the bus instead. From the principal thoroughfares of Main Street and Teaneck Road, New Jersey Transit buses reach the Port Authority terminal in Manhattan in less than 45 minutes; the fare is $4.50 one way or $148 monthly.

While the house is in need of updates, she said, it retains many of its original details, including marble and Slavonian oak floors, wood-burning fireplaces and ornate moldings and columns.The 9,687-square-foot townhouse, attached on both sides, has six bedrooms, three full baths and one half bath. Through the arched wooden doors on the ground level, a marble-floored foyer with high ceilings leads to an office area, study and powder room, with access beyond to a large marble patio and backyard.The first floor, which can be reached by elevator, contains much of the entertaining space. A large central gallery at the foot of a grand marble staircase leads on one side to a rear-facing formal dining room with a fireplace and on the other to an expansive living room with a fireplace and a library with built-in bookshelves. The living room overlooks the residential Montevideo Street. There is also a small kitchenette on this level.A roomy master suite with oak floors and molded arches is on the second floor, as are a terrace and two more bedrooms with en suite baths. On the top level is a family room, along with three small bedrooms, a laundry room, a large kitchen with a granite-topped island and an informal dining area, and a spacious terrace.At the rear of the patio is space for at least four cars, as well as a small structure containing two staff rooms and a full bath.\u201cThis house is special because of the location,\u201d Ms. Massa said, noting its proximity to hotels like the Palacio Duhau Park Hyatt and the Alvear Palace, as well as high-end shops and fashion showrooms.\u201cOngoing sales were renegotiated,\u201d Ms. Rivas said, \u201cor they fell apart.\u201dShe estimated that home prices in the second quarter were at least 10 percent lower, on average, than in the previous quarter.

Most foreign buyers are from the United States, Britain, Italy and Spain, Mr. Joffe said, adding that he has also seen interest from Australians.\u201cBuenos Aires is known as the Paris of South America,\u201d he said. \u201cInternational people would like to have an apartment there, just as they would like to have an apartment in Miami or New York.\u201dThe Recoleta neighborhood typically attracts older buyers, he said, particularly retirees or those who have business in the city. Younger buyers prefer trendier areas like Palermo Soho, he said.American dollars are typically used for pricing and transactions, rather than Argentine pesos.The buying process is fairly straightforward, Mr. Joffe said: After an offer is made and a price agreed upon, the buyer provides a down payment, usually around 30 percent of the sale price. A date is set for the closing, at which time the deed is transferred through a notary public. The notary is also responsible for overseeing the title search and ensuring that all taxes on the property have been paid at the time of closing.Many buyers opt to hire an experienced local real estate lawyer to help guide them through the process.Spanish; Argentine peso (1 peso = $ .036) Buyers are responsible for a number of expenses that typically total around 7 percent of the sale price, Mr. Garc\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez said.

{"Headline": "Military\u2019s Influence Casts a Shadow Over Pakistan\u2019s Election", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 The phone calls started last month, said Rana Iqbal Siraj: intimidating, anonymous demands that he defect from the party that governed Pakistan for the past five years and tried to curb the power of the military. Soon, he was summoned by state security officials who delivered the same message.Mr. Siraj, a candidate for the legislature in Punjab Province, stayed with his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which was built decades ago around former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Then in June, roughly a month before Election Day, security officials raided his business at the behest of the military, Mr. Siraj said in an interview.\u201cThey are trying to ruin me financially by raiding my warehouse and beating my staff,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering moving his family abroad for their safety. \u201cWhat am I at fault for? Just because I\u2019m running on the PML-N ticket?\u201dThe most likely beneficiary of the military\u2019s manipulation is the party led by the former cricket star Imran Khan, who has called the Taliban\u2019s war against the United States military in Afghanistan justified, and is seen as the military\u2019s favored candidate \u2014 a notion he denies. Mr. Khan has positioned himself as a fighter against corruption, taking aim at the dynastic politics and nepotism of parties like the PML-N while maintaining a good relationship with the military, which he credits with protecting the country.The military has ruled Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country, through various coups for nearly half the country\u2019s history since it gained independence in 1947. Even during civilian rule, the country\u2019s generals have wielded enormous power, setting the agenda for the country\u2019s foreign and security policies and tolerance of extremist groups \u2014 including the Afghan Taliban in its fight against the United States-backed government in Afghanistan next door.As prime minister, Mr. Sharif ran afoul of the military early on by trying to assert control over foreign and defense policy, which is seen as the army\u2019s domain. He also tried to improve ties with India, Pakistan\u2019s archrival, and opposed the military\u2019s embrace of terrorist groups, members of his party say.In Wednesday\u2019s election, voters will choose provincial legislatures and the country\u2019s Parliament, which will appoint the next prime minister. Officially, it will be only the second democratic transition between civilian governments in the Pakistan\u2019s history, after the last election in 2013.The main Pakistani Army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, denied at a news conference this month that Mr. Siraj was targeted because he belonged to the PML-N, saying that he had been the subject of a government investigation for a year and a half. General Ghafoor would not specify the nature of the investigation, and he denied that intelligence agencies had been involved in the raid on Mr. Siraj\u2019s warehouse.Other high-profile PML-N candidates have defected to Mr. Khan\u2019s party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or P.T.I.Mr. Khan said that while he has a productive relationship with the military, he is not receiving any help from it. Candidates are joining his centrist party because they are fed up with traditional parties that have failed to deliver, he said.\u201cWhen you have poor-quality leadership without the moral standing, you have a void and someone will always fill it,\u201d Mr. Khan said in an interview at his home in Islamabad, referring to the military\u2019s track record of coups and political interference.The P.T.I. is popular with voters under 35 who are hungry for change and make up 43 percent of the electorate.But the military\u2019s influence over Pakistan\u2019s courts and its muzzling of the news media have cast a shadow over Mr. Khan\u2019s party and its rallying cries for change and transparency.The Sharifs say those rulings were politicized, with the courts pressed by the military to bar them from politics.On Saturday, a judge of the Islamabad High Court accused the military\u2019s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, of meddling in the judiciary and forcing the justices to rule against Mr. Sharif and his relatives.The speech by Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui to lawyers in Rawalpindi was the latest public indictment of the military\u2019s interference in politics. The parts of the speech that were critical of the ISI were not aired by local television news networks but short video clips went viral on social media.The judge accused the ISI of influencing and pressuring the court that convicted and sentenced Mr. Sharif and his relatives. On July 17, the Islamabad High Court deferred the hearings of the appeals by Mr. Sharif against the court verdict until after elections.\u201cIn this election, what\u2019s at stake is the fate of Pakistan,\u201d said Hina Rabbani, a former foreign minister who is running with the Pakistan Peoples Party, a rival of the PML-N. \u201cI may hate Nawaz Sharif for his political choices, but I believe the system needs to self-correct, and we can no longer allow external forces to correct it. The only thing that can correct the system is elections.\u201dThe 2013 election was important because it was the first time power had been transferred from one civilian government to another, Ms. Rabbani said. \u201cBut for the next 10 years, we\u2019ll be holding our breath with every election.\u201dMr. Khan, who made Mr. Sharif\u2019s removal from office almost a personal mission, sees the situation differently.\u201cTo say the army castrated Nawaz Sharif \u2014 Nawaz Sharif was castrated by his own corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unlevel playing field you see is that they have minted this country,\u201d he said, referring to the endemic corruption among Pakistan\u2019s top political parties.Although Mr. Khan has a good chance of becoming prime minister, the military is likely to insist on curbing the next government\u2019s ability to shape defense and foreign policy, risking Pakistan\u2019s further international isolation.\u201cThe military finds itself in a tight corner,\u201d said Raza Rumi, the editor of The Daily Times, an influential newspaper based in Lahore. \u201cThey want a hung Parliament that doesn\u2019t focus on cutting the military\u2019s budget or curtailing its foreign policy. Instead, they want a government that focuses on cleaning the streets and planting trees.\u201dWhichever party forms the government will inherit a raft of problems: domestic terrorism; terrible relationships with neighboring India and Afghanistan; deteriorating ties with the United States, once a major ally; and a sputtering economy.The military believes it can weather the storm by turning to China, which is spending some $65 billion on infrastructure and other projects in Pakistan, as well as doling out billions in loans.\u201cThe question the whole nation is asking is what does the army want and why this level of interference?\u201d said Ahmed Rasheed, a foreign-policy analyst and author.Like others interviewed, Mr. Rasheed said he believed the military wanted a weak government, with the P.T.I. at the helm of an unwieldy alliance in Parliament.While the PML-N, which held a supermajority in the last Parliament, may win the most votes, it will struggle to form a government if the military pressures potential coalition partners. Analysts say Mr. Khan\u2019s party is likely to be able to form the next government by cobbling together a coalition with smaller parties and independents.But the military risks a severe backlash, Mr. Rasheed said, in part because social media has increased scrutiny of an institution once seen as sacrosanct.\u201cFor the first time, not just the elite, but the public is now aware of the army\u2019s major role,\u201d Mr. Rasheed said. \u201cIt\u2019s now talked about at the village level.\u201dWhen Gul Bukhari, a journalist and vocal critic of the military, was abducted in an army-controlled area of Lahore last month by unknown assailants, including men in military uniform, the news spread quickly online. Pakistanis took to social media, including Twitter, to demand that Ms. Bukhari be freed, and within hours she was returned home.Ms. Bukhari said the public outcry had played a large role in her quick release.\u201cIt was a demonstration of the immense power of social media in our times,\u201d she said in an interview.The traditional news media have also stood up to the military, as happened this spring when the newspaper Dawn and the TV channel Geo News complained that their distribution was being disrupted in parts of the country that the military administers.Many candidates are nervous about the military\u2019s unusual decision to deploy some 371,000 soldiers to monitor the election, including inside polling stations. But Khurram Dastgir Khan, a PML-N candidate who was defense minister in the last government, said social media had made the military and its allies more careful about overt interference.\u201cThings come out \u2014 they can\u2019t be kept hidden anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfeasible to use the draconian measures of two decades ago. Society has moved forward and technology has moved forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Trump\u2019s Tax Returns Public", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Johnston is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the author of two books about Donald Trump.Ms. Underwood believes there is abundant evidence to bring criminal charges against Mr. Trump as well. She made that position very clear in the letters she sent to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission in Washington recommending \u201cfurther investigation and legal action.\u201dMs. Underwood sent those letters, at the same time she filed the civil complaint, because New York state law does not grant her automatic authority to initiate criminal investigations. Her criminal referral to Washington noted that it would be a crime for the president to interfere in such an investigation. However, given Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he has the power to halt any criminal inquiry and to pardon himself for federal crimes, a criminal investigation by any part of the federal executive branch seems highly unlikely.The attorney general could, however, easily gain that authority. All that\u2019s needed is for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Police or the state Department of Taxation and Finance to make a request, and the authority would be granted to her. Criminal jurisdiction also rests with Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Vance has shown no interest, so far, in investigating other complaints against Mr. Trump.A state or county criminal investigation that begins with abuse of the Donald J. Trump Foundation need not be limited to violations of charity and election law. It can also examine his personal and business tax filings and, in the process, lawfully put his tax returns in the public record.The civil complaint and other documents released by the attorney general\u2019s office show that this case meets the standards for criminal prosecution: repeated misconduct over many years, large sums of money involved and efforts at concealment. A prosecution would also promote the goal of deterrence.Auditors eventually got into the hotel\u2019s New Jersey storage locker, but most of the ledgers were missing. Still, they concluded that through undisclosed financial reporting techniques that fell outside generally accepted accounting principles, Mr. Trump had shorted the city almost $2.9 million.New York State tax returns strictly adhere to the federal tax system\u2019s definition of income, so an audit of Mr. Trump\u2019s state tax returns would apply equally to his federal tax returns. If an investigation concludes that Mr. Trump cheated the state, Ms. Underwood and Mr. Vance have the authority to put Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 into the public record by filing civil or criminal tax fraud charges.That disclosure could be much more important than the result of any potential criminal investigation. On the surface, the numbers on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns will appear to comply with the law, as did the summary pages of his 2005 income tax return, which I disclosed last year. But a criminal audit would allow investigators to inspect the transactions justifying each entry on the tax returns. Those transactions would reveal whether Mr. Trump engaged in money laundering for Russians and others, whether he fully reported profits from his more than 500 business organizations and whether he took unwarranted deductions or excessive expenses to lower his income taxes.I believe that we, as citizens, own our government and that we should act like owners. The owners of New York State\u2019s government should remind the governor, the Manhattan district attorney, the State Police and state tax authorities that they have a duty to initiate a thorough criminal investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s state and city tax returns and, if appropriate, to prosecute.Mr. Trump asserts that he is no crook despite abundant indications to the contrary. Let\u2019s find out the truth.Advertisement"}

The subsidiary was financed with an investment of $30 million, according to the records.Yet late Tuesday, in a sign of possible complications, the corporate registration was taken down from the Chinese government website, and some references to the new subsidiary appeared to be censored on social media in the country.The moves indicated how complicated it remains for Facebook to navigate China, where it has been blocked for almost 10 years. If the subsidiary is allowed to proceed, it will be a toe in the water here for the Silicon Valley company. Facebook said it wanted to use the subsidiary to coordinate with Chinese developers in the closely censored market.Even to release an app in China, Facebook is likely to need a separate license from regulators. To go further and introduce one of its larger products, like its social network or messaging service, would require further negotiations over issues like data storage and security. Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing service, Instagram, and its messaging platform, WhatsApp, are also blocked in China.\u201cWe are interested in setting up an innovation hub in Zhejiang to support Chinese developers, innovators and start-ups,\u201d said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman, referring to the province in eastern China where Hangzhou is. \u201cWe have done this in several parts of the world \u2014 France, Brazil, India, Korea \u2014 and our efforts would be focused on training and workshops that help these developers and entrepreneurs to innovate and grow.\u201dThe ruling Chinese Communist Party deems all social networks that it does not ultimately control, like Facebook and Twitter, as potentially destabilizing. A series of sophisticated internet filters block residents from gaining access to such sites. Networks within China often self-censor, but are still held closely accountable by government regulators.If Facebook started introducing services in China, it would probably face questions about whether to censor content or share data with Beijing. The latter could be a particularly tricky issue for the social network while it is under scrutiny by the United States government for its handling of user data.Facebook\u2019s fortunes in China follow some progress here for Google, which has also seen its products slowly squeezed out of the market. Over the past year, the search giant has set up an artificial-intelligence research lab in China and introduced several services, including an A.I.-powered sketching game.The legal representative for Facebook\u2019s new China subsidiary was the same employee who registered the company that launched Colorful Balloons: Ivy Zhang, Facebook\u2019s chief representative and head of business development in China.Also on the board of the new subsidiary with Ms. Zhang is William Shuai, Facebook\u2019s China government affairs representative and a former government relations executive at the Chinese search engine Baidu and LinkedIn.

{"Headline": "How E.U. Is Getting Ready for Chaos in a Worst-Case Brexit", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dutch government is hiring nearly 1,000 customs officials. Britain\u2019s health agency is mulling how to ensure medicine supplies. Ireland is preparing border inspections for food shipments and even racehorses.Call it contingency planning. Call it preparedness. Just try not to call it panic.But countries that conduct a lot of trade with Europe\u2019s second-largest economy face a particular challenge: How to manage the massive flow of TVs, car parts, drugs and every other product that cross their borders to get to and from Britain.Many have been preparing for a nightmare scenario in which Britain fails to negotiate an orderly departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, while assuming that a rosier outcome will prevail. That would involve keeping Britain tied to European regulations and customs arrangements, allowing goods to continue traveling easily across borders and safeguarding critical supply chains and jobs.Britain\u2019s neighbors are taking no chances.The government had been hoping for an outcome along the lines presented by Mrs. May, which would let the Netherlands and other European countries keep moving goods across borders with only slightly more red tape than now.A so-called hard Brexit, in which no such arrangement is made, would instead require strict new customs controls and a tangle of tariffs for each chocolate bar, computer or car part that passes through the Rotterdam port to and from Britain.The Dutch are bracing for the worst.\u201cAs far as we know, Brexit is happening,\u201d said Erik Jeene, a spokesman for the Dutch finance ministry, which oversees spending for the customs authority. \u201cHard Brexit is still a possibility, so we are preparing.\u201dIn addition to customs agents, the government is recruiting up to 90 veterinarians for animal and food inspection. New agents will have to have uniforms and other equipment. Warehouses to hold goods for inspection may be needed, adding to the nearly 35 million euro, or around $40 million, expense.In the event of a hard Brexit, ships sailing to Rotterdam from Britain could no longer pass through a type of express lane for customs clearance. Instead, Mr. Jeene said, they would be diverted into a different lane reserved for vessels from so-called third countries, which are not part of the European Union and undergo more extensive inspections to ensure cargo meets strict regional standards.\u201cIf we import apples from Germany, they can just cross the border,\u201d Mr. Jeene said. \u201cIn a new situation for Britain, that wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d The customs inspection load could be enormous. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about thousands of containers a day,\u201d he said.With Mrs. May\u2019s plan rapidly careening off course, a clear answer looks increasingly out of reach.\u201cIt\u2019s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly,\u201d the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday.As part of its contingency plans, Ireland is also considering whether to relocate part of the emergency oil stocks that it stores at British refineries back to Ireland or to other countries in the union, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported. A government spokesman said such stocks may be held only in European Union countries.Brexit, even in its tidiest form, could create paralysis at the Channel Tunnel crossing between France and Britain. In the French city of Calais, the deputy mayor, Philippe Mignonet, has warned that Brexit could result in round-the-clock traffic jams, and an increased risk of migrants trying to smuggle themselves into waiting payloads.France is accelerating the recruitment of up to 700 customs officers before Brexit. \u201cThe more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it\u2019s not impossible it could eventually happen,\u201d Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe said last week.Companies worried about supply chain disruptions are scrambling to cope. The European aerospace giant Airbus employs over 14,000 people in Britain making massive wings for its planes. Some parts must go back and forth between Britain and the European Union before final assembly. So any transport holdup could wreak havoc with production.Other firms have been stockpiling goods to prepare for an Armageddon scenario. Warehouse space in Britain has been filling up at record rates as companies from electronics producers to appliance makers stock inventories to meet demand in case they cannot get supplies quickly, according to KPMG, the professional services firm.Even Britain\u2019s own Department of Health is examining how to ensure continuity in the supply chain for medicines, vaccines, radioisotope products and medical devices under different Brexit outcomes \u2014 including if the country comes crashing out, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the National Health Service, told a parliamentary committee.\u201cNobody,\u201d Mr. Stevens said, \u201cis suggesting that this is a desirable situation in which to find ourselves.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of France\u2019s prime minister.

{"Headline": "Love Is in the Air, at Terminals and on Tarmacs, Too", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byField NotesWhen it comes to air travel, there are plenty of haters. And then there are those who have found love within airport terminals, tarmacs and even cockpits, like Adam Dershowitz, an aeronautical engineer.One afternoon, about 17 years ago, Mr. Dershowitz, who was 33 at the time and a private pilot living in Houston, took his sweetheart, Hanna Liebman, then 30, up in a two-seat acrobatic airplane. As he turned the vessel upside down, a move he often repeated while she was a passenger, he announced: \u201cA women who likes to fly like this is someone I should keep around, so do you want to get married?\u201d\u201cShe was hanging from the straps,\u201d Mr. Dershowitz recalled, \u201cand I said, \u2018This airplane has a two-minute inverted fuel system so decide quick.\u2019\u201dThe couple were married in October 2001 in New York, their hometown (though not at an airport).Marriage proposals on airplanes or helicopters, along with weddings at airports or places associated with aviation, have since become more common as couples find special meaning in these locations.In California, Chris Robinson, a lawyer and a notary, regularly performs weddings in public spaces at Los Angeles-area airports. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of dozens of weddings in L.A., Burbank and Orange County airports,\u201d he said, adding that passers-by are always charmed.Weddings are also popular at airport hotels with views of the runway, like the Sheraton Hartford Hotel at Hartford Bradley International Airport, where more than half a dozen couples each year celebrate their union from a ballroom overlooking the tarmac.As couples personalize the occasion, \u201cunique venues are on the rise,\u201d said Kristen Maxwell Cooper, the editor in chief of the wedding website the Knot.Hangars and air museums are also selected as wedding sites, though not just by couples involved in aviation.Catherine Harbove, an events director at a restaurant in Houston, and Alejandro Capetillo, who works in finance, both 31, decided to hold their wedding this past April in a former terminal building of Houston\u2019s Hobby Airport.\u201cHe\u2019s been flight obsessed his whole life,\u201d Ms. Harbove said of her new husband\u2019s interest in aviation. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the movie, \u2018Top Gun\u2019 came out the year he was born.\u201dMs. Harbove admits she can\u2019t tell one jetliner from another, but she says she remains fascinated with the golden days of aviation. When the couple toured the first passenger terminal to be built in Houston, now a city aviation museum, they knew right away they had found their spot.During the reception, Frank Sinatra tunes and jazz standards played while friends and family explored the Art Deco building, with its period check-in counters, flight crew uniforms and long-forgotten travel memorabilia.A reminder of times past \u201cmakes people emotional,\u201d Ms. Harbove said. Their wedding was an invitation to step back to a time when being in the air was romantic.The couple met as students at Embry Riddle Aeronautical, where Ms. Lindheim, now 23, was on a pilot career track and Mr. Lindheim, 25, was majoring in air traffic control. It wasn\u2019t until they graduated and got jobs in separate cities that they discovered there would be diversions en route to happily ever after.Ms. Lindheim worked as a factory demo pilot and a regional sales director for Textron/Cessna in Chicago, while her fianc\u00e9 was doing training in Oklahoma. Their career paths converged when both got assignments in Atlanta.The museum where they got married is at the Space Coast Regional Airport, which operates several hangars filled with vintage military planes.\u201cI can\u2019t think of one bad hangar party I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201d Ms. Lindheim said.Few of their friends and family had any connection to aviation, but they all appreciated a special surprise at the ceremony when the ring bearer pedaled down the aisle on an airplane bicycle.After the ceremony, the newlyweds, slipped out undetected to prepare for their big reveal at the reception: The bride taxied a Cessna 172 to the party hangar with her husband at her side.\u201cI was in full wedding dress,\u201d Ms. Lindheim said, though she\u2019d swapped her high heels for sparkly sneakers for better control on the rudder pedal. On the wedding cake the topper promised \u201cAdventure begins.\u201dMany flying metaphors seem to apply to life, as Lou Rodriguez and Chris Cueva, who live in Boston, discovered while planning their wedding on the tarmac of the Palm Springs Air Museum in Palm Springs, Calif.Both men are flight attendants with JetBlue, a job that can appear to be more fun than it actually is. \u201cPeople have a perception that it is glamorous, and certainly it is a great lifestyle and an addiction and a passion,\u201d said Mr. Rodriguez, 30.In reality, though, it is hard work, requiring empathy, energy and good communication skills.This training would turn out to be helpful planning a destination wedding for 200 guests in 2015, shortly after the legalization of same-sex marriages.The parents of Mr. Cueva, 38, were so uncomfortable with his upcoming nuptials that they considered not attending the wedding, creating a drama that played out on \u201cBride & Prejudice.\u201d The TV series on the FYI network documents weddings of couples who encounter family resistance. Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Cueva also found wedding service providers reluctant.Relying on flight attendant training that teaches the importance of prioritization, the couple decided to jettison the small problems. If a business owner had a problem with them, they\u2019d find someone else. They would concentrate instead on the one challenge that mattered: making sure that they did not shred family ties.They relied on professional problem-solving skills and a dose of understanding. \u201cIf people don\u2019t have information, it can intimidate them,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said of how the couple approached Mr. Cueva\u2019s parents, and specifically his father.\u201cThey grew up in a different time,\u201d he said, adding that once the father \u201cgot to know me and how much Chris and I were a great pair together, I think it was able to change his mind.\u201dDuring the ceremony, on the tarmac bracketed by World War II-era planes, the two said \u201cI do,\u201d with all parents and grandparents in attendance, as well as many airline employees.\u201cOnce you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in for life, said Mr. Rodriguez, who is now using his husband\u2019s last name. He was talking about how, despite the difficulties, aviation had won his and his husband\u2019s heart. Only now, the sentiment applied just as well to their lives together.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows) and Instagram.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles Koch Takes On Trump. Trump Takes On Charles Koch.", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has given Republicans good reason to tolerate his unruly leadership style. His tax cuts, deregulation push and nomination of conservative judges amount to the most orthodox Republican agenda any president has pursued since Ronald Reagan.Few had better reason to appreciate Mr. Trump\u2019s results than Charles G. Koch, a billionaire industrialist who is one of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest donors.Yet Mr. Koch\u2019s simmering frustrations with the president over trade and immigration have now spilled over into an ugly public feud with Mr. Trump and candidates who side with him. By calling Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies \u201cdetrimental\u201d and denouncing divisive leadership, Mr. Koch is making a provocative political move that \u2014 be it hardball strategy or more of a ploy \u2014 threatens to complicate Republican efforts to hold on to their slim congressional majorities in the November midterm elections.\u201cI never sought their support because I don\u2019t need their money or bad ideas,\u201d Mr. Trump fumed on Twitter in an early morning series of posts. And several Republicans, including some allies of the Kochs, accused them of self-aggrandizement.The back-and-forth between the two men began with threats from Mr. Koch and his top political aides over the weekend to withhold support for Republican candidates who do not help enact the free trade, budget-slashing, government-shrinking policies that have always been at the center of the Koch political philosophy but are of little interest to the president. The Koch network has said it plans to spend up to $400 million on politics and policy in the 2018 election cycle.In a video released to the media during a Koch network retreat in Colorado Springs on Saturday, Mr. Koch was unsparing in his criticism of the kind of nationalist, protectionist trade policies that the president favors. And while he did not mention Mr. Trump\u2019s name, at times he appeared to be speaking directly about the president and many of his supporters.Mr. Koch denounced a \u201crise in protectionism\u201d in which countries, organizations and individuals are \u201cdoing whatever they can to close themselves off from the new, hold on to the past, and prevent change.\u201d\u201cThis is a natural tendency,\u201d Mr. Koch added, \u201cbut it\u2019s a destructive one.\u201dThe Koch political network remains generally opposed to many Democratic policies and does not want to see leaders like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, return to power if the Democrats triumph in the midterms. But those who know Mr. Koch\u2019s thinking said that his criticism of Mr. Trump reflects the vast political and personal gulf between the two men. They also echo the widely held beliefs of many conservatives who worry that Mr. Trump is inflicting long-term damage on their cause, and on the country.Mr. Koch\u2019s unease is a reflection of the wider discomfort and disorientation inside the Republican Party since Mr. Trump stormed the presidential primaries in 2016 and knocked out every candidate the Koch network had supported.Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that the Koch network has spent on politics in recent years, Mr. Koch has always been unnerved at seeing portrayals of himself as a Republican kingmaker, people close to him have said. And over the last few years the Koch brothers, two of the world\u2019s wealthiest men, have tried to cultivate a worldly, civic-oriented image to counter the Democratic Party\u2019s attacks on them as self-interested corporatist puppet masters. Koch Industries, the global energy conglomerate, also began a national marketing campaign to try to soften its image.But how far Mr. Koch and his groups go in following through with their latest threats was the subject of cynical speculation this week from Republicans and conservatives across a wide spectrum of the party \u2014 from pro-Trump leaders and groups to more establishment-aligned interests that usually fight alongside the Kochs in Washington\u2019s legislative trenches.Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, blasted the Koch threats as a \u201cvanity play of historic proportions.\u201d\u201cThe Koch operation never had a foundation,\u201d Mr. Reed added. \u201cThey chased rabbits all over the country with no central set of issues, theme or ideology. Lots of noise and bluster and very little to show for it.\u201dStephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief White House strategist and a relentless critic of the older-guard Republican Party leadership, said the Kochs were \u201cthe latest to succumb to \u2018Trump derangement syndrome,\u2019\u201d a phrase the president and many of his supporters have started using to mock people who are highly critical of Mr. Trump.\u201cThey are trying to weaponize the \u2018Never Trump\u2019 movement against Republicans by saying they\u2019ll work with Democrats,\u201d Mr. Bannon added. \u201cAnd what they\u2019re doing has to be condemned, including by Vice President Pence.\u201dVice President Mike Pence, a former congressman and governor of Indiana, has been a longtime beneficiary of Koch donations. His inclusion in the Trump administration, and the ties he retains to the Koch political operation, underscore how difficult it has been to meld the two disparate political orbits.Marc Short, a former president of the Koch political arm Freedom Partners who joined the Trump campaign in 2016 to work alongside Mr. Pence, recently left his job as the White House legislative affairs director. His tenure was complicated by the way Mr. Trump often treated Republican leaders in Congress as members of the opposition party.Mr. Phillips, the Americans for Prosperity president, declined to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on advancing policies that break down barriers to success for Americans, not on personal attacks,\u201d he said.If the Koch political operation follows through with its plans to punish more Republicans like Mr. Cramer \u2014 network officials pointed out that if this were 2014 or 2016, Mr. Cramer most likely would have received their backing \u2014 that could put Republicans in jeopardy elsewhere.At their weekend retreat, Koch political strategists released a list of the states with Senate races they were committing to: Florida, Missouri Tennessee and Wisconsin. But what that list did not include spoke volumes.Notably absent was Indiana, where the incumbent Democrat, Senator Joe Donnelly, is facing a Republican businessman, Mike Braun. The race is one Republicans believe offers one of their best opportunities to gain a seat. But Mr. Braun has praised the president\u2019s actions on tariffs.A Koch endorsement and the accompanying advertising and on-the-ground campaign support that often follows can help swing close races. Koch groups like Americans for Prosperity were built to be vehicles for the conservative grass-roots, even if they rely heavily on paid staff to do their work. And their emphasis on cutting spending, regulations and the size of the government helped elevate fiscal issues to the forefront of the Tea Party-inspired revolts that helped Republicans take control of the House of Representatives in 2010.That Mr. Koch is being harshly critical of a president beloved by the conservative grass roots, while at the same time endorsing a strategy that could help cost Republicans seats in a close election, struck some activists as strange.Adam Brandon, president of Freedom Works, another conservative grass-roots group that supports low taxes, smaller government and free trade, said that a Democratic-controlled House would not be helpful on any of those issues, whereas a Republican majority would be.\u201cIf you lose that majority, I don\u2019t know how that helps,\u201d Mr. Brandon said. \u201cThis is a unity moment heading into these midterms.\u201dMr. Brandon explained the contradictory emotions many Republicans today are facing, balancing the good of the Trump administration with the bad. \u201cHere he is, the same president who\u2019s done more to deregulate than any president in history, cut taxes \u2014 and now he\u2019s pushing tariffs. It\u2019s left a lot of people scratching their heads.\u201dMr. Brandon reasoned that he can look past it. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a whole lot more that we like than that we don\u2019t like,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the states with Senate races to which the Kochs were committing their political efforts. Nevada is not one of those states.Advertisement"}

The assailants were not identified.Henri Depele, the mayor of the town of Sibut, the capital of K\u00e9mo, a prefecture in the Central African Republic, told the Reuters news agency that the journalists were killed in an ambush in the region on Monday night.The journalists\u2019 driver, who survived the attack, told Mr. Depele that he and his passengers were attacked about 14 miles away from Sibut.\u201cArmed men emerged from the bush and opened fire on the vehicle,\u201d Mr. Depele said. \u201cThe three journalists died instantly.\u201dThe group\u2019s relationship with the Kremlin is murky and unconfirmed, but its leaders have reportedly received awards from the Kremlin, and its mercenaries were trained at the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s facilities.The journalists were in the Central African Republic on an assignment for the Investigation Control Center, a Russian online news organization financed by Mikhail B.

{"Headline": "Americans Are Having Fewer Babies. They Told Us Why. ", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen have more options, for one. But a new poll also shows that financial insecurity is altering a generation\u2019s choices. Because the fertility rate subtly shapes many major issues of the day \u2014 including immigration, education, housing, the labor supply, the social safety net and support for working families \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of concern about why today\u2019s young adults aren\u2019t having as many children. So we asked them. The survey, one of the most comprehensive explorations of the reasons that adults are having fewer children, tells a story that is partly about greater gender equality. Women have more agency over their lives, and many feel that motherhood has become more of a choice. At the same time, he said, \u201cThere is no getting around the fact that the relationship between gender equality and fertility is very strong: There are no high-fertility countries that are gender equal.\u201d In the Morning Consult and Times survey, more than half of the 1,858 respondents \u2014 a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 20 to 45 \u2014 said they planned to have fewer children than their parents. About half were already parents. Of those who weren\u2019t, 42 percent said they wanted children, 24 percent said they did not and 34 percent said they weren\u2019t sure. Jessica Boer, 26, has a long list of things she\u2019d rather spend time doing than raising children: being with her family and her fianc\u00e9; traveling; focusing on her job as a nurse; getting a master\u2019s degree; playing with her cats. \u201cMy parents got married right out of high school and had me and they were miserable,\u201d said Ms. Boer, who lives in Portage, Mich. \u201cBut now we know we have a choice.\u201d Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave. She admits being \u201ca little nervous\u201d that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighborhood. \u201cA lot of people, especially communities of color, can\u2019t really afford that now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just apprehensive about going back to poverty. I know how it goes, I know the effects of it, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Can I ever break this curse?\u2019 I would just like to change the narrative around.\u201d David Carlson, 29, graduated from college in 2010, when the job market was still rough.

High employment among women and high fertility don\u2019t have to be in conflict, but they will be without such policies, said Olivier Thevenon, an economist studying child and family policies at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cWhether the young generation will catch up later is not certain,\u201d he said, \u201cbut will depend on their capacity to combine work and family.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brett Kavanaugh, a Conservative Stalwart in Political Fights and on the Bench", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Brett Michael Kavanaugh was just 38 when he was first nominated to a federal appeals court in Washington. But he had already participated in an extraordinary number of political controversies, attracting powerful patrons and critics along the way.He served under Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, examining the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel, and drafting parts of the report that led to Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment. He worked on the 2000 Florida recount litigations that ended in a Supreme Court decision handing the presidency to George W. Bush. And he served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary to Mr. Bush, working on the selection of federal judges and legal issues arising from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.He was \u201cthe Zelig of young Republican lawyers,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said at Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s first confirmation hearing, in 2004. \u201cIf there has been a partisan political fight that needed a good lawyer in the last decade, Brett Kavanaugh was probably there.\u201dBut Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has also formed lifelong friendships with liberals, many of whom praise his intellect and civility. In his professional life, before he became a judge, he was often a moderating force.As a judge, though, he has been a conservative powerhouse, issuing around 300 opinions. His dissents have often led to Supreme Court appeals, and the justices have repeatedly embraced the positions set out in Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions.He has written countless decisions applauded by conservatives on topics including the Second Amendment, religious freedom and campaign finance. But they have particularly welcomed his vigorous opinions hostile to administrative agencies, a central concern of the modern conservative legal movement.\u201cTo prevent tyranny and protect individual liberty, the framers of the Constitution separated the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the new national government,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cTo further safeguard liberty, the framers insisted upon accountability for the exercise of executive power. The framers lodged full responsibility for the executive power in a president of the United States, who is elected by and accountable to the people.\u201dJohn G. Malcolm, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group, said the decision was emblematic of a judicial career.\u201cHe is a thoughtful, strategic judge who has, over time, moved the direction of the law in a conservative direction, and he has done it with scalpel-like precision,\u201d Mr. Malcolm said. \u201cThis is a conservative judge who has written textualist, originalist opinions in a whole host of areas.\u201dBorn in Washington, the son of two lawyers and the graduate of one of its elite private high schools, Georgetown Preparatory School, Judge Kavanaugh is in many ways a creature of the city Republicans like to deplore.After seven years at Yale, where he went to college and law school, he returned here for a varied career that included stints in the Justice Department, the independent counsel\u2019s office, a private law firm and the White House before joining the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Along the way, he married the former Ashley Estes, who served as personal secretary to Mr. Bush. They have two daughters.\u201cI never see him prouder,\u201d Professor Walker added, \u201cthan when I see him talk about coaching girls\u2019 basketball.\u201dMs. Kavanaugh was a public high school teacher in Washington before going to law school, becoming a state prosecutor and then a state trial judge. \u201cShe\u2019s instilled in me a commitment to public service and a respect for the rule of law that I\u2019ve tried to follow throughout my career,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said at his 2006 confirmation hearing.President Trump\u2019s selection, Brett M. Kavanaugh, is a Washington insider who appears unlikely to drift left as other conservative justices have.After law school, he served as a law clerk to three judges: Judge Walter Stapleton of the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia; Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco; and Justice Kennedy, whom Judge Kavanaugh hopes to replace.During that last clerkship, Judge Kavanaugh overlapped with a young Neil M. Gorsuch, who had been hired by a retired member of the court, Justice Byron White, and also worked part time in Justice Kennedy\u2019s chambers.No Supreme Court justice has had more than one former law clerk join the court. If Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is successful, two of Justice Kennedy\u2019s clerks from a single term will serve together, probably for decades. Judge Kavanaugh also showed his loyalty to another former Kennedy clerk, Richard Cordray.Before he joined the bench, Judge Kavanaugh made around $6,000 in contributions to political candidates, all but one of them Republican. The exception was Mr. Cordray, who received a $250 contribution for his unsuccessful 1998 campaign to become Ohio\u2019s attorney general and $1,000 for a failed bid in 2000 for the Senate. Mr. Cordray, who also worked with Judge Kavanaugh at Kirkland & Ellis, went on to become the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency Judge Kavanaugh later voted against, and is now running for governor of Ohio.Years later, Justice Kennedy still spoke with admiration verging on awe of the young Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s work ethic, Professor Walker said, recounting the justice\u2019s words: \u201cBrett was always there the first thing in the morning before I came in and last thing at night when I was leaving. I\u2019d say, \u2018Brett, you\u2019re working too hard. You\u2019ve got to go home.\u2019 But he would never listen to me.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh wrote large parts of Mr. Starr\u2019s 1998 report to Congress, though he has said that he did not draft its narrative portion, which included many explicit details of Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual encounters with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.After the Clinton investigation and impeachment proceedings concluded but before Mr. Trump entered politics, Judge Kavanaugh came to have doubts about the wisdom of criminal investigations of presidents while they are in office.\u201cWhether the Constitution allows indictment of a sitting president is debatable,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a 1998 law review article.\u201cMy chief takeaway from working in the White House for five and a half years \u2014 and particularly from my nearly three years of work as staff secretary, when I was fortunate to travel the country and the world with President Bush \u2014 is that the job of president is far more difficult than any other civilian position in government,\u201d he wrote.He concluded that sitting presidents should not be distracted by civil suits or criminal proceedings. \u201cA president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh said the proceedings could resume after a president left office and that impeachment remained an option.Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s first nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stalled in the Senate, but he was confirmed after Mr. Bush renominated him in 2006.The court is generally considered the second most important, but its docket is idiosyncratic and heavily weighted toward administrative law, which can be extraordinarily complex. In his opinions, Judge Kavanaugh has often been skeptical of government regulations, notably in the area of environmental law, and he has argued in favor of greater judicial power in reviewing the actions of administrative agencies on major questions.In 2011, Judge Kavanaugh dissented from a decision upholding President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, but he did so on jurisdictional grounds.\u201cThe policy is laudable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe earth is warming. Humans are contributing. I understand the international impact and the problem of the commons. The pope\u2019s involved. And I understand the frustration with Congress.\u201dBut he added: \u201cIf Congress does this, they can account for the people who lose their jobs. If we do this, we can\u2019t.\u201dHe has also been open to using the First Amendment to strike down government regulations. Dissenting from the full District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a three-judge panel\u2019s decision upholding the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations, he said the government can no more tell internet service providers what content to carry than it can tell bookstores what books they can sell.\u201cThe net neutrality rule is unlawful,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause the rule impermissibly infringes on the internet service providers\u2019 editorial discretion.\u201dHis opinions on abortion rights, religious exemptions and Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law shared a common quality: they were all conservative, but none took an absolutist position.Last year, he dissented from a decision allowing an undocumented teenager in federal custody to obtain an abortion, writing that the majority\u2019s reasoning was \u201cbased on a constitutional principle as novel as it is wrong: a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\u201d He said he would have given the government more time to find a sponsor for the teenager.But Judge Kavanaugh did not join a separate dissent from Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who wrote that the teenager had no right to an abortion because she was not a citizen and had entered the country unlawfully.In 2015, he dissented from the court\u2019s decision not to rehear a three-judge panel\u2019s decision upholding an accommodation offered by the Obama administration to religious groups with objections to providing contraception coverage to their female workers.He agreed that \u201cthe government has a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception for the employees of these religious organizations.\u201d But he said the government had other ways of achieving that goal.Advertisement"}

Stormer, whose self-published 1964 book, \u201cNone Dare Call It Treason,\u201d became a right-wing favorite despite being attacked as inaccurate in promulgating the notion that American government and institutions were full of Communist sympathizers, died on July 10 in Troy, Mo. He was 90.The book landed in the year that the Republican Party nominated Barry M. Goldwater, the conservative Arizona senator, for the presidency, and Goldwater sympathizers latched onto it, buying up copies and distributing them at rallies and by other means. The far-right John Birch Society was among the groups spreading the book around.Communists, Mr. Stormer wrote, were bent on infiltrating the American government and had largely succeeded, as evidenced by American and United Nations economic support for Communist countries.\u201cThe Communists have sworn to bury us,\u201d Mr. Stormer wrote. \u201cWe are digging our own graves.\u201dThe conspiracy, he claimed, was also seeking to undermine Christianity, the American education system and more. Unions and the news media were enablers, he said, as were charitable foundations.\u201cFrom where has the money come to build and finance the vast collectivist underground which reaches its tentacles into education, the churches, labor and the press?\u201d he asked. \u201cAmazingly, the fortunes of America\u2019s most successful tycoons, dedicated by them to the good of mankind, have been redirected to finance the socialization of the United States.\u201dMillions of copies of the book ended up in circulation, although not as a result of people stampeding to the bookstores.John Anthony Stormer was born on Feb. 9, 1928, in Altoona, Pa., to Regis and Mary Ann (Forr) Stormer. He graduated from Altoona High School and attended Penn State University, where he studied electrical engineering. He served in the Air Force during the Korean War and afterward completed a journalism degree at San Jose State University in California.Mr. Stormer was editing an electronics magazine in 1960 when he attended a conservative conference in Washington whose speakers included Goldwater and Walter Judd, a United States representative from Minnesota known for his anti-Communism.\u201cI decided after what I heard there that what I should do is write a 16-page pamphlet explaining what the threat was,\u201d he said in the 2014 interview. \u201cAnd of course it grew into a 250-plus-page book.\u201dNot holding out much hope that a mainstream publisher would be interested, he took an unusual approach to publication.\u201cI printed up 125 copies of the manuscript and actually mailed those to 87 people that I knew were concerned conservatives,\u201d he said. He asked for advance orders and, he said, soon had 57,000, enough to support a print run.The book and efforts to distribute it divided the country. In Hicksville, on Long Island, the school board rejected someone\u2019s offer to donate copies, while in nearby Levittown, after an hour of debate, the school board accepted a gift of six. At Elmira College in Western New York, 60 students picketed the home of the college president after he distributed free copies through the campus mail.The book may have circulated widely, but it did not help Goldwater; he lost the 1964 election by a wide margin to the incumbent, Lyndon B. Johnson.Mr. Stormer, though, saw a silver lining to that defeat. He viewed it as a signal to conservatives to work harder and smarter.\u201cThat whole conservative movement of the early 1960s matured and produced the Reagan revolution,\u201d he told The Washington Times in 1999, on the occasion of the publication of another book of his, \u201cNone Dare Call It Education.\u201d In that book Mr. Stormer contended that the American education system had strayed from a focus on academics and been hijacked by forces promoting a type of social engineering dangerous to traditional values.In 1965 Mr. Stormer, who had grown up in a Roman Catholic family, \u201ccame to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,\u201d as the funeral home\u2019s obituary put it. He became pastor of a Baptist church in Florissant, Mo., a position he held for 31 years. He was also superintendent of a Christian school and, for 10 years, president of the Missouri Association of Christian Schools.His other books, all espousing conservative views, included \u201cThe Death of a Nation\u201d (1968), \u201cBetrayed by the Bench\u201d (2005) and a 25-year updating of \u201cNone Dare Call It Treason\u201d in 1990.He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Elizabeth; a daughter, Holly Hartzell; a sister, Susan Pezzi; four grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.Though the accuracy of \u201cNone Dare Call It Treason\u201d was often disputed, Mr. Stormer was confident he was right, so much so that in the book\u2019s final chapter, \u201cWhat Can You Do?,\u201d he urged his readers to scrutinize him.\u201cFirst, you must educate yourself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDetermine that the facts in this book are true.\u201dAmong his other advice was that people read two newspapers a day of opposite editorial viewpoints. He also urged his readers to make God a meaningful force in their lives and to be politically active. The stakes, he said, were high.\u201cIf Communism comes to America,\u201d he wrote, \u201cyou will lose not only your money, but your freedom, your children, your home, and possibly your life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Nominee Is Mastermind of Anti-Union Legal Campaign", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven before the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union fees for government workers last month, the next phase of the conservative legal campaign against public-sector unions was underway.In March, with the decision looming, lawyers representing government workers in Washington State asked a federal court to order one of the state\u2019s largest public-employee unions \u201cto disgorge and refund\u201d fees that nonmembers had already paid. Similar lawsuits were filed in California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Ohio.The complaints could upend the legal system by arguing that states and private parties like unions face liability even though they followed the law as it existed at the time. They could also cost unions hundreds of millions of dollars.Beyond their legal claims, the cases share another striking detail: The lead counsel in each is a conservative lawyer named Jonathan F. Mitchell.Mr. Mitchell, 41, has a formidable r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He was a Supreme Court clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia; worked at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush; taught at several law schools, including Stanford; and spent more than four years as the solicitor general of Texas.After the 2016 election, he served as a volunteer attorney on the Trump transition team, where he helped review future executive orders. In September, the president nominated him to head the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small federal agency that advises the government on improving its inner workings. His nomination awaits action by the Senate after the Judiciary Committee approved him on a party-line vote in March.In the meantime, Mr. Mitchell appears to be a driving force behind the anti-union litigation, suggesting a well-coordinated effort. In an email, he declined to discuss the matter, citing \u201cmy pending nomination and my desire not to draw attention to the lawsuits.\u201d It is unclear who funds the work of the firm cited on most of the cases, Mitchell Law.Mr. Mitchell\u2019s co-counsel in the Washington State case, Hannah Sells, a lawyer for the free-market Freedom Foundation, said she met Mr. Mitchell less than one year ago at an event put on by the Federalist Society, the conservative legal organization. He expressed interest in working on litigation related to union membership and mandatory union fees, Ms. Sells said.\u201cJonathan is a brilliant legal mind; I\u2019m a first-year attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cVisionary, I think, is the right way to put it.\u201dKermit Roosevelt, an expert on retroactive constitutional claims at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said Mr. Mitchell\u2019s legal reasoning \u201cwould be very destabilizing\u201d beyond union matters if it gained significant traction in the court system.For instance, he said, if a future Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, applicants denied admission under the previous policy would be able to win damage awards retroactively tied their rejection.In all three cases, the judges found that the unions could claim a good-faith defense because they had followed \u201cseemingly valid state laws\u201d requiring the fees, as one judge put it, that were only later deemed to be unconstitutional. No appeals court has overturned any of these rulings.Even so, Mr. Mitchell and his allies may get a favorable reception in the one court that really matters: the Supreme Court.\u201cThis court has shown itself to be so hostile to workers\u2019 rights that they will find a way,\u201d said Sharon Block of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, who is a former senior Labor Department official and National Labor Relations Board member.Will Baude, a libertarian-minded professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, said the Supreme Court had proved less sympathetic than some lower courts to good-faith defenses for private parties like unions.Amid this possibility, Mr. Mitchell\u2019s central role, and his ties to the Trump administration, loom large.On one level, Mr. Mitchell appears well suited to head the administrative conference. It weighs in on such technical questions as how to make the process of creating regulations more efficient and democratic, and how to reduce the backlogs facing immigration judges and administrative judges, like those who preside over Social Security hearings.The agency\u2019s most recent chairman, Paul Verkuil, a law professor and dean who was appointed by President Barack Obama and served until 2015, said he had spoken with Mr. Mitchell and had come away impressed. \u201cHe knows the administrative law field very well,\u201d Mr. Verkuil said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy.\u201d (The agency has been run by acting chairmen since Mr. Verkuil left.)But in other ways, Mr. Mitchell is a curious choice, albeit one that may reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s impatience with the norms that have historically constrained the federal government.While presidents nominate members of their own parties as agency chiefs, the conference tends to be studiously bipartisan in its approach. Prominent former government officials serve on the agency\u2019s board, like Ronald Klain, a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Theodore B. Olson, who was solicitor general under Mr. Bush. A young Antonin Scalia once ran the agency.(In written responses to senators\u2019 questions, Mr. Mitchell said that he did not believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s gay-marriage decision allowed governments to deny same-sex spouses benefits that opposite-sex spouses received, and that he was not out to destroy the \u201cadministrative state,\u201d a goal some Trump advisers have espoused.)And then there are the union cases, which Mr. Mitchell filed after his nomination to head the conference, and which could also suggest a free-market worldview hostile to regulation.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who opposed the nomination in the Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Mitchell\u2019s role in the cases raised questions about his suitability for the federal position.\u201cMr. Mitchell has given us no information about how he got involved in these cases and who is backing them financially,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he is a clandestine operative of the same powerful ultraconservative special interests out to cripple unions, he is not fit to serve in this post.\u201dMr. Mitchell said he disclosed his involvement in the cases to the Judiciary Committee and the administrative conference this week, although he declined to explain how he had gotten involved. He denied that conservative groups were financing the cases.Mr. Verkuil said a chairman would have to stop representing clients in any litigation. Regardless, he said, an ideological agenda is inconsistent with the conference\u2019s mission.\u201cYou can\u2019t bring those into the agency \u2014 that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first job of the chairman is to make sure its credibility is maintained and enhanced.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

Cohen, have received 12 audio \u201citems\u201d that had been seized by the F.B.I. but had been withheld from investigators, according to a court filing on Monday.The materials, presumably audio recordings, were turned over to prosecutors on Friday after \u201cthe parties\u201d withdrew claims that the items were subject to attorney-client privilege, the filing said.The authorities have been investigating Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in making hush-money payments to women in advance of the 2016 election, and whether any such action violated federal campaign finance laws.The court filing on Monday does not specify the contents of the 12 audio items.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen, President Trump and Mr. Trump\u2019s private business, the Trump Organization, have been working with Ms. Jones to identify which materials they believe should be deemed privileged. Ms. Jones submitted the Monday court filing, which provided a brief update on her review.\u201cOn July 20, 2018, the parties withdrew their designations of \u2018privileged\u2019 as to 12 audio items that were under consideration by the special master,\u201d Ms. Jones wrote. \u201cBased upon those de-designations, the special master released the 12 items to the government that day.\u201dThe court filing does not specify which \u201cparties\u201d withdrew the privilege claims on the audio items, but one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers, Lanny J. Davis, writing on Twitter on Monday, suggested that the decision to withdraw the privilege designation had come from President Trump.Mr. Davis appears to have been referring to comments by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who confirmed in the recent Times report that Mr. Trump had discussed payments to Ms. McDougal on the recording.According to the Times report, Mr. Giuliani described the recording as less than two minutes long, and said it gave no indication that Mr. Trump knew before the conversation about the payment to Ms. McDougal.\u201cNothing in that conversation suggests that he had any knowledge of it in advance,\u201d Mr. Giuliani was quoted as saying.Lawyers for Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment; the United States attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.

{"Headline": "Senators Push Fed Chairman for Answers on Slow Wage Growth", "Date": "2018-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the economy is humming and the financial system is safe, but cautioned that trade policy has cast an uncertain shadow over the United States.Pressed repeatedly by Democrats about what the Fed could do to accelerate wage growth, Mr. Powell said a strong economy and low unemployment would ultimately lift wages. He said a range of factors outside the Fed\u2019s control have contributed to middle-class wage stagnation over the past three decades, including a slowdown in advancements in educational attainment in the American work force.He offered a mixed assessment of whether the new tax law has stimulated the American economy, agreeing with a Republican senator\u2019s assessment that the mere anticipation of tax cuts increased growth last year but telling a Democratic senator that it was too soon to say if the law had begun to lift wages.\u201cI think it would be early to look for a bill that was signed into law less than a year ago to be affecting much of anything,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell said it was possible Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy would end up liberalizing trade, by forcing other nations to reduce tariffs levied on American exports. He also said the opposite was possible, and that growth and wages could be dampened by an escalating trade war.\u201cWe don\u2019t see it in the numbers yet,\u201d Mr. Powell said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve seen a rising chorus of concern.\u201d\u201cThe Fed looked the other way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Fed let these banks off with a conditional non-objection.

Andrew M. Cuomo announced his bold vision for New York\u2019s second largest and perhaps longest-suffering city.Sure enough, the money soon started to flow to Buffalo, leading to new waterfront parks, gleaming modern factories and a cluster of medical and technology facilities.But an examination of the plans and progress of projects included in the Buffalo Billion reveals a far more uneven return on investment to date: a mix of street-level successes, expensive brick-and-mortar gambles and ill-conceived misfires.While some projects have bloomed, others have been delayed by years or show no sign of progress, beyond their initial news release. And Mr. Cuomo\u2019s promises of well-paying, permanent jobs at the most costly projects have repeatedly fallen well short.The governor\u2019s strategy and spending have come into sharp relief as the man who spearheaded the Buffalo effort, Alain E. Kaloyeros, went on trial last month in Federal District Court in Manhattan along with three co-defendants \u2014 executives with two companies who generously donated to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s past election campaigns. Mr. Cuomo, 60, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and prosecutors have said the donations to him were legal.Mr. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University Polytechnic Institute who was once called \u201cNew York\u2019s secret weapon\u201d by the governor, stands accused of bid-rigging several upstate development projects, including Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest: a $750 million solar-panel plant on the banks of the Buffalo River.\u201cI think the Buffalo Billion sounds better than it probably turned out to be,\u201d said Isaac Ehrlich, a SUNY distinguished professor of economics at the University at Buffalo.\u201cJob growth in Buffalo during the expansion had been buoyed by a surge in construction jobs associated with major projects\u201d such as the solar plant, according an October report from Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, two Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists. \u201cAs these projects have wound down, so, too, has construction-related employment.\u201d\u201cThe last seven years have undoubtedly been the best in Buffalo for a very long time,\u201d said Howard Zemsky, the president of Empire State Development, the state\u2019s primary economic development agency. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that the way the governor transformed economic development has had a very positive impact.\u201dMr. Zemsky noted some 25,000 new private sector jobs have come to the city during the Cuomo administration, and added that many of the Buffalo Billion projects \u2014 both past and future \u2014 were not exclusively about jobs, per se, but support for long-term solutions like downtown revitalization, smart growth, opening up the waterfront and keeping younger generations from fleeing.The project, however, hasn\u2019t even broken ground; an empty former mall and a parking garage remain on the site, though state and company officials said it is still in the works.But only a handful of students ever found full-time jobs with the company, which no longer has offices in Buffalo and \u201cfailed to meet the partnership goals,\u201d according to the college. Calls and emails to the company were not returned.In remarks about the trial, Mr. Cuomo said recently that he would let the legal process work, and said he\u2019d not really even paid attention to the case.\u201cI haven\u2019t been following it all that closely,\u201d he said, in an interview on NY1. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we have a trial.\u201dThus far, the Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest money projects have gone to just a select group of well-connected developers, and have been limited to a small number of locations, including several blocks known as the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, where several multimillion projects have been based.All told, the state has spent more than $135 million at the medical campus, including support for a genomics institute, a children\u2019s hospital and expanding class sizes and faculty at the University at Buffalo\u2019s medical school.George Palumbo, an economics professor at Canisius College in Buffalo, said that the gleaming new buildings at the medical campus \u201ctake nice pictures,\u201d but said the development was also illusory.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go very far from that neighborhood to see Buffalo blight,\u201d he said, \u201cnot Buffalo billion.\u201dStill, as the Buffalo Billion has grown over the last six years, it has come to include grant programs, entrepreneurial competitions and beautification projects, and many of those seem popular.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many industries around here,\u201d said Kathy Miner, a retired nurse, as she watched a steady stream of dump trucks come and go. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dEconomists say that the theory of flooding a single area with money is not a bad one, and that it may be years before a final verdict can be made about the Buffalo Billion. But for now, the governor\u2019s declarations that the city has been saved seem premature.\u201cAt best, it has stopped declining,\u201d Professor Palumbo said. \u201cBut not dying anymore is not a rebirth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brett Kavanaugh on the Issues: Abortion, Guns, Climate and More ", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJudge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, has spent the past dozen years embracing the philosophy of the conservative legal movement as he assembled a record on the powerful federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.On issues as diverse as abortion and gun rights to disputes over national-security policies and business regulations, Judge Kavanaugh emphasized textual limitations while frequently favoring corporations over regulators, and the government over individuals claiming rights violations. With a few exceptions, his pattern is typically conservative.To be sure, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s history on the bench is not a perfect guide to the approach he would pursue if confirmed to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he once clerked. Appeals court judges are bound to obey Supreme Court precedent, but justices are free to vote to overturn past rulings.Still, the judge\u2019s record \u2014 especially in cases where he disagreed with colleagues \u2014 provides clues about the sort of justice he would be if the Senate confirms him.Here are some of the notable issues and cases he has addressed. Many of them arose from disputes over the scope and limits of the power of the federal government.Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He wrote that while the appeals court was bound to obey Supreme Court rulings that said that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion, those precedents left room for the government to apply \u201creasonable regulations that do not impose an undue burden.\u201dHe maintained that the government was within its bounds to choose a transfer to a sponsor instead of \u201cforcing the minor to make the decision in an isolated detention camp with no support network available.\u201d Judge Kavanaugh accused the majority of wrongly inventing \u201ca new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\u201d He said that barred the government from intervening to connect minors with their immigration sponsors before making such a serious life decision. \u201cThe majority\u2019s decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence,\u201d he wrote.Some religious organizations challenged that arrangement, contending that even submitting the form made them complicit in providing contraception. An appeals court panel rejected their argument, and the full appeals court decided not to rehear it \u2014 over Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s objections.Forcing employers to submit the form violated their religious liberty, he wrote, though he acknowledged a Supreme Court precedent that strongly suggested that the government \u201chas a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception for the employees of these religious organizations.\u201d The same outcome could be achieved, he contended, if employers instead only had to notify the government of their objections and let the government deal with the insurers.He upheld the practice as constitutional, citing the principle that government-sponsored religious speech or prayer at public events where prayers were traditionally said do not violate the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on establishment of religion, so long as the prayers are \u201cnot proselytizing (seeking to convert) or otherwise exploitative.\u201dHe wrote that while the government may ban fully automatic machine guns, a ban on semiautomatic rifles should be unconstitutional because they \u201chave not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting and other lawful uses.\u201d He also said that because registration had not traditionally been required for all lawfully possessed guns, that rule should be struck down, too.In several important cases brought by Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees, Judge Kavanaugh generally sided with the government. In habeas corpus cases, for example, he broadly interpreted the military\u2019s power to hold people in wartime detention even when the evidence of their suspected ties to terrorism is relatively weak. And he has repeatedly taken a skeptical approach to Environmental Protection Agency regulations attempting to address greenhouse gas emissions using a clean-air law crafted before climate change had emerged as a major policy concern.

{"Headline": "Review: A Godard Film About Making Movies Arrives in New York", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe imposing filmography of Jean-Luc Godard is dotted with many remarkable anomalies and one-offs, including television commercials and music videos. \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Small Film Company,\u201d a shot-on-video picture made in 1986 and having its official New York premiere in a new restoration, is one of the most diverting and substantial of these.Commissioned by, yes, a small film company to produce an installment of a French TV channel\u2019s series of crime novel adaptations, Mr. Godard instead created something almost wholly other. This one was to be based on \u201cThe Soft Centre,\u201d a book by James Hadley Chase (who wrote the lurid and scandalous \u201cNo Orchids for Miss Blandish\u201d in 1939, as well as \u201cEva,\u201d which was made into a notable film by Joseph Losey in 1962). Drawing on his own frustrations in a new era of film production, Mr. Godard concocted a narrative that, like his movies \u201cContempt\u201d (1963) and \u201cPassion\u201d (1982), chronicles a film that doesn\u2019t get made.Making a film of \u201cThe Soft Centre,\u201d he uses the small offices of his producer, Jean Almereyda (Jean-Pierre Mocky, an actor and director who was a contemporary of Mr. Godard\u2019s), to conduct elaborately ritualized auditions, creating assembly lines of emoting. He approaches women in bistros and requests that they come to his place for private auditions and that they bring their bathing suits. When they tell him that sounds shady, he responds, \u201cThat\u2019s not our style.\u201d (Sure enough, when they do show up, Bazin is sufficiently scattered and passive that you think maybe he wasn\u2019t lying.) He does take a genuine interest in working with Almereyda\u2019s wife, Eurydice (Marie Valera). Almereyda is too caught up in financing concerns to take much notice.The allusive character names and the absurdist spectacles of the depicted auditions suggest that the proceedings constitute an elaborate inside joke, which they do. (Bazin of course refers to the groundbreaking French film critic, mentor to Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Godard and several other critics turned filmmakers; Almereyda was the assumed name of the filmmaker Jean Vigo\u2019s father; and you hopefully know who Eurydice was.) The effect is heightened when Mr. Godard himself shows up, playing the director Jean-Luc Godard. But his work never operates on just one level. Beneath the playfulness, there\u2019s both genuine melancholy and anger; as ridiculous as the characters here can seem, the movie attaches them all to a palpable thread of anguish.\u201cMais c\u2019est Godard!\u201d Almereyda exclaims when the filmmaker materializes, an unlit cheroot in his mouth. The two get in the fictional producer\u2019s car and discuss recent real-life events in the film world, including the 1985 drug overdose of the producer Jean-Pierre Rassam and the 1982 death of the actor Romy Schneider.As funny as Mr. Godard\u2019s claim that he\u2019s recently moved to Reykjavik, Iceland, to be closer to great chess is, his near prediction of what would become, in his own life and practice, a larger isolation from the ostensible center of French filmmaking here speaks to a disillusionment that has a genuine poignancy. In the most piquant of the film\u2019s dozens of allusions, one of the central characters of \u201cRise and Fall\u201d emerges from the inevitable shipwreck of the Hadley project to present himself for employment at another company, this one called Albatross Films. Cinema: Can\u2019t live with it, can\u2019t live without it.An earlier version of this review referred incorrectly to the history of Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud\u2019s working relationship with Jean-Luc Godard. They worked together on \u201cD\u00e9tective\u201d in 1985; \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Small Film Company,\u201d in 1986, did not reunite them for the first time since 1969.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

How much do diapers cost? I asked a friend with a 1-year-old, as if the answer wasn\u2019t online. She couldn\u2019t answer; diapers were just one of countless minor recurring expenses. The cost of child care, however, she could tell me. If it didn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg, it did seem that every month she cut off a finger and a toe and Venmo\u2019d them to her nanny \u2014 a payment that despite its size was still inadequate to the importance of the task and to the woman\u2019s skill in doing it. Well, my friend had a job that paid twice as much as mine and could afford it; I would go with day care instead. But day care centers were dear, too. The cheapest I could find charged a finger joint a month. For every minute you were late to pick up your child, an ounce of blood. Operating costs were kept down by letting the toddlers play in a doubtless very stimulating TV-walled closet while the caregiver worked data-entry jobs she found on TaskRabbit to supplement her paycheck, which was more of an honorarium anyway \u2014 she did it, it was said, for the kids.The anxiety of parents like me \u2014 educated professionals without many assets to show for it \u2014 animates Alissa Quart\u2019s new book, \u201cSqueezed,\u201d a dispiriting survey of the economic stress felt by families who belong to the \u201cMiddle Precariat,\u201d as Quart calls the new middle class. As her coinage suggests, this once large swath of the population is narrowing, its members finding their financial situation increasingly tenuous. Much that middle-class professionals took for granted in previous generations, including homeownership, decent health care, a comfortable retirement, is now out of reach. Over the past 20 years, the cost of housing has risen dramatically. The price of health care and college has almost doubled. Meanwhile, wages have stagnated, unions have nearly vanished and, in some sectors, technology has replaced human workers. Many people find themselves carrying school and credit-card debt, and working low-paid, temporary or part-time jobs. Those in certain industries, like tech or finance, are forced to work long hours as a matter of course; others supplement jobs that once upon a time would have been considered full time, such as teaching, with temporary gigs such as driving an Uber.Quart\u2019s main subject is this generation\u2019s attempts to produce the next. Tight circumstances may be tolerable when no one depends on you; they become quite another matter when you have kids. Among the parents Quart spends time with are an adjunct professor, the single mother of a child with cerebral palsy, who teaches four classes a semester to barely make do; and a nurse whose hospital now uses robots for certain tasks that used to fall into her purview, such as hauling linens. Diligently reporting on the troubles facing \u201cMiddle Precariat\u201d families, Quart doesn\u2019t offer much that is news. It is by this point a commonplace that inequality is as bad as it has been in a century, that every sector of the population save the richest is treading water at best.What is perhaps unusual about Quart\u2019s book is her attention to how we feel about it \u2014 specifically our peculiar willingness to take personal responsibility for problems that are not our fault. Everyone Quart talks to is acutely stressed, which makes sense. But everyone also feels guilty. Why? People have been so successfully inculcated into neoliberal ideology that nobody thinks twice about feeling bad about not making enough money. Of course, what makes the ideology persuasive is that there\u2019s a grain of truth to it; there are people who through a combination of dedication and luck manage to overcome their inherited lot. Yet the issue is overwhelmingly structural and social, not individual or moral. We haven\u2019t failed; Capitalism has failed us. As Quart reminds her reader \u2014 and as every story in the book is meant to illustrate \u2014 the economic bind we find ourselves in cannot be solved by personal discipline or better financial decisions. The truly wise are those born into a family in the 1 percent.Quart has tried to write a book that is not uniformly depressing, and at the end of some chapters she describes ways people have attempted to better their situations with unconventional arrangements \u2014 for example, two families save money by living together and sharing child care. Other chapters sound an optimistic note that seems forced \u2014 say, the Paraguayan nanny who has been separated from her 11-year-old son for 10 years and is finally able to bring him to New York. Is there any point to this story other than to prevent readers from feeling devastated about the thousands of women who must live away from their own children in order to care for those of other people? More heartening is Quart\u2019s invocation of policy solutions that until recently were seen as impossibly idealistic, such as universal health care or a universal basic income.In May, the Centers for Disease Control released data suggesting that women were having fewer children than at any point since 1978 \u2014 1.76 over their lifetimes, down from 2.1 in 2007 \u2014 even as the number of children they report wanting to have (around 2.2) has remained more or less the same for two decades. The reasons for the falling birthrate are no doubt complex, but the gap between desired and \u201ccompleted\u201d family size (as the lingo has it) suggests a grim and cleareyed sense of reality. Rage, grief, refusal: These are appropriate reactions to a broken economic order. Not guilt. While on assignment for this book review, I lost my job. (I\u2019ve since taken another one.) The next day, my partner lost his. I have no reason to think we\u2019ll have more than one child.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Work Done, Tax Policy Writers Decamp to Lobbying Jobs", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Six months after Republicans pushed a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul through Congress, many of the most influential players who worked behind the scenes on the legislation are no longer on Capitol Hill or in the Trump administration.They are now lobbyists.The two-way street between lobbying and lawmaking is well worn in Washington. But after President Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d there was some speculation that the so-called special interests might be sidelined. And while the frenetic two-month sprint last year to pass the tax legislation left some lobbyists marginalized, the businesses now scrambling to navigate the changes are increasingly recruiting the people who wrote it.With the November midterm elections near, and the possibility that Republicans could lose control of the House or the Senate, staff members have additional motivation to move on.\u201cCompanies are looking to better understand the legislation and potentially affect future changes, which is why they are snatching up top talent,\u201d said Ken Spain, a Republican consultant who works on financial and tax issues. \u201cWith the uncertainty of the election looming, Republican staffers are quietly making themselves available to K Street while they can still demand top asking price.\u201dWhile they might not be household names, those who have decamped to the private sector played a major role in the passage of the most sweeping tax bill in three decades. More than a dozen people have already migrated this year, and more are expected to follow as the elections draw closer.With little time left on the legislative calendar and more gridlock in store, some of these departing officials may feel that staying in government offers diminishing returns.\u201cIf you think about administrations historically, a lot of what is accomplished is in the first year or 18 months,\u201d Mr. Maloney said in an interview. \u201cMany staffs spend years and never accomplish what we did at Treasury in a limited amount of time, between tax legislation, financial services reform, Cfius reforms and sanctions.\u201d He was referring to the recent rollback of some rules for smaller banks and the likely passage of legislation that would expand the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to block international mergers on national security grounds.Administration and congressional staff members can often double or triple their salaries while working a fraction of their government hours by joining lobbying firms.The migration from lawmaking to lobbying has occurred under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Congressional staff members often make the switch after the enactment of major legislation, and experts who chart the influence of money in politics noted a similar trend, perhaps to a lesser degree, after the passage of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama.\u201cThis year, the revolving door is particularly swinging out of control,\u201d said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that promotes lobbying reform. \u201cThe midterm elections are coming up, which many expect to not go well for the Republicans, and this is the ideal opportunity for Republican congressional staff and administration officials to be able to cash in on what they have been doing the last year an a half.\u201dPaul Miller, president of the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, said that this has led to the growth of a shadow lobbying industry, where former government staff members take consulting and advisory jobs that are essentially lobbying under a different name.\u201cThey\u2019re calling it something else and doing what they were doing anyway,\u201d Mr. Miller said. He noted that the number of registered lobbyists has been falling in recent years. \u201cThe actual number of lobbyists has increased dramatically.\u201dThe international side of the tax code is also due for more changes. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged in an interview on the Fox Business Network last week that the speed of the passage of the legislation meant that fixes were needed.\u201cWe threw major changes at the international side,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have as much time to model them, analyze it. Now that we\u2019re getting that feedback, we\u2019re going to be making those changes.\u201dBut critics of the Trump administration warn that the president is turning a blind eye to the fact that lobbyists are becoming more entrenched under his watch.\u201cIt\u2019s going to cost the American taxpayer billions of dollars,\u201d said Norman Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and a former adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cThese people are being brought into the special interest influencing industry in order to find ways to evade an already generous, excessively generous giveaway to corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Do you see us ever going back to those halcyon days when someone like Sandra Day O\u2019Connor could be confirmed 99-0?The same thing happened about 100 years ago when, thanks to cheaper printing technology and urbanization, people who were used to getting maybe one news publication in the mail suddenly discovered they could buy three or four or eight different local papers. There was a lot of shrieking back then, too. Have I ever told you the story of Grover Cleveland? Very respectable guy but suddenly there were all these headlines about him staggering drunk and naked through brothels.Given that, what\u2019s your prediction?Predictions? Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals who once clerked for Kennedy, is my first bet. Among other things, he wrote a law review article in 2009 arguing that presidents should be exempt from lawsuits and investigations, which must be music to President Trump\u2019s ears. And he\u2019s in his early 50s, meaning he\u2019d likely be on the court for decades.And while environmentalists would have good reason to be scared of this guy, some of the swing votes \u2014 like Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski and Heitkamp \u2014 would love nothing better than to have a Supreme Court that flies a \u201cDrill, baby, drill\u201d flag outside the building.Although of course we both know that whatever this person believes, during the Senate hearings it will turn into a strong commitment to open mindedness and respect for precedent. Even if he or she secretly is plotting to destroy Social Security and deport all puppies.When you talked wistfully about bipartisanship I was remembering John McCain partnering with Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform \u2014 getting both parties together for a really heavy lift that could have put American politics on a whole new, principled level. And the deciding Supreme Court vote to kill off reform came from Anthony Kennedy. So while I understand the concerns everyone has over his departure, I\u2019m not exactly weeping.He got beat by a young, very intelligent, hard-charging Latina who knew how to use social media.

I think \u201cabolish ICE\u201d is just a way of objecting to Trumpian immigration outrages. Again, a happy opening to Independence Day.Still, it worries me, for a few reasons. First, I think anyone who calls herself a democratic socialist must either be ignorant of the immense damage socialism did in the 20th century or, more frighteningly, cognizant of it. The Sanders-style instinct of treating the financial class in the United States as virtual criminals is an ugly form of class warfare this country doesn\u2019t need.Second, the increased prominence of Sandernistas among Democrats ultimately strengthens the right. You know I favor a tolerant and liberal immigration policy.

{"Headline": "A $100 Billion Train: The Future of California or a Boondoggle?", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "In the face of sharp opposition and questions about how to pay for it, construction of California\u2019s high-speed rail line is roaring ahead.Supported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 It is vigorously opposed by Republicans, including President Trump. It has been plagued by escalating costs and delays. Californians are mostly against it. And a central question \u2014 how is it going to be paid for \u2014 remains unresolved.But here in the Central Valley, far from the debates in Washington and Sacramento, the $100 billion Los Angeles-to-San Francisco bullet train has moved off the drawing board and onto 21 construction sites spread across five Central California counties.Work began two weeks ago on one of the more ambitious pieces of the project \u2014 an overpass that will carry trains over a major highway in Fresno \u2014 and ground will be broken on three more viaducts in the next few months. Nearly 2,000 workers are on the job, starting as early as 5 a.m. to avoid the 110-degree afternoon heat. \u201cSimply put, dirt is flying in the Central Valley,\u201d the High-Speed Rail Authority declared in a recent business plan.Yet for all the cranes, crews in orange vests, beeping trucks and fresh concrete, it remains far from certain that this project will ever be completed. In addition to the lack of funding, it faces opposition from both Mr. Trump and Kevin McCarthy, the Bakersfield Republican who is the House majority leader.The continued delays and rising costs have fueled criticism that California, perhaps the most prosperous state in the nation, is squandering money on a transportation project that critics describe as a prime example of big government waste in a state controlled by Democrats.\u201cThis is going to be the most expensive and slowest form of fast rail imaginable,\u201d said Jim Patterson, a former Fresno mayor who is now a Republican member of the Assembly and a critic of the project.For all the construction, the project faces the ever-present threat that a future governor may decide that state resources would be better used dealing with, to name one example, the housing crisis. Gov. Jerry Brown, a big proponent, is leaving office at the end of the year.\u201cThe project seems to make even less sense today,\u201d said Joe Nation, a professor of public policy at Stanford University.For advocates of high-speed rail, California under Mr. Brown has been a rare bright spot, while other ambitious government-funded bullet train proposals across the nation have struggled in the face of opposition from Republicans who are concerned about the costs and disruptions.Gov. Rick Scott of Florida rejected Federal funds to help build a high speed rail line from Tampa to Orlando, saying it was too expensive for taxpayers. Attempts to upgrade rail service between New York and Boston on Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor have repeatedly faltered because of community opposition.A high-speed rail line is moving ahead in Texas, connecting Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, but it is being financed by private industry.The high-speed train in California, championed by Mr. Brown, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, his Republican predecessor, is the most ambitious public transportation project underway in the nation today. It is moving ahead while other mass transit improvement ambitions \u2014 for the subway system in New York City, for an innovative elevated train line in Honolulu \u2014 have also been hamstrung by costs and opposition.The entire 800-mile line is scheduled for completion by 2033. There is no shortage of obstacles to what even the project\u2019s biggest boosters call an ambitious timetable, including the engineering challenge of tunneling through the Tehachapi Mountains, a barrier between the Central Valley and Los Angeles.The cost was originally supposed to be split among the state, the federal government and private business. But that arrangement faltered, as hopes for federal dollars faded with Republicans in power in Washington and businesses shied away from such an uncertain venture. As of now, the rail authority has come up with less than $30 billion of the necessary $100 billion, and the project\u2019s costs are expected to continue to rise.\u201cThe rest has to be found,\u201d said Martin Wachs, an emeritus engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a member of a committee appointed by the Legislature to review the project. \u201cAt the moment, 100 percent of the cost is going to be absorbed by the taxpayers.\u201dBeginning construction without all of the financing in place represents a strategic gamble by the rail authority, and by Mr. Brown, that once enough work is completed, future leaders will be loath to walk away from the project and leave a landscape of unfinished pillars, viaducts, bridges and track beds. Faced with reduced resources, the authority has altered its plans, and is now focused on finishing a 119-mile stretch of track from Bakersfield to Madera by 2022.Brian P. Kelly, the head of the authority, argued that when this stretch of train is completed, people will rally around the project and the business community would become convinced of its viability.\u201cIf I can get trains on the ground, Californians will start to see that this is something that we want,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of attention paid to what we don\u2019t have. But we have significant fund-raising to get done what we have to get done.\u201d\u201cYes, the project has challenges,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cAnd the primary challenge for this same project is the same today as it was the day the voters passed the bond: And that is, we don\u2019t have enough money to build what we want to build.\u201dNEV.SanFranciscoCALIFORNIAMaderaPlannedhigh-speedrail routeFresnoSectioncurrentlybeing builtin CentralValleyBakersfieldPACIFICOCEANLos AngelesCALIF.Planned routeof second phaseArea ofdetailSan DiegoMEXICOBy The New York TimesIn downtown Fresno, more than 300 homes and businesses have been relocated, some by condemnation, to make way for the rail line. A mile-long network of viaducts, bridges and platforms is rising more than 60 feet over farmland.\u201cWe had to shift this freeway here over by 100 feet,\u201d said Diana Gomez, the Central Valley regional director of the California High-Speed Rail Authority, as she drove down a brand-new stretch of Highway 99 that was rebuilt to make way for the train line just north of this city.The strategy of concentrating first on the section from Bakersfield to Madera puts off tunneling through mountains, which Mr. Kelly said could cost anywhere from $4 billion to $13 billion. It also means that people living in California\u2019s two major population centers \u2014 San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 will see no sign of the project any time soon.\u201cThe latest business plan is essentially a going-out-of-business plan,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cIt finally admits that it cannot complete a high speed rail plan between San Francisco and Los Angeles. It\u2019s a rump railroad.\u201dBut John Hernandez, an employee with the Small Business Administration who lives in Fresno, said a high-speed train would transform his town, bringing in more visitors and making it easier for him to get to big cities.\u201cIt would change my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be able to go places faster. I could get on a train at noon and be in San Francisco at 3 p.m.\u201dRoger Dickinson, the executive director of Transportation California, a transit advocacy group, said the obstacles were significant, but the need for the train was critical.\u201cLooking at the need for increased environmentally sound ways of moving people between Northern and Southern California, it\u2019s a project that still makes great sense, and I think it will be successful.\u201dKaren Philbrick, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University, said the problems were not unlike those that confront any ambitious project.\u201cApproximately two dozen other countries have found H.S.R. feasible, including Uzbekistan,\u201d she said, referring to high-speed rail. \u201cAnd there is no reason it can\u2019t be done here.\u201dIt remains entirely conceivable that the state could walk away from the project, and put the acquired rights of way and new viaducts to other uses, like conventional freight or passenger trains. The question is whether the construction on display in the Central Valley will be enough to dissuade a future governor from doing that.\u201cThe more they can show what they have done, the harder it is to abandon the project,\u201d Mr. Wachs said. \u201cOn the other hand, it can easily be argued that the cost of what they have done so far has so exceeded their projections that it\u2019s not inappropriate for a governor to look at it and say, \u2018Let\u2019s not throw more good money after bad.\u2019\u201dMr. Kelly said that the merits of the project would ultimately pull it through.\u201cThe project has been a political football for some time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I know is this: This project has all the right points of what California is trying to do with transportation. We are trying to provide fast, efficient service and we are trying to do it in a clean way that expands our economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a professor of public policy at Stanford.
