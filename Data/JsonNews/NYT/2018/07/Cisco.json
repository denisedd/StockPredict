{"Headline": "California Today: Are Criminal Justice Reforms Making the State Safer?", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In less than a decade, California has gone from being a standard-bearer for the ills of prison overcrowding to a national exemplar of reform, letting tens of thousands of people out of prison and reducing penalties for many crimes.Important measures were passed by voters in 2014 and 2016, but only now is research starting to show the effects on crime in California. The new data is fueling a continuing debate, with national implications, about whether California should continue on the path of reform, or take a step back and get tougher, once again, on crime.The overall picture, according to supporters of criminal justice reform, is that crime is at historic lows in California. And they say that even if some categories have increased, such as thefts from automobiles, it hardly justifies a return to the days of mass incarceration.\u201cMy main takeaway is that criminal justice reform is continuing to advance public safety,\u201d said Lenore Anderson, the founder and executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, which has backed reforms.This would represent a threat to one of the signature legacies of outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown, who wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cRead the fine print. This flawed initiative would cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and endanger public safety by restricting parole and undermining inmate rehabilitation.\u201dThe issue is a rare one that crosses party lines. While liberals tend to fall in line for reform, and Republicans are more likely to emphasize prison over rehabilitation, the lines are not clean.One of the new ballot initiative\u2019s top supporters is a Democrat in Sacramento \u2014 Jim Cooper, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy turned assemblyman. And some Republicans, most prominently the former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, have been voices of reform.\u201cThis has never been a left-versus-right issue,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who noted that in the past, \u201cpoliticians of all stripes rode the bandwagon of increased incarceration.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal have Oakland in their bones.Mr. Diggs, who won a Tony Award in 2016 for his spirited performance as Lafayette and Jefferson in \u201cHamilton,\u201d and Mr. Casal, a spoken-word savant, were both born and bred in the gritty East Bay city.The two men are now the writer-stars of \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d an Oakland-set comic drama that arrives in theaters on July 20.Our reporter called it \u201ca type of primal howl\u201d \u2014 and an apt example of the defiant city\u2019s emergences as an artistic hotbed.Read the full report here.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Cisco Chief Executive\u2019s New Mantra: Simplify Computer Networks", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Over more than three decades, Cisco Systems became a Silicon Valley giant partly because of one facet of its business: technological complexity.Managing Cisco\u2019s many varieties of networking equipment, which help computers exchange data, became such a convoluted process over time that customers who learned to do so became loath to try competing products.\u201cThe networks that we build we\u2019re going to have to think about fundamentally differently,\u201d Mr. Robbins, 52, told attendees.New Cisco offerings that are based on Mr. Robbins\u2019s streamlining strategy seem to be selling well, reversing years of revenue stagnation for the company\u2019s core business. Since 2015, Cisco\u2019s market capitalization has risen by more than 50 percent to around $200 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s now getting better understood by investors that Cisco is not an incumbent being killed by the cloud,\u201d said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research.Cisco\u2019s momentum is representative of how some older technology giants are finding ways to survive vast changes in their markets, forces that felled earlier standard-bearers like IBM in personal computers and Nokia in mobile phones.\u201cThere is no room for technology religion,\u201d Mr. Robbins said in a recent interview at Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose, indicating that he is open to changing longtime practices.Ten of Cisco\u2019s most prominent executives soon left. Some other senior managers have exited more recently, while the company has also recruited from outside. Of 13 people in Mr. Robbins\u2019s top executive circle, 12 are new to that role. One key appointment was David Goeckeler, an executive vice president who was given responsibility for all networking offerings and security products. Mr. Robbins said Cisco needed faster decision-making and new skills.One reason for urgency: By mid-2015, Cisco\u2019s business of networking switches and routers was no longer growing predictably. Some longtime telecom customers had turned to lower-priced networking hardware and new software that made it easier to run systems from multiple vendors. Cisco had also largely failed to win over big cloud-computing specialists, a group led by Amazon.Mr. Robbins persuaded Cisco\u2019s board to shift research and development dollars back to networking. One key focus was a little-noticed company stronghold: the closets of many businesses where boxes, wires and Wi-Fi connect PCs and other devices to the internet.Those campus networks, as they are called, are not easily disrupted by newer technologies like cloud computing; even ardent fans of such services need boxes to connect users to the web.Mr. Robbins specifically pointed to a new line of switching systems called the Catalyst 9000, which has some novel features, including the ability to scan packets of data for malicious software even if they are encrypted. In just the past three quarters, it has been purchased by 5,800 customers, a record order rate for the company.Catalyst 9000 also comes with new software used to manage the systems, called DNA Center, which provides a kind of digital dashboard for all the devices connected to a corporate network. The software streamlines what technicians need to do, which previously involved typing in an arcane set of text commands for each networking device to configure and make changes to a network. Cisco estimates that it has taught that skill to more than six million people over the years, building customer loyalty through their investment in training.But the labor to manage that complexity has turned into a liability, Mr. Robbins said. Companies often spend $15 in operating costs over five years for each dollar spent on network technology, he said.Seth Price, who manages networks operated by Durham County, N.C., estimated that DNA Center and other Cisco software had reduced the time needed to resolve service problems by 80 percent. Finding and isolating a computer infected with malware \u2014 a job that once took months \u2014 now takes hours, he said.DNA Center is also designed to improve security by making it easier to restrict what devices can communicate with one another. That was a key selling point for Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, which has to worry about protecting computers, medical instruments and other devices, said Steven Garske, its chief information officer. The hospital decided to buy 350 of the Catalyst devices last July.The latest Cisco technology works like \u201cdigital alchemy,\u201d said Jerry Sheehan, chief information officer at Montana State University, which is also testing DNA Center.Some competitors question whether Cisco, which has long specialized in hardware, has what it takes to thrive as software becomes a decisive differentiator.\u201cI think they have a difficult transition from where they are,\u201d said Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey are running uncontested,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And how high might it go? The cable company loves Sky\u2019s mix of content, its distribution channels and its rights to show the English Premier League, so a big fight is plausible.There\u2019s another player to consider, too. Walt Disney, which is fighting Comcast for control of Fox, wants Sky for similar reasons, and is helping Mr. Murdoch overcome British government fears about antitrust.But the fine may not be the last punishment Facebook receives in this scandal. In the U.S., the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are all investigating. Their powers go much further.It\u2019s proof that Mr. Trump still wields a lot of power from his Twitter perch, and he\u2019s not afraid to use it when companies do things he dislikes.But they don\u2019t all yield: Harley Davidson \u2014 which the president criticized for moving some motorcycle production offshore to avoid European tariffs \u2014 is not retreating.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restAdvertisement"}
