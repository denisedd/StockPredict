{"Headline": "Xiaomi\u2019s Weak I.P.O. Raises Doubts About China\u2019s Tech Boom", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Xiaomi\u2019s public debut was supposed to value the Chinese gadget maker at $100 billion and set the stage for a global coming-out party for some of China\u2019s most successful technology companies.When Xiaomi finished its first day of trading on Monday, the company was worth only $48 billion, weakness that could hang over the rest of the Chinese tech players waiting to go public.Some companies say money from Chinese lenders has become harder to come by. China\u2019s leaders are bracing for a bruising fight with the United States over trade.Xiaomi\u2019s founder and chairman, Lei Jun, cited worries about the trade war just before the company\u2019s shares began trading.\u201cAt this critical moment in Sino-U.S. trade relations, the global capital markets are in a constant flux,\u201d Mr. Lei said to a group that included Xiaomi employees at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange early Monday.The expectations for Xiaomi have been falling in recent weeks. Investors started to re-evaluate the prospects for the company, which sells affordable smartphones and a slew of other gadgets. Although it was the biggest Chinese initial public offering since 2014, Xiaomi raised considerably less than it had originally hoped on Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. Shares then fell slightly.Xiaomi is widely expected to be the first of several big Chinese tech names to seek initial public offerings in coming months. They include Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s version of Uber; Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of the Alibaba Group; and Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and products.All three companies have benefited from the prevalence of smartphone use in China and the country\u2019s wild online growth, which has made it by far the world\u2019s largest internet market in terms of users. They could choose to go public in Hong Kong, which would give global investors a chance to bet on them.Xiaomi\u2019s shares on Monday ended at 16.80 Hong Kong dollars, or roughly $2.15 \u2014 just below the 17 Hong Kong dollars at which they began the day, and far below the company\u2019s earlier hopes.Though Mr. Lei cited trade, investor concerns about the company\u2019s plan played a big role in its disappointing debut.In recent months, as Xiaomi bankers and executives traveled around the world to meet with prospective investors, they pitched Xiaomi as an internet company and China\u2019s answer to Apple. It was a formula \u2014 China plus internet \u2014 that in the past guaranteed strong support from overseas investors like hedge fund managers in the United States.But many investors view Xiaomi as still largely a hardware maker, not an internet company. It has promised fatter margins from selling internet services to its smartphone users, but those services accounted for less than 9 percent of last year\u2019s revenue.\u201cXiaomi has been billing itself as a Chinese internet company, but they really are not quite yet a pure internet company,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.\u201cInvestors haven\u2019t really bought into that story,\u201d Mr. Wang added.Some investors were also concerned about Xiaomi\u2019s focus on international growth, as its home market has become increasingly competitive. More than half of its sales are outside China, primarily in India, where it has a loyal following for its low-cost smartphones.While that could be attractive to some investors in the long run, some saw more immediate risks. For example, Xiaomi was forced to backtrack in Brazil after it failed to establish a relationship with local carriers.Xiaomi received wide news coverage this year when it announced its plans to list in Hong Kong, picking Hong Kong over New York, the listing venue of choice for some of China\u2019s blockbuster offerings, like Alibaba.Even with the tepid market response on Monday, Xiaomi persuaded a number of high-profile investors to buy shares. These included China Mobile, Qualcomm and China Merchants Bank Group, according to a term sheet seen by The New York Times.And with its public market listing, Mr. Lei is a new billionaire. Wearing a tie in the same orange as his company\u2019s logo, he told reporters at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, \u201cI am excited beyond words!\u201dMr. Lei then hit the gong to signal the start of trading, and everyone watched as the company\u2019s shares fell. And they continued to fall; by midmorning the stock had dropped 5 percent against a rising Hong Kong Stock Exchange.By the end of the day, it had recovered some of the losses, after support from bargain hunters and Xiaomi\u2019s bankers helped to push the share price back up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wild About Tech, China Even Loves Robot Waiters That Can\u2019t Serve", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome in China are building a future that isn\u2019t quite ready. Still, the exuberance may be a good thing, as useful products find their place and bad ones disappear.SHANGHAI \u2014 The mind-reading headsets won\u2019t read minds. The fire-detecting machine has been declared a safety hazard. The robot waiter can\u2019t be trusted with the soup.China is ready for the future, even if the future hasn\u2019t quite arrived.Donning black headbands that looked like implements of electroshock therapy, the seven men and two women onstage were told to envision themselves pressing a button. The headbands would transmit their brain activity to the robotic hand sharing the stage, which would then push a button to officially start the conference. A countdown began. A camera put the robotic hand onto a huge screen above the stage. The people onstage seemed to concentrate. And then, nothing happened. The hand remained motionless. The camera panned away. A spokesman for Yiou, the tech consultant that hosted the event, declined to comment except for: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.Those deficiencies were made clear in April when the United States forbade American companies to sell chips, software and other technology to ZTE, a Chinese telecom company. ZTE was found to have violated American sanctions by selling products to Iran and North Korea. The ban brought the company to a virtual standstill.And China has come a long way. What was an agrarian backwater 40 years ago is home to the world\u2019s single largest group of internet users and some of its most valuable internet companies. Many in China see the country\u2019s supremacy over the United States in tech as inevitable, and they are eager to get to that day. \u201cChinese are much more willing to try something new just because it looks cool,\u201d said Andy Tian, chief executive of Beijing-based Asia Innovations Group, which runs mobile apps. \u201cIt sounds superficial. It is superficial. But that\u2019s the driver of progress in a lot of cases.\u201dDuring a winter visit to the station, the robot was nowhere to be found. First, it had missed a fire, officials said. It also had a tendency to collect so many selfie-seeking fans that it became a safety hazard. A spokesman for the train station said it was getting an upgrade and would eventually return.Companies and local officials often have good reason to show off their splashiest and silliest wares. China frequently takes a top-down approach to technology, with local governments rushing to follow plans that come down from on high. Gizmos with a bit of futuristic verve are often the best symbols of progress.Alibaba, the Chinese online shopping giant, has also gotten into the act, though in a more sophisticated way. At one of its new Hema grocery stores in Shanghai, rolling robots take cooked food out onto a sort of runway that connects the kitchen to seating. A team of waiters standing nearby said a human hand was required for soup and steamed dishes, lest the robots inadvertently splash someone with hot liquid.An Alibaba spokeswoman said in an email that the store was a prototype that sought to combine digitization with a unique consumer experience. \u201cThe system has driven significant traffic to the Hema store,\u201d she added.Robot restaurants have been popping up across China. One in Shanghai\u2019s Xujiahui district, Robot Magic Restaurant, cultivates a space-age, mini-golf ambience. Diners enter through a door on which animated fairies flap their wings. Inside, a robot with hearts for eyes charged its batteries in an ersatz cave rimmed by silver stalagmites tipped with glowing white lights. On the ceiling, fake stars twinkled.Waiters said their automated counterparts caused more work than they saved. The robots take trays of food out to customers, but are unable to lower them to the table. Real waiters stand back so photos and videos can be taken before shuffling in and serving food the old-fashioned way. The robots also break down. Three times during an hour lunch, a waiter had to lean a robot on its side and take a blowtorch to the undercarriage to burn out food and trash caught in its axles. When asked whether he was worried that the robots would take his job, the waiter laughed.Still, patrons were impressed. \u201cI\u2019ve just been to America, and I didn\u2019t see many new things at all,\u201d said Xie Aijuan, a retiree in her 50s. \u201cI don\u2019t think they have anything like robotic restaurants there.\u201d\u201cChina is surpassing America,\u201d agreed her dining companion, Zhuang Jiazheng. \u201cRobots are coming. Tech is advancing. It\u2019s all a matter of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Spending Is Up, but Aerospace and Defense Workers Are Scarce", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sunny Sunday in March, 29 new United States Air Force recruits took an oath to support and defend the Constitution.This was not just any swearing-in because the man turning civilians into airmen was an Air Force Thunderbird pilot. When Maj. Eric Gorney finished the ceremony on the tarmac at Florida\u2019s Orlando Melbourne International Airport, he climbed into an F-16 and along with five other Thunderbird pilots proceeded to dazzle the tens of thousands of spectators who minutes earlier had applauded the Air Force\u2019s newest members.At a time when all four branches of American\u2019s armed forces are actively recruiting to meet new personnel goals, high-profile performance teams like the Thunderbirds and the Navy\u2019s Blue Angels are powerful tools. Similar recruitment efforts are deployed around the world by the Snowbirds in Canada, the Red Arrows in Britain, and other teams as far-flung as Finland and Jordan. Maj. Ray Geoffroy, a spokesman for the Thunderbirds, said the team\u2019s goal was to \u201crecruit, retain and inspire\u201d the next generation.\u201cThe U.S. defense budget is the big dog in global military spending,\u201d John H. Schmidt, global managing director for aerospace and defense at the consulting firm Accenture, said of the $700 billion spending plan. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased investments in existing programs around the world,\u201d he said.Searching for people to do the work funded by these budgets puts the defense and aerospace industries in competition with companies like Google, Alibaba and Facebook, names that are more familiar and more firmly rooted in the minds of the digital generation.In this environment, companies are trying to be more creative to get the attention of younger workers. \u201cWhile competition for skills is fierce, we continue to attract and recruit incredible talent globally,\u201d the Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said in a statement.\u201cIn the past, if you wanted to do cool high-tech stuff, there wasn\u2019t anything else\u201d but the military, Mr. Schmidt said. Now, he added, the military has to address the impression among many young people that it is \u201cold and slow.\u201dThe adrenaline-fueled military air show teams are one way of changing that impression. When show season begins, the Thunderbirds arrive with their F-16 fighter jets. They give journalists and celebrities an opportunity to ride along on a gravity-defying flight, challenging them not to pass out or throw up.But the pilots also work on the ground, officiating as Major Gorney did at enlistment ceremonies. Last year, they also visited 55 schools and 25 hospitals. They met with scout troops and civic organizations, spreading the message that military service can help people \u201cbecome the best version of themselves,\u201d Major Geoffroy said.Thirty-one thousand new enlistees joined the Air Force in 2017, down about 500 from 2016 but higher than the previous six years. More than 1,000 people enlisted in the Air Force at Thunderbird events last year, with 4,000 more expressing interest in the service, according to Brooke L. Brzozowske of the Air Force Public Affairs Office.The public fascination with military performers can be seen around the world. In Finland, which has one-year military or civil conscription for all men at the age of 18, the Midnight Hawks demonstration team flies four BAE System Hawks at air shows and roars over the country\u2019s two annual military parades on Independence Day and Defense Forces Day.\u201cPeople are quite keen about the military,\u201d said Capt. Marc Fuss, a pilot and the team leader. \u201cStill, we need to keep the spirit up and keep them aware of the air force and defense forces and that is the role our display team plays.\u201dThe Royal Jordanian Falcons team promotes tourism through its summer appearances at European air shows and encourages young people to join the air force and learn to fly, according to the retired colonel Ghazi Sadoun, a pilot and team operations leader.England\u2019s Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, known as the Red Arrows, shows off the British-made Hawk T1 jets it flies and the Rolls-Royce engines that power them, also a British product. Watching the Red Arrows turns some spectators into performers, according to the team\u2019s website: \u201cMany of the pilots and other members of the Squadron joined the Royal Air Force as a direct result of seeing the Red Arrows perform as children.\u201dFinding more people to design, create and maintain the systems is critical. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much is in the plane beyond the wow factor of how fast it goes,\u201d Mr. DeLaney said. \u201cIn the F-35, the helmet that the pilot wears is a half-million-dollar piece of equipment and technology. That\u2019s the more enticing thing.\u201dAccording to Mr. Schmidt: \u201cAerospace is on the cutting edge of many technologies.\u201d If in the past the armed forces and the companies that do business with them didn\u2019t make effective use of that argument, that appears to be less the case now with a personnel crisis on the horizon. Whiz-bang displays, however, may not be enough to counter an unwillingness among some tech workers to create software with lethal applications.In April, more than 3,100 Google employees signed a letter to the company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, asking that the company not participate in a Pentagon program to create artificial intelligence for targeting drone attacks.Mr. DeLaney experienced something similar in his business, which provides candidates to companies with military contracts. \u201cSome individuals I recruit have shot me down,\u201d he said, when he approached them about defense-related jobs. Mr. DeLaney said the candidates told him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things that blow up or put people in harm\u2019s way or are a threat to people.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no single big red \u2018easy\u2019 button to be pushed\u201d to overcome these hurdles, said Maj. Gen. Mark Smith, the national commander and chief executive of the Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air Force.\u201cYoung people have to have the opportunity to get hands-on experience and explore potential career opportunities that are aviation-related or of interest to the air force, like cyber security or maintenance or logistics, robotics and unmanned vehicles,\u201d said Brent Wolfe, secretary general of the Canada-based cadet exchange.As part of the 2018 United States defense budget, a small amount has been set aside to help pay for flight training for cadets who otherwise would not be able to afford it. It is part of the Civil Air Patrol\u2019s mission to promote aviation and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). General Smith said helping the cadets get a private pilot\u2019s license could \u201cprime the pump\u201d and motivate some to fly for the military and maybe even become the kind of pilots who will inspire the next generation.\u201cThere are a lot of kids that think the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels are amazing and really cool,\u201d General Smith said. \u201cThey give kids an appreciation for what the military is doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those investments would build on billions of dollars that investors have already put into the companies.The investments reflect facial recognition\u2019s embrace by Beijing, which has created a better environment for companies to test the technology than in the West. And that could help China deploy advanced systems faster and more broadly than America.SenseTime has already raised over $1.6 billion in funding since it was founded in 2014, according to data from S & P Global Market Intelligence, and as recently as May was valued at about $4.5 billion. Investors included Alibaba and Bank of China as well as the American firms Qualcomm, Silver Lake, Tiger Global Management and Fidelity International.Megvii\u2019s previous funding round raised $460 million from Chinese companies like Foxconn and Ant Financial, as well as several domestic investment funds.

{"Headline": "Chinese Billionaire Is Named as Party Host in Australian Sexual Assault Case", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 A Chinese billionaire who had tried to distance himself from a sexual assault case that has gripped Australia for the past month was identified this week as Richard Liu, chairman and chief executive of the e-commerce giant JD.com.Mr. Liu isn\u2019t accused of any wrongdoing, but the assault was alleged to have taken place after a party that he had hosted here in 2015. He had tried to get a court in the Australian city to prevent the release of his name by citing potential damage to his marriage and business, court documents show.For Mr. Liu, the founder of one of China\u2019s largest internet companies, the details of the case are fraught with potential peril, both for himself and, by extension, the company with which he is synonymous in China. It offers a rare glimpse of the high-flying lifestyle Chinese business leaders have sought to keep private.While many of China\u2019s tech elite own multimillion-dollar properties around the world, like the Sydney penthouse where the 2015 party took place, exposure of those holdings is considered risky.President Xi Jinping of China has cracked down on signs of conspicuous consumption and also guided the country\u2019s ruling Communist Party to a new primacy in everyday life. Decadent dinner parties tend to be seen as undermining the spirit of those efforts.She reportedly told the court that some men at the party, but not Mr. Liu, had given her so much alcohol that she became drunk and could barely walk. According to her, Mr. Xu had offered to take her home but instead walked her back to his hotel room.Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, has not been charged with any crime or accused of any wrongdoing. A JD.com spokesman said that Mr. Liu had \u201cexpressed his deep sympathy for the victim and profound sadness about the incident.\u201d\u201cAs the judge clearly stated, Mr. Liu is not implicated in any way,\u201d the spokesman added. \u201cHe was preparing food for the guests throughout the evening and was not present for most of the dinner. Further, the perpetrator was a casual acquaintance, and the crime was committed later that evening at a separate location.\u201dThe original application for a suppression order on Mr. Liu\u2019s name was made to a judge in the New South Wales District Court on the grounds it could damage, among other things, his business. The judge ultimately decided that it was not in the public interest for the order to be issued.Mr. Liu, 44, founded JD.com in the early days of Chinese e-commerce, and grew it to massive scale, in part by investing heavily in logistics to ensure that packages get delivered quickly and in good condition. The company is now worth about $50 billion and is locked in a fierce competition for customers\u2019 attention with its better-known rival Alibaba.Mr. Liu is married to the Chinese internet celebrity Zhang Zetian, now 24, who is better known in China as Sister Milk Tea. Ms. Zhang rose to fame when, as a 16-year-old, a photo of her drinking tea in a high school classroom went viral along with a love letter addressed to her on social media.Jacqueline Williams reported from Sydney, Australia, and Paul Mozur from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Emerges as Clear No. 2 in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Thomas M. Siebel often faced skepticism when encouraging big companies to adopt internet-style cloud computing. Many companies, he said, had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers.Now his customers have a different concern: One cloud service isn\u2019t enough.And Mr. Siebel is adapting. After initially working closely with Amazon, a pioneer in cloud computing, C3 IoT now also has a technology and marketing partnership with Microsoft. And it is negotiating a similar agreement with Google.For a few years, it looked like Amazon would run away with the cloud computing business, piling up market share as it has with online shopping. But in the past couple of years, many companies have decided that they don\u2019t want to depend on Amazon alone, and are spreading out their business.That has helped Microsoft most of all. And the software giant has emerged as a strong No. 2 in the cloud market. Microsoft provided further evidence of its rise in the cloud business on Thursday, when it reported its most recent quarterly financial results.Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit, which supplies cloud-based computer processing and storage, and competes most directly with Amazon Web Services, grew by 89 percent over the same period a year ago. The company also reported strong growth in its other cloud offerings.Microsoft\u2019s profit increased 5 percent to $8.8 billion, or $1.13 a share. That was slightly above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.08 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters IBES.Revenue rose 17 percent to $30.09 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in June, higher than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $29.21 billion.The competition to supply the foundation layer of computing and software \u2014 the cloud-era equivalent of an operating system \u2014 is heated and costly. The biggest players, analysts estimate, are spending up to $10 billion a year on their global networks of data centers.This core cloud business is a $60 billion-a-year market, which grew by 50 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Synergy Research Group. In that fast-growing market, Amazon holds a 33 percent share, unchanged since the end of 2015. Over the same span, Microsoft\u2019s share climbed from 7 percent to 13 percent, and Google\u2019s doubled to 6 percent.John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, predicted that the cloud giants will get bigger and capture a steadily rising share of corporate technology spending \u2014 especially as they add new capabilities, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, to their services.\u201cThe information technology market is going to increasingly gravitate towards a small number of hyperscale cloud providers,\u201d Mr. Dinsdale said.In a recent research report on that market, Gartner identified three top-tier companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google. And it listed only three others, Alibaba, Oracle and IBM, as their competitors.\u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft at this stage,\u201d said Raj Bala, a Gartner analyst. \u201cGoogle is making headway, nipping at their heels, but it\u2019s still behind the leaders.\u201dFor Amazon and Google, cloud-computing services were a natural outgrowth of their original businesses \u2014 e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google. Both companies were born on the internet.Not so for Microsoft, which has made the most striking transition to the cloud. Its heritage, corporate wealth and industry dominance was based on selling packaged software and its Windows operating system for personal computers.Microsoft\u2019s later forays into new markets were typically late and hobbled by the company\u2019s Windows fixation. Its failed mobile operating system, for example, was widely criticized as a kludgy attempt to shoehorn Windows onto a smartphone.The company\u2019s path to cloud computing was lengthy and sometimes halting, even if the technical roots stretch back many years. Its MSN online service and Internet Explorer browser had their heydays in the 1990s. More recently, the company poured resources into its Bing search engine.In 2008, two years after Amazon entered the cloud market, a team of the Microsoft\u2019s brightest scientists set to work on a cloud project, code-named Red Dog. In 2010, Microsoft introduced its cloud service, but it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Before he became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive in 2014, Satya Nadella held senior roles in its cloud, online services and search businesses. Once he took over, Mr. Nadella accelerated investment in the cloud unit and focused Microsoft\u2019s sales teams on the business, analysts say.Unlike his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, Mr. Nadella\u2019s career was not steeped in Windows and the business model of packaged software. The traditional software business relied on product licenses with hefty payments up front rather than the pay-for-use subscriptions of the cloud world.\u201cTechnology was not really the obstacle for Microsoft, the problem was the business model,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cNadella has changed the strategy and the culture.\u201dAmazon holds some formidable advantages in the cloud market. It has the most customers \u2014 some spending more than $100 million a year \u2014 and more than 2,000 consulting partners to help companies use increasing amounts of Amazon cloud services. Many corporate technology managers see Amazon as the safe choice.But Microsoft has the advantage of being mainly a supplier of technology to businesses, unlike Amazon and Google. Its longstanding relationships with corporate customers, analysts say, are helping Microsoft gain ground as mainstream companies increasingly move to cloud technology. Microsoft has recently announced cloud deals with companies including Walmart, General Electric, Bayer, Starbucks and Campbell Soup.Microsoft\u2019s offerings have steadily improved, but even Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer for Azure, pointed to the company\u2019s roots in business as a driving force.\u201cThe relationships we have with companies, understanding their needs, is really helping with these migrations to our cloud,\u201d Mr. Russinovich said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Latest Hot E-Commerce Idea in China: The Bargain Bin", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Apple, Gucci, Tesla. Many Chinese shoppers love their top-shelf brands.But another big slice of the population goes gaga for a 40-cent pair of earrings, a $1.50 wireless smartphone charger and 50 rolls of toilet paper for $4.75.These are the shoppers on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app that drew close to 350 million customers in the past year, more than the entire population of the United States. Its parent company is expected to list shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, just three years into its existence.They live outside the country\u2019s prosperous megacities, in the cities, towns and hamlets that over a billion Chinese call home. They skew older, less internet savvy. And they absolutely cannot resist a bargain, even if the stuff they\u2019re buying isn\u2019t exactly top of the line.In the southern city of Foshan, Li Tianqiang and his wife sell rice noodles and other breakfast food out of a three-wheeled truck to hungry factory workers. Over the past two years, Mr. Li, 45, has bought nearly $1,000 worth of merchandise on Pinduoduo \u2014 the equivalent of around two months\u2019 income for him. Among his purchases: an inflatable paddle boat, a fishing bag and a cherry-red motorized car for his young daughter to drive around.Mr. Li knows he is a little addicted. And regretted purchases? He has a few.Some were made out of curiosity. In other cases, the items were of such lousy quality that he threw them out after they arrived. The toys he has bought for his daughter \u2014 including dolls, a violin and a keyboard \u2014 have been particularly bad, he said.It is all so inexpensive, though, that he said he didn\u2019t mind the occasional misfire.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really,\u201d he said of his spending on the app.For many years, China was a byword for shoddy goods produced at mass scale. But that is changing. Wages are rising, forcing manufacturers to compete on quality. Communist Party leaders want to nurture brands known globally for their innovations. Gadget makers such as Xiaomi and Huawei are investing heavily in design, chasing cool and cachet.To shop on Pinduoduo, however, is to be reminded that many Chinese consumers still check prices first, and that low-end suppliers remain a big part of the country\u2019s economy. The Pinduoduo app\u2019s main page is a bottomless cascade of groceries, fast fashion, household sundries and electronic bric-a-brac \u2014 all carrying wildly improbable price tags.A pair of stretchy, \u201cPlayboy\u201d-brand men\u2019s pants: less than $3. Eleven pounds of rice: $4. A four-pack of boxer briefs printed with an image of a wolf\u2019s head: $2. A purple water kettle with \u201cLOL\u201d written along the bottom: $3. A pink, around-the-neck smartphone stand that lets you lie down and watch videos at the same time: $1. A vibrating electric belt that goes around the midsection and supposedly helps shed fat: $6.Shipping is always free.Pinduoduo wants shoppers to involve their online friends in the process. Group orders receive discounts. New users who persuade others to sign up are rewarded with one of a selection of free purchases. Tiny pop-ups within the app provide relentless, real-time updates on what others are buying, creating a sense of urgency. Everyone is getting great deals and you are not.Between the deliriously strange product selection, the next-to-nothing prices, the barrage of coupons and deals, and the ease with which purchases are made, the experience feels less like shopping and more like playing a shopping video game. In regulatory filings, the company calls the app \u201ca combination of Costco and Disneyland.\u201dPinduoduo started operations only in 2015. The app is a platform for merchants to sell products: Sellers pay for their wares to be promoted on the app, and pay a fee for each sale. The company, which is based in Shanghai, has grown swiftly enough to attract powerful backers including the venture firm Sequoia Capital and the Chinese internet giant Tencent. It expects to raise $1.4 billion in this week\u2019s share offering. That would give the company a valuation of more than $20 billion.Because it offers so much cheap stuff, however, Pinduoduo is still way behind its rivals in the total value of goods sold. The company, which is unprofitable, said that its average shopper spent less than $90 on the platform last year. That translates into revenue per shopper of a dollar and change.\u201cThis is the lowest quality of traffic you can get,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. And if older people are driving Pinduoduo\u2019s popularity, Mr. Zhu added, then its prospects for long-term growth are grim by default.His own mother complained to him when two of the nine mangoes she had bought for $1.50 on the app turned up rotten, Mr. Huang told Caijing. Still, he said, she continued to use Pinduoduo. \u201cIf you can buy seven good mangoes for $1.50, you\u2019re not losing out,\u201d he said.For the most part, Kang Xia agrees. Ms. Kang, a 52-year-old retiree in the southwestern city of Chengdu, has used Pinduoduo to buy shoes, clothes, gadgets \u2014 \u201cquite a lot,\u201d she said, although the quality isn\u2019t always great.This spring, she got stung by two bad purchases. First, there was a $5 wardrobe with colorful fabric panels and a \u201creal wood\u201d frame. One touch was all she needed to realize the thing was no good. Then she bought a chiffon skirt with a floral pattern \u2014 less than $6, including a yellow T-shirt to wear with it \u2014 that arrived with a jagged tear down the side.Ms. Kang said she is now less likely to buy things on Pinduoduo solely because they are cheap. But she still looks at the app every day.For the established big shots of Chinese e-commerce, it is unwelcome news that many shoppers will buy very nearly anything if the price is right.To retain customers and avoid regulators\u2019 ire, Alibaba, which served more than 500 million buyers last year, has fought sales of fakes on its Taobao marketplace. The retailer JD.com, which had around 300 million buyers, has courted upmarket brands and cultivated a reputation for reliability.\u201cFrom time to time, there are new players, but the question is whether they can sustain themselves,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said at a recent event in San Francisco. \u201cWe are also climbing.\u201dTerry Yao lives in Dandong, a small city in China\u2019s northeast. After looking at some sneakers on Pinduoduo \u2014 pairs that should retail for more than $100 were going for a tiny fraction of that, he said \u2014 he made up his mind about the authenticity of the platform\u2019s products.\u201cChina has developed so much,\u201d said Mr. Yao, 28. \u201cBut if residents of these third- and fourth-tier cities can only use things like Pinduoduo, it feels to some degree like a big failure. We\u2019ve gone backward.\u201dBut Pinduoduo does not have to be stuck in the bargain bin forever, said Tian X. Hou, founder of T. H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. Now that it has used low prices to attract so many users, it can do as Alibaba did and go premium.\u201cOnce you have this trust, you can grow out of the current business and create a new business,\u201d Ms. Hou said.That might turn off the most fervent deal hunters. But it could raise Pinduoduo\u2019s profile among other consumers.Zhang Huajin, 34, a manager at a tech company in Guangzhou, bought an iPhone 7 Plus on Pinduoduo this month. Or he thought he did. What arrived was a smartphone, but it was not made by Apple.Mr. Zhang got his money back, though. And if Pinduoduo improves quality control and helps big brands sell directly on the app, he will probably buy from there again, he said.Taobao managed the transition, he said, and shoppers\u2019 expectations shifted accordingly. On Taobao, Mr. Zhang said, \u201ceverybody already knows what kinds of product should be sold at what price.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Wars? Three Funds Made Solid Profits Anyway", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter \u2014 as well as over the last five years \u2014 by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.\u201cSemiconductors are China\u2019s largest import, even more than oil,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies.\u201dMs. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances. GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.\u201cCancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., if you get cancer, you\u2019re likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time. In China, 65 percent of treatment is still chemotherapy.\u201dA challenge for an investor in emerging-market small caps is a dearth of the corporate disclosures and market regulation that developed-world investors take for granted. Ms. Hsiao said she compensated by sleuthing.\u201cI\u2019ll interview ex-bosses and ex-co-workers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I visit a factory, I always ask to see the defects. How do they define a defect? If a little scratch qualifies as a defect, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to cheat me on the numbers.\u201dMs. Hsiao\u2019s fund, which has a net expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 2.37 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. For the five years that ended June 30, it returned an annualized average of 14.78 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re usually overweight the U.S. because that\u2019s where the best intellectual property is,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cBut after the Trump victory, we went underweight because stocks went up so much, and emerging markets were in crisis.\u201dMr. Eiswert called himself a \u201ccareful contrarian\u201d about emerging markets and said he waited for crises to buy companies he liked.The fund\u2019s largest emerging-market bet \u2014 the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant \u2014 is also its largest holding. (Alibaba is based in China but has American depositary receipts that trade in the United States.)\u201cFacebook, Amazon, Google \u2014 there are elements of natural monopoly in those businesses,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s similar with Alibaba. And monopolies are good ways to make money.\u201d Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s holding company, Alphabet, are also top holdings.The fund has a heavy slug of technology stocks \u2014 about a third of its assets, compared with only a fifth for the typical world stock fund tracked by Morningstar. That allocation may reflect Mr. Eiswert\u2019s background: He spent about a decade as a tech analyst and tech fund manager for T. Rowe Price before taking his current post in 2012.How three of the better performers of the second quarter of 2018 fared against the market \u2014 and against their peer groups of funds.FIVE-YEAR RETURNSDFA Global Real EstateSecurities PortfolioT.

With video and audio streaming, companies like Netflix and Spotify can offer far cheaper alternatives than the cable TV and purchased music they\u2019re replacing.\u201cThe average American pays something like $125 month for cable,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cNetflix is $12 a month.\u201d That price difference has helped to spur the growth of Netflix, which is one of the fund\u2019s holdings.Mr. Eiswert\u2019s fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.84 percent, returned 3.06 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 16.48 percent over the last five years.It buys mainly real estate investment trusts but can also hold stakes in two of its sibling funds \u2014 DFA Real Estate Securities Portfolio and DFA International Real Estate Securities Portfolio.\u201cWe\u2019re in 22 countries around the world, both developed and emerging,\u201d said Joseph H. Chi, a fund manager and one of the leaders of portfolio management for Dimensional Fund Advisors, the fund\u2019s parent.The fund aims to give investors broad-based exposure to real estate. Dimensional doesn\u2019t make many real estate investments in its other stock mutual funds because many clients already have some exposure through vacation homes and rental properties, Mr. Chi said. Its separate real estate funds let them fine-tune their overall asset allocations.Mr. Chi said this fund didn\u2019t make bets on individual securities, gathering up promising ones and avoiding potential laggards, but rather held a broadly diversified basket of real estate investment trusts \u2014 nearly 450 in all. The holdings are generally weighted by market capitalization \u2014 the larger a REIT\u2019s market cap, the larger its place in the fund.Though the fund is actively managed, it focuses on minimizing costs and generally keeps turnover very low, recently about 2 percent.\u201cTurnover is expensive, so we\u2019re very cost sensitive about how we trade,\u201d Mr. Chi said.The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.24 percent, returned 5.36 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 7.43 percent over the last five years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Xiaomi\u2019s Offering May Not Spell Trouble for Other Chinese Unicorns", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo, why did it miss the mark?Xiaomi pitched itself to investors as more than a producer of commodity electronics. (Its hardware division achieved a margin of just 8.8 percent last year.) Instead, the company said it was pushing further into internet services, like online music and video, from which it generated a 60 percent margin in 2017.But according to the company\u2019s prospectus, those internet services accounted for just 8.6 percent of its revenue last year. Smartphones represented 70.3 percent of the total. Investors don\u2019t appear to believe that Xiaomi has yet made the leap from hardware company to internet giant.(One factor that probably wasn\u2019t responsible for Xiaomi\u2019s woes: the trade war between the United States and China. The company\u2019s biggest markets are India and China.)Analysts have speculated that this I.P.O. may pose problems for other Chinese tech titans\u2019 plans to go public. But that may not be the case. Here is DealBook\u2019s look at why the forthcoming market debuts of other Chinese technology companies could play out more smoothly.Once the financial arm of the Alibaba Group, the company is now a full-fledged behemoth in its own right. It operates Alipay, China\u2019s most dominant mobile payment app, and Yu\u2019e Bao, a giant money-market fund, cementing its centrality in its country\u2019s internet ecosystem.Tencent\u2019s music arm is a significant part of its parent company\u2019s empire. And it already has a lock on Chinese music listeners\u2019 ears: The business controls more than 70 percent of that country\u2019s market for music streaming, according to analysts at Citigroup.The company, which was founded in 2010, offers food delivery, Groupon-like discounts and more.

{"Headline": "Chinese Shopping App Pinduoduo Sued in U.S. Ahead of I.P.O.", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s hottest new online bazaar has had a whirlwind year. The number of people shopping on the app, Pinduoduo, has grown more than fivefold since the beginning of 2017, and its parent company is preparing to list shares on the Nasdaq, one of a wave of Chinese tech companies tapping international capital markets this year.But by taking its business global, Pinduoduo has exposed itself to a new kind of stumbling block: a trademark infringement lawsuit in the United States.The complaint, filed Thursday in a federal court in New York by a diaper maker called Daddy\u2019s Choice, says that Pinduoduo knowingly allowed the sale of knockoff products bearing the Daddy\u2019s Choice name. According to the suit, the e-commerce platform removed some of the unauthorized goods when Daddy\u2019s Choice, which is based in Beijing, first reported them last year. But the items quickly reappeared, and Pinduoduo took no action when notified of them again this year, the complaint says.Lawyers for Daddy\u2019s Choice say in the complaint that they filed the suit in New York because American consumers are able to buy from Pinduoduo, and because Daddy\u2019s Choice has spent considerably to build its brand in the United States. Pinduoduo declined to comment.China is the world\u2019s largest market for online retail, and giant companies and start-ups alike are competing to modernize the shopping experience. There are platforms catering to shoppers of every taste and persuasion, whether they want high-end imported wares or the latest in fast fashion. Heavyweights such as Alibaba and JD.com are experimenting with technologies such as facial recognition and drones to get people to buy more, and more often.Even by the standards of China\u2019s buzzy tech scene, Pinduoduo\u2019s rise (its name is pronounced \u201cPING-daw-daw\u201d) has been extraordinarily rapid.The three-year-old company says that nearly 350 million people shopped on its platform in the past year, which would most likely make it China\u2019s No. 2 e-commerce provider by that metric, behind only Alibaba. With its deep discounts on groceries, clothes, gadgets and knickknacks, the company has won over a vast, underserved population of online shoppers in China: older, less internet-savvy people living in smaller cities and the countryside.But Pinduoduo has been dogged by accusations that its platform hosts sales of counterfeits, illegal goods or products that simply do not match their descriptions online.In its filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Pinduoduo has said that it immediately removes unauthorized products or misleading information found on its platform, and that it freezes the accounts of merchants who violate its policies. Still, the company said in its regulatory filings that in January, the Chinese authorities required it to strengthen supervision and respond more effectively to claims of copyright infringement.Such allegations are hardly new in the world of Chinese e-commerce.Advertisement"}

But in the future, being an investor in the company will mean betting on the investment prowess of its founder, Masayoshi Son.If those deals go through, what will be left of the company is essentially a gigantic, publicly traded venture capital firm. Its holdings would include:\u25a0 A 27 percent stake in Alibaba Group, the Chinese internet behemoth.\u25a0 A 43 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.\u25a0 A stake in ARM, the British designer of computer chips.\u25a0 An investment in its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund, the much-ballyhooed tech investment vehicle that owns stakes in Uber and much more.It makes sense for SoftBank\u2019s stake to be valued at a discount: The entire investment can\u2019t be easily sold in one go. But the gap appears to be too steep, given all of its other assets.To solve the valuation gap, Mr. Son is doubling down on deal-making. By spinning out SoftBank\u2019s domestic telecom division, he is letting that business trade on its own merits. But he is also betting that investors in SoftBank believe in his continued ability to make savvy investments.Mr. Son\u2019s luck isn\u2019t guaranteed to continue. His Vision Fund is his vehicle for investing in technologies that he thinks will define the future, and it has bought big stakes in promising start-ups like Uber and the messaging service Slack.
