{"Headline": "Trump Has Yet to Award the National Arts Medals for 2016", "Date": "2018-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades the United States has recognized its greatest artists \u2014 about a dozen each year \u2014 with a national medal, an award created by Congress and typically distributed each year by the president at a White House ceremony.Since 1985, arts figures including Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Frank Capra and Ella Fitzgerald have received the National Medal of Arts while similar cultural achievement has been recognized by the National Humanities Medal, which presidents have awarded to the likes of Steven Spielberg, Anna Deavere Smith and Louise Gl\u00fcck.But neither of those medals has been awarded since President Trump took office, the longest gap ever and one that again draws attention to the president\u2019s often awkward relationship with the arts. The deadline for nominations for the 2016 arts medals, which have yet to be awarded, was in February 2017.The White House responded to questions about the medals by saying that planning is underway to distribute them as in years past. \u201cWe are currently evaluating candidates and will likely issue later this year,\u201d said Lindsay E. Walters, a White House spokeswoman.It does seem the delay may be simply a matter of an administrative backlog. The National Medal of Science, and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation have also not been awarded since 2016.But the holdup around the arts medals is notable because of President Trump\u2019s rocky relationship with the National Endowment for Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. His first proposed federal budget would have eliminated these agencies, which, in addition to promoting cultural programs, recommend candidates for the national medals to the president.The last White House ceremony to award the arts and humanities medals was held in September 2016 by President Obama, who distributed the 2015 medals at that event. In recent years, the medals have been given out in the latter half of the following year. But no ceremony was held in 2017.The agencies involved in nominating candidates for the arts, humanities, science and technology awards said in recent days that they either could not discuss the timing of the next award ceremony or referred questions to the White House.Certainly other presidents have dawdled a bit, too. President Obama, for example, went almost 17 months before awarding the 2012 medals in the arts and humanities in July 2013. But it has now been almost two years (22 months) since the last time the medals were awarded.Mary Anne Carter, the acting chairwoman of the N.E.A., noted that President Obama did not hold an awards ceremony in 2009, his first year in office, as evidence that a delay in distributing the medals is not unusual for an incoming administration. She declined to speculate on when the next awards might be announced.\u201cThe selection of recipients for the National Medal of Arts is, and always has been, a confidential process,\u201d she said in a statement.\u201cThe way that the arts and the humanities flourish in this country,\u201d Representative Lance said, \u201cis to make sure that we honor those distinguished citizens who have done so much either for the arts or the humanities.\u201dThe arts and humanities awards have traditionally been presented together at the White House ceremony. Mr. Lynch of Arts in America recalled with some excitement attending the first National Medal of Arts ceremony, more than 30 years ago. Ronald Reagan was president and the recipients included Martha Graham, Ralph Ellison and Lincoln Kirstein.\u201cThere was palpable excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important, I think, as I look back on 1985, not only for the arts in America and not only for those artists, but for the whole field, and it was exciting for the Reagans. You could see them presiding over it and actually enjoying it and soaking up the magic of the arts themselves.\u201dShe was upset with what she saw as the increasing inequality of wealth and influence in the United States and the consequent concentration of political power that it created.President Obama\u2019s concerns were more prosaic when he presented Mel Brooks with a National Medal for the Arts in 2016. Mr. Brooks drew laughs by pretending to stumble a bit from the weight of the medal as it was placed around his neck.Mr. Obama provided him with an additional caution. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you,\u201d he said, \u201cif you sell it on eBay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Delivers a Pile of Cash, but No Fireworks", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hold that champagne.Expectations for Amazon\u2019s second quarter were extremely high, and in some respects the company exceeded them when it released results on Thursday. But any hope that it would be the event that hurtled the company\u2019s valuation above the trillion-dollar mark will have to wait.Net sales increased 39 percent, to $52.9 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. Analysts predicted $53.37 billion. What\u2019s a $500 million miss from a highflier? Well, Facebook on Wednesday missed its estimates by about $200 million, on revenue that was a quarter of Amazon\u2019s, and the stock tumbled 19 percent.But Amazon leads a charmed life: Good results mean things are working out, and weak results mean it is investing so things will work out in the future.Net income for the quarter was impressive: $2.5 billion, or $5.07 per share, compared with $197 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2017. Analysts anticipated only about half that. Amazon has now been consistently profitable since early 2015, something a few analysts \u2014 and quite a few short-sellers, who were betting on the stock dropping \u2014 thought they would never see.\u201cA blowout quarter by virtually any measurement,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, Moody\u2019s lead retail analyst.The company\u2019s result eased some tech investor worries that Facebook\u2019s problems would spread elsewhere. Amazon fell $56, or about 3 percent, in regular trading Thursday \u2014 a minor blip in the stock\u2019s relentless march upward over the last decade. The company\u2019s results, posted after the markets closed, made up those losses plus a few dollars more in after-hours trading.Last week, both the power and the perils of Amazon were on vivid display. The company had its fourth-annual Prime Day, a made-up shopping holiday that is available only to Prime customers. It was so successful that the site crashed. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, estimated that Prime Day sales rose 33 percent from last year.But the sale was conducted against the backdrop of work stoppages in Europe that lasted as long as three days, one of the biggest labor actions in the company\u2019s history. The strikes, which happened in Germany, Poland and Spain, did not involve all the workers in those countries. In Spain, the police clashed with the strikers, resulting in at least one worker injury.Amazon responded with a statement saying it was \u201ca fair and responsible employer\u201d that was offering Europeans \u201cgood jobs with highly competitive pay, full benefits and innovative training programs.\u201dIn its announcement about its earnings, Amazon brought up the things it cares most about: its membership club, Prime; its market-leading cloud division, Amazon Web Services; and Alexa, the voice technology that powers the Echo devices people use in their homes.While Amazon gives few numbers on Alexa and Echo, the research firm eMarketer says 41 million people in the United States will use an Echo this year, up 31 percent over last year. Echo has about twice the market share of its closest competitor, Google Home.Amazon is so dominant in e-commerce that it barely needed to mention it in the earnings announcement. It controls exactly half of the online market in the United States. Its next competitors, including eBay and Walmart, own market shares mired in the single digits. Ebay, which bested Amazon in auctions long ago, has been struggling. It said it would lay off hundreds of employees this month.For years, Amazon has been on a hiring binge \u2014 world domination needs many hands. But in the second quarter, it slowed a bit, increasing only 12,000 from the first quarter. In 2017, employment grew 31,000 between the first and second quarters.Daniel Ives, head of technology research for GBH Insights, reaffirmed Thursday his $2,000 target for Amazon\u2019s shares, a price that would make it a trillion-dollar company.\u201cAfter the Facebook debacle last night,\u201d Mr. Ives wrote in a research note, \u201cwe believe the Street will be somewhat relieved to see Amazon deliver another strong quarter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(He has often been mistaken as a Pop artist; in fact, his art is far warmer than Pop\u2019s often fatalistic American scenes.) Mr. Thiebaud\u2019s drawings have been less celebrated, and this sweet show at the Morgan is the first devoted to his work in pen, charcoal and pastel.Some drawings served as preparatory works for paintings, and this show includes several engrossing sheets covered with seven to 10 drawings apiece, as Mr. Thiebaud varied the count of pie slices or the placement of lipsticks. Later he turned to cityscapes, which display the greatest amount of direct invention; the steep streets of San Francisco appear here as black-and-white roller coasters, as if M.C. Escher had taken a Bay Area sabbatical.Museum of Modern ArtOne of the best of them, and a fully-formed answer in its own right, is Mr. Fischli\u2019s own \u201cSnowman,\u201d a 2016 reprise of a piece he originally made in 1987 with his longtime collaborator David Weiss, who died in 2012. It lives inside a chunky gray freezer about the size and shape of a block of Carrara marble waiting to be carved into a masterpiece. This inconvenient machine, located outside in the brutal heat of a New York summer, is a reminder both of the outrageous expense of mounting any kind of art show and of art\u2019s own precariousness and fragility. Since it could theoretically preserve the snowman as long as there\u2019s an electric grid, it\u2019s also a model of the kind of immortality art can grant even the most ephemeral idea simply by freezing it in place.Bronx Museum of the ArtsQueens MuseumA few highlights include Mr. Chin\u2019s recent \u201cUnauthorized Collaboration\u201d series, in which he cut apart old portrait paintings found in antique stores or bought on eBay to reconfigure formal portraiture into objects that critique cultural authority. A wall installation from 2001 finds him remaking Gustave Courbet\u2019s notorious \u201cOrigin of the World\u201d (1865), a painting of a woman\u2019s genitalia and abdomen redrawn here with computer keyboard keys on which you can type your own message.Brooklyn MuseumThose landscapes form the backdrop for the show, but they don\u2019t occupy the foreground as much as one might expect. Many of the strongest works incorporate violence latently, as a suggestion or ever-present specter. It\u2019s there in Mara \u00c1lvares\u2019s photographs of nude body parts in nature and in Graciela Carnevale\u2019s locking guests into a gallery at an art opening. Anna Bella Geiger\u2019s re-creations of postcards of Brazil\u2019s Bororo Indians are funny, but they also highlight the exploitation of indigenous peoples. A performance by Sylvia Palacios Whitman, shot by Babette Mangolte, shows a group of performers suspended in a bundle like meat carcasses.The violence, when it does move toward center stage, is visceral and stunning. The corpse in the side-view mirror in a Diana Dowek painting sneaked up on and then winded me. Let\u00edcia Parente painstakingly sewing the words \u201cMade in Brazil\u201d into her foot made me cringe. I was awed before Sonia Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s Pop Art-style paintings of bound bodies. Yet for all the darkness, there\u2019s a welcome and important dose of levity too, from a hilarious video of a beauty products fair by Mar\u00eda Luisa Bemberg to Regina Vater\u2019s playful, costumed self-portrait photographs.Museum of Jewish Heritage\u201cLet the atrocious images haunt us,\u201d Susan Sontag once wrote.

{"Headline": "The Education of a Brotelier", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Weprin, 40, had taken the subway there from Manhattan, an experience that he seemed to regard as a kid would a carnival ride. (He stood the entire train ride despite all the empty seats, and excitedly gave a subway mariachi musician 10 bucks.) When he emerged from underground, he didn\u2019t have his bearings. He walked south. He pivoted. He walked north. He asked a security guard for directions. Then he found what he was looking for.As Instagram bait goes, it will be hard to beat the view from the roof bar \u2014 the entire East Side skyline of Manhattan. \u201cThe Graduate was just an idea, and now it\u2019s coming to life in New York City,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, adding, as he often does, a four-letter expletive. Then he spotted a hot dog truck, ambled over and ordered two, which he gulped down in one bun.Mr. Weprin is the founder and chief executive of AJ Capital Partners, the Chicago real estate company that is behind Graduate Hotels, a four-year-old chain of boutique hotels situated near college campuses and designed to cater to the nostalgia and local boosterism that are part of the culture of university towns. (Room keys are imprinted with the names of famous alumni, and public spaces are decorated with historical photos of campus life, vintage art and other collegiate artifacts.)\u201cThe cost of living is low, you have culture, you have commerce, and you have a youthful energy,\u201d said Mr. Weprin, who, with his confident manner and determinedly youthful look (that country singer cap seems to be a staple of his wardrobe) might well represent a new generation of hotel executive: the brotelier.He and his company are trying to create a brand that will find year-round business by catering to more than just alumni coming back for once-a-year football weekends or 10-year anniversaries of their graduating classes. Travel to college towns has increased in recent years thanks to more frequent visits by \u201chelicopter parents\u201d and the rise of the parent-child college tour. Mr. Weprin, who grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from the University of Tennessee, has even come up with a name for this growing niche: \u201cvisitcation.\u201dThere are 11 Graduate Hotels in locations like Ann Arbor, Mich.; Oxford, Miss.; Tempe, Ariz.; and Charlottesville, Va.; and nine more in construction or renovation phases, including in Nashville, New Haven and Palo Alto, Calif. In September, AJ Capital expects to close a $475 million fund-raising round, said Cooper Manning, a principal of AJ Capital and its head of investor relations. The company expects the portfolio to grow to 30 hotels or more. The company has $3 billion in assets.In 2014, Mr. Manning \u2014 whose brother Eli, the New York Giants quarterback, is one of Mr. Weprin\u2019s best friends \u2014 began to advise Mr. Weprin as he was developing the Graduate in Oxford, home of the University of Mississippi, the alma mater of the two Mannings and their father, Archie. The Manning family connected Mr. Weprin to locals and helped him get a feel for the Ole Miss vibe. Mr. Weprin named the roof bar the Coop.Mr. Weprin didn\u2019t start out to be a hotelier.\u201cLarry knew everyone,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. \u201cHe had a lot of influence and power, and a lot of swagger.\u201dAfter two years in Nashville, where he and a college friend started a business buying and renovating buildings, Mr. Weprin and his wife, Mary Ann, moved back to Chicago, and Mr. Weprin took a job overseeing Mr. Levy\u2019s real estate investments.Among the investments that were in his purview was Mr. Levy\u2019s interest in Auberge Resorts, which operated luxury hotels like the Esperanza Resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In the fall of 2008, as the economy was cratering, Mr. Levy told Mr. Weprin that he intended to sell his interest in Auberge. Mr. Weprin, a new father who was studying for an M.B.A. at Northwestern University, decided he wanted to buy it.Mr. Levy was encouraging, but reminded Mr. Weprin that he was going to have a hard time getting bank financing to buy a luxury hotel business when Wall Street was in a free fall. He gave him about 45 days to get the money.\u201cMy dermatologist from Dayton, Ohio, was probably our largest investor,\u201d Mr. Weprin said. (AJ Capital sold its interest in Auberge in 2016.)\u201cThat validated us because people thought we were nuts trying to be in luxury hotels at that time,\u201d Mr. Weprin said.The idea for the Graduate started a little closer to home. Mr. Weprin was walking in his Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park when he focused in on a shuttered, neglected Days Inn. The location had none of the traditional market drivers in its favor \u2014 it wasn\u2019t in the business or tourist district. But it was near Wrigley Field, DePaul University, and the homes of thousands of young professionals and families who might need a close-by place to put up visiting relatives, if not a cool local spot to grab a drink.The first branded Graduate Hotel, in Tempe near Arizona State University, opened in 2014. Next came Athens, Ga., and Madison, Wis.\u201cWe want people to wake up and have a sense of place, and it should be secondary that they\u2019re waking up at the Graduate Hotel,\u201d Mr. Alford said.These sort of details, and the overall business model, have impressed other successful hotel owners. Jonathan Tisch, the chairman and chief executive of Loews Hotels, met Mr. Weprin about six years ago, when Mr. Weprin was attending a Giants game with Eli Manning\u2019s wife, Abby. (The Tisch family owns the Giants.)The men, along with their wives, have become friends. (Mr. Tisch\u2019s wife, Lizzie, persuaded Mr. Weprin to include her student ID photo on a key card for the Graduate in Ann Arbor, putting her in the company of Gilda Radner, Iggy Pop and Desmond Howard.) But the two have a professional connection as well.\u201cI have tremendous respect for him for finding a market that was not necessarily being filled and, having been in the business for 35 years myself and knowing the challenges, for having the ability to react to the white space and create a brand,\u201d Mr. Tisch said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My 8-Month Search for $900 Sneakers", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperOrdinarily, this column has rules, an enclosed rhythm: visit store, take in its offerings, offer impressions. But this is not how most of my \u2014 or anyone\u2019s \u2014 actual shopping is done. It is a longitudinal, polyvalent process. It happens on the couch or on the phone as often as in a store. It is about chasing a specific thing as often as it is about the happenstance of discovery. And it is about failure. So much of shopping is about coming up short. By percentage, most of my time devoted to shopping is unsuccessful: styles that don\u2019t work, garments that don\u2019t fit well, wild goose chases.Since last fall, I\u2019ve been failing in spectacular, repeated, mortifying fashion in the pursuit of one particular item: Balenciaga Triple S sneakers, in the beige, green and yellow colorway.But all those disappointments made for an excellent case study on the way we shop today: the collapse between the luxury marketplace and street wear-inspired drops, the ways in which the perfect-information promise of internet commerce is a sham, how the hype cycle has become a series of unnavigable spikes and also a long arc all at once.They were released commercially late last summer. One night in September, I was driving on the Upper East Side \u2014 it happens! \u2014 and spotted them in the Balenciaga store window on Madison. A couple of weeks later I went back to get them.They were as heavy as small watermelons and as beautiful as Lalique vases. Each shoe was roughly the volume of my head. The floor pair happened to be my size, and I was surprised that when I tried them on, they didn\u2019t look unreasonably clunky. They had aerodynamic spirit. I looked like a K-pop star.It seems quaint now, in retrospect, to expect to saunter into the store, request my size, pay and leave. But fall 2017 was a simpler time in luxury sneakers.From that day, I remember mostly that the sales clerk was tall. With a blend of exuberance and pity, he told me no, the shoes were just for show. They\u2019d sold out. I left my number, hoping for a call. It never came.When I want something badly, it becomes an unbearable itch. When it involves solving an unsolvable puzzle, good sense goes out the window. I set useless Google alerts, called Balenciaga customer service a couple of times, searched Grailed, eBay and so on. No dice. By December, I got serious. I called every Balenciaga store in the country. Some snickered, some were helpful, some told me they already had \u201cpresold\u201d their restock orders. A couple had unspoken-for pairs, but not the colorways I wanted. Only one store, the SoHo location, said it was planning to restock and simply put them out on the floor.I stopped in with a friend to sniff around and struck up a conversation with a friendly young clerk named Maya who offered to reach out if my preferred colorway ever came back in stock, which it almost certainly would not.Still, a couple of weeks later, I got a text asking if I was interested in the all-black version of the shoe \u2014 a compromise, but not a terrible one. I headed over on a filthily rainy day to try them on. There were two options: one distressed and one more polished. I went with the more polished one because it felt more versatile, and because I thought that might answer the bell that had been ringing in my head for months.It did not. Contemplating the Triple S-size hole in my wardrobe became a daily habit. I bought a jacket that I believed would go great with the sneakers I feared I\u2019d never get. I griped about them on a podcast, maybe two. At a party one night in January, I saw Pusha-T wearing the Dover Street Market limited-edition Triple S in my size \u2014 you can read the size right on the toe box, one of the shoe\u2019s signature filigrees \u2014 and seriously considered asking to buy them from him when he was through wearing them.At a certain point, unable to sate my desire, and long past reason, I decided to investigate the world of bootlegs, in search of a fake that was extremely credible or extremely noncredible. For about six weeks in December and January, I emailed with the anonymous agents faithfully. They followed up on order updates, letting me know about items that were out of stock, or were slightly different than advertised. It was, up until that point, the most reliable and satisfying human exchange I\u2019d had on this whole quest.They arrived, three crushed shoe boxes in a heavily taped cardboard box covered in Chinese lettering. The sneakers themselves were made carelessly, with paint where it\u2019s not supposed to be and stitching that comes apart, but they make me laugh every time I look at them. I wore them to MoMA\u2019s bootleg party in January, and no one noticed.At around the same time, Balenciaga announced that it would be shifting production of the Triple S from Italy to China. When the 2.0 versions started trickling out, some changes were obvious: The Chinese remake is about a pound lighter per shoe and less distressed than the original. It is itself something of a bootleg.Though I was still pursuing the Italian originals, futilely sending several notes to one Grailed user who was selling the only pair in my size, I decided on full-scale assault to get a pair of the new versions. I set up some columns in Tweetdeck and began keeping tabs on the thriving underground system of bots and monitors that specialize in grabbing sneakers as soon as they are made available for sale online. I focused especially on the Twitter accounts @Bkantha1 and @BkanthaLinks (now @LINKSZN), which seemed to have the most austere approach, and set up tweet notifications for each account. A little later, I began following a guy who lives in Hong Kong, seemingly in his late 20s, who has a surfeit of cash, a penchant to vomit hashtags and a nascent interest in street wear. He would reliably retweet every tweet about a Triple S restock. I set an alert to receive notifications when he did.My phone quickly turned into an heavy-traffic orchestra, notifications dinging at all hours. More than once, I was rousted from sleep by an alarm, and I instinctually grabbed the phone and looked at the screen through mostly shut eyes to see if it was about the pair I was still craving. Many times I clicked through immediately, only to find that it was already sold out.Once, when I was up writing at around 4 a.m., an alert came through for a Barneys listing of the black and pink women\u2019s Triple S, and I snapped up the biggest available size, hoping they might fit. When they arrived, I tried them on, and they were like sausage casings. I was worried they\u2019d split if I ever had to run in them. I mournfully returned them.For a sneaker that\u2019s being aggressively bootlegged \u2014 and judging by the pictures on Russian and Chinese web stores, at a reasonably high level \u2014 this was a service I would have happily paid for. (It is free when you purchase.)In March, out of nowhere, someone accepted my totally reasonable, not outlandish bid. I was excited, but maybe a bit wary. A couple of days later, they arrived with a StockX tag dangling from the left shoe. They were beautiful, but they felt a bit too clean, and the stitching of the size number on the left toe box was slightly distressed. I held them up against the real ones I\u2019d bought at the SoHo store, and they were eerily similar. I searched YouTube for videos offering guidance on how to spot fake Triple S\u2019s \u2014 there are oodles for Yeezys and Jordans \u2014 but the only ones I could find appeared to have been made by bootleggers themselves. (Nice try!) I sat on them for a few weeks, slightly skeptical. Eventually, I sold them. And then, in early May, the deluge finally came. First, a random late-evening notification led to the exact pair I craved on the Saks Fifth Avenue website, which I ordered and which never came. The FedEx tracking page was a grueling taunt. At one point, on the day of alleged delivery, I went downstairs from my apartment to meet the FedEx truck, which turned out to be nothing more than a Budget rental truck with an ocean of boxes in the back and two extremely harried workers trying to sort through them, all of this at around 9 p.m. (I assumed that the package was stolen by an observant handler somewhere along the way. But after a couple of weeks in tracking purgatory, the package began moving south and ended up at the Saks store in Bal Harbour, Fla., the phone clerk who finally issued my refund \u2014 several weeks late \u2014 told me.)There was no prize for finally fulfilling this arduous task, no celebration. Suddenly, I had the shoes, and I was long, long over them. The months had taken their toll. At some point, my need to acquire had replaced raw aesthetic desire. It didn\u2019t help that in the public imagination, they were coveted, then memed, then played out, then strangely forgotten. There was a new generation of bulky sneakers, some even more absurd: the Dior Homme B22, the Versace Chain Reaction, the Guccis with the Sega font crisscrossed by bands of crystal.Also, now, nine months from when I first put a pair on my feet, only to be told they couldn\u2019t stay there, they were suddenly everywhere. They mocked me in the ads on my Instagram feed, and in the ones that trail me across the internet. Here we are! Easily available! I began to resent them, sitting in a box I\u2019d opened only once, on the day I picked them up from the store. One day last month, though, I was wearing something with a hint of bright green and I realized that I had the perfect sneakers to go with it. Lacing them up didn\u2019t provide quite the same thrill as when I pranced around the Upper East Side Balenciaga store. Instead, the satisfaction was something different, like wearing something you\u2019ve had for so long that it\u2019s become familiar, a foregone conclusion. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sacha Baron Cohen Is Duping Republicans. Is He the James O\u2019Keefe of the Left?", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019re referring to the newest series from Sacha Baron Cohen, a comedian known for foisting outlandish characters on unsuspecting victims.The show has been met with scorn from some corners, especially from some who were fooled like Ms. Palin, but others have taken the pranking in stride.\u201cWho Is America?\u201d has also prompted a conversation about the ethics of deception. And since Mr. Cohen\u2019s most biting sketches so far \u2014 including one about arming children with guns, and another on Sunday night that embarrassed a Georgia legislator \u2014 have been aimed at Republicans, more than a few people have called him a mirror version of Mr. O\u2019Keefe, who has delighted conservatives and infuriated liberals with his tactics.Mr. O\u2019Keefe himself has gleefully seized on the comparison.He said in an email, referring to the name of his operation, \u201cIt is hypocritical to deride Project Veritas\u2019s ethics using undercover techniques, and then gloss over the same exact tactic Cohen has repeatedly used to commercial success.\u201dHow similar are Mr. O\u2019Keefe and Mr. Cohen? We explore that question and more in our primer below.Christy Cones, of the Coast Gallery in Laguna Beach, Calif., sat down with Mr. Cohen as he played an ex-convict looking to start an art career. His \u201cart\u201d consisted of using body waste in prison to make portraits. At Mr. Cohen\u2019s urging, Ms. Cones did some, um, clipping to provide him some bodily materials for his brush.The highlight \u2014 or lowlight, depending on who is reacting \u2014 involved the Cohen character Col. Erran Morad, an Israeli \u201cantiterror expert\u201d who appears to be comfortable with growth hormones. He duped several politicians and gun rights activists into making public service announcements for an initiative that would arm children as young as 3. One, Philip Van Cleave, head of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, even taped an instructional video \u2014 complete with silly graphics \u2014 aimed to teach preschoolers to be \u201ckinderguardians.\u201dMr. Spencer, who had proposed a bill that would have banned Muslims from wearing veils in public, was fooled into taking part in what he believed was antiterrorism training. Mr. Cohen, playing the Morad character again, was able to persuade Mr. Spencer to shout a racial epithet repeatedly and drop his pants by telling him that doing so would help stop a terrorist attack. He also used a slur to refer to people from the Middle East.By Monday morning, leading Republicans in Georgia were distancing themselves from Mr. Spencer, and the speaker of the state House of Representatives urged him to resign.Others were less forgiving.In a statement last week, Mr. Spencer said that he was put in a \u201ckidnapping scenario\u201d and \u201crepeatedly asked to shout provocative language.\u201d He said Mr. Cohen had exploited his real fear of being attacked, as he had been receiving death threats over his proposed legislation. He also threatened legal action against Showtime \u2014 and said Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cdeceptive and fraudulent behavior is exactly why President Donald Trump was elected.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Spencer was more contrite, saying in a text message to The Washington Post: \u201cI apologize to my family, friends, and the people of my district for this ridiculously ugly episode.\u201d He was defeated in a primary election this year, and said on Monday that he would finish out the final five months of his term rather than resign.\u201cI sat through a long \u2018interview\u2019 full of Hollywoodism\u2019s disrespect and sarcasm \u2014 but finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohen\u2019s chagrin,\u201d Ms. Palin wrote.Mr. Rohrabacher and Mr. Walsh, of the \u201ckinderguardians\u201d segment, both described being approached by someone claiming to be from an Israeli television crew looking to interview supporters of Israel for a program about the 70th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding. Mr. Walsh provided emails to The Times that shed some light into Mr. Cohen\u2019s approach. Here\u2019s one:\u201cSubject: Media Request for Rep. Joe Walsh\u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201cMy name is Ashley and I am writing to you on behalf of First Liberty Pictures. We are currently producing a docu-style series that will air on the Israeli network YES and we\u2019d like to feature Rep. Joe Walsh as a \u201cFriend of Israel\u201d since he has consistently been a supporter for the security of the Israeli people. Our show\u2019s aim is to highlight the common security concerns that our countries share, learn from each other\u2019s perspective, and further illustrate the unshakeable bond between the U.S. and Israel.\u201cRep. Walsh understands that the post-9/11 security situation in the U.S. is similar to what Israel has faced since its creation, in the form of terrorist organizations like Hamas, the P.L.O., Hezbollah, and ISIS. He understands it\u2019s crucial that Americans are ready to defend themselves against radical Islamic extremists. Terrorism is no longer just in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem \u2026 it has spread to places like Orlando, San Bernardino, and Fort Hood, and it\u2019s threatening our shared values of freedom and democracy.\u201cFor the on camera appearance, he would meet with a gentleman from Israel who has seen the tactics used by these extremists up close and has developed unique anti-extremist techniques that very few in the world are privy to and he would like to share them with Rep. Walsh and our audience.\u201cWe\u2019d love to fly him out here to film with us in the L.A. area at the end of October or alternatively, we plan to be in the Washington D.C. area the first or second week of November. Would he be available then? Please let me know his level of interest in participating.\u201cLooking forward to speaking with you.\u201dMr. Walsh said in a phone interview that Mr. Cohen\u2019s team went as far as to charter a limousine for him, provide hair and makeup for the on-camera appearance, as well as present him with an actual award that lauded Mr. Walsh for \u201csignificant contributions to the state of Israel.\u201dIt depends on how you look at it, and like much in America today, the answer falls along party lines.Their tactics and aims are somewhat different. Mr. O\u2019Keefe often operates with undercover cameras, sending in people playing characters like a pregnant woman (to Planned Parenthood) or a prostitute (to Acorn), to try to entrap their workers into discussing improper or potentially illegal activities. His participants don\u2019t realize they are being filmed, which is not the case with Mr. Cohen\u2019s work.Mr. O\u2019Keefe also seems more interested in tearing down institutions than merely embarrassing them, as Mr. Koppel noted in a phone interview.\u201cOn the one hand, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as approving of what Mr. O\u2019Keefe has done but at least he\u2019s doing it for an ideological end,\u201d Mr. Koppel said. \u201cThere\u2019s a purpose to it other than getting a few giggles.\u201dMr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover assistants also tried to strike up conversations with several New York Times journalists (this reporter believes he was one). One employee who was secretly recorded criticizing President Trump is no longer at The Times.Both men have been criticized for using selective editing. Mr. O\u2019Keefe has been accused of making conversations appear more sinister than they really were. For Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201ckinderguardians\u201d sketch, Mr. Walsh said he was asked to read from a teleprompter a message in support of Israel, which ended with a few sentences about what he thought was an Israeli initiative to train children how to use firearms. Those few seconds were the only ones shown on camera. Mr. Rohrabacher, who is filmed saying that children ought to learn to defend themselves, noted that he had never actually discussed arming children. But the editing made it appear they supported training very young Americans to use firearms.\u201cThis was fraud, a sick fraud at that, and its intention was to deceive the American people for political purposes,\u201d Mr. Rohrabacher said in a statement, adding that he didn\u2019t actually support \u201ctraining toddlers in handling guns.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Walsh said it was a \u201cfair point\u201d to say that Mr. O\u2019Keefe engages in deceptive editing, much in the same way Mr. Walsh said Mr. Cohen has done.\u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of any of them,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. He added, \u201cThis is the world we live in right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Tried to Give Artists a Cut. But the Judges Said No.", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal appeals court has ruled that visual artists will no longer be entitled to royalties from resales of their work in California \u2014 a decision that may discourage other states from considering royalty laws.The ruling, issued on Friday, addressed a 1977 law, the California Resale Royalties Act, the only of its kind implemented in the United States. The law benefited visual artists, who, unlike composers, filmmakers or writers, do not receive a share of any future sales under copyright law. California residents selling work in or out of state, or others selling their work in California, were entitled to earn 5 percent of the price of any resale of their artwork over $1,000. (For deceased artists, royalties went to estates or heirs.)After a seven-year battle, prompted by class-action lawsuits, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco restricted the state law to resales occurring in 1977, on the grounds that the statute was pre-empted by the federal copyright law that went into effect on Jan. 1, 1978.On Friday, the court said that the state law conflicts with the federal copyright law\u2019s first-sale doctrine that claims once a copyright owner sells work a first time, they lose control over future sales.\u201cThis quixotic action, which was based on an obviously unconstitutional statute, is finally nearing its end,\u201d the auction house Sotheby\u2019s said in an email statement. Christie\u2019s said in a statement that it \u201cis pleased with the court\u2019s decision.\u201dRepresentatives for eBay did not respond to requests for comment.The court also remanded the 1977 claims to the district court. Ira Bibbero, a lawyer arguing for the artists, appeared to be looking on the bright side, saying he was pleased to fight for these artists and to enforce the act for that one-year span.\u201cIf they\u2019re starting out and something goes up for auction, I think they should get a piece of it,\u201d he said, though he added that royalties from auctions sometimes also just don\u2019t add up to much \u2014 he\u2019s made from a few hundred dollars to the $2,500 range.Under the state law, a seller was supposed to seek out the artist, but if the artist couldn\u2019t be traced, the seller was to give the royalties to the California Arts Council. That council then distributed them. .Up until 2012, when the council suspended the administration of the act because of litigation, a spokeswoman said, the organization helped to trace 555 artists or their heirs and distributed $256,144 to them since 1977. It kept $50,839 of royalties for those artists it could not trace.When contacted this week, the council could not provide information as to which public art projects this money funded.As for the application of the new ruling, Mr. Dill, one of the original plaintiffs, said he will not be pursuing royalties for any of his works sold in 1977.\u201cI personally am not going to delve into it, because it was a long time ago,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated a provision of the royalty law regarding a 90-day grace period. It was the seller who had 90 days to find the artist, not the California Arts Council.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dan Schulman of PayPal on Guns, Cash and Getting Punched", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeA New Jersey native whose mother took him to civil rights marches says companies and chief executives \u201chave a moral obligation to try to be a force for good.\u201dHe climbed to a senior executive role at AT&T before he was 40, jumped ship to work at Priceline when the travel website was still a start-up, then took Virgin Mobile USA from an idea to a business with five million subscribers. After stops at Sprint and American Express, Mr. Schulman joined PayPal in 2014, overseeing its split from eBay the next year. Since then, PayPal\u2019s stock has more than doubled, quieting doubters who wondered if the online payments company would be a sustainable business over the long term. He is also a regular practitioner of Krav Maga, the martial art system practiced by the Israeli military, and has the scars to prove it. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at PayPal\u2019s offices in New York. What was your childhood like? You started working for AT&T right out of school and wound up staying there for 18 years. What did you learn during that time? Early on in my career I had a family tragedy where my sister died, and I was leading a team at the time. That was a devastating time for me and my family. I had to take time off. I came back several months later and the team had just gelled together to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cover for Dan. We\u2019re going to do everything.\u201d And when I was presenting to the AT&T board about the accomplishments of this team, I couldn\u2019t take any credit because I deserved no credit. This idea of the power of giving credit to others \u2014 as opposed to your own individual accomplishment \u2014 has shaped my entire career. Most people don\u2019t really think about that. They mostly think, \u201cLook at me.\u201d But really if you say, \u201cLook at what others are accomplishing,\u201d it\u2019s so much more powerful in terms of your ability to attract the best people, to get things done.You left AT&T for Priceline when it was just a start-up. That was a big risk. Why not just stay at AT&T?I was president of the consumer division at age 39 or so. But my view was not so much that leaving was a risk. I actually thought it\u2019s more risky to stand still. There\u2019s a philosophy in martial arts which is, \u201cNever stand still.\u201d Standing still is asking to be hit. You always have to be willing to take some risks going forward. You can\u2019t stand still. I have this advice that I give to people I mentor. I always say, \u201cDon\u2019t overthink your next step, because none of us know where we\u2019re going to be 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\u201d One step leads to another. What changes have you made to PayPal\u2019s organizational structure as C.E.O.?I\u2019ve taken my team from 21 direct reports to eight direct reports. To me, a great team is one that discusses all of the issues. When you have 21 people, it\u2019s not a discussion; it\u2019s a presentation. There\u2019s no way that 21 voices can be heard around a table. It\u2019s a cacophony of voices. The smaller the team is, the more you can discuss issues in depth and detail, and there becomes a trust among the team. If you\u2019re going to have a consistent set of values that you stand up for, they have to be reflected in your acceptable use policy. Around the violence in Charlottesville, we identified a number of groups that espouse hate or violence, and we don\u2019t allow them to use PayPal to fund-raise. And we do not allow PayPal to be used for guns and ammunition. That there are rules and regulations in terms of background checks is extraordinarily important. But if somebody is going to do something online, we can\u2019t fully vouch for those background checks. And so therefore we just outlaw it. It\u2019s not always comfortable for C.E.O.s to take a stand on these issues. How do you decide where to draw that line?Companies, and by extension their management teams and their C.E.O.s, have a moral obligation to try to be a force for good. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that we can shirk that responsibility, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to fully stand away from the culture wars around us. You have to take a stand. That stand shouldn\u2019t be a political one. But it should be one that is based on your values and your mission. You practice martial arts, right?I practice Krav Maga. I spent some time in Israel when I was young, and they have what\u2019s called Youth Military Training there, so I started then. That was when I was in my teens, and I\u2019ve been doing Krav since then.Have you ever gotten hurt?But the overrunning philosophy of Krav is that the best way to win a fight is to not get into a fight. It's very Zen in that way. How do you de-escalate situations? We spend a lot of time thinking about that. It's translated into the way that I think about business as well. When we started partnering with Visa and Mastercard and JPMorgan Chase and Citi, nobody ever thought that PayPal would be allies with those companies. That would always be an uneasy friend relationship. But my view is, \u201cHow do you give customers the choice they want, and how do you avoid fights that you don\u2019t necessarily need to be in?\u201d And it was maybe one of the key things that catapulted PayPal\u2019s success in recent years.A reader on Twitter, Kyle Rosenbaum, asked about India\u2019s effort to ban cash. Do you think we\u2019ll see more countries doing that in the future? There are two mega-trends happening right now in the financial services industry. One: You\u2019re seeing the digitization of payments. People are moving away from checks. People are slowly but surely moving away from cash. That\u2019s driven by the other big trend, which is the explosion of smartphones. In smartphones, you have all of the power of a bank branch in the palm of your hand. You can do basic transactions at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time that it took you before. That can enable so many of these underserved populations to come into the mainstream as well and do things that perhaps you and I take for granted, and it can actually make a real difference in their lives. The demonetization in India is one of the most audacious and bold experiments that a government has done. India is one of the last places you would think that would try to get rid of cash, but there's a huge issue that goes on. There's a huge amount of graft and corruption. But if the government can directly send that money to you electronically, right into a digital account or a bank account, that could be incredibly impactful in that country. Whether it fully works or not, it is a harbinger of things to come.What do you still use cash for?I don\u2019t use a lot of cash right now. Things that I used to use cash for, like paying babysitters, now everybody has Venmo and it\u2019s simpler and easier. Some people feel that cash is a more anonymous form of payment, and I would never predict the death of cash over the next decade or two. I think cash is going to be with us for a long time to come. But there is a clear trend toward digitization. It\u2019s just a more efficient, time-efficient, cost-efficient way to managing your money.Advertisement"}

Your first thought might be: what an honor!But being a bridesmaid is often very expensive, so before accepting this position it might be prudent to check your savings account. It\u2019s difficult to say no once the process begins.One of the biggest expenses is the dress.Some brides include their bridal party in the dress decision, giving their attendants some say in the cost and the look. Other brides decide on their own what the women (or men) in their entourage will wear.Before Nicole Levinson was married May 26 in an outdoor ceremony in Garrison, N.Y., she took her mother and the maid of honor shopping at Bella Bridesmaid in Manhattan to choose dresses for her four bridesmaids. (Each dress ended up costing $270 before alternations.)\u201cI thought a lot about the cost,\u201d Ms. Levinson said. \u201cThe dresses I chose were expensive, and I let the women know in advance that they would be expensive. They were understanding.\u201dOnly one woman voiced concern about money, so Ms. Levinson was happy to help her pay.\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to be uncomfortable,\u201d she said. The alterations were another $210, Ms. Levinson said, adding, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty terrible and I plan to send a check to my friend to help with that.\u201dSome brides choose a color palette and tell their bridesmaids to buy whatever dress they like in those hues.Tej Toor\u2019s wedding was June 30 in Norfolk, Va. Her bridal party included four women and three men. For the women, the bride chose a color scheme of red, pink and peach and asked each of them to find a long dress they like in one of those colors, leaving the cost and style up to them. The men were in black tuxedos with boutonnieres in the wedding colors.One of Ms. Toor\u2019s bridesmaids, Shannon Koggin, who is traveling to the wedding from San Francisco, seemed happy to be able to choose her own dress. She said that all the women in Ms. Toor\u2019s party had a text thread to discuss the dresses. The budget, she said, was \u201cup to each of us and we can choose outfits we\u2019ll wear again.\u201d(Ms. Toor, the bride, said she sold the last bridesmaid dress she wore on eBay.)Michelle Cordova is planning for a Sept. 1 wedding; she\u2019ll have five bridesmaids.She works in the bridal industry and was lucky. She won dresses she loved in a raffle held at a dress manufacturer\u2019s party, and she was allowed to choose the color from an online chart. The dresses arrived, she loved them, but the color was different in person than on the chart. She wanted burgundy but got red. She used them anyway.Having been in friends\u2019 bridal parties, and having spent down her savings doing so, Ms. Cordova said she did think a lot about the cost to the women she invited to be her bridesmaids.\u201cWe all expect to spend $1,000-plus on the bachelorette party, $100-$125 on the shower gift, and $350 on the wedding present,\u201d she said.Because Ms. Cordova won the dresses they were free, but the alterations can be pricey. \u201cOne friend went to a local tailor and still spent $200.\u201d she said. \u201cShe was furious.\u201dThere are options for finding inexpensive dresses.

{"Headline": "New York City Considers New Pay Rules for Uber Drivers", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City regulators are moving toward significantly raising wages for drivers for Uber and other ride-hailing apps. The step would make New York the first major American city to establish pay rules to grapple with the upheaval caused by ride-hailingcompanies that has decimated the yellow cab industry and left many drivers in financial ruin.\u201cTheir low pay has persisted despite the rapid growth of the industry,\u201d the study said.If a driver\u2019s earnings fall below $17.22 per hour over the course of a week, the companies would be required to make up the difference. The study suggested the companies could absorb this cost partly by lowering their commissions, which range from about 10 to 25 percent of passenger fares on average. The median net hourly earnings in the industry were about $14.25, the study found.The taxi commission has the power to adopt the rules without the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio or the City Council, but the mayor said he prefers to address the driver pay problem through the City Council.The New York pay rules would apply to four major car service apps \u2014 Uber, Lyft, Via and Juno \u2014 all of which provide more than 10,000 trips each day in New York.\u201cThis is an important step in addressing one of the many pressing challenges that face the for-hire and taxi industries today,\u201d said the taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi.Uber said on Monday that it had major concerns over the proposal. Alix Anfang, a spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company worried that it would hurt \u201criders through substantially increased prices and reduced service.\u201dThe study is a rare glimpse inside New York City\u2019s booming ride-hail industry. It found that about 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps. Some drivers bought vehicles, enticed by claims that they could make as much as $5,000 during their first month of driving, and now feel trapped.New York City is considering a broader series of regulations for Uber, including a cap on vehicles, as debate has intensified not only over pay but about worsening traffic from the flood of for-hire cars.The city\u2019s taxi commission hired two independent economists to study its pay proposal, which has not yet been formally introduced. Ms. Joshi, who has said she wants wages to be raised, said the findings would inform the new policies being considered by her commission and the City Council. Though the commission can adopt the rules on its own, Ms. Joshi was appointed by Mr. de Blasio and is likely to defer to him.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office said the city wouldn\u2019t \u201cmove in any direction until we review the report and the mayor makes a decision\u201d but that the mayor supported a \u201ccomprehensive package\u201d to address the challenges facing the taxi and for-hire vehicle industry.A minimum wage of $17.22 an hour after expenses would increase driver earnings by about 22.5 percent on average, or $6,345 per year, for those who would get increases under the proposal, according to the study by the independent economists. The proposal aims to bring pay in line with the $15 minimum wage that the state is moving toward while considering the challenges the drivers face as independent contractors. The study\u2019s findings and recommendations did not focus on yellow cabdrivers.In New York, the taxi commission sets rules for taxis and private companies that offer for-hire rides. In the past, the commission has approved regulations to establish a lease cap on what taxi garages can charge drivers and to require companies like Uber to offer more wheelchair accessible vehicles.Some drivers would still make substantially less than $17.22 per hour because their expenses are much higher than the allowance.Behind the proposed hourly minimum wage is a sophisticated arrangement designed to make the entire app-based system more efficient. Its centerpiece is an incentive for the app companies to increase their so-called utilization rates \u2014 that is, the portion of each hour in which drivers are ferrying a passenger.The authors say this incentive would address a key inefficiency of the current system, which is that companies like Uber and Lyft lure too many drivers onto the road as a way to lower wait times for passengers. This oversupply depresses wages, since drivers can only earn money when they have a passenger in their car.The study, which relied primarily on data collected from the companies by the taxi commission, was written by Dr. James Parrott, of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School and Professor Michael Reich, of the University of California at Berkeley.Zubin Soleimany, a lawyer for the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that supports professional drivers, criticized the proposal for accepting the general pay structure of the app industry, which, he said, has created a race to the bottom that hurts both app drivers and taxi drivers. His group prefers requiring the apps to charge the regulated taxi fare at a minimum, and giving drivers a guaranteed percentage of that fare.The Independent Drivers Guild, another group that represents drivers, had a more positive reaction, saying that establishing a minimum pay rate was the most important step to help drivers.The proposal has at least two potentially significant flaws. Mr. Soleimany pointed out that app drivers could end up having to work harder over time for the same amount of money. As drivers work a greater portion of each hour, the amounts they earn per-mile and per-minute fall, leaving them potentially no better off financially.But in an interview, Mr. Reich said his calculations showed that the utilization rate \u2014 the measure of busyness \u2014 was only likely to increase by a few percentage points, meaning drivers would be working only somewhat harder (about 2.5 minutes per hour on average in a plausible scenario) for significantly more pay (about 22.5 percent more per hour on average).\u201cWe think they\u2019ll see this as a good deal,\u201d Mr. Reich said.A second problem is the potential for gaming the new system. Because drivers must be paid $17.22 per hour regardless of whether or not they earn that amount by transporting passengers, they could choose to simply decline rides and collect the minimum wage while remaining idle.Mr. Reich said the app companies are able to identify app drivers who decline too many rides. But the companies are loath to penalize drivers, whom they classify as contractors, for declining rides because that would imply an employment relationship.The findings in the taxi commission study are roughly in line with that figure after adjusting for the pay scale in New York City, where wages are about 25 percent higher than the national average.In New York City, Uber\u2019s annual revenue from passenger fares is about $2 billion, according to the study\u2019s estimate. The company keeps about $375 million in commissions and fees. Its operating costs are an estimated $50 million each year.That kind of markup, the authors concluded, was higher than almost any other similar marketplace \u2014 higher than Amazon, which must carry large inventories of goods and shoulder greater labor costs, and much higher than companies like eBay and Etsy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Here\u2019s What\u2019s Been Different About Fires This Year", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The huge wildfires across California in recent weeks have underlined what fire experts describe as the new normal for the state. But firefighters say it\u2019s more than just the scale and the timing of the fires that is different.Chris Anthony, a division chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says fire behavior appears to be changing on a more micro level. One example: In mountainous terrain, fires typically run much faster uphill as the fire heats the fuels above it, making them more readily combustible.Another example: Firefighters for decades were accustomed to seeing fires slow down considerably at night, said Scott L. Stephens, a professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley. But a number of recent fires have continued to advance rapidly through the night.\u201cMany times now in the evening fires are burning at night almost as active as they are in the day,\u201d Professor Stephens said. \u201cThings are happening here in California that 10 years ago I never heard about.\u201dCraig Clements, a meteorologist at San Jose State University who specializes in the behavior of wildfires, says experts are still trying to quantify and confirm changes in fire behavior.It\u2019s certain that California is seeing much larger fires, he said, and much of that is connected to drier conditions. One of his students has investigated what are known as nocturnal drying events \u2014 when very dry air coming off the Pacific Ocean leaves higher altitudes desiccated.\u201cIt\u2019s most cool and foggy down in the Bay,\u201d he said of the San Francisco Bay. \u201cYou have a sea breeze coming in. But above the sea breeze some of the driest air in North America is coming in. Up in the hills it\u2019s super dry.\u201dChanges in fire behavior have consequences both for firefighters and for people who live near open spaces, said Mr. Anthony, the Cal Fire division chief.\u201cWhat we thought was normal or average isn\u2019t normal anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to change our thinking.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Now that the Chargers are settled in Los Angeles, Boltman has apparently run out of wattage.\u201cIt has been a great ride and experience for me as I played the role of the mascot character Boltman for over 22 years,\u201d Mr. Jauregui\u2019s statement said, according to The Union-Tribune. \u201cBut the time has now come for me to pass the baton to a true Chargers fan in Los Angeles or San Diego or perhaps even to the Los Angeles Chargers.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "In the Hudson Valley, a Home With Centuries\u2019 Worth of Stories", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byon locationFor a designer and an actor with a modern house in California, a second home had to be the exact opposite: a stone farmhouse with a sense of history.14 PhotosMost of the time, Jeffrey Doornbos and Caroline Diani live in a breezy, low-slung 1950s house in Santa Barbara, Calif. So when they began looking for a second home on the East Coast, they wanted something entirely different \u2014 a creaky stone farmhouse with a weighty sense of history. Ms. Diani, 44, an interior designer and owner of the Diani fashion and lifestyle boutiques in Santa Barbara, grew up in a stone farmhouse in England and wanted something that offered the charm and seasonal changes she experienced as a child. Mr. Doornbos, 50, an actor and writer who grew up in Michigan before spending his early adulthood in New York, where he was a performer and director with Blue Man Group, was captivated by the idea of owning a home that came with centuries\u2019 worth of stories. And because they both travel frequently to New York for work, they wanted a house within commuting distance of Manhattan. But that didn\u2019t stop them from nearly buying one that was all wrong: a former tavern in Cazenovia, N.Y., built in the early 19th century, which was more than a four-hour drive from the city, with expansive grounds that were impractical for part-time residents. \u201cWe fell in love with it, it was in our price range, but it had 114 acres, needed work and was clearly not commutable to the city,\u201d Ms. Diani said. \u201cSo we walked away.\u201d Back in Santa Barbara, heartbroken, Ms. Diani redoubled her efforts. \u201cI was feverishly Googling for old stone farmhouses\u201d within easy reach of New York, she said, when she found a new listing for just such a place, built in 1752 in Germantown, N.Y.Mr. Doornbos, who had been out with friends, remembered what happened next: \u201cI came home and she said, \u2018Look what I just found.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, we should call the realtor tomorrow.\u2019\u201dMs. Diani was way ahead of him. She hadn\u2019t just called the listing agent \u2014 she had already booked their flights. \u201cThat\u2019s very typically Caroline,\u201d Mr. Doornbos said. When they arrived, they found a 2,700-square-foot stone-and-brick house with three bedrooms and two bathrooms; enormous exposed chestnut beams; floorboards as wide as 16 inches; early doors, wood paneling and windows; and two yawning wood-burning fireplaces. Outside, there were two barns sitting on six acres. \u201cWe kept saying, \u2018How is this all still here?\u2019 Because over time there\u2019s so much that can go horribly wrong, aesthetically,\u201d Ms. Diani said. \u201cIt had been in the right hands all the way along.\u201d It immediately felt right, Mr. Doornbos said: \u201cWe were standing out in the garden and Caroline asked, \u2018Do you love it?\u2019 I said, \u2018It feels like we never left.\u2019\u201dThey bought the house for about $475,000 in April 2016. The previous owner had lovingly maintained it, but there were still a few quirks. Then there was the dining room, part of which was built into the side of a hill. \u201cWe were getting puddles of water in there every time it snowed or rained,\u201d Ms. Diani said. The couple hired contractors to break up the concrete floor with jackhammers and install French drains beneath a new floor with a radiant heating system, which banished the indoor stream. But by tackling smaller jobs themselves, including rebuilding the existing kitchen cabinets and removing later additions, like a wall in the kitchen and a built-in bookcase in one of the bedrooms, they kept costs down to about $50,000. When it comes to furniture, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of mixing it up\u201d \u2014 although they are committed to preserving the home\u2019s original architectural details. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve been entrusted with this house,\u201d Mr. Doornbos said, \u201cand shepherding it, I hope, through several more decades.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the door was to Jack Kerouac\u2019s room, $37,500. For Bob Dylan\u2019s door, a whopping $125,000.How about a dilapidated house that a 1950s civil rights activist spent time in? At least $1 million.Most people would abandon items like these. But for others, the response is different: Cherish it the way someone else might prize a Picasso or a Renoir.At a time when information on even the most obscure objects can be easily found on the internet and hobbyists across the world can connect online, some of that junk might actually become treasure.\u201cThere\u2019s barely a day that goes by that people aren\u2019t presenting interesting collections to us,\u201d said Arlan Ettinger, president and chief executive of Guernsey\u2019s, an auction house that has staked its reputation on nontraditional objects. \u201cWill it resonate with the public? That\u2019s the answer to whether we go forward and sell it at auction.\u201dObscure historical items present all sorts of questions that a piece of fine art with an established provenance and an auction history does not. For one, if the names attached to them are not immediately recognizable, their inherent value could be in doubt. And the future value of an item can be unpredictable.At auction, the doors \u2014 all heavily chipped, battered and marked with X\u2019s to signify demolition \u2014 brought in prices higher than the nicest new door.The door to a room where Janis Joplin and Leonard Cohen spent a night together brought in $106,250. Andy Warhol\u2019s door went for $65,225, and the door to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s room fetched $16,250. Joni Mitchell\u2019s door was a relative bargain at $10,000.\u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to odd things,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said. \u201cI bought them mostly as energy.\u201dWhether discarded items will have any value to someone else is hard to predict. And some psychologists question whether someone junk could have any real value.\u201cHolding on to junk with the hope of spectacular appreciation is the equivalent to buying a lottery ticket that won\u2019t be drawn for 50 years,\u201d said Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist in Hawaii. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of extremely high-odds gambling that requires a storage unit and lots of patience.\u201dFor some, he added, it may be a sign of hoarding. \u201cShows like the \u2018Antiques Roadshow\u2019 give a false impression of the value of old junk,\u201d Dr. Klontz said.Several decades ago, hand-carved wooden carousel animals were being discarded as the carousels were replaced with more modern rides. In the early 1980s, Guernsey\u2019s organized an auction of about 90 carousel animals that one man had collected over the years. He needed to sell them to pay for medical care for his daughter and hoped to get $30,000, Mr. Ettinger said.The auction brought in more than $1 million. Today, a single horse can sell for more than $100,000 if it was made by a famous carver like Daniel Muller, who operated a carousel company with his brother in the early 20th century.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth very much today,\u201d Mr. Ettinger said. \u201cWhat made it noteworthy is no longer the case.\u201dBut sports memorabilia is still a lure for fans. Brandon Steiner, chief executive of Steiner Sports, which specializes in collectibles, sold off as much of the old Yankee Stadium as possible. Seats and signs, for sure, but also bricks, dirt and even grass from the field.\u201cI knew with the grass that people would love to have a piece from the last game,\u201d Mr. Steiner said. \u201cI made over $1 million selling that grass.\u201dHe did well with the dirt, too, which he included in pictures, frames, coasters, pens and other collectibles at prices that ranged from $25 to more than $1,000.Yet when asked about what they might be worth in the future, he demurred. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying that type of stuff thinking it\u2019s going to go up in value and you\u2019re going to make a lot of money, you\u2019re going about it the wrong way,\u201d he said.Such fleeting connections to value make it hard to determine what might appreciate and what is basically a nice ornament, like a chandelier or a sink faucet that may cost a lot but has little intrinsic value.Carousel horses have certainly gone up in value. They are even appreciated by museums for their artistry and craftsmanship.The doors from the Chelsea Hotel lack any craftsmanship; their value is tied to the reputations of the people who once slept behind them. But those associations with fame, like Mr. McGwire\u2019s baseball, could rise and fall.Of course, some stuff that seems like junk really is. Amanda Chunn, senior researcher and curator at M. S. Rau Antiques, a New Orleans shop known for odd finds, said she gets calls every week from people asking about the value of their Beanie Baby, Coca-Cola bottle or McDonald\u2019s toy collections.She has to tell them that they really have none, at least not from an investment point. She suggests that they try to sell them on eBay.\u201cIt\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a market for vintage Americana,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not on the high end.\u201dEven at that high end, there are not that many buyers for pieces that others might consider junk. Take 92 feet of ticker tape, the spools of paper that used to deliver breaking news from around the world to newsrooms. It was usually discarded after being read, but M. S. Rau has tape from D-Day, when Allied troops invaded Normandy on June 6, 1944. It begins at 8 a.m. and ends at 4:35 p.m., Ms. Chunn said.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what newspaper it\u2019s from, but someone had the wherewithal to keep it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reads like a novella.\u201dIt\u2019s priced at $38,000, but it has been up for sale since 2015.Equally obsolete, but a quick seller, are old metal machines that individuals used to cork wine bottles, Ms. Chunn said. One in the store is priced at $12,850.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to use it, but you know it\u2019s going to work in someone\u2019s d\u00e9cor,\u201d she said.There is profit to be made in the quest to buy and collect stuff that others might discard. Larry Moss, who owns Interstate Blood Bank in Memphis, has amassed thousands of items. These include signed dollar bills, canceled checks with presidential autographs on them, and a lot of Elvis Presley memorabilia.In his quest for ephemera, he did buy a couple of truly valuable pieces, which came in handy when his business was struggling in the late 1990s.The items were the white suit that Presley wore in his 1968 comeback television special and the white Knabe piano he played at Graceland but moved out when his wife, Priscilla, gave him a gold-leaf piano.\u201cI worked for a year and a half without a salary, and I sold those two items and supported by family,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cThere was a time when things weren\u2019t great, and Elvis helped me out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
