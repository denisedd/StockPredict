{"Headline": "In Our \u2018Winner-Take-Most\u2019 Economy, the Wealth Is Not Spreading", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLabor\u2019s share of the pie is still crumbs. Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. They go on:Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor \u2014 known among economists as \u201clabor share\u201d \u2014 coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to \u201ctemporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.\u201dThe outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the \u201cfissuring of the workplace\u201d that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account \u201cfor a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.\u201dThe steady erosion of workers\u2019 bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors.\u201cThe Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,\u201d Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court\u2019s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June\u2019s Janus decision, and the Court\u2019s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses.The authors document increasing market concentration:From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues.Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile \u201cgrew 160 percent\u201d while firms \u201cin 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.\u201dWhat economists\u2019 technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people.The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: \u201cConcentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent \u2014 monopsony \u2014 that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.\u201d Firms dominating concentrated labor markets \u201cface relatively inelastic labor supply\u201d (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to \u201creduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.\u201dReduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor\u2019s share of income has fallen.Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart.Labor\u2019s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted.115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:97.17INDEXED TO 2009 = 100\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:INDEXED TO 2009 = 10097.17\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector.In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share.Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: \u201cResults show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.\u201dWhat does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back:Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening:1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it).2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits.3. A general increase in profits.Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately becausewithout any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits.Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profitsaffects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households \u2014 which live on wage/salary income \u2014 and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments.This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate.The growing importance of digital innovation \u2014 new products and processes based on software code and data \u2014 has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter\u2019s vision, digital innovation gives rise to \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, \u201caccrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.\u201dHow much money are we talking about?The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity \u2014 from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies.In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent.While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years.$22.80Tax bill enactedJUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80Tax bill enacted$22.80JUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars.Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we\u2019ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover.That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations \u2014 amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections \u2014 is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates\u2019 probability of victory.These improvements, in turn, \u201clower uncertainty about an election\u2019s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.\u201dThe effect, then, is thatwhen one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most.Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others \u2014 a majority of them men \u2014 have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them.How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cisco Chief Executive\u2019s New Mantra: Simplify Computer Networks", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Over more than three decades, Cisco Systems became a Silicon Valley giant partly because of one facet of its business: technological complexity.Managing Cisco\u2019s many varieties of networking equipment, which help computers exchange data, became such a convoluted process over time that customers who learned to do so became loath to try competing products.\u201cThe networks that we build we\u2019re going to have to think about fundamentally differently,\u201d Mr. Robbins, 52, told attendees.New Cisco offerings that are based on Mr. Robbins\u2019s streamlining strategy seem to be selling well, reversing years of revenue stagnation for the company\u2019s core business. Since 2015, Cisco\u2019s market capitalization has risen by more than 50 percent to around $200 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s now getting better understood by investors that Cisco is not an incumbent being killed by the cloud,\u201d said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research.Cisco\u2019s momentum is representative of how some older technology giants are finding ways to survive vast changes in their markets, forces that felled earlier standard-bearers like IBM in personal computers and Nokia in mobile phones.\u201cThere is no room for technology religion,\u201d Mr. Robbins said in a recent interview at Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose, indicating that he is open to changing longtime practices.Ten of Cisco\u2019s most prominent executives soon left. Some other senior managers have exited more recently, while the company has also recruited from outside. Of 13 people in Mr. Robbins\u2019s top executive circle, 12 are new to that role. One key appointment was David Goeckeler, an executive vice president who was given responsibility for all networking offerings and security products. Mr. Robbins said Cisco needed faster decision-making and new skills.One reason for urgency: By mid-2015, Cisco\u2019s business of networking switches and routers was no longer growing predictably. Some longtime telecom customers had turned to lower-priced networking hardware and new software that made it easier to run systems from multiple vendors. Cisco had also largely failed to win over big cloud-computing specialists, a group led by Amazon.Mr. Robbins persuaded Cisco\u2019s board to shift research and development dollars back to networking. One key focus was a little-noticed company stronghold: the closets of many businesses where boxes, wires and Wi-Fi connect PCs and other devices to the internet.Those campus networks, as they are called, are not easily disrupted by newer technologies like cloud computing; even ardent fans of such services need boxes to connect users to the web.Mr. Robbins specifically pointed to a new line of switching systems called the Catalyst 9000, which has some novel features, including the ability to scan packets of data for malicious software even if they are encrypted. In just the past three quarters, it has been purchased by 5,800 customers, a record order rate for the company.Catalyst 9000 also comes with new software used to manage the systems, called DNA Center, which provides a kind of digital dashboard for all the devices connected to a corporate network. The software streamlines what technicians need to do, which previously involved typing in an arcane set of text commands for each networking device to configure and make changes to a network. Cisco estimates that it has taught that skill to more than six million people over the years, building customer loyalty through their investment in training.But the labor to manage that complexity has turned into a liability, Mr. Robbins said. Companies often spend $15 in operating costs over five years for each dollar spent on network technology, he said.Seth Price, who manages networks operated by Durham County, N.C., estimated that DNA Center and other Cisco software had reduced the time needed to resolve service problems by 80 percent. Finding and isolating a computer infected with malware \u2014 a job that once took months \u2014 now takes hours, he said.DNA Center is also designed to improve security by making it easier to restrict what devices can communicate with one another. That was a key selling point for Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, which has to worry about protecting computers, medical instruments and other devices, said Steven Garske, its chief information officer. The hospital decided to buy 350 of the Catalyst devices last July.The latest Cisco technology works like \u201cdigital alchemy,\u201d said Jerry Sheehan, chief information officer at Montana State University, which is also testing DNA Center.Some competitors question whether Cisco, which has long specialized in hardware, has what it takes to thrive as software becomes a decisive differentiator.\u201cI think they have a difficult transition from where they are,\u201d said Pat Gelsinger, VMware\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey are running uncontested,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Says", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepresentative John Lewis of Georgia and Representative Bobby L. Rush of Illinois are both Democrats, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights leaders.But facial recognition technology made by Amazon, which is being used by some police departments and other organizations, incorrectly matched the lawmakers with people who had been charged with a crime, the American Civil Liberties Union reported on Thursday morning.The errors emerged as part of a larger test in which the civil liberties group used Amazon\u2019s facial software to compare the photos of all federal lawmakers against a database of 25,000 publicly available mug shots. In the test, the Amazon technology incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress with people who had been arrested, amounting to a 5 percent error rate among legislators.The test disproportionally misidentified African-American and Latino members of Congress as the people in mug shots.In the letter, the lawmakers asked for details on how Amazon tested its facial technology for accuracy and bias. They also requested a list of all government agencies using Amazon\u2019s facial technology as well as all law enforcement and intelligence agencies Amazon had communicated with about the system.Nina Lindsey, an Amazon Web Services spokeswoman, said in a statement that the company\u2019s customers had used its facial recognition technology for various beneficial purposes, including preventing human trafficking and reuniting missing children with their families. She added that the A.C.L.U. had used the company\u2019s face-matching technology, called Amazon Rekognition, differently during its test than the company recommended for law enforcement customers.For one thing, she said, police departments do not typically use the software to make fully autonomous decisions about people\u2019s identities. \u201cIt is worth noting that in real-world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgment,\u201d Ms. Lindsey said in the statement.She also noted that the A.C.L.U had used the system\u2019s default setting for matches, called a \u201cconfidence threshold,\u201d of 80 percent. That means the group counted any face matches the system proposed that had a similarity score of 80 percent or more. Amazon itself uses the same percentage in one facial recognition example on its site describing matching an employee\u2019s face with a work ID badge. But Ms. Lindsey said Amazon recommended that police departments use a much higher similarity score \u2014 95 percent \u2014 to reduce the likelihood of erroneous matches.Facial recognition \u2014 a technology that can be used to identify unknown people in photos or videos without their knowledge or permission \u2014 is fast becoming a top target for civil liberties groups and privacy experts.Over the last two months, Amazon has come under increasing pressure for selling its Rekognition technology to law enforcement agencies. The company has sold the service as a way for police departments to easily identify suspects in photos or videos.Mr. Snow of the A.C.L.U. said his group\u2019s test of Amazon\u2019s software should push Congress to put a moratorium on law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition technology.In the civil liberties group\u2019s test, the Amazon software misidentified several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Mr. Lewis and Mr. Rush, as other people who had been arrested.\u201cWe think these test results really raise the concern that facial recognition has a race problem,\u201d said Mr. Snow, the A.C.L.U. lawyer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Employee Uprisings Sweep Many Tech Companies. Not Twitter.", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWorkers across the technology industry are forcing their employers to reconsider how their products are being used by the United States government.But it\u2019s premature to declare those giant tech companies as suddenly woke. The government contracts in question are inconsequential to their fortunes.A better test of tech-worker activism would involve a company with a primary product that is being used to inject misinformation and authoritarian speech into mainstream conversation \u2014 and, more to the point, a company that appears to have directly benefited from the toxic flood of political vitriol in which all of us are now drowning.In other words: Will there be an employee uprising at Twitter?The social network favored by President Trump has a complicated political ethos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, and the company has reveled in its centrality to viral progressive movements \u2014 the Arab Spring, #BlackLivesMatter, #metoo and #MarchForOurLives were all animated by forces on Twitter.The tension between Twitter\u2019s liberal employee base and the service\u2019s role in news and politics has only heightened recently. For years, Twitter\u2019s business looked gloomy; with about 300 million users, it had a fraction of Facebook\u2019s billions of members, and it struggled to convince advertisers and the mainstream public of its relevance. But in the last 18 months, Twitter found a new focus in the news. The company shed ancillary businesses and tweaked its central feed to highlight virality, turning Twitter into a bruising barroom brawl featuring the most contentious political and cultural fights of the day.Perhaps. But at what cost to the world?Twitter declined to make Mr. Dorsey available for an interview. The company did put me on the phone with Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal, policy, trust and safety, who echoed the idea that there is robust debate within Twitter about its impact on the world.\u201cA lot of our employees are here because they\u2019re tied to the mission that we\u2019re serving and to our purpose in the world,\u201d Ms. Gadde said. She defined that mission as providing \u201ca healthy public conversation,\u201d but acknowledged the company has had trouble defining exactly what such a healthy conversation might look like.To critics, Twitter\u2019s call for outside help in deciding the most straightforward element of its platform feels like part of a familiar pattern at the company \u2014 slow-walking a response to problems that have long been obvious to users, and that grow more obvious by the day.After all, isn\u2019t there enough evidence already that conversations on Twitter aren\u2019t very healthy?Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was the study\u2019s lead author, suggested that there were several ways Twitter could address this disparity, including by providing users with stats on their behavior. She also said that what happened on Twitter had real-world consequences.\u201cBecause it\u2019s this insular community of journalists following other journalists, when people think of someone who they might like to hire, people whose names keep showing up in their Twitter feeds are first of mind,\u201d Dr. Usher said.You might argue that it is too much to ask Twitter to consider its effect on long-simmering social problems like gender inequality. So let\u2019s look at a more direct way that Twitter impacts discourse: Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, which are very likely to become even more important as the political season heats up before the midterms.But what if that \u201cimportant information\u201d conflicts with Twitter\u2019s mission to promote a healthy public conversation?Sooner or later, Twitter\u2019s executives and employees are going to have to make a decision about which is more important, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets or the company\u2019s desire to promote a healthy public conversation. It\u2019s hard to see how both are tenable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Combat China\u2019s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAt the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow?These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn\u2019t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout?Here\u2019s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you\u2019re used to, could plan a role in the future.Does this sound un-American? It shouldn\u2019t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries\u2019 advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries.But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of \u2014 and will own \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy.You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in?But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. \u201cLife science and software get a lot of money,\u201d he said.I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development.But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China\u2019s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry.One huge problem with today\u2019s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now \u2014 as we\u2019re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy \u2014 there\u2019s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise.Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today\u2019s miracles.It\u2019s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes.A federal plan to win this or that industry isn\u2019t guaranteed to work.

One employee presented Mr. Nadella with a USB stick that contained the petition, along with the signatures, including 500 from Microsoft employees, they said.Microsoft declined to comment on Thursday\u2019s petition, but confirmed that Mr. Nadella had received the USB stick.The petition was started earlier this month by a coalition of nonprofit organizations calling for immigration reform. A group of Microsoft employees circulated the petition internally, collecting signatures. The group then decided to present Mr. Nadella with the petition and use the opportunity to raise their concerns directly with him, said employees involved in Thursday\u2019s encounter. They said they chose that day to present the petition because it coincided with the deadline set by a federal court to reunite children and parents who had been divided under the former policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Aide Questioned Deleting Sensitive Meeting Details. Then She Was Fired.", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Before he resigned on Thursday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was facing new questions about whether aides deleted sensitive information about his meetings from his public schedule and potentially violated the law in doing so.Last summer one of his senior schedulers, Madeline G. Morris, was fired by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Kevin Chmielewski, who said he let her go because she was questioning the practice of retroactively deleting meetings from the calendar. Mr. Chmielewski has emerged as a harsh critic of Mr. Pruitt after a bitter falling out that led to his departure from the agency as well.Ms. Morris, who started work as Mr. Pruitt\u2019s scheduler in June 2017, confirmed Wednesday that she was fired after she raised objections about the deletions, which she believed were illegal, although she said that Mr. Chmielewski did not tell her his reasons for firing her. One case involved the deletion of several of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s meetings during a spring 2017 trip to Rome, including one with a controversial cardinal then under investigation for sexual assault.The E.P.A. acknowledged in a series of legal memos last year that it did in fact direct an agency scheduler \u2014 although it did not name the person \u2014 to revise Mr. Pruitt\u2019s daily calendar retroactively. The agency said it was doing so to remove errors that had been left in the electronic record after various events were canceled or happened differently than expected.Ryan Jackson, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff, dismissed Mr. Chmielewski\u2019s criticism as a fabrication by a disgruntled former employee. \u201cWhatever he\u2019s telling you about altering calendars is not correct,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Ms. Morris was called last July by two agency lawyers, who told her that the changes she was making to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s schedule might be illegal, according to a person familiar with the conversation. The following month, Ms. Morris noticed that a number of changes had been made to the record of a trip Mr. Pruitt had taken to Italy. Ms. Morris questioned the legality of the changes to Mr. Chmielewski and Mr. Jackson, and a few days later was fired, he said.Asked to explain Ms. Morris\u2019s departure from the E.P.A., as well as his own email correspondence indicating that she was being paid for time not worked, Mr. Jackson declined to comment. He also declined to comment on whether Ms. Morris was simply being asked to reconcile calendars.The E.P.A. spokesman and the agency\u2019s general counsel declined to comment.Ms. Morris had nearly a decade of experience in Washington and solid Republican credentials, according to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She worked for former Representative Denny Rehberg, a Montana Republican, as an assistant and scheduler, before working as a federal affairs specialist for Koch Companies Public Sector, the lobbying arm of Koch Industries, the conglomerate long run by the conservative brothers David H. and Charles Koch.Ms. Morris, whose start date at the E.P.A. was June 18, was an executive scheduler with an annual salary of $90,350. She handled a variety of planning needs for Mr. Pruitt, including requests for meetings with executives from Toyota and Chevron.The account of the calendar deletions and the aftermath is based on interviews with four people who were working at the agency at the time, including Mr. Chmielewski and three others who asked not to be identified out of concern for retaliation.In July 2017, according to Mr. Chmielewski, Ms. Morris was instructed by him and Mr. Jackson to retroactively delete some meetings Mr. Pruitt held with lobbyists and replace them with staff meetings in the calendar, which was maintained in Microsoft Outlook. He and other people familiar with the calendar also said Ms. Morris was asked not to enter some of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s meetings on the official calendar.Mr. Chmielewski cited an August 2017 meeting with billionaire Denver-based businessman Philip Anschutz, a prominent donor to Republican Senate candidates and owner of an energy company regulated by the agency. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar for that day, which was publicly released, does not include the meeting.Mr. Anschutz declined to comment, and didn\u2019t dispute that the meeting occurred.Three agency memos drafted last year as these changes were being made offer an alternative explanation for the work that Ms. Morris was doing.Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, White House staffers and cabinet officials have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.\u201cScheduling staff corrected inaccurate entries by adding meetings that occurred but were not originally reflected on the schedule, removing meetings that were on the schedule but did not occur or that Administrator Pruitt did not attend,\u201d said one memo from last September, signed by Mr. Jackson.But the agency, as it undertook this process, realized itself that it was doing something wrong: It was deleting items from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar, meaning it was wrongly modifying a public record. Moving forward, the agency agreed to block out incorrect details, instead of deleting meetings, before it made the schedule public.After Ms. Morris made earlier deletions, the two E.P.A. attorneys \u2014 who became aware of the issue after receiving Outlook emails notifying them that their names had been removed from a past meeting \u2014 told Ms. Morris to stop making deletions to the calendar, according to a person familiar with the call.But last week Mr. Jackson acknowledged to the House Oversight and Reform Committee, one of the bodies investigating Mr. Pruitt\u2019s management practices, that he instructed staff to remove references to Cardinal Pell from the public schedule. According to a committee aide familiar with the interview, Mr. Jackson told investigators that he ordered Cardinal Pell\u2019s name to be removed because he considered it a \u201cpersonal dinner\u201d and because no E.P.A. business was conducted. About 15 people attended the dinner at which Mr. Pruitt discussed climate change, according to agency emails.Ms. Morris pointed out the changes and the possibility that they were illegal to Mr. Chmielewski, he said, as well as to Mr. Jackson. On Aug. 31, a few days after Ms. Morris raised these objections (and two and a half months after she had started at the agency), Ms. Morris was told that it would be her last day.Mr. Chmielewski confirmed the sequence of events and acknowledged that by firing Ms. Morris for refusing to modify the calendars he was in effect endorsing the practice. \u201cShe refused \u2014 and I didn\u2019t blame her \u2014 she refused to falsify the schedule,\u201d Mr. Chmielewski said in an interview, adding, \u201cIt was me and Ryan that fired her.\u201dWe know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Asked why Ms. Morris was fired, Mr. Jackson said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think Maddy would appreciate me talking about the circumstances of her separation from here.\u201dAfter being fired, Ms. Morris stayed with her sister\u2019s family in Pittsburgh, and described to them what had happened.\u201cShe told us that she had alerted her chief of staff that some things had disappeared from the schedule, and that it was illegal, and that later that week she was called in and they told her she was being dismissed,\u201d said Christopher Marshall, Ms. Morris\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cShe was told she would never find out why.\u201dHe added, \u201cMaddy thought it was probably because of the scheduling thing, but we could never be sure.\u201dIn an unusual arrangement, Ms. Morris also continued to receive pay for six weeks after she left the E.P.A., according to agency emails that were released as part of a public records lawsuit by the Sierra Club, an environmental group, as well as a United States Office of Personnel Management document obtained by The New York Times.The personnel record shows Ms. Morris remained on the payroll through Oct. 14. Paying a federal employee for work not performed is prohibited by federal law. Under the government\u2019s personnel policy, neither political appointees nor employees who work for the federal government for less than 12 months are entitled to severance pay.\u201cWe have not put in any paperwork on you so no one is aware of any actions,\u201d Mr. Jackson wrote in a Sept. 22, 2017, email to Ms. Morris. Earlier that day, she had asked about not having received a paycheck she was expecting after she had stopped working at the agency. \u201cI just wanted to see if something has changed since our conversation about being paid a few months,\u201d she wrote.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this \u2014 this is highly irregular and appears to flout the rules,\u201d said Jeffrey Lubbers, a professor of administrative law at American University, of the terms of Ms. Morris\u2019s dismissal and payment.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said of Mr. Pruitt: \u201cThe reports that have come out are something the president is concerned about, and there are many of those reports.\u201d But he added that Mr. Trump felt the administrator had done a \u201creally good job at deregulating the government.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.Yet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.Facebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.Facial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201dBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.Rochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.At the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.European regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.Nikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201dFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.People could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.But Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.One patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.Another Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.But legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.The case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.If the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

Those investments would build on billions of dollars that investors have already put into the companies.The investments reflect facial recognition\u2019s embrace by Beijing, which has created a better environment for companies to test the technology than in the West. And that could help China deploy advanced systems faster and more broadly than America.SenseTime has already raised over $1.6 billion in funding since it was founded in 2014, according to data from S & P Global Market Intelligence, and as recently as May was valued at about $4.5 billion.

The \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Weekend Update anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che will host the ceremony.It\u2019s a new era for the Emmys.The streaming service Netflix led the way with 112 nominations when they were announced on Thursday, snapping HBO\u2019s 17-year streak of being the most nominated network for TV\u2019s most coveted prize.HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d did lead all series with 22 nominations, followed by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC) and \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO), which each had 21, and Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which had 20.The awards will be handed out on Sept. 17.But Netflix\u2019s ascension is one that Hollywood has been anticipating. The streaming service pumps out new shows at a dizzying pace and spends plenty to make them \u2014 it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year, compared with HBO\u2019s $2.5 billion.Netflix\u2019s growth at the Emmys has been staggering. Three years ago it had just 34 nominations, an amount it more than tripled this year.\u201cWe are particularly enthused to see the breadth of our programming celebrated with nominations spread across 40 new and returning titles which showcase our varied and expansive slate \u2014 comedies, dramas, movies, limited series, documentary, variety, animation and reality,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in a statement.Still, Netflix\u2019s Emmy contenders are not expected to capture the top drama and comedy awards. And HBO, which nabbed 108 nominations, does have a 16-year streak of winning the most Emmys.Here are a few other story lines to keep an eye on as the awards show approaches.One of the key questions for Emmy voters: Will it be Westeros or Gilead?With \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d eligible at this year\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards for its not-so-recent seventh season, there will be a showdown between the dragon-fueled HBO juggernaut, twice recognized as best drama, and last year\u2019s top winner, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from Hulu.Or perhaps things will go in another direction.Last year was a year of change at the Emmys with rookie shows like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d all nabbing best drama nominations. They were all among the seven nominees in the best drama category again, with FX\u2019s critical darling \u201cThe Americans\u201d also getting a nod for its final season. It is not unheard-of for Emmy voters to give shows a big trophy on their way out: Series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d all claimed top prizes for their final seasons.The last time the Emmy for best actress in a comedy went to someone not named Julia Louis-Dreyfus, President Barack Obama was in his first term.The race is wide open. Rachel Brosnahan, who stars as a 1950s housewife-turned-comedian in Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d is an early favorite. (She won the Golden Globe in the same category in January.) Others in the running are the two-time nominee Tracee Ellis Ross from \u201cblack-ish,\u201d the seven-time Emmy winner Allison Janney for the CBS sitcom \u201cMom,\u201d Issa Rae from HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d Lily Tomlin from Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d and Pamela Adlon from FX\u2019s \u201cBetter Things.\u201dThe absence of \u201cVeep\u201d also means there will be a new winner in best comedy for the first time in four years.

{"Headline": "Would You Pay $1 Billion for This View?", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "A 157-acre hilltop plot in Los Angeles is being pitched as the city\u2019s most expensive residential property ever.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A property about to go on the market here consists of 157 acres of hilltop land in the coveted Beverly Hills 90210 ZIP code, a 10-minute drive from Rodeo Drive. With its 360-degree views, you can spot many of Los Angeles\u2019s major landmarks in the distance, from Century City to downtown, and even \u2014 on a clear day \u2014 the Pacific Ocean. There are winding, private roads that lead to big, flat lawns the size of football fields.The asking price? A cool $1 billion.Aaron Kirman of Pacific Union Real Estate, the listing agent, recently drove a couple of visitors around the property, reeling off its numerous highlights and noting more than once that it was large enough to hold all of both Disneyland and California Adventure, another Disney park. (The site, which is in an area of Los Angeles known as Beverly Hills Post Office and has been newly branded as the Mountain of Beverly Hills, comes with permission to build nearly 1.5 million square feet of living space across multiple buildings.)With views into some of Los Angeles\u2019s priciest mansions and their swimming pools below, it had the surreal feel of an empty, mountaintop golf course in the middle of a city, with large, manicured lawns kept green by plentiful sprinklers.As Mr. Kirman drove up toward the highest point, a helicopter buzzed by in the distance, not much higher than eye level.Mr. Kirman said the $1 billion price was justified partly because it would be impossible to assemble so much acreage in such a prime location ever again.\u201cThis is a crown jewel,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that billionaire who wants that privacy on the highest peak of Beverly Hills, it\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201dAll these properties included houses. This Mountain of Beverly Hills does not. (Up to now, the most expensive vacant properties for sale in the area were 120 acres in Beverly Hills that the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen listed this month for $150 million and a 97-acre lot nearby that is listed at $250 million. Both have yet to find buyers.)Billy Rose, a co-founder and the president of the Agency, a luxury real estate brokerage that is unaffiliated with the billion-dollar listing, said flat lots in the priciest neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills could go for nearly $20 million per acre, and higher if they have views.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing prices for land that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said.Over the past decade or so, Los Angeles\u2019s luxury real estate market \u2014 which, until recently, was considered a bargain compared with other global hubs, like New York and London \u2014 has been experiencing an unprecedented boom. The city is increasingly a draw for wealthy buyers looking for properties that have plentiful indoor and outdoor space.\u201cYou can have a palatial estate here,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy land like this in other major metropolitan cities. Here you can have your house and your car and your garage.\u201dWith so much money pouring into Los Angeles, large estates that were divided into smaller lots in the 1950s and \u201960s are being reassembled, said Jeff Hyland, of Hilton & Hyland, who has Mr. Allen\u2019s listing. But unlike properties during previous booms, the priciest today are often out of reach for Hollywood stars.Billionaires and tech titans are the new trophy estate buyers, said Mr. Hyland, who is also the author of \u201cThe Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills.\u201d Recently, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive, paid $12.9 million for his neighbor\u2019s half-acre, bringing his estate to a total of 2.5 acres.Stephen Shapiro, the president of Westside Estate Agency, said that the market for properties above $60 million was particularly strong but that the Mountain of Beverly Hills was wildly overpriced.\u201cFor a billion dollars, you could buy it multiple times,\u201d he said, adding that he had gotten feelers that suggest $200 million might be within negotiable reach. (Ronald Richards, a lawyer who represents Secured Capital Partners, the current titleholder on the property, said such queries were a common way for lenders to get a sense of whether their debts could quickly be recovered if necessary, not an indicator of the property\u2019s market value.)Though this prime parcel is zoned for six lots, Mr. Kirman is marketing it as a family compound for a single buyer. Pulling out a color-coded spreadsheet that he said included the names of about 2,800 billionaires, he explained that by his calculation, roughly 50 to 100 of the people on that list would be in the market for such a property \u2014 Middle Eastern royalty or a Russian oligarch being a few of the possibilities he bandied about. (It\u2019s unlikely that a developer would be able to make enough money by subdividing such pricey land and building multiple nine-figure mansions to justify the risk.)One challenge: The buyer will have to come with not only an extremely high net worth but also some vision. \u201cTo be impressed by dirt is hard,\u201d Mr. Kirman admitted.Another challenge: This dirt has quite the history. Decades of legal battles, scuttled mansion plans and huge egos partly explain why such vast, beautiful piece of land in the middle of one of the hottest real estate markets in the country remains vacant. Known until recently as the Vineyard Beverly Hills, the property has been the subject of so many lawsuits and ownership disputes that even the lawyers seem to have lost count. Celebrities, including Tom Cruise, have tried to buy it in the past. Previous owners have drawn up grand plans to build homes, never to follow through.In the late 1970s, Shams Pahlavi, an Iranian princess and the older sister of the last shah of Iran, bought the land and made plans to build a giant estate for her family. But in 1979, in the midst of her home country\u2019s revolution, Iranian students in Los Angeles stormed another property she owned in the area, throwing firebombs. That, along with the death of the shah in 1980, prompted her to abandon the plans.In 1987, Merv Griffin, the talk-show host and game-show producer, bought the property with the goal of building a home that would be slightly larger than the producer Aaron Spelling\u2019s mansion \u2014 the largest in Los Angeles at the time, with 56,000 square feet. But he, too, eventually abandoned his plans and sold the Vineyard for $8.5 million in 1997 to Mark R. Hughes, the founder and chief executive of Herbalife.Mr. Hughes, like the owners before him, planned to build a grand home with a bird\u2019s-eye view of the celebrity estates below. In 2000, at 44, he died from an overdose of alcohol and antidepressants. Mr. Hughes had put the property into a family trust, and the sole beneficiary was his son, an only child who was just 8 when his father died.In the years since, the trust\u2019s handling of the property has prompted numerous lawsuits and legal challenges. In 2004, the trustees lent money to an Atlanta developer, Charles Dickens, to buy the property for no money down. Public records show the land sold for $23.75 million. Mr. Dickens, along with Victorino Noval, a philanthropist who, in 1997, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail fraud charges and spent three years at a federal prison, managed the property through a limited liability company for over a decade. They obtained approval to build multiple homes, but they never did.The Mark Hughes Family Trust remained a lender on the property, though its original trustees were removed after a lengthy legal battle, largely as a result of their mismanagement of the Vineyard, according to court documents. (Mr. Dickens couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Victorino Noval did not respond to requests for comment sent through his personal and family foundation websites.)In recent years, the land has been the site of a handful of high-profile events and parties, including Rihanna\u2019s 2014 Diamond Ball, attended by celebrities like Brad Pitt and Kim Kardashian, as well as Oscar parties and other benefits.Public records show that it changed hands most recently in July 2016 when Tower Park Properties L.L.C., which lists Mr. Dickens as an officer, transferred the property to Secured Capital Partners, a separate limited liability company managed by Mr. Noval\u2019s son, Victor Franco Noval.Mr. Richards, the lawyer for Secured Capital Partners, said the elder Mr. Noval was no longer involved. His son took a management role because \u201cit was such a mess that only someone with inside knowledge like a relative would have the sense to say, \u2018This is a good business risk,\u2019\u201d Mr. Richards said. He said Secured Capital Partners had spent \u201cmillions\u201d upgrading the property\u2019s infrastructure, but declined to offer specifics. Victor Franco Noval declined to comment.Partly to emphasize the property\u2019s fresh start, the new ownership changed the name from the Vineyard to the Mountain of Beverly Hills, since it is so large that it\u2019s visible from the flats of Beverly Hills (and because there is, in fact, no vineyard on the property). Mr. Kirman said \u201cauthenticity\u201d was going to be a big part of the branding.Mr. Kirman said he had reached out to five of the billionaires on his list and planned to fly to London, Qatar, Russia and China to meet with as many of them who are already in his network as possible. \u201cEveryone so far has been super intrigued,\u201d he said.He added that in the next few weeks he\u2019d be commissioning a designer to build a large glass cube on the property where he can entertain potential buyers, and that he was considering ways to allow qualified billionaires to spend a night there, possibly Bedouin-tent style.The next owner of the property, Mr. Kirman said, will most likely come from overseas and be looking to make a splash with a bold purchase. \u201cI think the price will make someone quite well known,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Long Dormant, Inflation Reawakens Investors\u2019 Fears", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the markets ignored inflation. Not anymore.Inflation may not be a major preoccupation \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but it\u2019s back as a real concern.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too long ago when all we were concerned about was deflation,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company. \u201cRight now, what we\u2019re seeing is a transition to a normalization of inflation.\u201dFor investors who\u2019ve been worrying more about deflation \u2014 falling prices \u2014 for the last decade, even \u201cnormal\u201d inflation may feel foreign, Mr. Smith said.Recently, inflation has definitely ticked upward. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent over 12 months through June, its biggest increase in six years. That\u2019s still below the long-term average of 3 percent. Yet a year ago, consumer prices were growing at a 1.6 percent annual rate. And 12 months before that, inflation was just 1 percent.The changes are striking even for producer prices, which reflect the wholesale cost of raw materials. The Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent in June, the largest increase in more than six years.Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer for Westwood Holdings, said he wasn\u2019t necessarily worried about inflation growing out of control in the near term, because wages aren\u2019t soaring. In June, average hourly wages for all employees in private-sector nonfarm jobs rose to $26.98, a 2.7 percent increase over the last year.Still, he said it\u2019s more likely that inflation pressures will grow than shrink, \u201cespecially if you have things like tariffs come into the picture.\u201d A move away from free trade could reverse the disinflationary effects that globalization has had in recent decades, he said.So as inflation becomes part of the normal environment again, he said, \u201cinvestors should be normalizing their portfolios along with it.\u201dThat needn\u2019t entail big changes overnight.Areas that were traditionally sensitive to inflation haven\u2019t been affected much, at least not yet. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that specialize in precious metals lost 5.6 percent, on average, over the last year, according to Morningstar. And funds that specialize in real estate \u2014 which tend to rise when inflation does \u2014 returned a mere 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.But it may make sense for investors to assess their comfort with their overall mix of stocks and bonds.Mr. Smith of Haverford agreed. \u201cIf this is truly a normalization of inflation, then that would pressure fixed income more than equities,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is that within whatever range for stocks that investors believe they can tolerate, they should have maximum exposure to equities.\u201dHe said investors ought to tilt their stock portfolios slightly toward economically sensitive areas of the market to ride the tailwind of economic growth that is propelling inflation. Those sectors include industrials and technology.\u201cAt the margins, we\u2019re putting a little more into playing offense, with names like Honeywell and FedEx,\u201d he said.Though Honeywell is a giant industrial conglomerate, it has been growing four times as fast as its peers in terms of earnings over the last five years, according to Zacks.com. That has been helped by Honeywell\u2019s push into industrial automation and internet connectivity.FedEx is another beneficiary of the accelerating economy in the short run as well as long-term growth \u2014 in this case, from e-commerce. But the express delivery giant could benefit from rising inflation for another reason.Historically, low inflation has usually coincided with higher valuations in the stock market, as price stability offers companies a greater margin of safety. Yet as inflation heats up, the price that investors are willing to pay for every $1 of corporate earnings has tended to fall.Since 1958, the average price/earnings ratio for stocks when the inflation rate has been 2 to 3 percent has been 17.6, according to an analysis by Charles Schwab. But once inflation is between 3 and 4 percent, P/E ratios have historically fallen nearly 10 percent.At FedEx\u2019s current price/earnings ratio of 14.3, the company\u2019s shares aren\u2019t just trading below the market average, they are at a 47 percent discount to the company\u2019s five-year average, according to Morningstar.Another strategy is to look for stocks that aren\u2019t just growing faster than inflation but that also have a track record of passing on that growth to shareholders in the form of dividends.\u201cWhat you want is to own companies that have the ability to grow their dividends in excess of the rate of inflation,\u201d Mr. Freeman of Westwood Holdings said. These so-called dividend growers can be found, he said, among companies whose profits are rising faster than the market as a whole.\u201cMicrosoft has been the poster child of that over the past decade, thanks to their steady, significant earnings growth,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. And over the last eight years, the stock\u2019s dividend payout has grown 15 percent annually.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, said investors shouldn\u2019t restrict themselves to giant companies. Mr. Paulsen said that historically, large stocks have actually thrived in periods when inflation has been slowing, not accelerating.Smaller companies, on the other hand, can often thrive in an inflationary time. \u201cSmall companies are run more lean and mean, with narrow margins,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. As a result, if their revenues were to increase because of a modest rise in prices, that would have a bigger impact on their profits than it would for much larger businesses.In the recently ended quarter, small stocks have outpaced larger ones by a wide margin. The Russell 2000 small-company index returned nearly 8 percent in the quarter, compared with 1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average, which contains big companies.The recent small-stock outperformance may derive from fears over the impact of a trade war with China on big, trade-oriented companies. Small stocks tend to be more resistant to tariffs because they are usually domestically oriented. But Mr. Paulsen said investors should not underestimate inflation\u2019s effect on this recent trend.\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the peak for small-stock outperformance was in 1983,\u201d he said, when inflation was finally being brought under control after a huge increase in the 1970s.More recently, Mr. Paulsen pointed out: \u201cThe best period for small stocks was in the early 2000s, when commodity prices were booming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Emerges as Clear No. 2 in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Thomas M. Siebel often faced skepticism when encouraging big companies to adopt internet-style cloud computing. Many companies, he said, had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers.Now his customers have a different concern: One cloud service isn\u2019t enough.And Mr. Siebel is adapting. After initially working closely with Amazon, a pioneer in cloud computing, C3 IoT now also has a technology and marketing partnership with Microsoft. And it is negotiating a similar agreement with Google.For a few years, it looked like Amazon would run away with the cloud computing business, piling up market share as it has with online shopping. But in the past couple of years, many companies have decided that they don\u2019t want to depend on Amazon alone, and are spreading out their business.That has helped Microsoft most of all. And the software giant has emerged as a strong No. 2 in the cloud market. Microsoft provided further evidence of its rise in the cloud business on Thursday, when it reported its most recent quarterly financial results.Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit, which supplies cloud-based computer processing and storage, and competes most directly with Amazon Web Services, grew by 89 percent over the same period a year ago. The company also reported strong growth in its other cloud offerings.Microsoft\u2019s profit increased 5 percent to $8.8 billion, or $1.13 a share. That was slightly above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.08 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters IBES.Revenue rose 17 percent to $30.09 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in June, higher than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $29.21 billion.The competition to supply the foundation layer of computing and software \u2014 the cloud-era equivalent of an operating system \u2014 is heated and costly. The biggest players, analysts estimate, are spending up to $10 billion a year on their global networks of data centers.This core cloud business is a $60 billion-a-year market, which grew by 50 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Synergy Research Group. In that fast-growing market, Amazon holds a 33 percent share, unchanged since the end of 2015. Over the same span, Microsoft\u2019s share climbed from 7 percent to 13 percent, and Google\u2019s doubled to 6 percent.John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, predicted that the cloud giants will get bigger and capture a steadily rising share of corporate technology spending \u2014 especially as they add new capabilities, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, to their services.\u201cThe information technology market is going to increasingly gravitate towards a small number of hyperscale cloud providers,\u201d Mr. Dinsdale said.In a recent research report on that market, Gartner identified three top-tier companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google. And it listed only three others, Alibaba, Oracle and IBM, as their competitors.\u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft at this stage,\u201d said Raj Bala, a Gartner analyst. \u201cGoogle is making headway, nipping at their heels, but it\u2019s still behind the leaders.\u201dFor Amazon and Google, cloud-computing services were a natural outgrowth of their original businesses \u2014 e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google. Both companies were born on the internet.Not so for Microsoft, which has made the most striking transition to the cloud. Its heritage, corporate wealth and industry dominance was based on selling packaged software and its Windows operating system for personal computers.Microsoft\u2019s later forays into new markets were typically late and hobbled by the company\u2019s Windows fixation. Its failed mobile operating system, for example, was widely criticized as a kludgy attempt to shoehorn Windows onto a smartphone.The company\u2019s path to cloud computing was lengthy and sometimes halting, even if the technical roots stretch back many years. Its MSN online service and Internet Explorer browser had their heydays in the 1990s. More recently, the company poured resources into its Bing search engine.In 2008, two years after Amazon entered the cloud market, a team of the Microsoft\u2019s brightest scientists set to work on a cloud project, code-named Red Dog. In 2010, Microsoft introduced its cloud service, but it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Before he became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive in 2014, Satya Nadella held senior roles in its cloud, online services and search businesses. Once he took over, Mr. Nadella accelerated investment in the cloud unit and focused Microsoft\u2019s sales teams on the business, analysts say.Unlike his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, Mr. Nadella\u2019s career was not steeped in Windows and the business model of packaged software. The traditional software business relied on product licenses with hefty payments up front rather than the pay-for-use subscriptions of the cloud world.\u201cTechnology was not really the obstacle for Microsoft, the problem was the business model,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cNadella has changed the strategy and the culture.\u201dAmazon holds some formidable advantages in the cloud market. It has the most customers \u2014 some spending more than $100 million a year \u2014 and more than 2,000 consulting partners to help companies use increasing amounts of Amazon cloud services. Many corporate technology managers see Amazon as the safe choice.But Microsoft has the advantage of being mainly a supplier of technology to businesses, unlike Amazon and Google. Its longstanding relationships with corporate customers, analysts say, are helping Microsoft gain ground as mainstream companies increasingly move to cloud technology. Microsoft has recently announced cloud deals with companies including Walmart, General Electric, Bayer, Starbucks and Campbell Soup.Microsoft\u2019s offerings have steadily improved, but even Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer for Azure, pointed to the company\u2019s roots in business as a driving force.\u201cThe relationships we have with companies, understanding their needs, is really helping with these migrations to our cloud,\u201d Mr. Russinovich said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Hackers Appear to Shift Focus to U.S. Power Grid", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.Despite attempts to infiltrate the online accounts of two Senate Democrats up for re-election, intelligence officials said they have seen little activity by Russian military hackers aimed at either major American political figures or state voter registration systems.By comparison, according to intelligence officials and executives of the companies that oversee the world\u2019s computer networks, there is surprisingly far more effort directed at implanting malware in the electrical grid.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, but their conclusions were confirmed by several executives of technology and technology security firms.While the department cited \u201chundreds of victims\u201d of the attacks, far more than they had previously acknowledged, there is no evidence that the hackers tried to take over the plants, as Russian actors did in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.In interviews, American intelligence officials said that the department had understated the scope of the threat. So far the White House has said little about the intrusions other than raise the fear of such breaches to maintain old coal plants in case they are needed to recover from a major attack.On Friday, President Trump was briefed on government efforts to protect the coming midterm elections from what a White House statement described as \u201cmalign foreign actors.\u201d It said it was giving cybersecurity support to state and local governments to protect their election systems.\u201cThe president has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation state to other malicious actors,\u201d the statement said.It is possible that Russian hackers are holding their fire until closer to Election Day in November. Given the indictments this month of 12 Russian military officers who are accused of American election interference, the agency once known as the G.R.U. may be all too aware it is being closely watched by the National Security Agency and other American intelligence services.But that has not completely deterred Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies from targeting politicians.Microsoft announced at a security conference last week that it stopped an attack last fall aimed at congressional staff offices. While the company did not identify who was targeted, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces a tight race for re-election, said on Thursday night that her office had been struck in what she called an unsuccessful attack.\u201cRussia continues to engage in cyberwarfare against our democracy,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said in a statement. \u201cWhile this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this. I will not be intimidated.\u201dAmerican officials said it was unclear whether the attack was related to Ms. McCaskill\u2019s re-election bid. She serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and one senior official said it was possible that the hackers were seeking a way into the panel\u2019s access to classified military operations and budgets.Officials of Microsoft, which detected the intrusion in October and November, agreed.\u201cWhen we see an attempt like this, we have no way of discerning what the attacker\u2019s motivation is,\u201d Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, said on Friday.Ms. McCaskill was one of two legislators whose offices Microsoft found were being targeted by the Russian hackers; the company has declined to name the other. (Mr. Burt initially told the Aspen Security Forum last week that three members of Congress had been targeted, but he said on Friday that the many accounts that were targeted now appear to have belonged to employees from only two legislative offices.)Microsoft blocked the attacks with a special court order that allowed it to seize control of internet domains created by Russians that appeared to be official Microsoft sites, but were not. The company has used that procedure at least three times against hackers who are linked to Russian military intelligence.But beyond those attempts, Mr. Burt and several American intelligence officials said there have been surprisingly few cyberattack attempts directed at political leaders, at least compared with 2016.\u201cWe are not seeing the level of activity in the midterm elections that we saw two years ago,\u201d Mr. Burt said. \u201cBut it is still early.\u201dIn part that may be because midterm elections are far more difficult to influence than a presidential race. It would require separate interventions in more than 460 contests, many of which would be of little interest to a foreign power.\u201cI see 2018 as a ramp-up to 2020,\u2019\u2019 said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. Ms. Rosenberger, a former State Department official and foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, has been leading one of the most comprehensive efforts to track and expose foreign influence in American elections.She said the Russian intelligence hackers \u201cwant to make a highly polarized electorate even more polarized and undermine faith in the election systems.\u201dIn a presentation at the Aspen forum, the new chief of the United States Cyber Command spoke at length about a new approach of \u201cpersistent engagement\u201d with American adversaries, an effort to see attacks amassing in networks overseas before they strike in the United States.The commander, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, who is also the director of the National Security Agency, said that he had set up a Russia small group after assuming command in the spring, but said nothing about its operations. The N.S.A. is responsible for defending government networks and conducting covert offensive operations.He spent much of his talk describing the difficulties of countering states that \u201coperate below the threshold level of war,\u201d which is how he and other officials often refer to the Russian efforts to influence the election.Last year, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, called the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election an \u201cact of war.\u201d The hackers are accused of stealing of the committee\u2019s data and then publishing stolen emails through a number of websites, including WikiLeaks.Just as it is difficult to judge the intent of the Russian hackers in attacking Ms. McCaskill\u2019s office, it is hard to fully understand why they have put so much effort into installing \u201cimplants\u201d \u2014 hard-to-find malware \u2014 in the utility operating systems.The fear, of course, is that Russia may be planning to unplug American power systems in a time of conflict. But such an attack would almost certainly result in a military response, as General Nakasone obliquely suggested at the Aspen forum.It is possible that the hackers are simply trying to demonstrate what they are capable of, just as they did in 2014 when they fought the N.S.A.\u2019s efforts to force them from the White House\u2019s unclassified email systems.In the cases described by the Department of Homeland Security, as presented to the electric utilities and outside experts, the Russian hackers went into the power plants through the networks of contractors, some of whom were ill-protected. Those contractors provided software to the utility company\u2019s systems. Then they used \u201cspearphishing\u201d emails, trying to trick utility operators into changing their passwords.That is exactly the approach used against Ms. McCaskill\u2019s staff, the officials said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the past two decades, antitrust enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe. Mr. Zingales is a co-host of the podcast Capitalisn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the first time. Just last year the European Commission (the administrative arm of the European Union) fined Google $2.8 billion for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in the search engine market, a charge that the American Federal Trade Commission had dropped a few years earlier. Is this the first salvo in an incoming trade war or a form of tax-thy-neighbor policy? Dangerous, because it will deflect from asking the real important question: Is there something wrong with American antitrust? Perhaps there is a reason Americans are paying so much more for smartphones in the United States than Europeans are. In the old days America was laughing at the \u201cnational champion\u201d strategy pursued by Continental Europe, where domestic consumers\u2019 interest was sacrificed to project local companies into the world. It seems that the table has turned now. The Google fine should not be used to escalate the commercial tension with Europe, but to start a soul searching about the proper level of government intervention to preserve competition in America.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Urges Congress to Regulate Use of Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lengthy blog post about the potential uses and abuses of facial recognition, Bradford L. Smith, the company\u2019s president, compared the technology to products like medicines and cars that are highly regulated, and he urged Congress to study it and oversee its use.Tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, and Mr. Smith\u2019s unusual entreaty illustrates how powerful technologies involving artificial intelligence \u2014 including facial recognition \u2014 have set off a contentious battle among tech executives. These technologies have the potential to remake industries. They could also reduce workers\u2019 job prospects or result in unequal opportunities for consumers, leading some to argue that the products are too risky for tech companies to deploy without government oversight.Mr. Smith\u2019s appeal also comes as Silicon Valley is facing withering scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy experts. Several companies have been harshly criticized in recent months for their role in spreading false information during the 2016 election, and exploiting users\u2019 personal data. In response, some businesses, like Facebook, have expressed more openness to regulation of practices like political advertising.With many of its rivals under fire, Microsoft has aggressively tried to position itself as the moral compass of the industry. Company executives have been outspoken about safeguarding users\u2019 privacy as well as warning about the potential discriminatory effects of using automated algorithm to make important decisions like hiring.Now that facial recognition has become a new lightning rod for critics, Microsoft is taking the lead in calling for some regulatory restraint.The powerful technology can be used to identify people in photos or video feeds without their knowledge or permission. Proponents see it as a potentially important tool for identifying criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that the technology could enable mass surveillance, hindering people\u2019s ability to freely attend political protests or go about their day-to-day lives in anonymity.In calling for government oversight of facial recognition, Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of any new state efforts to tightly regulate the technology. Mr. Smith, the company\u2019s president, suggested that governments around the world examine both law enforcement and commercial uses of the technology.\u201cShould law enforcement use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould the law require that companies obtain prior consent before collecting individuals\u2019 images for facial recognition?\u201dIn the European Union, many of these questions have already been settled.Civil liberties and privacy advocates said they both welcomed and felt wary of Microsoft\u2019s push for government regulation, questioning how committed the company was to strong user privacy controls.April Isenhower, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said that the company had long been committed to privacy, including pushing for a national consumer privacy law in the United States since 2005.Tech companies are spreading facial recognition in part because it provides a powerful way for them to connect consumers\u2019 online and real lives.In addition to using facial recognition for its own consumer services, Microsoft \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 also sells the software to others.Mr. Smith wrote in the blog post that Microsoft was examining its own development and marketing of the technology.He also said Microsoft had rejected facial recognition requests from certain customers \u201cwhere we\u2019ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,\u201d and that the company was committed to \u201cestablishing a transparent set of principles\u201d for the technology.Microsoft employees recently protested the company\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that has been involved in the separation of migrant children from their families at the border. In his blog post, Mr. Smith wrote that the company\u2019s contract with that agency \u201cisn\u2019t being used for facial recognition\u201d or to separate families.Ms. Isenhower, the Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about whether the company provided facial recognition services to other government agencies or whether it had put any specific restrictions on its customers\u2019 use of the technology. She also declined to discuss the company\u2019s position on consumer consent for facial recognition.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "San Francisco Officials to Tech Workers: Buy Your Lunch", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The corporate campuses of the Bay Area\u2019s technology companies have become independent fiefs with dry cleaning, gyms, doctors, shuttle buses and bountiful free meals, made by the best chefs poached from the region\u2019s famous restaurants. Now, local officials are knocking at the gates.And they are coming for the food.Two San Francisco supervisors introduced an ordinance last week that would forbid employee cafeterias in new corporate construction. It is not clear whether the measure will pass, but it is a direct attack on one of the modern tech industry\u2019s most entrenched traditions.The ordinance, which seeks to force tech workers out of their subsidized cafeterias and into neighborhood restaurants, is the latest attempt by San Francisco leaders to make the tech companies that are migrating north from Silicon Valley adapt to life in the city.Though San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors is not expected to consider the cafeteria ban until the fall, local reaction to it has fallen along the city\u2019s typical, pro- and anti-tech fault lines.\u201cThese tech companies have decided to leave their suburban campuses because their employees want to be in the city, and yet the irony is, they come to the city and are creating isolated, walled-off campuses,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor who is co-sponsoring the bill with Ahsha Safa\u00ed. \u201cThis is not against these folks, it\u2019s for them. It\u2019s to integrate them into the community.\u201dMr. Peskin\u2019s ordinance is also aimed at getting more out of a tax deal given to tech companies that would agree to move into a troubled area called Mid-Market. In 2011, the companies were given tax breaks on payroll and stock options with the hope that they would bring jobs and investment to the neighborhood, just a short walk from San Francisco\u2019s City Hall.Within a few years, a number of companies like Twitter, Square and Uber moved into Mid-Market. But despite initial excitement over the opening of a number of restaurants and shops, the neighborhood has not yet flourished the way many had hoped.Open drug use is still common on the streets around Twitter\u2019s headquarters. Some of the big restaurants that moved in have already moved out because they were not drawing enough customers. A few stories up, in a forbidding Art Deco-style building, Twitter employees enjoy free meals in an expansive corporate cafeteria. Tight security on the ground floor keeps the problems of the street away.\u201cWe gave huge tax breaks to revitalize neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Peskin said. \u201cBut instead, they\u2019re all walled into their tech palaces.\u201dExisting tech kitchens would be grandfathered in under the proposed ordinance, so that anyone who has in-office meals now would keep them. But newcomers would have to learn to eat out or brown bag it.\u201cI\u2019m not taking away anybody\u2019s lunch,\u201d Mr. Peskin said.\u201cThere\u2019s never been anything on the scale of what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said Ms. Berlin, who wrote a history of the industry called \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered what\u2019s lost in this trend to just constantly stay in your own ecosystem. What are the risks in these siloed monocultures?\u201dTo some tech workers, targeting their free food feels more like scapegoating for the city\u2019s problems than like sound policy. San Francisco had drug and homelessness issues long before Twitter came along. Tech companies cannot be blamed for local policies that have helped to derail new housing construction. And not every computer programmer, they note, is a millionaire.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat,\u201d said James Manning, 43, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories, where in-office meals are heavily subsidized. \u201cThe idea the food doesn\u2019t need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.\u201dAs he talked, Mr. Manning was having lunch (barbecue ribs) on a foray outside his office \u201cas a treat\u201d because he was meeting up with friends.\u201cIt\u2019s the food equivalent of going out for drinks,\u201d he said.Certainly, not all tech companies in San Francisco offer employees free meals. Salesforce, the largest tech employer in the city, does not. And Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame, a start-up that offers free credit scores, said the cafeteria ban could help him compete for workers.\u201cThis could even the playing field a bit,\u201d he said. He said his company had just recruited someone from Google, which is hard because it cannot match the food spread.Katherine Chiao, the co-owner of Kagawa-Ya Udon, a Japanese bistro that shares a building with the Uber and Square offices in Mid-Market, said the corporate cafeterias were making local restaurants \u201cunsustainable.\u201d Workers do not come downstairs to eat, she said.\u201cAll the restaurants that moved in here, we\u2019re just sitting ducks,\u201d Ms. Chiao said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to go down next?\u201dIn the center of Mid-Market, downstairs from Twitter, is a buzzing grocery store and food court called the Market. The food hall includes a poke bar, an organic chicken sandwich counter, a wine bar and a Malaysian restaurant. But it is hard to compete with free.Michael Cohen, the Market\u2019s managing partner, said he visited some of the tech company cafeterias and was shocked to see people not only eating their free lunches \u2014 they were picking up a few things to eat at home.\u201cThey\u2019re grabbing extra fruit, snacks, drinks, right out of the refrigerators,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong grocer, and I saw people shopping.\u201dStill, he offered as a caveat, the bigger issue for him is crime, street chaos and the staggering expense of security (there are several security guards at the door and inside). Recently, someone took off their pants in the store and had to be carried out by a guard, only to come back and urinate on a window.\u201cI\u2019ve operated grocery stores all over the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis environment is the most challenging I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201dSitting outside the Market were two tech workers dressed in layers for the San Francisco summer chill, wearing corporate badges on drawstrings. Free food, they said, was more necessity than luxury.\u201cI\u2019d personally rather have the cash,\u201d said Tim Bellay, 40, a software engineer at Microsoft, which has a local office.\u201cIf I have food upstairs, I\u2019m not going to pay for it, no way,\u201d said K. C. Clawson, 35, who does business analytics for Microsoft. \u201cI\u2019m so cheap.\u201dWhat then do they spend their money on?\u201cRent,\u201d Mr. Bellay said flatly.\u201cRent,\u201d Ms. Clawson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. Even on weekends. You know, I used to go out. I used to go out to restaurants all the time. I used to love it. Now in San Francisco, when I don\u2019t eat at the office, I cook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry.The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions?Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences.This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices.One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights \u2014 not unlike splitting AT&T into eight \u201cBaby Bells\u201d nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission\u2019s verdict on Microsoft\u2019s dominant market position in the 2000s.But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants.In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies \u2014 such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence \u2014 to upend existing industries.\u201cOld economy\u201d companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants.Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase.

DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Trump Is Right About the E.U.\u2019s Penalty Against Google", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseLet\u2019s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union\u2019s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of Google.But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point.It\u2019s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission.The commission, which is the union\u2019s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects.But the heart of the decision involved Google\u2019s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company\u2019s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs.The commission called this a classic \u201ctying\u201d arrangement, in which a company extends the market dominance it enjoys in one area (in this instance, the app store) to others, specifically the browser and search engine. (For some reason, the commission\u2019s logic did not extend to any other Google apps.)\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, said in announcing the ruling.The focus on tying arrangements is reminiscent of two famous Microsoft cases: one in the United States, in which the government accused the company of illegally tying its Internet Explorer browser to its dominant Windows operating system, the other in Europe, where Microsoft was found to have abused its Windows dominance by embedding its media player.The outcomes in both cases are now widely viewed as irrelevant, since by the time they were decided, Explorer and Windows Media Player had been overwhelmed by technological change and competition \u2014 from Google, among others. Microsoft\u2019s share of the browser and media-player markets is insignificant today.But even if the European Union\u2019s Microsoft precedent is viewed as sound, Google\u2019s competitive situation is different. \u201cThere\u2019s only a superficial resemblance to Microsoft,\u201d said Pinar Akman, director of the Center for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds in England, who has received support from Google for some of her research.Unlike adding a rival media player to the Windows operating system, which at the time was a slow and cumbersome process, adding rival apps to an Android-based phone can be done \u201cin seconds,\u201d said Ms. Akman, an antitrust expert. \u201cThe commission put a lot of emphasis on the value of preinstallation. But just because an app is preinstalled doesn\u2019t mean consumers are going to use it. It\u2019s very easy to download a rival app.\u201dGoogle\u2019s photo app, for example, has struggled to compete against Instagram and Snap, even though it comes preinstalled on Android-based phones as part of the Google suite.Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, agreed that if installing a rival app is as easy as Google claims, \u201cit would make for a pretty solid argument that whatever dominance Google has retained in mobile search has nothing to do with anticompetitive conduct, and rather just reflects its superiority as a product.\u201dCuriously, the commission\u2019s statement announcing the ruling did not address that issue. (A full written decision is not expected for months.) So I opened the Google Play store on my Android phone and searched for Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine. I was able to download it in seconds. Google suggested I \u201cmight also like\u201d an array of other search options, including Firefox and DuckDuckGo, which were displayed on the same page and equally accessible with a touch of my finger.Even though Google requires phone makers to use the full suite of Google apps if they want to install the Play store, there is nothing to prevent those companies from also preinstalling rival apps. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Microsoft just pay manufacturers to preinstall Bing?\u201d Ms. Akman asked.Apple, for one, makes Google the default search engine on the iPhone\u2019s Safari browser, even though Apple does not use either the Android operating system or the Play store. Oddly, the commission excluded Apple as a Google competitor, saying that because the company produced premium-price products, it did not constrain Google\u2019s ability to dominate the broader market.\u201cCan you imagine a U.S. court finding that Android and iOS don\u2019t compete?\u201d said Professor Sagers, referring to Apple\u2019s operating system.Samsung, too, preinstalls a range of rival apps in addition to the suite of Google products.The commission\u2019s stated mission is to protect European consumers by assuring them the benefits of competition. But the commission does not seem to have considered the possibility that Google\u2019s search engine and browser have achieved such high market share because consumers prefer them, or that consumers might also like having the apps already installed on their phones.The commission argues that when a phone comes with a single search engine preinstalled, it confers an enormous competitive advantage on that product. To support the theory, the commission said that on phones using Windows operating systems, which come with Bing preinstalled, 75 percent of searches are conducted using that engine.But Windows-based phones accounted for only 0.15 percent of the global market at the end of last year. That renders the data irrelevant, Ms. Akman said.A closer analogy, though not one cited by the commission, can be found in Russia. Last April, Google reached a settlement with a rival search engine based there, Yandex, under which it agreed that phone makers could preinstall Yandex on Android devices and let consumers decide which app would be their default search engine.At the time, Google and Yandex each had about 48 percent of the Russian search market. Since then, Yandex has increased its share to 51 percent; Google\u2019s has dropped to 45 percent.Even if preinstallation offers Google an advantage over rival app producers, that does not mean it harms consumers or violates competition law. I, for one, like having the Google apps preinstalled on my phone, unlike most of the clutter imposed on me by my phone service provider, Verizon.Google has said it will appeal the commission\u2019s decision. Given the commission\u2019s track record \u2014 it has rarely been reversed \u2014 the company would seem to face long odds. Still, the European Union\u2019s highest court sent a 2009 antitrust judgment against Intel back to a lower court for further review last year. The higher court\u2019s opinion clarified that the purpose of European antitrust law was not to protect inefficient competitors at the expense of consumers. That could give Google an opening.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Google ruling is anti-American,\u201d Ms. Akman said. \u201cThere are plenty of rulings against European companies, too. It\u2019s just that the American tech companies have been so successful, and have achieved so much market power, that they\u2019re going to come under scrutiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Government Work Done, Tax Policy Writers Decamp to Lobbying Jobs", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Six months after Republicans pushed a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul through Congress, many of the most influential players who worked behind the scenes on the legislation are no longer on Capitol Hill or in the Trump administration.They are now lobbyists.The two-way street between lobbying and lawmaking is well worn in Washington. But after President Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d there was some speculation that the so-called special interests might be sidelined. And while the frenetic two-month sprint last year to pass the tax legislation left some lobbyists marginalized, the businesses now scrambling to navigate the changes are increasingly recruiting the people who wrote it.With the November midterm elections near, and the possibility that Republicans could lose control of the House or the Senate, staff members have additional motivation to move on.\u201cCompanies are looking to better understand the legislation and potentially affect future changes, which is why they are snatching up top talent,\u201d said Ken Spain, a Republican consultant who works on financial and tax issues. \u201cWith the uncertainty of the election looming, Republican staffers are quietly making themselves available to K Street while they can still demand top asking price.\u201dWhile they might not be household names, those who have decamped to the private sector played a major role in the passage of the most sweeping tax bill in three decades. More than a dozen people have already migrated this year, and more are expected to follow as the elections draw closer.With little time left on the legislative calendar and more gridlock in store, some of these departing officials may feel that staying in government offers diminishing returns.\u201cIf you think about administrations historically, a lot of what is accomplished is in the first year or 18 months,\u201d Mr. Maloney said in an interview. \u201cMany staffs spend years and never accomplish what we did at Treasury in a limited amount of time, between tax legislation, financial services reform, Cfius reforms and sanctions.\u201d He was referring to the recent rollback of some rules for smaller banks and the likely passage of legislation that would expand the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to block international mergers on national security grounds.Administration and congressional staff members can often double or triple their salaries while working a fraction of their government hours by joining lobbying firms.The migration from lawmaking to lobbying has occurred under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Congressional staff members often make the switch after the enactment of major legislation, and experts who chart the influence of money in politics noted a similar trend, perhaps to a lesser degree, after the passage of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama.\u201cThis year, the revolving door is particularly swinging out of control,\u201d said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that promotes lobbying reform. \u201cThe midterm elections are coming up, which many expect to not go well for the Republicans, and this is the ideal opportunity for Republican congressional staff and administration officials to be able to cash in on what they have been doing the last year an a half.\u201dPaul Miller, president of the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, said that this has led to the growth of a shadow lobbying industry, where former government staff members take consulting and advisory jobs that are essentially lobbying under a different name.\u201cThey\u2019re calling it something else and doing what they were doing anyway,\u201d Mr. Miller said. He noted that the number of registered lobbyists has been falling in recent years. \u201cThe actual number of lobbyists has increased dramatically.\u201dThe international side of the tax code is also due for more changes. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged in an interview on the Fox Business Network last week that the speed of the passage of the legislation meant that fixes were needed.\u201cWe threw major changes at the international side,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have as much time to model them, analyze it. Now that we\u2019re getting that feedback, we\u2019re going to be making those changes.\u201dBut critics of the Trump administration warn that the president is turning a blind eye to the fact that lobbyists are becoming more entrenched under his watch.\u201cIt\u2019s going to cost the American taxpayer billions of dollars,\u201d said Norman Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and a former adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cThese people are being brought into the special interest influencing industry in order to find ways to evade an already generous, excessively generous giveaway to corporations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Google $5.1 Billion in Android Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities fined Google a record $5.1 billion on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices, in one of the most aggressive regulatory actions against American technology giants and one that may force lasting changes to smartphones.The fine was coupled with remedies that would effectively loosen Google\u2019s grip over its Android software, which is used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones and is a key part of the Silicon Valley company\u2019s business. Those changes, which European regulators ordered to take effect in 90 days, undercut Google\u2019s ability to automatically include its own search and other apps in mobile devices, opening it to more competition in a market that it has dominated.\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. \u201cThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\u201dThe size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects the seriousness and the sustained nature\u201d of Google\u2019s actions.Regardless of an appeal, if Google does not start altering its mobile phone practices in 90 days, it faces penalties of up to 5 percent of the worldwide average daily revenue of its parent company, Alphabet.\u201cAndroid has enabled this and created more choice for everyone, not less,\u201d he added.Yet the ultimate effect of Wednesday\u2019s ruling may be muted given that Europe has largely acted alone in its regulatory actions against Silicon Valley titans, though there have been signs recently of shifting attitudes and a tougher stance by officials in the United States.At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said that the mobile-software market was concentrated and that he spoke with Ms. Vestager on Tuesday.\u201cLet me just say we\u2019re going to read what the E.U. put out very closely,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe European Commission left Google to come up with its own ways to comply with the decision, an approach that critics said gave the company room to soften the blow. Competitors said that after Google was fined \u20ac2.4 billion, or $2.7 billion, in an antitrust case last year for favoring its comparison-shopping service in search results, the company sidestepped the rules. Google has appealed that decision.\u201cGetting a good headline and a big fine is one thing. Fixing the market is quite another,\u201d said Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo, a comparison-shopping site that has filed complaints against Google to regulators.Google\u2019s services remain immensely popular, and its stock price, profits and revenue continue to soar. Since the European Commission began investigating Android three years ago, annual revenue for Alphabet has grown to $111 billion from $75 billion. Google has also strengthened its dominance in the mobile phone market, with more than 1.25 billion Android handsets sold globally last year, according to the research firm IDC.The case underscores the broader challenge regulators face in overseeing the digital economy. By the time the authorities home in on an area deserving of scrutiny, the market may have moved on.\u201cFast-moving markets are where competition law is most important,\u201d said Jonathan Kanter, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss and a former antitrust investigator for the Federal Trade Commission, who has worked for Google competitors including Yelp. But \u201cwhen you have cases that are many years old, you\u2019re fighting old battles instead of the next one.\u201dAt the heart of the European Commission\u2019s case was the question of whether Google had abused its power by forcing handset makers like Samsung, Huawei and HTC to make its Google Search and Chrome browser the default services on Android-based devices in order to gain access to other Google apps.While Google gives Android away to handset makers, those companies must effectively pre-install 11 Google apps on their devices, giving Google\u2019s products far greater reach and more users to click on its ads. The strategy has enabled Google to reach more than a billion monthly users for six products: search, maps, Gmail, YouTube, the Chrome internet browser, and the Google Play app and media store.Now the European authorities are ordering Google to stop tying Google Search and Chrome to the Google Play store. In addition, antitrust officials said Google must stop providing financial incentives to handset makers and wireless carriers to favor its services, a practice the company stopped in 2014.In another remedy, European officials ordered that Google must allow handset manufacturers to create their own versions of Android software, otherwise known as \u201cforks.\u201d Google had previously discouraged the rise of competing smartphone software based on Android by blocking manufacturers\u2019 access to Google apps if they built devices using any alternative versions.The case has parallels to a similarly significant action against Microsoft in the 2000s, when it was heavily penalized in Europe and the United States for using its power in the personal computer market to bundle in its own internet browser, boxing out its rivals. At the time, Google, a young upstart, was among those to complain about Microsoft\u2019s practices.Some Google rivals cheered Wednesday\u2019s decision. Locking handset makers into deals with Google made it \u201cvery challenging to compete,\u201d Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine, said in an interview. \u201cWe would hope the U.S. would ultimately follow suit and take another look at this.\u201dBut handset makers may continue to pre-install Google\u2019s Chrome and Search because consumers like them \u2014 or because Google pays them to do it.\u201cThe reality is there are not that many other players that can compete, so in some ways, I think the E.U. is fighting a battle that\u2019s already over,\u201d said Ben Schachter, a technology analyst at Macquarie Securities.Google could ultimately decide to charge handset makers for using Android in Europe, a policy shift that could drive up the prices of some handsets.Google argued that the European decision was an attack on its ad-based business model. The company said it required handset makers to use its suite of apps as a way of recouping the billions of dollars it spends to make Android. The arrangement, the company said, lets manufacturers compete with Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, by making phones and tablets of various designs and prices, while Google makes money through its services.Mr. Kanter, the lawyer, said that although Google had largely won the battle to embed Android into smartphones, Wednesday\u2019s ruling could limit how the company approached new areas where the software was being used, including automobiles and internet-connected home electronics.The regulatory push in Europe might also influence others around the world to take a tougher look at Silicon Valley, he added.\u201cTo say that any single action by the European Commission is going to stop them is probably na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Kanter said. \u201cBut movements have to start somewhere, and good, strong, persistent, decisive action can over time have an effect.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from Brussels, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.
