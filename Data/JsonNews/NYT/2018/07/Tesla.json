{"Headline": "California Today: Are Criminal Justice Reforms Making the State Safer?", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In less than a decade, California has gone from being a standard-bearer for the ills of prison overcrowding to a national exemplar of reform, letting tens of thousands of people out of prison and reducing penalties for many crimes.Important measures were passed by voters in 2014 and 2016, but only now is research starting to show the effects on crime in California. The new data is fueling a continuing debate, with national implications, about whether California should continue on the path of reform, or take a step back and get tougher, once again, on crime.The overall picture, according to supporters of criminal justice reform, is that crime is at historic lows in California. And they say that even if some categories have increased, such as thefts from automobiles, it hardly justifies a return to the days of mass incarceration.\u201cMy main takeaway is that criminal justice reform is continuing to advance public safety,\u201d said Lenore Anderson, the founder and executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, which has backed reforms.This would represent a threat to one of the signature legacies of outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown, who wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cRead the fine print. This flawed initiative would cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and endanger public safety by restricting parole and undermining inmate rehabilitation.\u201dThe issue is a rare one that crosses party lines. While liberals tend to fall in line for reform, and Republicans are more likely to emphasize prison over rehabilitation, the lines are not clean.One of the new ballot initiative\u2019s top supporters is a Democrat in Sacramento \u2014 Jim Cooper, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy turned assemblyman. And some Republicans, most prominently the former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, have been voices of reform.\u201cThis has never been a left-versus-right issue,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, who noted that in the past, \u201cpoliticians of all stripes rode the bandwagon of increased incarceration.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Daveed Diggs and Rafael Casal have Oakland in their bones.Mr. Diggs, who won a Tony Award in 2016 for his spirited performance as Lafayette and Jefferson in \u201cHamilton,\u201d and Mr. Casal, a spoken-word savant, were both born and bred in the gritty East Bay city.The two men are now the writer-stars of \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d an Oakland-set comic drama that arrives in theaters on July 20.Our reporter called it \u201ca type of primal howl\u201d \u2014 and an apt example of the defiant city\u2019s emergences as an artistic hotbed.Read the full report here.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The $3 Billion Plan to Turn Hoover Dam Into a Giant Battery", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "Hoover Dam was a public works project likened to the pyramids. Now, after channeling a river, what if it could tap the power of the sun and wind?Hoover Dam helped transform the American West, harnessing the force of the Colorado River \u2014 along with millions of cubic feet of concrete and tens of millions of pounds of steel \u2014 to power millions of homes and businesses. It was one of the great engineering feats of the 20th century.Now it is the focus of a distinctly 21st-century challenge: turning the dam into a vast reservoir of excess electricity, fed by the solar farms and wind turbines that represent the power sources of the future.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, an original operator of the dam when it was erected in the 1930s, wants to equip it with a $3 billion pipeline and a pump station powered by solar and wind energy. The pump station, downstream, would help regulate the water flow through the dam\u2019s generators, sending water back to the top to help manage electricity at times of peak demand.The net result would be a kind of energy storage \u2014 performing much the same function as the giant lithium-ion batteries being developed to absorb and release power.The process begins when the dam converts water into energy. Here's how:The Hoover Dam project may help answer a looming question for the energy industry: how to come up with affordable and efficient power storage, which is seen as the key to transforming the industry and helping curb carbon emissions.Because the sun does not always shine, and winds can be inconsistent, power companies look for ways to bank the electricity generated from those sources for use when their output slacks off. Otherwise, they have to fire up fossil-fuel plants to meet periods of high demand.And when solar and wind farms produce more electricity than consumers need, California utilities have had to find ways to get rid of it \u2014 including giving it away to other states \u2014 or risk overloading the electric grid and causing blackouts.\u201cI think we have to look at this as a once-in-a-century moment,\u201d said Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles. \u201cSo far, it looks really possible. It looks sustainable, and it looks clean.\u201dThe target for completion is 2028, and some say the effort could inspire similar innovations at other dams. Enhancing energy storage could also affect plans for billions of dollars in wind projects being proposed by the billionaires Warren E. Buffett and Philip F. Anschutz.But the proposal will have to contend with political hurdles, including environmental concerns and the interests of those who use the river for drinking, recreation and services.In Bullhead City, Ariz., and Laughlin, Nev. \u2014 sister cities on opposite sides of the Colorado, about 90 miles south of the dam \u2014 water levels along certain stretches depend on when dams open and close, and some residents see a change in its flow as a disruption, if not a threat.\u201cAny idea like this has to pass much more than engineering feasibility,\u201d Peter Gleick, a co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a think tank in Oakland, Calif., and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, internationally known for his work on climate issues. \u201cIt has to be environmentally, politically and economically vetted, and that\u2019s likely to prove to be the real problem.\u201dUsing Hoover Dam to help manage the electricity grid has been mentioned informally over the last 15 years. But no one pursued the idea seriously until about a year ago, as California began grappling with the need to better manage its soaring alternative-electricity production \u2014 part of weaning itself from coal-fired and nuclear power plants.In California, by far the leading state in solar power production, that has sometimes meant paying other states to take excess electricity. Companies like Tesla have gotten into the picture, making lithium-ion batteries that are deployed by some utilities, but that form of storage generally remains pricey.Lazard, the financial advisory and asset management firm, has estimated that utility-scale lithium-ion batteries cost 26 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared with 15 cents for a pumped-storage hydroelectric project. The typical household pays about 12.5 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity.Some dams already provide a basis for the Hoover Dam proposal. Los Angeles operates a hydroelectric plant at Pyramid Lake, about 50 miles northwest of the city, that stores energy by using the electric grid to spin a turbine backward and pump water back into the lake.But the Hoover Dam proposal would operate differently. The dam, with its towering 726-foot concrete wall and its 17 power generators that came online in 1936, would not be touched. Instead, engineers propose building a pump station about 20 miles downstream from the main reservoir, Lake Mead, the nation\u2019s largest artificial lake. A pipeline would run partly or fully underground, depending on the location ultimately approved.\u201cHoover Dam is ideal for this,\u201d said Kelly Sanders, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt\u2019s a gigantic plant. We don\u2019t have anything on the horizon as far as batteries of that magnitude.\u201dSri Narayan, a chemistry professor at the university, said his studies of lithium-ion batteries showed that they simply weren\u2019t ready to store the loads needed to manage all of the wind and solar power coming online.\u201cWith lithium-ion batteries, you have durability issues,\u201d Mr. Narayan said. \u201cIf they last five to 10 years, that would be a stretch, especially because we expect to use these facilities at full capacity. It has to be 10 times more durable than it is today.\u201dMr. Narayan said he felt the Hoover Dam project should be given serious consideration because pumped-storage projects had been tested and proven for decades. In a comparison with lithium-ion batteries, he said, \u201cI think the argument is very good.\u201dThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the nation\u2019s largest municipal utility, says its proposal would increase the productivity of the dam, which operates at just 20 percent of its potential, to avoid releasing too much water at once and flooding towns downstream.Engineers have conducted initial feasibility studies, including a review of locations for the pump station that would have as little adverse impact on the environment and nearby communities as possible.But because Hoover Dam sits on federal land and operates under the Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Interior Department, the bureau must back the project before it can proceed.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the concept, but at this point our regional management has not seen the concept in enough detail to know where we would stand on the overall project,\u201d said Doug Hendrix, a bureau spokesman.If the bureau agrees to consider the project, the National Park Service will review the environmental, scientific and aesthetic impact on the downstream recreation area. If the Los Angeles utility receives approval, Park Service officials have told it, the agency wants the pumping operation largely invisible to the public, which could require another engineering feat.Among the considerations is the effect on bighorn sheep that roam Black Canyon, just below the dam, and on drinking water for places like Bullhead City. Some environmentalists worry that adding a pump facility would impair water flow farther downstream, in particular at the Colorado River Delta, a mostly dry riverbed in Mexico that no longer connects to the sea.Another concern is that the pump station would draw water from or close to Lake Mohave, where water enthusiasts boat, fish, ride Jet-Skis, kayak and canoe.Keri Simons, a manager of Watercraft Adventures, a 27-year-old rental business in Laughlin, said water levels already fluctuated in stretches of the Colorado close to the river towns. The smaller Davis Dam, just north of Laughlin, shuts off the flow overnight.One morning this year, the water level just outside town dropped so low that you could walk across the riverbed, Ms. Simons said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t put any boats out until noon,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf the river was a sandbar.\u201dEven if no water is lost because of the pumping project, the thought of any additional stress on the system worries Toby Cotter, the city manager of Bullhead City.The town thrives on the summer tourism that draws some two million visitors to the area for recreation on the greenish-blue waters, Mr. Cotter said. \u201cThat lake is the lifeblood of this community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to see 100 boats on that lake.\u201dEnvironmentalists have been pushing Los Angeles to stop using fossil fuels and produce electricity from alternative sources like solar and wind power. And Mayor Garcetti said he would like his city to be the first in the nation to operate solely on clean energy, while maintaining a reliable electric system.\u201cOur challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?\u201d he said. \u201cStorage helps. There\u2019s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.\u201dBut old wounds are still raw with some along the Colorado. A coal-fired power plant in Laughlin that the Department of Water and Power and other utilities operated was shut down in 2006, costing 500 jobs and causing the local economies to buckle. And a decision long ago to allot Nevada a small fraction of the water that California and Arizona can draw remains a sore point.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on in California with power that has given people who are dealing with them any comfort,\u201d said Joseph Hardy, a Nevada state senator. \u201cI think from a political standpoint, we would have to allay the fears of California, Nevada and Arizona. There will be a myriad of concerns.\u201dThe decision to close the coal plant angered many residents. They wanted the utility to simply add emission-control features known as scrubbers to reduce carbon pollution. The community later hoped a natural-gas plant would replace the coal facility, but Los Angeles could not agree with the local communities on a site.The 2,500-acre parcel where the coal plant stood remains largely vacant. \u201cThere\u2019s still some sting here,\u201d said Mr. Cotter, the Bullhead City official.There have been local efforts to convert the site into a development of housing and businesses \u2014 or to build a solar farm on a plot of land, if Los Angeles would buy the power.Mr. Garcetti said other states and cities had worked with Los Angeles to build economic development projects for their communities, so he would like to consider similar ideas for the Hoover Dam project, as well as ways to benefit the entire region.  \u201cI\u2019m all open ears to what their needs are,\u201d he said.Mr. Hardy is wary of big-city promises. The Department of Water and Power has treated Nevada so cavalierly, he said, that a security guard at the old coal plant site once refused to return a ball to children after it bounced over the property\u2019s fence. He said the guard had told the children\u2019s parents that they could file a claim to get it back \u2014 a process that would take two to three years.\u201cNot the kindest neighbor,\u201d Mr. Hardy said.But he said he was willing to meet with Los Angeles officials to make the project successful.\u201cThe hurdles are minimal and the negotiations simple, as long as everybody agrees with Nevada,\u201d Mr. Hardy said. \u201cIt would be nice if there was a table that they would come to. I\u2019ll provide the table.\u201dSources: The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power; Bureau of ReclamationProduced by Keith Collins, Meg Felling, Whitney Richardson and Josh Williams.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Yourself in Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "PursuitsThe novelist Reif Larsen seeks out sites of reverence in and around this sprawling city, places of quiet contemplation far from the gridlock and glamour.Supported byIt was 3:30 p.m. I was already running half an hour late.

These boulevards offer both the best and worst of the city: there are never any pedestrians; every surface is too bright; every lawn too green, and yet every building, no matter how garish, has some fantastical story to tell if only you stop to listen.The Italian Renaissance Revival villa that houses the Peace Gardens is sandwiched between a Polish shrine to Pope St. John Paul II and a low-slung stucco apartment block that looks like the scene of a murder in a 1930s noir film. The lavish villa was built in 1914 for Secondo Guasti, a penniless Italian immigrant who became California\u2019s largest winemaker despite widespread skepticism at the time that such an industry could ever thrive in the state. In 1974 the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, a new-age church focused on \u201csoul transcendence,\u201d purchased the villa and in 2002 constructed the Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens, optimistically, for a post-9/11 world. The gardens are open to the public by appointment. If possible, try not to miss your appointment because of existential traffic jams.Despite the late hour, I was greeted at the villa\u2019s entrance by a kind man named Juan Roberto.\u201cWe\u2019re very glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. Memories of Interstate 10 bedlam began to evaporate as we promenaded through the compact, tiered garden, serenaded by the gentle babble of small fountains. The Japanese call such walks shinrin-yoku, or \u201cforest bathing.\u201d\u201cThere used to be many more plants, too many plants,\u201d said Juan Roberto. \u201cWe realized you needed open space to reflect.\u201dHe showed me how to walk the labyrinth, a circular pathway of travertine marble. Have you ever walked a labyrinth? Labyrinths, unlike mazes, are unicursal \u2014 they have only one way in and one way out. Each step becomes a purposeful movement. They are an ancient form of meditation; this one is based on the labyrinth at the Chartres Cathedral in France, built in the early 13th century. As you walk, the city becomes a distant dream, a movie half-remembered. In a way, it is bit like the festina lente of Interstate 10, but without the cars, the smog, the man in the neon-yellow Dodge Charger listening to Whitesnake\u2019s \u201cHere I go Again\u201d at peak volume. One way in, one way out.What is strange is that many Angelenos I talked to echoed this view of interstate gridlock as a kind of contemplative lacuna. I was told on multiple occasions that in order to be truly at home in this city, you had to make peace with your commute.\u201cMy car is my safe space,\u201d one person told me.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the podcast,\u201d said another.For many, the car, that private palace of glass and steel, is now the place where we perform the majority of our essential business; the place where we make up, break up, wake up.Maybe it is the East Coaster in me, but I find this slightly dispiriting. Have our automobiles replaced our churches? Can you practice shinrin-yoku in a Chevy? Cars and all their associated infrastructure do not help build communities in cities. For decades, interstates have cleaved open neighborhoods, lowered property values and compounded segregation. What will happen when fully autonomous vehicles arrive on a wide scale and we can finally take our hands off the wheel? Will we binge-watch Netflix shows during our commute? Will we ever get out of our cars again?Then again, places of refuge can take on all forms. Who am I to judge? A sanctuary for one can be a hell for another. In New York City, where space is at a premium, there are strict, unspoken codes of privacy and proximity: you can stand this close in a subway car and this close in an elevator and this close while waiting in line for an egg and cheese. An end seat on the subway becomes a private temple. A pair of earphones offers a vital cocoon of sound. A corner of a closet becomes a consecrated shrine to high-top shoes.In Los Angeles, there is more room to spread out. Aside from the strange liminal anomaly of downtown, Los Angeles is not a vertical city; it is a city of boulevards and interchanges, of 30-foot palm trees and drive-through liquor stores. The quality of life is better. You can have fresh avocados every morning; the weather is like free Xanax; you can take meetings in the morning and be chased by a bobcat in the afternoon. Given such a bounty of natural riches, do Angelenos even need spaces of retreat? Or was the entire city its own surreal sanctuary?Our family stayed at an Airbnb in Echo Park in a little 1920s bungalow nestled behind our hosts\u2019 home. Echo Park is a fairly unique locale in Los Angeles in that you can walk most places. I even saw other people walking on the sidewalk. We made the secret walker sign to one another. As I walked, I noticed the self-contained worlds of people\u2019s forecourts: a petite bench beneath a prolific grapefruit tree, a strange flock of robot sculptures, what looked like the world\u2019s tiniest vineyard. I walked up the hill to Elysian Park and discovered secret, unnamed streets not on any map. Our Airbnb hosts had placed a couple of chairs and a table in the middle of a little dead end to nowhere.Where is your retreat? What do you do to escape from it all?I emerged from the cavernous, Art Deco masterpiece of Union Station into a neighborhood where each shop seemed to be peddling only one thing: the shop selling Jesus statuettes was next to the shop selling giant stuffed bears was next to the shop selling soccer uniforms for babies was next to the shop selling pi\u00f1atas.In recent years there has been a big effort to rejuvenate Downtown Los Angeles. Amid this urban rejuvenation you will find the Last Bookstore, one of the world\u2019s best. In the past, Los Angeles had developed an unfair reputation for being anti-intellectual. In reality, the city is a vibrant, artistic, literary place; perhaps it is the sprawl that makes its various beacons of culture feel like stars in a distant constellation. The list of writers who have attempted to capture the city\u2019s many beguiling contradictions is long and varied: Raymond Chandler, Joan Didion, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathanael West, Charles Bukowski, Eve Babitz.Their ghosts haunt the Last Bookstore. When you enter, you are asked to hand over your backpack. This is ostensibly to prevent shoplifting but it felt more symbolic, as though you must leave any remnant of the outside world behind. As soon as you pass through the front door, it is as if you have entered a different era, before the death of our collective attention. The Last Bookstore is truly a refuge, books literally form walls and windows, archways, tumble off shelves. The place feels like a living, breathing being, with various catacombs and vaults and catwalks that disobey the laws of gravity. I spent all afternoon there, stumbling upon books that I never knew I was missing.Even if Los Angeles crumbled around it\u2014burned up in the wildfires, collapsed in an earthquake, dried up in a drought, was entombed in a mudslide\u2014 the Last Bookstore would still remain. When my backpack was finally returned to me upon my exit, it took a moment to adjust to the idea that I would need such a bag again, that there was still a place outside where backpacks were useful.Across town, far from the urban stage set of downtown, you will find two beautiful, divergent sites of reflection and retreat in the Pacific Palisades.The property was in turn sold to an oil executive who planned on turning the lake into a resort. Except then he began having this recurring dream in which he had transformed the site into a Church of All Religions. The oil executive looked up \u201cChurch of All Religions\u201d in the phone book (this was back when people looked in phone books) and found Yogananda, who somehow already knew he would be calling. Yogananda accepted the property and constructed a temple, a meditation garden and a peace memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.I visited the Lake Shrine on a cold, misty day, more reminiscent of San Francisco than Los Angeles. The houseboat is still there. The windmill has been transformed into a meditation chapel. Somehow they fit perfectly within this hodgepodge of serene spirituality. It is a collage of eclectic yet entangled visions and in this way it feels very \u201cL.A.\u201dI wandered the path of the lake, stumbling upon people in various states of contemplation. Two enlightened swans floated by. I wondered if they were paid actors.The house is actually two rectangular cubes of glass, quietly set into the hillside. The open, modular floor plans are filled with the delectable detritus of a lifetime of thinking and designing: African masks, bright Afghan textiles, little prototypes for toys never built. It is the urtext, what every midcentury modern space before and since aspires to be.Crucially, the attention of the house is not focused on itself but on its serene surrounds, a little wild meadow surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus trees, the ocean just visible beyond.This was their retreat, their \u201cshock absorber,\u201d as they termed it, from the outside world. But it was also a place of work. One of the cubes functioned as their studio, a space of collaboration and experimentation where their colleagues would come and get messy. And it is this duality that I am most drawn to: that a private space of contemplation can also be a place of intense activation. A retreat is not so much a retreat but a re-turn, a re-think, a re-view, in its literal sense. All my best ideas come when I have stepped away from my office, when I am in the shower or running or shinrin-yoku-ing and have a chance to view my work from a new angle. I have learned to keep little notebooks in strange places. Every car in Los Angeles should come equipped with a Dictaphone in the glovebox.The most profound retreat from the city remains actually retreating from the city. So when the weekend rolled round we made like the locals and fled the City of Angels for the temptations of the high desert.

He had plans to construct a multiple wave oscillator that would utilize a high voltage Tesla coil to rejuvenate biological tissue. Twenty-minute intervals inside the dome would allegedly add years to one\u2019s life. Unfortunately, Van Tassel was never able to test his machine as he died of a heart attack just before its opening in 1978. The machine\u2019s plans then mysteriously disappeared.Today the Integratron is owned by three sisters originally from Long Island. For the last 15 years they have been performing sound baths in the \u201cacoustically perfect\u201d dome using a series of quartz singing bowls that are precisely tuned to the body\u2019s seven chakras. Apparently Angelenos\u2019 chakras are way out of whack; these sound baths are booked months in advance.As you prepare for your sound bath, there is a little courtyard of hammocks and junkyard art where you can lounge, dream, pant. A statue of the Virgin Mary sits among a cactus grove.When it was finally my turn, I entered the Integratron alongside my fellow sound bathers \u2014 hipsters, Mormons, surfers, aliens, a pro basketball player \u2014 and lay down on my mat, ears turned heavenward.Gradually I relaxed, accepting this sonic intrusion. Then, welcoming it. The bath lasts about 25 minutes; only a dozen or so extended notes are played on the bowls during this time. After it was all done, when I finally managed to extricate myself from the dome\u2019s embrace, I had trouble walking a straight line. My chakras had not been bathed, they had been power washed.As I was leaving, I overheard a couple arguing whether they could make it back to the city in time to catch their favorite yoga class.

{"Headline": "Tesla Achieves a Key Weekly Goal for Producing Its Model 3", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla says it has reached a manufacturing milestone, producing more than 5,000 Model 3 sedans in a week. Now the electric-car maker must prove it\u2019s not a one-time achievement.The company is counting on the Model 3, its first mass-market vehicle, to increase revenue and offset the billions of dollars it has been spending to set up a huge battery plant in Nevada and begin making the Model 3 at its car plant in Fremont, Calif., as well as to develop new vehicles.For now, however, the automaker is celebrating. Tesla said it produced more than 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the last seven days of June, a goal that its chief executive, Elon Musk, has said is crucial to its bid to turn a profit in this year\u2019s final two quarters.\u201cWe either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible,\u201d Mr. Musk told employees Sunday in an email, adding, \u201cI think we just became a real car company.\u201dInvestors initially reacted favorably to the production report, sending Tesla shares up in morning trading, but the stock finished the day more than 2 percent lower at $335.07.Tesla has been struggling with bottlenecks and other glitches in its Model 3 assembly process. Mr. Musk had once foreseen making 20,000 Model 3s a month by last December, but in the entire fourth quarter Tesla produced fewer than 2,500. Since then it has refrained from making annual projections for the vehicle.The company has streamlined its production line by replacing complicated robotic machinery with human workers. In June, Tesla erected a giant tent just outside the walls of the Fremont plant, where it cobbled together a new production line to hasten final assembly of the cars.The assembly problems had mostly plagued two Model 3 final assembly lines Tesla has set up inside the plant, although there were also production slowdowns in the paint shop.With the three assembly lines running, Tesla built 5,031 Model 3s in the final seven days of June; about 20 percent came from the line set up in the tent outside the plant. It also made nearly 2,000 other vehicles \u2014 the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle.Tesla\u2019s challenge is to prove that it can produce more than 5,000 Model 3s week after week. A company spokesman said Tesla had to operate the assembly line 24 hours a day to reach the seven-day total.Automakers typically cannot run plants around the clock for long periods because they need to stop production to maintain the machinery. Workers also become fatigued if required to work six or seven days a week. Nonetheless, Tesla said it expected to produce 6,000 Model 3s a week by late next month.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the numbers really represent reality or sustainability,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cYou have to keep a critical eye on them. There is a history with Tesla, and we\u2019ve been told a lot of things about Model 3 targets in the last year that haven\u2019t proven accurate.\u201dAlarmed by both the cash burn and the lagging increase in assembling Model 3s, Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating in March.In the second quarter, Tesla produced 28,578 Model 3s, about three times as many as in the first quarter, the company said. Output for the Model S and Model X totaled 24,761 combined. The overall output of 53,339 was a 55 percent jump from the first quarter.Tesla delivered just 18,440 Model 3s to customers in the quarter, and 11,166 were in transit, a result of having increased production so late in the quarter. Combined deliveries for the Model S and X came to 22,300 vehicles.Tesla has delivered 28,386 Model 3s to date and has reservations for approximately 420,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Even Apartment Dwellers Can Use Solar Power", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore New York homeowners have tapped into solar power in recent years, as regulations have eased and prices have dropped. But apartment dwellers, for the most part, have been kept in the dark.These community groups essentially broker the sale of solar power to a local electrical company, which in turn gives the group\u2019s members a discount on their electricity bills. Each member\u2019s discount varies depending on the size of the group\u2019s solar array system \u2014 that is, a combination of several solar panels \u2014 and the number of members in the group.Most groups have a four-prong system that connects a host, sponsor, utility and customers. A host or a commercial building owner either buys its own solar array system or leases its rooftop space to a sponsor that will design, operate and maintain a system. The sponsor then sells the solar energy produced as solar credits to a utility, which in New York City\u2019s case is Consolidated Edison.The terms, rates, and offerings differ from group to group. Some require a customer to agree to a rate-lock, or a fixed rate for electrical consumption over several years. Others may charge a yearly membership fee. Customers who opt into community solar groups are never disconnected from ConEd, and will continue to pay connectivity and other charges through a bill from the subscription manager.Mr. Dalaeli said IPPsolar\u2019s first group has month-to-month contracts, and the account can be transferred to a different address if the customer moves within the five boroughs. The number of subscribers in a group will be capped at 25 households so the firm can ensure a discount to everyone.\u201cAs the concept of community solar gets accepted further, we\u2019ll be able to build larger systems and that will help expand the number of people that can be part of a group,\u201d he said.\u201cIf I see that I\u2019m saving money, I can use that to train and hire more people,\u201d said Mr. Rogers, who considers himself environmentally conscious (he drives a Tesla). He said that several area business owners are keen to see how the system pans out for him before leasing their own rooftop spaces.\u201cI love everything about community solar, so I don\u2019t mind being the guinea pig,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m expecting solar power will be a main energy source for many communities in the future, so joining a community solar group is my vote for that,\u201d said Mr. Weiss, whose solar power comes from an array atop a building in Gowanus, Brooklyn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Big Red Flag\u2019: Automakers\u2019 Trade Secrets Exposed in Data Leak", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAutomakers like Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen go to great lengths to keep their technical information confidential. Details about assembly line machinery and proprietary robotics are among the industry\u2019s most closely guarded trade secrets.But this month, a security researcher came across tens of thousands of sensitive corporate documents \u2014 including many from nearly all of the largest auto manufacturers \u2014 on the open internet, unprotected. The trove included material from more than 100 companies that had interacted with a small Canadian company, Level One Robotics and Controls.Among the documents were detailed blueprints and factory schematics; client materials such as contracts, invoices and work plans; and even dozens of nondisclosure agreements describing the sensitivity of the exposed information.\u201cThat was a big red flag,\u201d said Chris Vickery, the researcher who found the data. \u201cIf you see NDAs, you know right away that you\u2019ve found something that\u2019s not supposed to be publicly available.\u201dIt was unclear whether anyone else had seen or downloaded the unguarded data, which included some personal information, such as scanned driver\u2019s licenses and passports, on Level One employees but otherwise appeared to be confined to corporate secrets. Mr. Vickery alerted the company last week, and the exposed information was taken offline within a day.But the inadvertent exposure of customers\u2019 data illustrates a problem confounding businesses: Some of their biggest security risks come from their suppliers and contractors.Fifty-six percent of the businesses polled last year by Ponemon Institute, a security research firm, said they had at some point experienced a data breach linked to a vendor. The exposure only grows as more third-party companies gain access: The survey\u2019s respondents said an average of 470 outside companies had access to their sensitive corporate information, up from around 380 a year earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively recently that C-level executives have begun to acknowledge that some of their third-party relationships are creating unbelievable risk,\u201d said Larry Ponemon, the research firm\u2019s founder.\u201cNo one wants their data outside of their own company,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that showcases how they manufacture is proprietary and competitive.\u201dMr. Vickery found Level One\u2019s data through an exposed backup server. It required no password or special access permissions, he said. Anyone who connected could download the material, which totaled at least 157 gigabytes and contained nearly 47,000 files filled with factory records and diagrams from companies including Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.Milan Gasko, Level One\u2019s chief executive, declined to discuss the details of the exposed information.\u201cLevel One takes these allegations very seriously and is diligently working to conduct a full investigation of the nature, extent and ramifications of this alleged data exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to preserve the integrity of this investigation, we will not be providing comment at this time.\u201dMr. Gasko said it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the data had been viewed by any outside parties other than Mr. Vickery, but he did not address questions about whether Level One has tools in place to detect unauthorized access.Level One was founded in 2000 in Windsor, Ontario, and opened an American office six years later outside Detroit. The company provides engineering services, with a focus on robotics and automation, to manufacturing companies, according to its website.Officials from General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen declined to comment on the data exposure. Fiat Chrysler, Ford and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Researchers like Mr. Vickery often face skepticism, and criticism, from the companies that they notify about exposed data \u2014 no business likes to get a phone call telling it that it has revealed sensitive information. But publicizing data breaches is an effective way to get other companies to combat them, he said.\u201cNothing gets better in silence, as far as cybersecurity goes,\u201d Mr. Vickery said. \u201cHuman nature is to try to sweep things under the rug.

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Latest Aim: Build 500,000 Cars a Year in China", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill scrambling to sort out production problems at its electric car factory in California, Tesla is taking on another big challenge: building a vast new plant and development center in China.The automaker said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with the Chinese authorities to build a battery and automobile factory in Shanghai \u2014 its first plant outside the United States \u2014 that would eventually be capable of producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year.Tesla said it expected to begin construction as soon as it had obtained the necessary approvals and permits. \u201cFrom there, it will take roughly two years until we start producing vehicles and then another two to three years before the factory is fully ramped up,\u201d the company said in a statement.Setting up a plant in China will not be easy, and one of the toughest parts may be finding executives to manage the effort, said Ron Harbour, at auto-manufacturing expert at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. \u201cThey are trying to get going in California, so who are they going to send overseas to do the same thing?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the question in my mind. You usually want to get it right at home first.\u201dThe investment in China is the latest initiative that Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has announced with lofty ambitions, some of which he has fallen well short of achieving.Last fall, he unveiled a battery-powered semi truck that he said Tesla would begin producing by the end of 2019. The truck is now being redesigned, and no plans have been announced for a factory to produce it.And Mr. Musk has also promised that Tesla would produce a version of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3 sedan, costing $35,000. So far, the only versions available sell for $49,000 and up.Tesla has reported losses every year since it was founded in 2003. In recent months, analysts have become worried about its finances and the slow pace of Model 3 production. Moody\u2019s Investor Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating over concerns about how much cash the company is using up.China is a key growth market for Tesla, and the world\u2019s largest market for electric vehicles. The government there subsidizes and promotes the production and sale of electric cars as part of its efforts to improve air quality and cut tailpipe emissions.Tesla began selling cars in China in 2013 and has set up 35 sales centers and some 1,200 charging stations in the country. It sold about 15,000 cars there last year, according to estimates by LMC Automotive.Tesla said its Shanghai-based initiative would include a research-and-development center and a sales operation. The local government said it would be the largest manufacturing project backed by foreign investment in Shanghai\u2019s history.A Tesla spokesman said the plant would not affect the company\u2019s American operations and was not a response to the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China. But a Tesla factory in China is most likely not something the Trump administration wants to see.Even before the recent escalation in trade tensions, China\u2019s tariffs were an issue for Tesla. \u201cThe current rules make things very difficult,\u201d Mr. Musk lamented on Twitter in March about the 25 percent tariff on cars imported from the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.\u201dFor Tesla, building cars in China would inoculate it against the effects of a trade fight and put the company close to China\u2019s huge automotive supply chain. Even more important, it would provide a firmer foothold in a potentially vast market. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market after the United States; its revenue there doubled to $2 billion last year.China has a number of electric-car makers, but they tend to make smaller, more affordable vehicles that lack the polish of Tesla\u2019s offerings. The American-made cars can frequently be seen in some of the more upscale areas of Beijing and Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Suspicious Minds", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "Mingling with wariness and wonder at a conference devoted to \u201cAncient Aliens.\u201dSupported byEveryone had questions: about whether we were alone in the universe; about what our government really knows; about humanity\u2019s very origins.And there are so many people ready to believe that aliens visited Earth before recorded history that some 10,000 attendees paid to visit this conference over three days.In the audience was Chris Bayley, a neatly dressed lawyer who had traveled from Arizona with his two adult sons. \u201cJust because someone says the Egyptians made the temples with ropes and wooden rollers doesn\u2019t make it true,\u201d Mr. Bayley said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t accept blindly things we\u2019ve been taught by quote-unquote scientists.\u201dEarlier that morning, a woman had risen from the crowd and told the \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d producers: \u201cI\u2019m indoctrinating my children in your show so they\u2019ll ask questions and not believe everything they\u2019re told.\u201dDuring the question-and-answer period, a wheelchair-bound man of about 60 was handed a microphone. He asked, \u201cDo you believe we are indigenous to this planet?\u201dThe man in the wheelchair waited along with the crowd to hear if Earth was in fact our ancestral home. Behind the speakers\u2019 table, Mr. Tsoukalos leaned in and, as he so often does on TV, made an incredible claim with total confidence and a goofy grin. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cExactly,\u201d the man said, and practically dropped the mic. The book\u2019s Swiss author, Erich von D\u00e4niken, flew 12 hours from Zurich with his ponytailed young assistant, Ramon, to speak at AlienCon. Eighty-three and slightly stooped, he still works every day, he told me backstage on Day 1, crisscrossing the globe \u201clike a missionary.\u201dWith his severe Swiss-German accented English and tetchy impatience with critics, Mr. von D\u00e4niken is now, with the visibly amped Mr. Tsoukalos, one of the familiar personalities of \u201cAncient Aliens.\u201d Before \u201cAncient Aliens,\u201d these believers had been scattered on the margins, hawking their ideas at small gatherings in the Nevada desert. Now they\u2019d been unified under one tent and given a podium by a network with the sheen of educational TV. Did that awesome responsibility temper them? Here\u2019s Mr. Childress, in an episode from Season 10 called \u201cThe Alien Architects\u201d: \u201cSo here we have an ancient grid structure, probably built by extraterrestrials, possibly to power their craft, that\u2019s now being reconstructed today by the military.\u201dFor Kevin Burns, naysayers like Mr. Vacker add little to the discussion. A veteran TV producer who is often confused with the highbrow filmmaker Ken Burns (\u201cI do the ones in color,\u201d he likes to say), he was old enough to remember \u201cChariots of the Gods?\u201d and to notice similarities with the 2008 movie \u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\u201d which Lucasfilm hired him to promote with a TV special. Initially, Mr. Burns included skeptics on the show. But, he said, \u201cwe found that they had nothing to say, other than, \u2018There\u2019s no proof, there\u2019s no proof.\u2019 If we were going to do a show about the birth of Jesus, would we have people who say, \u2018This is ridiculous?\u2019 No.\u201d The invocation of religion is deliberate. In Mr. Burns\u2019s view, \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d succeeds because it explores spirituality and the mystery of life in an increasingly secular, data-driven culture. Like religion, it offers seekers an origin story. \u201cIt\u2019s not about little green men in outer space. That\u2019s the three-headed snake lady that gets you into the tent,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a show about looking for God. Science would have you believe we are the result of nothing more than a chance assemblage of matter. The real truth is we don\u2019t know.\u201d The questions posed by the ancient astronaut theorists, however far-fetched, serve a rare purpose, according to Mr. Burns: \u201cIt allows the audience to wonder. And very few things on television do that.\u201d In the long line of fans who had paid $25 to get Giorgio\u2019s autograph was Fabian Garcia, who had come with his daughter, Amanda, and young grandsons, Ashton and Cruz. Mr. Garcia said he wanted to get the full story from the \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d producers and cast. \u201cI want to go, \u2018What else can\u2019t you show?\u2019\u201d Over dinner at a Greek cafe in Old Pasadena on the eve of the convention, Mr. Tsoukalos insisted he never intended to become a media personality. \u201cI never sought out to be on TV,\u201d he said. He was wearing what for him passed as a celebrity disguise: a hat. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally weird experience.\u201d As if to illustrate the point, a woman approached us on the patio and said, \u201cExcuse me. I love the show,\u201d then tried to palm him a $100 bill to buy his dinner. He politely declined. What did they see in him?He felt, accurately, he was being mocked. A frequent criticism had it that he wasn\u2019t qualified to appear on \u201cAncient Aliens.\u201d Unfair, really, since M.I.T. isn\u2019t giving out Ph.D.s in ancient astronaut theory. Mr. Tsoukalos discovered Mr. von D\u00e4niken\u2019s books as a boy growing up in Switzerland, at 14 \u2014 the ideal indoctrination age, judging by the many convention-goers who said they\u2019d also latched onto \u201cChariots\u201d in junior high school. Later, he courted Mr. von D\u00e4niken as a mentor, and earned a degree in communications from Ithaca College. What was he if not a communicator? One sensed he was making decent bank in this field. He has become a co-executive producer of \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d and travels far and wide filming the show. But does he really believe this stuff? You couldn\u2019t fake the fire in his eyes. Even before our moussaka arrived, he was lecturing me on prehistoric man\u2019s contact with aliens: \u201cThey came down from the sky and said, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t know how to make fire? Let us show you.\u2019\u201dBut, he wanted New York Times readers to know, \u201cI\u2019m a skeptic. I don\u2019t buy everything hook, line and sinker. There\u2019s a lot of weird stuff out there, man.\u201d He mentioned the flat-earth believers. \u201cAnd then for people to argue, \u2018Well, you believe in ancient astronauts so the flat earth isn\u2019t too far-off.\u2019 That\u2019s what I have to deal with. It\u2019s, like, the two are not even related! They\u2019re not even in the same category!\u201dHe sipped his wine and with all seriousness said, \u201cI\u2019m a forensics guy. I need to touch, measure, feel and see things.\u201d When I\u2019d arrived, Mr. Feder, 65, had shown me his worn paperback of \u201cChariots of the Gods?\u201d which he had read as a child of the \u201960s along with occultish books on witchcraft and reincarnation. But in college, he said, he took classes with Pedro Armillas, a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican scholar, and moved away from mythology into the science camp. \u201cA lot of the ancient alien stuff relies on willful ignorance and temporal chauvinism\u201d \u2014 a disbelief that ancient people were capable of complex feats of engineering, Mr. Feder said. \u201cI\u2019d read that the building of the Mayan temples was a mystery and think, \u2018Why don\u2019t you ask Professor Armillas? He knows exactly how it was done.\u201d Many of his colleagues in the academy thought it \u201cbetter not to engage,\u201d Mr. Feder said. \u201cMy feeling was it\u2019s a big mistake to ignore this stuff.\u201d The way Mr. von D\u00e4niken gathered evidence \u2014 \u201cI look worldwide for facts and indications that prove my theory,\u201d he told a Swiss newspaper \u2014 was the opposite of the scientific method. But, he added, \u201cScience is all about evidence. The bar has to be higher than Giorgio walking around going, \u2018How did they do that? The rocks are so heavy.\u2019\u201d Confronted by the filmmakers, Mr. von D\u00e4niken admitted that a piece of evidence in \u201cChariots\u201d \u2014 a photo purported to be a spaceship parking bay on the Nazca Plain in Peru \u2014 was \u201cridiculous.\u201d As a writer, he said, sometimes he was \u201csimply stimulating the reader, and one is allowed to do this.\u201dBut in presenting an alternate view of history (\u201cOur past is way different than what we\u2019re being taught in school,\u201d Mr. Tsoukalos told viewers in Season 1, Episode 1), \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d had come to mean something for a population who felt duped by the so-called experts. Chris Bayley, the lawyer from Arizona, told me that although he\u2019d been a good sheep in childhood, the truth was, even back then he had doubted the version of the world he was taught. \u201cThe show helped validate for me that suspicion,\u201d he said. The show had long ago run out of pyramids. It was getting further out in what it covered, mirroring modern life itself. Astronomers were discovering weekly new planets in the habitable zone, emboldening the ancient astronaut theorists. All these creatively connected dots, these ever-expanding cottage theories discussed by the cast members, it was affecting them. \u201cI\u2019ve always been open-minded, clearly,\u201d Mr. Tsoukalos said. But lately, he had become even more so; he had been considering \u201cthe nonphysical realm\u201d \u2014 aliens as \u201csomething completely ethereal, beings of light.\u201d Audiences were being radically opened, too. Something had come unanchored. It was inevitable where things were headed. The moment came at one of the \u201cAncient Aliens\u201d cast panels, during questions from the audience. Everyone listened uncomfortably to a man who spoke at length, in an agitated voice, about certain flaws he\u2019d discovered in the hard sciences. \u201cSir, sir, sir. Do you have a question?\u201d Mr. Burns interrupted. The man exclaimed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you challenge physics and math?\u201d Advertisement"}

It turns out they didn\u2019t need it.So he left it there, \u201cin case it may be useful in the future,\u201d he said on Twitter.Once the last four boys, their soccer coach and military personnel were evacuated Tuesday, Thai officials said in a Facebook post that the mission was complete. It had taken 18 days, dozens of divers and hundreds of volunteers, but Mr. Musk\u2019s mini-submarine invention was left on the sidelines, a Thai official said.Mr. Musk himself was on the scene. He wrote in a tweet early on Tuesday local time that he had just returned from a large cavern in the Tham Luang cave complex where he had deposited the quickly assembled sub. \u201cIt is made of rocket parts,\u201d he explained. \u201cLeaving here in case it may be useful in the future.\u201dOn Tuesday, the head of the search operation, Narongsak Osottanakorn, until recently the provincial governor, rejected the notion that Mr. Musk\u2019s custom-made submersible was suitable for the extraction.\u201cI assure you that the equipment he brought to help us is not practical for our mission,\u201d Mr. Narongsak said. \u201cEven though the equipment has state of the art technology, it does not fit our mission in the cave.\u201dMr. Musk had mused on Twitter that they could build a \u201ctiny, kid-sized submarine\u201d with a part from a Falcon rocket, which SpaceX produces. He had said that a transfer tube, which helps move liquid oxygen to fuel the rocket\u2019s engine, could serve as the body of the submarine.Mr. Musk\u2019s representatives did not make him available for comment, but a SpaceX spokesman said that divers with the mission had signed off on the efforts.\u201cMultiple divers involved with the rescue said the mini-sub design was viable, and their feedback directly informed our engineering and testing,\u201d he said.The company did not immediately respond to a follow-up question about whether it planned to remove the abandoned submarine from the cave area.In his tweets amid the rescue, Mr. Musk presented his own evidence that team leaders had welcomed his help. He said of Mr. Narongsak: \u201cThe former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as \u2018rescue chief\u2019) is not the subject matter expert.\u201dBut a spokesman for Mr. Stanton said Tuesday that the cave proved to be too narrow for the mini-submarine.Muktita Suhartono reported from Mae Sai, Thailand, and Julia Jacobs from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lakeith Stanfield Is Playing Us All", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "The new symbol of Hollywood weird, who is starring in \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d refuses to be categorized as part of a movement. \u201cI\u2019m just doing me.\u201dSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Lakeith Stanfield was 20 and working at a marijuana grow house, he concluded that the plants in his care were conscious beings he was exchanging ideas with. That this realization came when he was really high didn\u2019t make it less lasting or less real. Mr. Stanfield loves plants, feels for them, because, he said, \u201cthey are a pure life, and they do not talk,\u201d and laments that his busy work schedule prevents him from keeping any at home. \u201cI travel too much,\u201d he said in a recent interview here, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to put plants through that.\u201dThis sentiment goes a ways to explaining Mr. Stanfield\u2019s singular allure, but it doesn\u2019t go all the way, because no anecdote ever could. It also could have sprung from the lips of Darius, the riveting, tender oddball Mr. Stanfield plays on \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Donald Glover\u2019s groundbreaking television show. In someone else\u2019s hands, Darius could have been limited to the goofy comic sidekick. Played by Mr. Stanfield, he was empathic, nuanced and complex. For audiences, this was a revelation. Empathic, nuanced, complex male black characters haven\u2019t exactly been saturating American screens.\u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d is about a black telemarketer, Cassius Green (Mr. Stanfield), whose sales skyrocket after he begins talking like a white man (voiced by David Cross). Absurdism ensues. Mr. Riley cast Mr. Stanfield after telling him he\u2019d have to appear in a nonsexual full frontal nude scene. \u201cHe cut me off and said, \u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for a film with full frontal nudity,\u2019\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cI said, \u2018O.K., this is the guy. This is the right kind of crazy.\u2019\u201d The scene ended up being scrapped. Mr. Riley had written it to show Cassius at his most vulnerable. Mr. Stanfield was at his most vulnerable every day.Mr. Stanfield, who is 26, met to chat in a cafe not far from his presumably plantless North Hollywood home. His velvety eyes were a dialed down version of the peepers he wields to astonishing effect onscreen, where they seem to bare every twitch of his soul. He had folded his tall, super-lanky self into a corner table, where he was digging into a grilled salmon salad he had greeted with an appreciative Kanye-inspired yip, \u201cNow I shall channel dragon energy!\u201d Around his neck were yellow mala beads, a gift from Brian Tyree Henry, who plays Paper Boi on \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and counts among Mr. Stanfield\u2019s rarefied group of close friends.Mr. Stanfield also brought along rose-colored granny glasses, which he described as \u201cmy soul realized in third-dimensional space.\u201d They put him in the zone, he said, and he planned to wear them for every interview from here on out, so long as he didn\u2019t lose them, which he tended to do with most of his things.The harmless antics are also part of his plan for self-preservation, pushback against the claustrophobic feeling he can get when the news media zeros in. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to come to understand it so I can play with it, without feeling like it\u2019s trying to play me,\u201d he said. He sees the Hollywood hoopla as the shadow side of success, but maybe a necessary one. \u201cThe reason why being pure can be something is because there are things that aren\u2019t that,\u201d he said. Still, he\u2019s a loner who needs seclusion and doesn\u2019t quite understand why anyone would be so interested in his life. \u201cMost of the time when you get into something, it\u2019s, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re human, it\u2019s boring,\u2019\u201d he said.Which may be true, except it doesn\u2019t remotely apply to him.When Mr. Cretton, the director, visited and saw Mr. Stanfield\u2019s Victorville bedroom, he said he knew that Mr. Stanfield would\u2019ve been creative whether Hollywood scooped him up or not.\u201cIt was, \u2018Oh my God, this guy is legit, this is an artist from the core of who he is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cretton said.In high school, Mr. Stanfield joined the drama club (that would be the extent of his acting training), and, after landing a role in \u201cHonk! The Musical\u201d playing the frog, resolved to become an actor. A photographer who took his headshots was encouraging, to a point. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yeah man, I think you\u2019re going to be good. You have this real disenfranchised look and feel about you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stanfield recalled. Mr. Stanfield didn\u2019t know what that meant, so he asked his mom. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018it\u2019s not a good thing.\u2019\u201dIf others rolled their eyes at Mr. Stanfield\u2019s acting dreams, his mother believed in him and called him her superstar. Part of their connection was forged by pain. Mr. Stanfield said he would get involved when his mother and stepfather fought, and scream at him to leave her alone. When she could, she would drive him to Los Angeles for auditions. When she couldn\u2019t, Mr. Stanfield tried to hustle up money for the train. And when there were no lawns to mow or cars to wash, he\u2019d panhandle.Around 2012, Mr. Cretton found the financing to make his short into a feature, and put new actors \u2014 among them Brie Larson and Rami Malek \u2014 in every role. But no one felt right for Mr. Stanfield\u2019s old part. And Mr. Stanfield was nowhere to be found. He\u2019d fired his manager, and dropped his old email and phone number. Mr. Cretton eventually tracked him down on a messaging board. Mr. Stanfield drove down with his mom from Victorville, riven with certainty. \u201cNever was I more ready,\u201d he said. He read through a few scenes in Mr. Cretton\u2019s living room, and when he looked up, he saw Mr. Cretton was in tears.And finally, someone did.It\u2019s hard to capture in words the place Mr. Stanfield goes to in his performances, where everything gets stripped away except for something so intense and pure it vibrates off the screen. In acting lingo, he is wide open. Mr. Riley, the director, said Mr. Stanfield feels everything his character feels, and also doesn\u2019t give a fig what that might look like. \u201cHe\u2019s raw, he\u2019s experiencing something that needs to be felt right then,\u201d he said. Hiro Murai, who has directed the majority of \u201cAtlanta\u2019s\u201d episodes, said Mr. Stanfield was the most intuitive performer he\u2019s worked with yet. \u201cHe sort of lets himself free-fall in the moment,\u201d Mr. Murai wrote in an email. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless that way.\u201dMr. Stanfield can\u2019t fully explain his process himself, or how he gets there. That\u2019s why he likes symbols so much, he said, and has them tattooed on his fingers, arms and neck: the sign of Saturn, a fire tetrahedron, a dagger-slash-cross. They mean something and make him feel something that language can\u2019t describe.Armie Hammer, who plays a twisted corporate titan in \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d said he quickly realized during filming that he hadn\u2019t a clue what direction Mr. Stanfield would go with his character next. There were moments when he was so taken with Mr. Stanfield\u2019s performance that he almost fell out of the scene. Off-camera, he found Mr. Stanfield equally mystifying. One day, Mr. Stanfield showed up on set and announced that his Tesla\u2019s windshield had been smashed in. Mr. Hammer\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI said, \u2018You drive a Tesla?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hammer recalled. \u201c\u2018I picture you riding a unicorn to work. Or 300 Pomeranians harnessed to a chariot.\u2019\u201dA few highlights from Mr. Stanfield\u2019s still short dazzler of a career:Mr. Stanfield saw the piece and said he hated being dissected. \u201cI\u2019m not coming in with an intention game,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing me.\u201d If people were surprised by it, he said, it\u2019s more a testament to a narrow-minded perception; because everyone feels strange, whether they admit to it or not. In fact, maybe it\u2019s a little strange not to feel weird, existing in this world. All he knows is that when he\u2019s acting, he\u2019s doing what he feels, which takes him to places that we all go to but rarely reveal.Mr. Stanfield may not want to be the symbol for black weird, or for anything, but people close to him said he was part of a profound shift around black identity.\u201cHe\u2019s interested in being weird and holding that space that, particularly for artists of color, hasn\u2019t always been accessible,\u201d said Tessa Thompson, who plays Cassius\u2019 performance-artist girlfriend in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201d She added, \u201cThe folks that take that and own that, those outliers, are remarkable, and really important culturally.\u201dThose outliers include Mr. Riley, Mr. Glover and Issa Rae (\u201cInsecure\u201d), who have helped create a moment that Mr. Stanfield has met perfectly, even if he won\u2019t embrace what it means for most everyone else. \u201cI\u2019m a black man and I love being a black man,\u201d he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be categorized as being a conscious part of a movement.\u201dMr. Stanfield was dancing drunkenly at a party when Mr. Glover approached him about the part of Darius, a non sequitur-spouting stoner whose bon mots include \u201cCan I measure your tree?\u201d His first thought after reading the script was that this guy was an idiot. \u201cWho\u2019d want to play him?\u201d he asked himself. But he soon came to see Darius as a mad, beautiful genius, one he drew solace from. \u201cI tapped into this beautiful space that you can live in,\u201d Mr. Stanfield said. \u201cWhen I go into \u2018Atlanta,\u2019 I can go into that world. It\u2019s just like everything\u2019s O.K., everything\u2019s free, and there\u2019s not a worry in the world.\u201dOutside the Studio City cafe, night had fallen, and Mr. Stanfield\u2019s mind was flitting to his mother, who was at his home, visiting from Victorville. After \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d opens, he\u2019ll have a breather before his next film, \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d is released this fall. He was looking forward to getting back to his private life, to puttering around, painting, reading \u2014 he was rereading Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s \u201cOutliers\u201d \u2014 and hanging with his girlfriend, the actress Xosha Roquemore, and their baby, who was born last year, and whose name and gender, per Mr. Stanfield\u2019s desire, have been kept under wraps.Mr. Stanfield told me he suspects he might have unwittingly forecast the entry of Ms. Roquemore and their baby into his life. When he moved to North Hollywood, he drew a Saturn on his vision board, and he said that Ms. Roquemore was a Sagittarius and that the baby was born in Saturn, and it all felt connected. \u201cThat was me seeing it before it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI often have these times when I\u2019m moved by the spirit of something I don\u2019t understand.\u201dHe\u2019d lost me a bit, but that was beside the point.

{"Headline": "The Latest Hot E-Commerce Idea in China: The Bargain Bin", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Apple, Gucci, Tesla. Many Chinese shoppers love their top-shelf brands.But another big slice of the population goes gaga for a 40-cent pair of earrings, a $1.50 wireless smartphone charger and 50 rolls of toilet paper for $4.75.These are the shoppers on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app that drew close to 350 million customers in the past year, more than the entire population of the United States. Its parent company is expected to list shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, just three years into its existence.They live outside the country\u2019s prosperous megacities, in the cities, towns and hamlets that over a billion Chinese call home. They skew older, less internet savvy. And they absolutely cannot resist a bargain, even if the stuff they\u2019re buying isn\u2019t exactly top of the line.In the southern city of Foshan, Li Tianqiang and his wife sell rice noodles and other breakfast food out of a three-wheeled truck to hungry factory workers. Over the past two years, Mr. Li, 45, has bought nearly $1,000 worth of merchandise on Pinduoduo \u2014 the equivalent of around two months\u2019 income for him. Among his purchases: an inflatable paddle boat, a fishing bag and a cherry-red motorized car for his young daughter to drive around.Mr. Li knows he is a little addicted. And regretted purchases? He has a few.Some were made out of curiosity. In other cases, the items were of such lousy quality that he threw them out after they arrived. The toys he has bought for his daughter \u2014 including dolls, a violin and a keyboard \u2014 have been particularly bad, he said.It is all so inexpensive, though, that he said he didn\u2019t mind the occasional misfire.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really,\u201d he said of his spending on the app.For many years, China was a byword for shoddy goods produced at mass scale. But that is changing. Wages are rising, forcing manufacturers to compete on quality. Communist Party leaders want to nurture brands known globally for their innovations. Gadget makers such as Xiaomi and Huawei are investing heavily in design, chasing cool and cachet.To shop on Pinduoduo, however, is to be reminded that many Chinese consumers still check prices first, and that low-end suppliers remain a big part of the country\u2019s economy. The Pinduoduo app\u2019s main page is a bottomless cascade of groceries, fast fashion, household sundries and electronic bric-a-brac \u2014 all carrying wildly improbable price tags.A pair of stretchy, \u201cPlayboy\u201d-brand men\u2019s pants: less than $3. Eleven pounds of rice: $4. A four-pack of boxer briefs printed with an image of a wolf\u2019s head: $2. A purple water kettle with \u201cLOL\u201d written along the bottom: $3. A pink, around-the-neck smartphone stand that lets you lie down and watch videos at the same time: $1. A vibrating electric belt that goes around the midsection and supposedly helps shed fat: $6.Shipping is always free.Pinduoduo wants shoppers to involve their online friends in the process. Group orders receive discounts. New users who persuade others to sign up are rewarded with one of a selection of free purchases. Tiny pop-ups within the app provide relentless, real-time updates on what others are buying, creating a sense of urgency. Everyone is getting great deals and you are not.Between the deliriously strange product selection, the next-to-nothing prices, the barrage of coupons and deals, and the ease with which purchases are made, the experience feels less like shopping and more like playing a shopping video game. In regulatory filings, the company calls the app \u201ca combination of Costco and Disneyland.\u201dPinduoduo started operations only in 2015. The app is a platform for merchants to sell products: Sellers pay for their wares to be promoted on the app, and pay a fee for each sale. The company, which is based in Shanghai, has grown swiftly enough to attract powerful backers including the venture firm Sequoia Capital and the Chinese internet giant Tencent. It expects to raise $1.4 billion in this week\u2019s share offering. That would give the company a valuation of more than $20 billion.Because it offers so much cheap stuff, however, Pinduoduo is still way behind its rivals in the total value of goods sold. The company, which is unprofitable, said that its average shopper spent less than $90 on the platform last year. That translates into revenue per shopper of a dollar and change.\u201cThis is the lowest quality of traffic you can get,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. And if older people are driving Pinduoduo\u2019s popularity, Mr. Zhu added, then its prospects for long-term growth are grim by default.His own mother complained to him when two of the nine mangoes she had bought for $1.50 on the app turned up rotten, Mr. Huang told Caijing. Still, he said, she continued to use Pinduoduo. \u201cIf you can buy seven good mangoes for $1.50, you\u2019re not losing out,\u201d he said.For the most part, Kang Xia agrees. Ms. Kang, a 52-year-old retiree in the southwestern city of Chengdu, has used Pinduoduo to buy shoes, clothes, gadgets \u2014 \u201cquite a lot,\u201d she said, although the quality isn\u2019t always great.This spring, she got stung by two bad purchases. First, there was a $5 wardrobe with colorful fabric panels and a \u201creal wood\u201d frame. One touch was all she needed to realize the thing was no good. Then she bought a chiffon skirt with a floral pattern \u2014 less than $6, including a yellow T-shirt to wear with it \u2014 that arrived with a jagged tear down the side.Ms. Kang said she is now less likely to buy things on Pinduoduo solely because they are cheap. But she still looks at the app every day.For the established big shots of Chinese e-commerce, it is unwelcome news that many shoppers will buy very nearly anything if the price is right.To retain customers and avoid regulators\u2019 ire, Alibaba, which served more than 500 million buyers last year, has fought sales of fakes on its Taobao marketplace. The retailer JD.com, which had around 300 million buyers, has courted upmarket brands and cultivated a reputation for reliability.\u201cFrom time to time, there are new players, but the question is whether they can sustain themselves,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said at a recent event in San Francisco. \u201cWe are also climbing.\u201dTerry Yao lives in Dandong, a small city in China\u2019s northeast. After looking at some sneakers on Pinduoduo \u2014 pairs that should retail for more than $100 were going for a tiny fraction of that, he said \u2014 he made up his mind about the authenticity of the platform\u2019s products.\u201cChina has developed so much,\u201d said Mr. Yao, 28. \u201cBut if residents of these third- and fourth-tier cities can only use things like Pinduoduo, it feels to some degree like a big failure. We\u2019ve gone backward.\u201dBut Pinduoduo does not have to be stuck in the bargain bin forever, said Tian X. Hou, founder of T. H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. Now that it has used low prices to attract so many users, it can do as Alibaba did and go premium.\u201cOnce you have this trust, you can grow out of the current business and create a new business,\u201d Ms. Hou said.That might turn off the most fervent deal hunters. But it could raise Pinduoduo\u2019s profile among other consumers.Zhang Huajin, 34, a manager at a tech company in Guangzhou, bought an iPhone 7 Plus on Pinduoduo this month. Or he thought he did. What arrived was a smartphone, but it was not made by Apple.Mr. Zhang got his money back, though. And if Pinduoduo improves quality control and helps big brands sell directly on the app, he will probably buy from there again, he said.Taobao managed the transition, he said, and shoppers\u2019 expectations shifted accordingly. On Taobao, Mr. Zhang said, \u201ceverybody already knows what kinds of product should be sold at what price.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

But solar arrays and wind turbines are intermittent electricity sources: They don\u2019t always produce power when it\u2019s needed, and at times they generate so much that California must give some away to its neighbors. So the state has been looking at ways to better manage all the carbon-free energy that officials have required power companies to create.One undertaking is particularly ambitious: a $3 billion plan by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery, soaking up some of that solar and wind energy for later use.\u201cOur challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said. \u201cStorage helps. There\u2019s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.\u201dThe proposal is the latest in a growing pool of ideas that California is grappling with to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change.Proponents argue that a regional grid could save consumers up to $1.5 billion a year through efficiencies while helping manage excess solar and wind energy by sharing resources rather than giving them away. Critics dispute those benefits, noting that the move could increase use of fossil fuels from coal-heavy companies in other states and require costly improvements to make a regional system work.The Hoover Dam proposal is seen as a green project.In either case, California will have to win the support of neighboring states.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on in California with power that has given people who are dealing with them any comfort,\u201d said Joseph Hardy, a Nevada state senator.It was just one of her many firsts in the field of law: the first female assistant attorney general of the United States, the first appointed to the California appellate court and the first to serve as a presiding justice on the Supreme Court of California, to name a few.Ms. Adams became known as California\u2019s first lady of law.

{"Headline": "China Strikes Back at Trump\u2019s Tariffs, but Its Consumers Worry", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it has in the past, China used the moment to cast itself as a defender of the global trade order. Beijing officials have portrayed Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods as a threat to global prosperity.\u201cThe wrong actions of the U.S. have brazenly violated the rules of the World Trade Organization, attacked the whole world\u2019s economic sustainability and obstructed the global economy\u2019s recovery,\u201d Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said in a daily news briefing. \u201cIt will bring disaster to multinational corporations, small and medium businesses and normal consumers across the world.\u201dChina\u2019s state-controlled news media echoed the sentiment.But Chinese news outlets have stopped short of language that would suggest appetite for a major escalation, such as a consumer boycott of American brands.Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington.\u201cOf course I want China to fight back,\u201d said Cathy Yuan, 32, who was shopping at an upscale Shanghai supermarket on Friday. \u201cWe are defending our rights as a nation.\u201dOther shoppers sounded warier. Fresh American beef and other high-end imports \u2014 goods that are likely to become more expensive as more tariffs are imposed \u2014 lined the shelves.\u201cHigh-quality fresh food is already quite expensive, and with tariffs, prices will go up even further,\u201d said Wan Yang, a 27-year-old seafood dealer who imports black cod and king crab from Alaska.Health and hygiene concerns have led China\u2019s increasingly well-off shoppers to prefer food imported from the United States or elsewhere.\u201cWe buy imported goods because we feel they are safer to eat,\u201d said Mike Zheng, 30, who was browsing the aisles with his 2-year-old son. \u201cIf there were domestic substitutes, then tariffs would be O.K. But domestic products can\u2019t keep up, so we\u2019ll just have to accept higher prices.\u201dIt may not just be buyers of American steaks who get hurt. Soybeans are the highest-value farm import from the United States that is affected by Friday\u2019s tariffs. American growers supplied one-third of the soy that China shipped in last year, mainly to produce cooking oil and animal feed.\u201cGlobal soybean supply and demand is tightly balanced right now,\u201d said Gong Yanhai, a senior analyst in Shanghai with Huatai Asset Management. Taxing American soy, Mr. Gong said, also means that China will pay more to buy beans from its biggest supplier, Brazil, where premiums per bushel have already risen in anticipation of the tariffs.Around China, the trade war is being watched with a mix of worry, ire at the United States \u2014 and frank curiosity about it all.The trade war could have equally important effects on the $2 trillion worth of goods that the country sells to the rest of the world, said Hua Min, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai. A decade ago, in the wake of the global financial crisis, China\u2019s exports cratered, and consumers and businesses at home could not spend enough to keep factories humming.\u201cThe driving force of the Chinese economy is mainly exports,\u201d Mr. Hua said. \u201cIf there are no exports, there will be manufacturing overcapacity. Manufacturing overcapacity will lead to debt. And debt will affect companies\u2019 balance sheets. Then it will be 2008 all over again.\u201dAt a Tesla dealership in downtown Shanghai on Friday, there was not much love for the idea of paying even more for the premium electric vehicles.\u201cThe trade war won\u2019t last forever,\u201d said Charlie Lin, 25, who works in real estate and was looking at cars. \u201cChina and the U.S. definitely have ways of resolving it. After all, an endless fight would be bad for both countries. These are just temporary measures.\u201dStill, \u201cChina must accept this challenge,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cWe have enough stamina to fight back. We will find out what America is made of.\u201dCao Li contributed research from Hong Kong, Karoline Kan from Beijing, and Ailin Tang from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Could Be Crucial in a U.S.-China Trade War", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUANTAN, Malaysia \u2014 Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium.Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze\u2019s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply.Right now, she can\u2019t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals \u2014 known as rare earths \u2014 that China produces.

China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar.But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market.And in one of its more strategic weapons, Beijing could use its dominance to cut off key parts of the global supply chain. China is the major supplier of a number of mundane but crucial materials and components needed to keep the world\u2019s factories humming. They include obscure materials like arsenic metals, used to make semiconductors; cadmium, found in rechargeable batteries; and tungsten, found in light bulbs and heating elements.They also include rare earths. A trade war risks putting those minerals in the middle of the conflict, potentially giving China a way to get back at the United States by cutting off supplies to American companies. Already rare earths have become embroiled in the conflict \u2014 they were among the long list released on Tuesday of Chinese-made goods that the Trump administration wants to tax.\u201cThere is a hole in the western supply chain,\u201d said Ryan Castilloux, the founder of Adamas Intelligence, a research firm.It is hard to go a day without using rare earths. They are found in personal electronics like smartphones, televisions and hair dryers, and electric and hybrid cars.They aren\u2019t actually rare \u2014 they are made up of 17 elements found together in the ground all over the world. But turning individual minerals into useful material is complicated, messy and costly, as Lynas well knows.Rare earth refining is done on a large scale in only two places on earth: China, and Lynas\u2019s plant here in Kuantan, Malaysia, a sprawling industrial area on the coast of the South China Sea. The company mines rare earths out of a collapsed volcano in Australia and ships them to Kuantan to be refined.With the business hemorrhaging cash, Ms. Lacaze slashed costs. She negotiated with impatient lenders, including hedge funds and a Japanese government agency that had backed Lynas because it was unsettled by China\u2019s hold over the industry. She reduced rent and overhead by closing the company\u2019s Australian headquarters and moved the company, her husband and herself to Lynas\u2019s facility in Kuantan.On a recent visit, Lynas technicians mixed rare earth concentrate, which looks to the untrained eye like unremarkable dirt, into chemical tanks that extract elements like lanthanum and cerium. Through a series of steps that take place in more than a dozen buildings, the resulting pinkish powder was funneled through oversize sieves into boxes on a conveyor belt and baked at 1,000 degrees Celsius.\u201cIt\u2019s just like a giant pizza oven,\u201d Ms. Lacaze said.Next door to the oven, more than 150 bags of neodymium and praseodymium and cerium sat on a warehouse floor to be shipped to customers around the world. These bags are precious goods \u2014 each one filled with neodymium and praseodymium is worth around $50,000.\u201cJust don\u2019t hit the bag!\u201d Ms. Lacaze said she likes to tell the forklift operators. \u201cIt\u2019s like hitting a BMW.\u201d\u201cWomen more often get to do jobs like mine, where you clean up other people\u2019s mistakes,\u201d said Ms. Lacaze, wearing her signature pink work boots. She is one of fewer than a dozen women running the 200 biggest companies in Australia, where Lynas is publicly listed.She has looked to elevate women at Lynas, often out of necessity as well as virtue. Unable to expand payroll during the the slump, Ms. Lacaze turned to current employees \u2014 often women \u2014 who worked in support roles like human resources and finance and shifted them to the factory floor to be operators, technicians and shift supervisors.China is her most immediate challenge. Lynas is now profitable, but Ms. Lacaze sees a potential trade war between China and the United States as more of a threat than an opportunity. Beijing could keep rare earths off the market, depriving many American and European manufacturers of the minerals they need.Lynas couldn\u2019t compensate for it all. It accounted for only about 12 percent of world output of rare earths last year, according to Adamas, the research firm. Chinese companies accounted for more than four-fifths.\u201cIf there is a full-blown trade war, I can\u2019t believe that the Chinese wouldn\u2019t use rare earths as part of that,\u201d Ms. Lacaze says. If China wanted to restrict the supply of rare earths by sticking tariffs on rare earth products or stopping exports outright, \u201cthey could do it, literally overnight.\u201dUnder that scenario, companies would look for alternatives to rare earths. Tesla Motors, for example, briefly turned to engines that don\u2019t use rare earths after the 2010 price surge. That could hurt Lynas\u2019s business.The Association of China Rare Earth Industry, an industry group controlled by the Chinese government, did not respond to a request for comment.Even if it doesn\u2019t disrupt the supply, China will likely keep its grip over the market for rare earths for a long time to come. It also dominates research and development of these minerals, giving it a leg up on the future, Ms. Lacaze said.\u201cI think there\u2019s about 100 Ph.D.s in rare earths working in applications inside China and working in technology development,\u201d she said. \u201cTo my knowledge, do you know how many Ph.D.s there are outside of China?\u201d With the fingers of her right hand, she made a zero.For other countries, that means depending on China for a long time to come, she said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d Ms. Lacaze said, \u201cbut it should scare policymakers.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bands of Paint and Light Shimmer. But Do They Still Shock?", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewMs. Corse\u2019s work from this period is cool, spare and often monochrome, and it fits nicely into the conversation around \u201960s Minimalism. Two identical, triangular white columns from 1965 in her Whitney show are reminiscent of the work of Robert Morris and Anne Truitt. Like those artists, Ms. Corse was interested in how columns can occupy space, like human bodies.To make these works, Ms. Corse experimented by using fluorescent light tubes filled with argon gas and high-frequency Tesla coils, which allowed her to get rid of unsightly or distracting electrical cables plugged into walls. The works are slightly off the wall and suspended from the ceiling, emitting a pulsating field of white-green-pink light. There is an element of danger in them, too: You are warned that the electromagnetic fields in these works can interfere with or damage pacemakers, defibrillators and hearing aids. One of her suppliers even required Ms. Corse to pass a physics test, so she enrolled in classes at the University of Southern California and learned about theories of Niels Bohr and quantum mechanics: that light is made up of both waves and particles, but everyone\u2019s experience of these phenomena is different.The light paintings earned Ms. Corse a place in exhibitions alongside Light and Space artists like James Turrell and Robert Irwin. The \u201cWhite Light\u201d paintings, shown in 1970 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, treated the small group of Los Angeles artists as a \u201csoft\u201d approach to light rather than the \u201chard\u201d approach of East Coast artists.Where other Light and Space artists moved off the wall, however \u2014 sometimes into quite exotic locales, like Mr. Turrell\u2019s immersive work inside Roden Crater, an extinct Arizona volcano \u2014 Ms. Corse returned to the wall. Searching for options to create light in more traditional paintings, she found a solution on the highway: the glass microspheres used to delineate traffic lanes. In 1968 she started experimenting with the microspheres, mixing them with gel over paint and applying them to the canvas. She is still working with these today.In the \u201cWhite Light\u201d series at both museums, you can see the glimmer of the microspheres, but also the brush strokes of the artist. Ms. Corse also experimented with hexagon and diamond-shaped paintings, and in the 1970s briefly moved into ceramics with the monochrome \u201cBlack Earth\u201d paintings, made with black tiles cast from different textured surfaces and coated with iridescent lusterware.So why did Ms. Corse disappear from historical view? Partly because she moved to Topanga Canyon in the \u201970s, away from the art scenes in Santa Monica and Venice in Los Angeles, and the feminist movement that flourished at CalArts. According to the Whitney catalog, the move \u201callowed her the time and space to focus on her young family\u201d \u2014 she had two children \u2014 while still working, \u201cher own feminist statement.\u201d It suggests that moving and distancing herself from feminism was a hedge against \u201cbeing marginalized as a \u2018woman artist.\u2019\u201dMeanwhile, Ms. Corse\u2019s peers moved into performance, film and sculpture \u2014 and some pursued a more eye-catching terrain, from gravity-defying shaped canvases to light environments and beyond. She gravitated toward painting and continued to pursue an austere, \u201960s minimalist form.I imagine her \u201cWhite Light\u201d series were a shock to the system in a world blaring with Pop Art images. T he theoretical arguments of that era are all here: Her works defy one-point linear perspective, and you must move to experience the works, which heightens your consciousness of your body in space (all part of the experiential and consciousness-raising \u201960s).Still, the canvases in these shows from that period lack the depth and richness of die-hard minimalist painters such as Albers, Agnes Martin and Ad Reinhardt \u2014 or the painterly richness of others who devoted themselves to white monochrome, like Robert Ryman.An earlier version of this review misstated the number of children Mary Corse had. It is two, not one.Advertisement"}

It did not say whether it sought rebates for work already delivered.Tesla\u2019s shares were down sharply Monday morning and ended the day with a decline of 3.3 percent, to $303.20.While squeezing cost savings out of suppliers is a common tactic in the auto industry, it most often involves future contracts rather than rebates for work already done, said Mike Jackson, executive director of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association.\u201cThere have been instances of it, but it\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said.Pressuring suppliers was a regular tactic of the three Detroit automakers a decade ago as they were scrambling to avoid bankruptcy, a fate General Motors and Chrysler were unable to evade. Many suppliers also slipped into bankruptcy, in part because constant price reductions made many lines of business unprofitable.Tesla\u2019s appeal to suppliers emerged after a series of incidents involving Mr. Musk that have raised concerns among at least some Tesla shareholders.The billionaire entrepreneur also offered, through Twitter, to help solve the water crisis in Flint, Mich., and sparred repeatedly with short sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla.Gene Munster, managing partner at the venture-capital firm Loup Ventures, warned Mr. Musk in an open letter to him that his actions were \u201cshaking investor confidence\u201d in Tesla.\u201cYour behavior is fueling an unhelpful perception of your leadership \u2014 thin-skinned and short-tempered,\u201d Mr. Munster wrote. \u201cTwitter might keep Tesla in the news, but it won\u2019t help continued improvements in production and product.\u201dRight now, Tesla has no more important product than the Model 3. The car, which is so far available only in versions selling for $49,000 or more, is supposed to provide revenue as the company spends heavily to develop future models. Tesla has not made a profit since it was founded in 2003, and in the first quarter it recorded a loss of $785 million. It also used up $745 million in cash.Mr. Musk had once predicted Tesla would produce a half a million cars in 2018, most of them Model 3s, but production has been hampered by glitches and bottlenecks involving complicated robotic machinery the company is using. Mr. Musk has said he was sleeping at the company\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., to solve manufacturing problems.Tesla has taken reservations for more than 400,000 Model 3s, each secured by a $1,000 deposit. But analysts are concerned that some customers may cancel reservations because a $7,500 tax credit available to buyers will begin phasing out next year, increasing the car\u2019s cost.Furthermore, Tesla originally said the Model 3 would be available in a base model selling for $35,000, but the company has acknowledged that it will be difficult to hit its profit goals with that version right now.

{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s \u2018Buffalo Billion\u2019: Is New York Getting Its Money\u2019s Worth?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUFFALO \u2014 More than six years ago, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced his bold vision for New York\u2019s second largest and perhaps longest-suffering city.Sure enough, the money soon started to flow to Buffalo, leading to new waterfront parks, gleaming modern factories and a cluster of medical and technology facilities.But an examination of the plans and progress of projects included in the Buffalo Billion reveals a far more uneven return on investment to date: a mix of street-level successes, expensive brick-and-mortar gambles and ill-conceived misfires.While some projects have bloomed, others have been delayed by years or show no sign of progress, beyond their initial news release. And Mr. Cuomo\u2019s promises of well-paying, permanent jobs at the most costly projects have repeatedly fallen well short.The governor\u2019s strategy and spending have come into sharp relief as the man who spearheaded the Buffalo effort, Alain E. Kaloyeros, went on trial last month in Federal District Court in Manhattan along with three co-defendants \u2014 executives with two companies who generously donated to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s past election campaigns. Mr. Cuomo, 60, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and prosecutors have said the donations to him were legal.Mr. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University Polytechnic Institute who was once called \u201cNew York\u2019s secret weapon\u201d by the governor, stands accused of bid-rigging several upstate development projects, including Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest: a $750 million solar-panel plant on the banks of the Buffalo River.\u201cI think the Buffalo Billion sounds better than it probably turned out to be,\u201d said Isaac Ehrlich, a SUNY distinguished professor of economics at the University at Buffalo.\u201cJob growth in Buffalo during the expansion had been buoyed by a surge in construction jobs associated with major projects\u201d such as the solar plant, according an October report from Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, two Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists. \u201cAs these projects have wound down, so, too, has construction-related employment.\u201d\u201cThe last seven years have undoubtedly been the best in Buffalo for a very long time,\u201d said Howard Zemsky, the president of Empire State Development, the state\u2019s primary economic development agency. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s coincidental that the way the governor transformed economic development has had a very positive impact.\u201dMr. Zemsky noted some 25,000 new private sector jobs have come to the city during the Cuomo administration, and added that many of the Buffalo Billion projects \u2014 both past and future \u2014 were not exclusively about jobs, per se, but support for long-term solutions like downtown revitalization, smart growth, opening up the waterfront and keeping younger generations from fleeing.The project, however, hasn\u2019t even broken ground; an empty former mall and a parking garage remain on the site, though state and company officials said it is still in the works.But only a handful of students ever found full-time jobs with the company, which no longer has offices in Buffalo and \u201cfailed to meet the partnership goals,\u201d according to the college. Calls and emails to the company were not returned.In remarks about the trial, Mr. Cuomo said recently that he would let the legal process work, and said he\u2019d not really even paid attention to the case.\u201cI haven\u2019t been following it all that closely,\u201d he said, in an interview on NY1. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we have a trial.\u201dThus far, the Buffalo Billion\u2019s biggest money projects have gone to just a select group of well-connected developers, and have been limited to a small number of locations, including several blocks known as the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, where several multimillion projects have been based.All told, the state has spent more than $135 million at the medical campus, including support for a genomics institute, a children\u2019s hospital and expanding class sizes and faculty at the University at Buffalo\u2019s medical school.George Palumbo, an economics professor at Canisius College in Buffalo, said that the gleaming new buildings at the medical campus \u201ctake nice pictures,\u201d but said the development was also illusory.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go very far from that neighborhood to see Buffalo blight,\u201d he said, \u201cnot Buffalo billion.\u201dStill, as the Buffalo Billion has grown over the last six years, it has come to include grant programs, entrepreneurial competitions and beautification projects, and many of those seem popular.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost so many industries around here,\u201d said Kathy Miner, a retired nurse, as she watched a steady stream of dump trucks come and go. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dEconomists say that the theory of flooding a single area with money is not a bad one, and that it may be years before a final verdict can be made about the Buffalo Billion. But for now, the governor\u2019s declarations that the city has been saved seem premature.\u201cAt best, it has stopped declining,\u201d Professor Palumbo said. \u201cBut not dying anymore is not a rebirth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

LeBron James, heading into the 16th season of his career, was asked to bring the luster back to one of the N.B.A.\u2019s two marquee franchises, and he readily accepted by agreeing to a four-year contract with the team on Sunday.It would be easy to make the case that this is a curious move for James in terms of his legacy. The Lakers are lacking in experience and play in the same conference as the mighty Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, which could end his incredible streak of making the N.B.A. finals at eight seasons. He will also have to contend with a fan base that will rank him far below homegrown talent like Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson almost no matter what he does.But after fulfilling his promise to end a pro sports championship drought in Cleveland that stretched back to 1952, James is comfortable with his legacy and reportedly made it clear to Johnson, who now serves as the Lakers\u2019 president, that he is fine with being patient and not blowing up the team to chase an immediate title. After 15 hard-fought seasons of fighting to prove himself as a worthy heir to Michael Jordan, James is ready to seek happiness for himself and his family. And he will do it in the sunshine of Southern California rather than spending another winter in his native Ohio.
