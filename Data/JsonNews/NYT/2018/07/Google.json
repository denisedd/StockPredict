{"Headline": "The Google Translate World Cup", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 On a warm, sticky morning in Kazan, Russia, a couple of weeks ago, a British journalist decided to brave the heat and go for a run. His apartment for the duration of the World Cup overlooked the city\u2019s state-of-the-art stadium, so he decided to do a couple of laps.By the time he rounded the arena for the second time, he had been reduced to walking, his face pink and his T-shirt soaked in sweat. Two police officers at a security checkpoint eyed him suspiciously. They had a brief, whispered conversation before moving to intercept him.Worried he was about to be asked for his papers and speaking little Russian, he readied himself to explain that he had left his passport at home and would be happy to retrieve it. Before he could speak, one of the officers uttered a short sentence into his cellphone. He held it toward the journalist, and an electronic voice asked, in English, \u201cDo you require medical assistance?\u201dThis was always supposed to be a World Cup indelibly marked by technology. FIFA\u2019s decision to appoint a team of video assistant referees to review controversial incidents during matches was hailed as soccer\u2019s next great leap forward, the moment it would join almost every other sport, including cricket and the N.F.L., in the 21st century.Across Russia for the last month, fans (and journalists) have used translation apps for everything: asking for directions, chatting with taxi drivers, getting slightly nerve-racking haircuts, checking into hotels, making friends, even flirting. The app\u2019s camera function \u2014 which can scan and translate text \u2014 has allowed visiting fans to decode menus, decipher signs and read the names of subway stations, even if the Cyrillic alphabet remains a mystery to them.\u201cIt really helps,\u201d said Rodrigo Ferreira, a Brazilian fan from Salvador who has been in Russia, with his brother Arthur, for almost two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s good for everything. We try to speak in English, too, but it\u2019s been useful in bars, in restaurants, for meeting women.\u201dThat does not come as a surprise to Julie Cattiau, a product manager at Google Translate. \u201cBrazil is our biggest market, but Russia would be in the top few,\u201d she said.The company was expecting an increase in use during the World Cup \u2014 it experienced something similar during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 but the \u201csurge\u201d has been impressive: the amount of translation on the mobile app has been double what it might ordinarily be, Ms. Cattiau said.Mauricio and Eduardo Contr\u00f3, brothers from Monterrey, Mexico, in Moscow to see the semifinals and final, have found that Russians, in particular, reach for their phones to communicate with foreigners.\u201cWe needed to charge our phones, so we went into a cafe and asked for power,\u201d Mauricio, 27, said. \u201cBefore we had finished talking, they had their phone out, opened Translate, and asked us to speak into it.\u201dGiven that Google\u2019s app has some 500 million users and translates some 143 billion words a day, into and out of dozens and languages, the increase is startling. It is not hard to see why.\u201cNot many people speak Russian, and it can be quite intimidating,\u201d said Hedi Salem, 31, a France fan from Marseille.\u201cIn some of the smaller cities \u2014 not so much in Moscow and St. Petersburg \u2014 fewer people speak English. We have picked up a little bit of Russian, and we try to point or mime first, but it makes it much easier. It is amazing to see, people being able to talk without speaking each other\u2019s language.\u201dIndeed, over this last month or so, it has been possible to glimpse the future of how we travel: a world in which language is no longer a prerequisite for understanding.\u201cFor younger travelers especially, the days of printed phrase and point-it books are over,\u201d said Joss Moorkens, an assistant professor at the School of Applied Language and Intercultural Studies at Dublin City University. \u201cThat is significant: As people become more familiar with mobile translation tools, they are more likely to be willing to engage with visitors despite the lack of a common language.\u201dThat, certainly, is the Google vision of what its app can do. Ms. Cattiau said the company\u2019s \u201cambition and vision is breaking language barriers for people in many different ways,\u201d and in many different contexts, not simply tourism. Some 95 percent of Google Translate users are outside the United States, often in multilingual countries such as India and Indonesia.That remains some distance off. \u201cIt is a continuous process to get as close to human-quality translation as possible,\u201d Ms. Cattiau said. Her team focuses not just on making sure the app is as accurate as it can be, but also on improving its ease of use. \u201cWe want people to be able to talk as naturally and seamlessly as possible,\u201d she said.At the moment, that has led to a conversation function \u2014 enabling two people to exchange sentences on one platform \u2014 but may, in the future, be driven by devices like headsets or earbuds, reducing the need to break the flow of a conversation by passing a phone back and forth.For the time being, Dr. Moorkens said, translation apps in general are best used \u201cin informal, low-risk situations, where errors can hopefully be laughed off.\u201d The ultimate standard, he said, would be met when they can be used in a \u201cdoctor-patient scenario.\u201dAs the programs improve, though, they will likely become more widespread, more familiar. That will, inevitably, make travel easier, but it also may have an effect on what we learn. It could, for example, reduce the need to learn languages, though Ms. Cattiau was quick to point out that is not a consequence Google intends, or encourages.Dr. Moorkens said learning a language provides control. \u201cWhen a machine speaks for you, how do you know that the message is being conveyed accurately, if you have no knowledge of the target language?\u201d he asked rhetorically.Then there is how we speak. The more we rely on translation apps when abroad, Dr. Moorkens suggested, the more we might be \u201ctrained\u201d by those apps to speak in such a way to ensure the most accurate translation. \u201cPeople will probably end up trained to speak in a restricted or unnatural way in order to achieve the best result,\u201d he said. The logical extension of that is that it may change how we use our native languages.In Russia, there has been no time to worry about those theoretical quandaries. Instead, as Dr. Moorkens said, \u201cwhen the alternative is no communication at all,\u201d even imperfect translation apps have been \u201cfar preferable.\u201d They have helped to bring fans and their hosts together; to get visitors around a vast, unfamiliar country; to make every day a little easier; and to help people find something to say, and a way to say it. Even if that is just, \u201cDo you require medical assistance?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s the latest.The remarks contradict the U.S. intelligence chief and come a day after Mr. Trump promised the government was working to guard against possible Russian interference in the coming midterm elections.Earlier, Mr. Trump tweeted that \u201cmany people at the higher ends of intelligence\u201d loved his remarks on Monday regarding Russia\u2019s possible meddling.It was not immediately clear whether the president was referring to smart people or high-level intelligence officials.He also implied that \u201chaters\u201d were angry that he got along with the leader of Russia and \u201cwould rather go to war.\u201d_____In an interview with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Mr. Trump wondered why the U.S. should be responsible for defending Montenegro, a small country in the alliance 5,000 miles away. But mutual defense is part of the treaty\u2019s charter: If one NATO country is attacked, all NATO countries would be considered under attack as well and would join in defense.Mr. Trump has long expressed skepticism about NATO, though he emerged from the summit this month claiming diplomatic victory on spending by members.__________The agreements required Google\u2019s services, such as its search bar and Chrome browser, to be favored over rival offerings. European authorities said those moves unfairly boxed out competitors._____The government announced new guidance for asylum officers to scrutinize applications more closely, and to weigh the applicants\u2019 claims of fear against whether they have previously entered the United States illegally.The moves are part of a larger plan developing in Washington to reshape the reputation of America as a safe haven._____Our reporters went to the village where one of the victims, a 65-year-old grandmother, was mistaken for a \u201cchild lifter\u201d and killed.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, has a quarter billion users in India alone, and the app and local authorities are struggling to stem the flow of false information._____7. \u201cIt was a miracle.\u201dThe boys displayed gratitude to rescuers, regret for worrying their parents and solemn regard for the Thai diver who died working to save them.The coach\u2019s tribute: \u201cHe sacrificed his life to protect and save us, the 13 Wild Boars, so we could go back outside and be happy, live a normal life.\u201d_____Above, an S.D.F. soldier guarding one of the jails._____The show has been an enormous financial success; as of Sunday, it had grossed $76 million._____\u201cThe news today is that our president is a liar,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, above, said. \u201cAnd not even a good one.\u201dStephen Colbert cried foul, too. \u201cYou either accept it was Russia, or say it could be other people.

{"Headline": "8 Suspect Claims From the Trump-Putin News Conference ", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact Check of the DayPresident Trump contradicted U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and President Vladimir V. Putin said he didn\u2019t know that Mr. Trump was in Russia in 2013. \u201cMy people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it\u2019s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\u201cYou have groups that are wondering why the F.B.I. never took the server \u2014 haven\u2019t they taken the server. \u201c\u201cThe government has uncovered no evidence that your client violated federal law with respect to the House computer systems. Particularly, the government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House members\u2019 offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information.\u201d This is false.Mr. Trump was responding to a question that was meant for Mr. Putin, about why Americans should believe the Russian president\u2019s statement that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election. Instead, Mr. Trump jumped in to claim that the \u201cconcept\u201d of Russian election interference did not emerge until after the November 2016 vote. In fact, the Democratic National Committee, congressional Democrats and the Obama administration had sounded the alarms months before the election. As for his claim that the Electoral College is \u201cmuch more advantageous for Democrats,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that Democrats have lost two out of the past five presidential electoral votes, despite winning the popular vote. His claim that he beat Mrs. Clinton \u201ceasily\u201d is also dubious. Mr. Trump\u2019s share of Electoral College votes ranked 46 out of 58 elections. He also lost the popular vote by the third largest margin among winning presidential candidates since 1824. Mr. Trump was responding to a Russian reporter who said the American president had called Mr. Putin \u201can adversary, a rival.\u201d Mr. Trump denied that he had ever used those words. Here is what he said in that interview: \u201cWell, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn\u2019t think of the European Union, but they\u2019re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn\u2019t mean they are bad. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. It means that they are competitive.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be competing \u2014 as you know, the United States is now \u2014 or soon will be, but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump\u201cWhen President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn\u2019t even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow.\u201d \u2014 Vladimir PutinIn November 2013, Mr. Trump hosted the Miss Universe pageant in a suburb of Moscow. Mr. Putin\u2019s claim of ignorance of Mr. Trump\u2019s presence is contradicted by Mr. Trump himself, as well as two other people. \u201cFor instance, we can bring up the Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u2014 Vladimir PutinBill Browder is a London-based financier who has led an international campaign against Russian human rights abusers. Mr. Putin\u2019s estimate of the amount of money that Mr. Browder\u2019s associates contributed to the Clinton campaign is overstated. Daniel Ziff also donated between $50,001 and $100,000 to the Clinton family\u2019s charitable foundation in 2015.

{"Headline": "Buying a Home Sight Unseen", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVirtual tours make it easier, but how can you tell from FaceTime if the basement is damp?10 PhotosZack Fountas bought a new one-bedroom apartment in White Plains, N.Y., from his home in Chicago, without ever having set foot inside the building.The 850-square-foot apartment is within walking distance of the train station, and with an asking price of $155,000, it appeared on paper to have almost everything Mr. Fountas and his fianc\u00e9e were looking for, including a dishwasher. During an open house last summer, his sister-in-law and Joe Muller, an agent with Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, gave Mr. Fountas a tour using FaceTime. Mr. Muller showed him around with his iPhone and then emailed a link with listing photos and comparable sales nearby. Mr. Fountas, who had not seen any other places in person, bid $142,000, and his offer was accepted.Six weeks later, it was time to take a tour in person. \u201cI think I was sweating because I was like, \u2018Oh, my god, what if he doesn\u2019t like it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Muller said. \u201cHe\u2019d have lost his deposit.\u201d Mr. Fountas, who was moving to New York for a job as a risk manager after earning a business degree, said he wasn\u2019t disappointed: \u201cHaving seen it through the phone, it was what we were expecting.\u201dMost buyers want to see a place in person at least once before committing. A home, after all, is usually an emotional purchase, with intangibles like the feeling it evokes key to a buyer\u2019s attraction. But a growing number of house hunters across the country are making the biggest financial decision of their lives sight unseen. According to a recent survey by Redfin, a national online real estate brokerage with more than 1,000 agents, 20 percent of buyers said they submitted an offer on a home without visiting it first. And in a survey of 45 New York City-based agents conducted by Realtor.com, more than half said that in the past six months they had worked with at least one buyer who was purchasing a primary home without visiting it first.But these days, agents said, more primary home buyers purchasing already-built properties are willing to go in blind, in part because technology has improved the remote-viewing process. And it tends to happen more in markets where properties sell quickly, putting out-of-town buyers at a particular disadvantage.Graham Candish was living in Geneva, Switzerland, when he accepted a job as an innovation director for a beauty company that would require him and his family to move to New York. His agent, Nuno Ribeiro of Redfin, showed him several homes in the New York area when he was in town on business, but nothing fit the bill.After returning to Geneva, he did some research on his own using Google Street View to get a sense of neighborhoods. He perused websites like Zillow to learn property sales history, something he was not able to do when buying a home in Europe, where less information is available through public records. \u201cThere are no secrets here,\u201d he said. Having identified the French language school in Mamaroneck that his 12- and 14-year-old son and daughter would attend, he set about looking for a home within a 10-minute drive.Mr. Candish said he found a Tudor-style home in Larchmont listed for $1.32 million near the school and within walking distance of the train station. \u201cThat was the main thing, the right location,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it ticked most of our boxes, including having the potential to renovate it and make it more modern.\u201d He put in an offer of $1.25 million, which the seller accepted. Mr. Candish and his family didn\u2019t fly back to New York to see the house until partway through the closing process, with their deposit at stake. \u201cAt that point, we were $125,000 in,\u201d he said.One thing he didn\u2019t realize about the home until he saw it in person was that the basement was very damp and dark \u2014 \u201cmuch more so than in the photographs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey massively overexpose the photographs and turn on all the lights. You get there in person, and it\u2019s not as bright as you\u2019d imagine.\u201d Also hard to capture in photos: \u201cIt smells like a basement.\u201d He has since remodeled the space to make it more livable and said he is generally happy with his decision to buy the home.Other surprises can come up, as well. When Mr. Fountas moved into his new apartment last August, he loved it, but he did make one disappointing discovery: Parking options nearby were very limited, with all streets forbidding parking between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., something he might have noticed had he walked around the area in person. \u201cThankfully, we were able to find a parking garage nearby,\u201d he said.Real estate agents say the growth in sight-unseen purchases is partly driven by low inventory and high demand. In the hottest markets, houses and condos can go into contract within 24 hours of listing. Leslie Turner, a real estate broker in Charleston, S.C., said homes in the downtown area are selling so quickly that it is challenging to get clients in for tours if they do not live in town and have immediate availability. \u201cBy the time you get on a plane to go see it, it\u2019ll be gone,\u201d she said.When she received a call last December from a buyer in New Orleans who had been searching listings online and was interested in a $430,000 condominium downtown, her advice was blunt: \u201cI told them, \u2018You don\u2019t have time to wait,\u2019\u201d she said.The two-bedroom unit, on the building\u2019s top floor, had 20-foot ceilings and views of the city. It was in a newer building near the medical school that the buyers\u2019 son attended, and their daughter would soon be moving there for medical school as well. The layout made it ideal for roommates or siblings, with the bedrooms at opposite ends. That same afternoon, Ms. Turner rushed over to give the family a FaceTime tour. \u201cThe daughter wanted to know about the closets, and the parents really wanted to know about security.\u201dAlan D. Kaye, the chairman of the anesthesiology department at Louisiana State University Medical School, who was buying the unit for his children, said he wanted to nab the place quickly because of its plum location. Although he had never bought a home without seeing it before, he said the FaceTime tour gave him a good enough sense of the place that he could confidently offer $420,000 in cash. The offer was accepted the same day.\u201cI realized that if we didn\u2019t move aggressively we wouldn\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know if prices were going up by the minute or by the hour,\u201d Dr. Kaye said, but \u201cif you drive around the medical school, which is an outstanding school, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s just not a lot of options.\u201d His wife and children saw the place after the deal closed and said everything was as they expected.Real estate experts say homes are indeed selling at a record pace in many cities. A typical listing sold in 36 days in April 2018, six fewer than in April 2017, according to Redfin. And in some markets it can be much faster. In Denver, for example, homes sold after a median of six days on the market this past April. But the bidding wars and rapidly increasing prices in Los Angeles \u2014 the median sale price rose from $327,000 in April 2012 to more than $705,000 in April 2018, according to Redfin \u2014 make its real estate market one of the most challenging for buyers. When Shachar Scott took a job at Snapchat, the social media company based in Southern California, she quickly learned that to be competitive as a buyer she would need to move fast. Ms. Scott, who was moving from Jersey City with her husband and six-year-old twins and had never lived in California, said she was not entirely sure what to expect, but she knew she wanted a house in a good school district that was close to her office.While on a work trip to Los Angeles, she met with Natasha Barrett of the Agency, who looked at homes for her when she was back in Jersey City, often FaceTiming her or emailing her video tours. Ms. Scott\u2019s husband flew to Los Angeles for six hours to attend the open house, FaceTiming her and emailing photos. The couple put in an offer right away, one of nine the seller received. She declined to say what they paid for the home, but said they offered more than the asking price and got the house.Ms. Scott didn\u2019t visit the home until after the closing. \u201cI\u2019d never seen the house or even been to the neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to use Google Maps and Waze to even find it. I was totally nervous.\u201d But she and her family have been happy with the home, which they moved into last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s even better than the pictures,\u201d she said.Some believe that a growing comfort with buying almost everything else online is affecting the way people shop for real estate. \u201cThere\u2019s an e-commerce mentality sinking into the American consciousness,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin. \u201cZappos popularized the idea that you can buy shoes online. I think it\u2019s true for almost any goods in America now.\u201d Of course, not everyone is convinced that this is how buyers should think about home purchases. Robert Dankner, a Manhattan real estate agent, said he would handle sight-unseen purchases only for longtime clients whom he knew very well. \u201cIf I don\u2019t really understand them, I would rather not make money and disappoint them and insist they look for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a house to enjoy for themselves, it\u2019s not a numbers thing \u2014 it\u2019s personal and touchy-feely.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the school where Alan D. Kaye is chairman of the anesthesiology department. It is Louisiana State University Medical School, not Tulane University.Advertisement"}

Beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track 1.4 billion people. It wants to assemble a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system, with crucial help from its thriving technology industry.\u201cIn the past, it was all about instinct,\u201d said Shan Jun, the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in Zhengzhou, where the heroin smuggler was caught. \u201cIf you missed something, you missed it.\u201dChina is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as a great democratizer, bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world. In China, it has brought control.In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China\u2019s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who don\u2019t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes. Already, China has an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras \u2014 four times as many as the United States.Such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications, hotel stays, train and plane trips and even car travel in some places.Even so, China\u2019s ambitions outstrip its abilities. Technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city, or even the next block over. Bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of a nationwide network.For the Communist Party, that may not matter. Far from hiding their efforts, Chinese authorities regularly state, and overstate, their capabilities. In China, even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line.Some places are further along than others. Invasive mass-surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the Uighur Muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family, according to software viewed by The New York Times.\u201cThis is potentially a totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cThe goal is algorithmic governance,\u201d he added.The intersection south of Changhong Bridge in the city of Xiangyang used to be a nightmare. Cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street.Then last summer, the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and a big, outdoor screen. Photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government I.D. numbers. People were initially excited to see their faces on the board, said Guan Yue, a spokeswoman, until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment.\u201cIf you are captured by the system and you don\u2019t see it, your neighbors or colleagues will, and they will gossip about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s too embarrassing for people to take.\u201dHis successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule. They formed a new understanding with the Chinese people. In exchange for political impotence, they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich.It worked. Censorship and police powers remained strong, but China\u2019s people still found more freedom. That new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth.Today, that unwritten agreement is breaking down.China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t growing at the same pace. It suffers from a severe wealth gap. After four decades of fatter paychecks and better living, its people have higher expectations.Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, has moved to solidify his power. Changes to Chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since Mao. And he has undertaken a broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies.For support, he has turned to the Mao-era beliefs in the importance of a cult of personality and the role of the Communist Party in everyday life. Technology gives him the power to make it happen.\u201cReform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,\u201d said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China\u2019s four-decade post-Mao policy. \u201cThe current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers\u2019 money to monitor the taxpayers.\u201dGovernment contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces, clothing and even a person\u2019s gait. Experimental gadgets, like facial-recognition glasses, have begun to appear.Judging public Chinese reaction can be difficult in a country where the news media is controlled by the government. Still, so far the average Chinese citizen appears to show little concern. Erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of China\u2019s authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life. As a result, many cheer on new attempts at law and order.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest intersections in the city,\u201d said Wang Fukang, a college student who volunteered as a guard at the crosswalk in Xiangyang. \u201cIt\u2019s important that it stays safe and orderly.\u201dStart-ups often make a point of insisting their employees use their technology. In Shanghai, a company called Yitu has taken that to the extreme.The halls of its offices are dotted with cameras, looking for faces. From desk to break room to exit, employees\u2019 paths are traced on a television screen with blue dotted lines. The monitor shows their comings and goings, all day, everyday.In China, snooping is becoming big business. As the country spends heavily on surveillance, a new generation of start-ups have risen to meet the demand.Chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition. Yitu took first place in a 2017 open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the United States government\u2019s Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A number of other Chinese companies also scored well.A technology boom in China is helping the government\u2019s surveillance ambitions. In sheer scale and investment, China already rivals Silicon Valley. Between the government and eager investors, surveillance start-ups have access to plenty of money and other resources.In May, the upstart A.I. company SenseTime raised $620 million, giving it a valuation of about $4.5 billion. Yitu raised $200 million last month. Another rival, Megvii, raised $460 million from investors that included a state-backed fund created by China\u2019s top leadership.At a conference in May at an upscale hotel in Beijing, China\u2019s security-industrial complex offered its vision of the future. Companies big and small showed off facial-recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials, tech executives and investors.Private companies see big potential in China\u2019s surveillance build-out. China\u2019s public security market was valued at more than $80 billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities, said Shen Xinyang, a former Google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of Eyecool, a start-up.\u201cArtificial intelligence for public security is actually still a very insignificant portion of the whole market,\u201d he said, pointing out that most equipment currently in use was \u201cnonintelligent.\u201dMany of these businesses are already providing data to the government.Mr. Shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than 20 airports and train stations, which had helped catch 1,000 criminals. Eyecool, he said, is also handing over two million facial images each day to a burgeoning big-data police system called Skynet.At a building complex in Xiangyang, a facial-recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police\u2019s collection of photos of local residents, according to local Chinese Communist Party officials.Wen Yangli, an executive at Number 1 Community, which makes the product, said the company is at work on other applications. One would detect when crowds of people are clashing. Another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where.China\u2019s surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high-tech surveillance abroad. Yitu says it has been expanding overseas, with plans to increase business in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.At home, China is preparing its people for next-level surveillance technology. A recent state-media propaganda film called \u201cAmazing China\u201d showed off a similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use, saying it could be used for predictive policing.\u201cIf there are anomalies, the system sends an alert,\u201d a narrator says, as Chinese police officers pay a visit to an apartment with a record of erratic utility use. The film then quotes one of the officers: \u201cNo matter which corner you escape to, we\u2019ll bring you to justice.\u201dFor technology to be effective, it doesn\u2019t always have to work. Take China\u2019s facial-recognition glasses.Police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at a high-speed rail station for state media and others. They snapped photos of a policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses.But the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds. They have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications.China\u2019s national database of individuals it has flagged for watching \u2014 including suspected terrorists, criminals, drug traffickers, political activists and others \u2014 includes 20 million to 30 million people, said one technology executive who works closely with the government. That is too many people for today\u2019s facial recognition technology to parse, said the executive, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn\u2019t public.The system remains more of a digital patchwork than an all-seeing technological network. Many files still aren\u2019t digitized, and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can\u2019t be easily reconciled. Systems that police hope will someday be powered by A.I. are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old-fashioned way.Take, for example, the crosswalk in Xiangyang. The images don\u2019t appear instantaneously. The billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago, though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days. Officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people\u2019s identities.Still, Chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on a campaign to persuade the country\u2019s people that the high-tech security state is already in place.In many places, it works. At the intersection in Xiangyang, jaywalking has decreased. At the building complex where Number 1 Community\u2019s facial-recognition gate system has been installed, a problem with bike theft ceased entirely, according to building management.\u201cThe whole point is that people don\u2019t know if they\u2019re being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient,\u201d said Mr. Chorzempa, the Peterson Institute fellow.He described the approach as a panopticon, the idea that people will follow the rules precisely because they don\u2019t know whether they are being watched.In Zhengzhou, police were happy to explain how just the thought of the facial recognition glasses could get criminals to confess.Mr. Shan, the Zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief, cited the time his department grabbed a heroin smuggler. While questioning the suspect, Mr. Shan said, police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn\u2019t matter. The glasses could give them all the information they needed.\u201cBecause he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology, he confessed,\u201d said Mr. Shan, adding that the suspect had swallowed 60 small packs of heroin.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even use any interrogation techniques,\u201d Mr. Shan said. \u201cHe simply gave it all up.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting from Zhengzhou.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How We Lost the Sky", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEThe space above us, once filled by the human imagination, is now crowded with technologies of surveillance and war. Mr. Weisbrode is a historian. Ms. Yeung is a poet.Once upon a time, the sky was everything above the earth, which lay at the center of human experience. The sky was the place of gods. Storms were demonstrations of their powers, and birds their airborne messengers. To attempt to fly, Icarus-like, too high, was a sign of hubris. Vast as it was, the sky remained in some sense \u201cclosed,\u201d forbidden to us, unknown and probably unknowable.The advent of popular air travel did not alter this perception so much as standardize it around the globe. Airplanes could go only so high and could stay in the air for only so long. Additionally, airplanes traveled along fixed routes. By 1919 these routes had been coined \u201cskyways.\u201d They were, and to some extent, remain, extensions of the land, spoken of in the same way as shipping routes. Indeed, much of the literature also describes space as a \u201cfrontier\u201d to be crossed, tamed and ultimately conquered in the way that the land and the seas had once been.The idea behind this was simple and is what today is called a \u201cconfidence-building measure.\u201d It was a statement of political and philosophical intent, nominally sincere but possibly cynical in practice. Using the transparency of the skies, in other words, was meant to shed light, to build mutual trust and perhaps even transpose what was once mysterious into something more knowable.\u201cOpen skies\u201d has come down to posterity as a partly psychological (and perhaps propagandistic) attempt to alter collective behavior \u2014 a sort of Big Brother effect, as it were. But it also marked a different psychological \u2014 or perhaps spiritual \u2014 shift, having less to do with the quality of the sky itself than with the relationship between the sky and the territory below.That it took until 1992 for an open-skies treaty to be signed between the former Cold War rivals suggests that some people like to keep their secrets hidden. Back when Eisenhower introduced the idea, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev protested, it was said, by insisting that Americans wanted to look into his bedroom. When Soviet forces shot down an American U-2 spy plane a few years later and caught Eisenhower in a lie, Khrushchev relished the I-told-you-so moment.By that time aerial photography had multiplied the possibility of its range; satellite imaging was included in its arsenal; the once novel image of the \u201cBlue Marble\u201d planet taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft in 1972 was now normalized and absorbed into the cultural imagination. In 2004, Google would buy Keyhole Inc.\u2019s EarthViewer software, transforming a tool of modern warfare into a convenience for the typical computer user.However, there was more to the coincidence of this shift in territorial meaning. Yes, there was a familiar, generational shift away from one form of linearity in favor of another, from an absolute to a relative sense of both time and space. But something else had happened. The sky had opened and shifted to another axis \u2014 not of the earth itself but to bridge the connection, spatial as well as spiritual, between the land and the air, between the planet and space. As human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two \u2014 each in the presence of the other \u2014 became less predominantly horizontal than vertical.Eisenhower\u2019s open skies \u2014 our airy source of clarity \u2014 became momentarily possible. The views from an airplane in the comparatively unpolluted skies of California in the early 1960s allowed Thom Gunn to write of the intoxicating \u201crichness\u201d of an aerially mappable space \u2014 a vision of \u201cplaces I have not been to\u201d \u2014 which, on cloudless days, is the ideal of scientific clarity: \u201ca cold, hard light without break/that reveals merely what it is \u2014 no more/and no less.\u201dYet, as human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two became again less vertical, and more contrived. The sky filled with all those orbiting gadgets therefore has not only turned the earth upon its axis multiple times and surrounded it with multiple smaller spheres, but also broken it down into a familiar patchwork of seas, plains, ghettos, \u201cstreet views\u201d and possibilities of filtered vision that Google Earth presents us so readily with.The filling of the sky just above the earth with the flotsam and jetsam of the space age leads us to ask whether or not this represents some sort of ironical condition of foreclosure in the early-21st-century imagination, foreshadowed by Louis MacNeice in 1937: \u201cThe sky was good for flying/Defying the church bells/And every evil iron/Siren and what it tells:/The earth compels \u2026.\u201dMeanwhile, many more countries now watch from the sky what each of us is doing in microscopic detail. And so we may be right to ask if another conceptual breakthrough may soon occur in the spatial imagination. And we would be right to fear that the sky may fully close before that happens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Our \u2018Winner-Take-Most\u2019 Economy, the Wealth Is Not Spreading", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLabor\u2019s share of the pie is still crumbs. Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. They go on:Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor \u2014 known among economists as \u201clabor share\u201d \u2014 coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to \u201ctemporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.\u201dThe outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the \u201cfissuring of the workplace\u201d that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account \u201cfor a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.\u201dThe steady erosion of workers\u2019 bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors.\u201cThe Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,\u201d Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court\u2019s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June\u2019s Janus decision, and the Court\u2019s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses.The authors document increasing market concentration:From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues.Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile \u201cgrew 160 percent\u201d while firms \u201cin 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.\u201dWhat economists\u2019 technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people.The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: \u201cConcentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent \u2014 monopsony \u2014 that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.\u201d Firms dominating concentrated labor markets \u201cface relatively inelastic labor supply\u201d (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to \u201creduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.\u201dReduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor\u2019s share of income has fallen.Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart.Labor\u2019s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted.115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:97.17INDEXED TO 2009 = 100\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95115110105FIRSTQTR.2018:INDEXED TO 2009 = 10097.17\u201950s\u201960s\u201970s\u201980s\u201990s\u201900s\u201910s95By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector.In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share.Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: \u201cResults show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.\u201dWhat does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back:Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening:1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it).2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits.3. A general increase in profits.Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately becausewithout any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits.Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profitsaffects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households \u2014 which live on wage/salary income \u2014 and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments.This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate.The growing importance of digital innovation \u2014 new products and processes based on software code and data \u2014 has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter\u2019s vision, digital innovation gives rise to \u2018winner-take-all\u2019 market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, \u201caccrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.\u201dHow much money are we talking about?The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity \u2014 from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies.In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation\u2019s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent.While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years.$22.80Tax bill enactedJUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80Tax bill enacted$22.80JUNE$22.62$22.58$22.60$22.40$22.20$22.002015201620172018$21.80By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars.Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we\u2019ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover.That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations \u2014 amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections \u2014 is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates\u2019 probability of victory.These improvements, in turn, \u201clower uncertainty about an election\u2019s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.\u201dThe effect, then, is thatwhen one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most.Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others \u2014 a majority of them men \u2014 have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them.How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

{"Headline": "Amazon Delivers a Pile of Cash, but No Fireworks", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hold that champagne.Expectations for Amazon\u2019s second quarter were extremely high, and in some respects the company exceeded them when it released results on Thursday. But any hope that it would be the event that hurtled the company\u2019s valuation above the trillion-dollar mark will have to wait.Net sales increased 39 percent, to $52.9 billion, compared with the same period a year ago. Analysts predicted $53.37 billion. What\u2019s a $500 million miss from a highflier? Well, Facebook on Wednesday missed its estimates by about $200 million, on revenue that was a quarter of Amazon\u2019s, and the stock tumbled 19 percent.But Amazon leads a charmed life: Good results mean things are working out, and weak results mean it is investing so things will work out in the future.Net income for the quarter was impressive: $2.5 billion, or $5.07 per share, compared with $197 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2017. Analysts anticipated only about half that. Amazon has now been consistently profitable since early 2015, something a few analysts \u2014 and quite a few short-sellers, who were betting on the stock dropping \u2014 thought they would never see.\u201cA blowout quarter by virtually any measurement,\u201d said Charlie O\u2019Shea, Moody\u2019s lead retail analyst.The company\u2019s result eased some tech investor worries that Facebook\u2019s problems would spread elsewhere. Amazon fell $56, or about 3 percent, in regular trading Thursday \u2014 a minor blip in the stock\u2019s relentless march upward over the last decade. The company\u2019s results, posted after the markets closed, made up those losses plus a few dollars more in after-hours trading.Last week, both the power and the perils of Amazon were on vivid display. The company had its fourth-annual Prime Day, a made-up shopping holiday that is available only to Prime customers. It was so successful that the site crashed. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, estimated that Prime Day sales rose 33 percent from last year.But the sale was conducted against the backdrop of work stoppages in Europe that lasted as long as three days, one of the biggest labor actions in the company\u2019s history. The strikes, which happened in Germany, Poland and Spain, did not involve all the workers in those countries. In Spain, the police clashed with the strikers, resulting in at least one worker injury.Amazon responded with a statement saying it was \u201ca fair and responsible employer\u201d that was offering Europeans \u201cgood jobs with highly competitive pay, full benefits and innovative training programs.\u201dIn its announcement about its earnings, Amazon brought up the things it cares most about: its membership club, Prime; its market-leading cloud division, Amazon Web Services; and Alexa, the voice technology that powers the Echo devices people use in their homes.While Amazon gives few numbers on Alexa and Echo, the research firm eMarketer says 41 million people in the United States will use an Echo this year, up 31 percent over last year. Echo has about twice the market share of its closest competitor, Google Home.Amazon is so dominant in e-commerce that it barely needed to mention it in the earnings announcement. It controls exactly half of the online market in the United States. Its next competitors, including eBay and Walmart, own market shares mired in the single digits. Ebay, which bested Amazon in auctions long ago, has been struggling. It said it would lay off hundreds of employees this month.For years, Amazon has been on a hiring binge \u2014 world domination needs many hands. But in the second quarter, it slowed a bit, increasing only 12,000 from the first quarter. In 2017, employment grew 31,000 between the first and second quarters.Daniel Ives, head of technology research for GBH Insights, reaffirmed Thursday his $2,000 target for Amazon\u2019s shares, a price that would make it a trillion-dollar company.\u201cAfter the Facebook debacle last night,\u201d Mr. Ives wrote in a research note, \u201cwe believe the Street will be somewhat relieved to see Amazon deliver another strong quarter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The suggestions made by Mr. Warner\u2019s office aim to address how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by the misuse of those companies\u2019 services.Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For instance, the reports propose large tech companies should:\u25a0 Undergo audits of their data and algorithms.\u25a0 Be liable if they fail to take down illegal or damaging content.\u25a0 Have a duty to identify and remove fake accounts.\u25a0 Be subject to legislation demanding their transparency.Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology companies. Mr. Warner\u2019s office focused on increasing competition in the technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are deemed to be so dominant that they have become \u201cessential facilities\u201d for users. The House of Commons report said the portrayal of tech companies as monopolies \u201cdoes not appreciate the benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.\u201dStill, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long way from becoming law. Some of them \u2014 such as thorough audits of data and algorithms \u2014 may be technically difficult to achieve.

{"Headline": "What Adults Can Learn From Dutch Children\u2019s Books", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe busy urban worlds of \u201czoekboeks\u201d and \u201cwimmelbooks\u201d have a lot to say about everyday European life.Mr. Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.And then the zoekboek really opened my eyes.The first such book we got was \u201cDe Vrolijke Vier Seizoenen\u201d (\u201cThe Merry Four Seasons,\u201d Google Translate tells me, though the book was published in the United States in 2008 as \u201cIn the Town All Year \u2019Round\u201d), by Rotraut Susanne Berner. It depicts the same seven panoramic scenes in a village (including a residential street, a city plaza and a department store) across the seasons. There\u2019s no text except for signage in the scenes. Rolling within each season are subplots (a cat chases a mouse; a parrot escapes; a fallen jogger is tended by a passer-by, from which romance blooms), while macroplots are threaded across the year (a woman has a baby; a school is built; a pumpkin grows). The main action belongs to what people do in each season: plant their gardens, buy Christmas trees, gather in the park with lanterns. Maybe the book is nostalgic for a bygone past, but apart from the winter ice skating, snowball-making and the absence of smartphones, the scenes belong to a present we\u2019d comfortably join.She argues that the zoekboek and the wimmelbook differ from each other: The zoekboek gives the reader explicit search tasks (where\u2019s Waldo?) and often uses words, while the wordless wimmelbooks \u201callow for manifold reading options and encourage a highly active response from children and adults, which rightfully might be called a form of playing.\u201d When I now read traditional storybooks (which we also do at home), they seem rigid and prescribed in comparison.This unabashed display of human bodies in wimmelbooks is wondrous: \u201cEen huis vol,\u201d by Doro G\u00f6bel and Peter Knorr, depicts, among other things, a pregnant woman getting checked by a midwife, a kid sitting on a toilet and another soaping up in the shower, but those are morsels of the book\u2019s charm. The point of view pivots around a ring of houses, viewed in cutaway as if they\u2019re dollhouses. At the center of the ring is a rickety merry-go-round, untarped for a party by a man living in a bowtop wagon, who in one page heads to the preschool with a shovel to help bury a rabbit. I have to resist listing all the activities crammed into the pages of my favorite wimmelbooks because they would come across as cringingly mundane. But the cramming is, in truth, transcendent, this gentle collapsing of time and bending of space to capture worldly things in their everyday profusion. These detail-laden scenes defy both photography and film. They\u2019re human constructions for satisfying the cognitive pleasures of collecting clues, exploring and telling stories.My family reads our wimmelbooks so much, we\u2019re loving them out of their bindings. But they really sank their teemingness into me as I was reading Richard Sennett\u2019s \u201cThe Foreigner: Two Essays on Exile,\u201d in which he describes how the political revolutions of 1848 redefined nationalism from one based on monarchies or concocted geographic partitions to one based on ordinary rituals, everyday life and authentic selves.The revolutionaries of the age \u201cbelieved that a nation was enacted by custom, by the manner and mores of a volk: the food people eat, how they move when they dance, the dialect they speak, the precise forms of their prayers,\u201d Mr. Sennett writes. Wimmelbooks do just that \u2014 they show people glorying \u201cin their ordinary selves,\u201d as he puts it.That the wimmelbooks don\u2019t depict the volk I live among but are often outdated visions (given changing demographics in northern Europe) is obvious. Yet they underscore another of Mr. Sennett\u2019s themes: the foreign exile can\u2019t envision herself in the teeming, which I imagine happening to me when I return to the United States, unable to place myself in the wimmelbook of American life. If such a thing were even possible, that is. What\u2019s interesting to me is the visual perspective of wimmelbooks reflects the experience of riding not in cars but in trains and trams, where you pass close enough to houses to admire the tchotchkes in the windows and even through them to the back garden, at a slightly elevated angle, and at a pace slow enough to whet the curiosity about the residents yet quick enough to miss them if they should appear. Riding in a car never inspires me to the same curiosity.Michael Erard is writer in residence at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Portugal Dared to Cast Aside Austerity. It\u2019s Having a Major Revival.", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "At a time of mounting uncertainty in Europe, the country has defied critics who insisted on austerity as the answer to the Continent\u2019s economic and financial crisis.Supported byLISBON \u2014 Ram\u00f3n Rivera had barely gotten his olive oil business started in the sun-swept Alentejo region of Portugal when Europe\u2019s debt crisis struck. The economy crumbled, wages were cut, and unemployment doubled. The government in Lisbon had to accept a humiliating international bailout.But as the misery deepened, Portugal took a daring stand: In 2015, it cast aside the harshest austerity measures its European creditors had imposed, igniting a virtuous cycle that put its economy back on a path to growth. The country reversed cuts to wages, pensions and social security, and offered incentives to businesses.The government\u2019s U-turn, and willingness to spend, had a powerful effect. Creditors railed against the move, but the gloom that had gripped the nation through years of belt-tightening began to lift. Business confidence rebounded. Production and exports began to take off \u2014 including at Mr. Rivera\u2019s olive groves.\u201cWe had faith that Portugal would come out of the crisis,\u201d said Mr. Rivera, the general manager of Elaia. The company focused on state-of-the-art harvesting technology, and it is now one of Portugal\u2019s biggest olive oil producers. \u201cWe saw that this was the best place in the world to invest.\u201d\u201cWhat happened in Portugal shows that too much austerity deepens a recession, and creates a vicious circle,\u201d Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said in an interview. \u201cWe devised an alternative to austerity, focusing on higher growth, and more and better jobs.\u201dThe government raised public sector salaries, the minimum wage and pensions and even restored the amount of vacation days to prebailout levels over objections from creditors like Germany and the International Monetary Fund. Incentives to stimulate business included development subsidies, tax credits and funding for small and midsize companies.The economic about-face had a remarkable impact on Portugal\u2019s collective psyche. While discouragement lingers in Greece after a decade of spending cuts, Portugal\u2019s recovery has pivoted around restoring confidence to get people and businesses motivated again.\u201cThe actual stimulus spending was very small,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Borges de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o, a professor at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Business and Economics. \u201cBut the country\u2019s mind-set became completely different, and from an economic perspective, that\u2019s more impactful than the actual change in policy.\u201dThe brighter outlook has lifted companies like Elaia, the olive oil producer. Its parent company, Sovena, opened Elaia as a start-up on a vast agricultural plain in southern Portugal in 2007, just before the downturn. Its timing could hardly have been worse, but managers persisted, paving the way for a surge in production when the crisis ebbed.Elaia says it generates 14 percent of Portugal\u2019s olive oil today, contributing to a renaissance in Portuguese exports, which now constitute 40 percent of economic activity. Drones buzz over vast olive groves, precision-planted with 2,000 trees per hectare, or roughly 2.5 acres, compared with around 150 trees for a traditional farm, monitoring crops for insect infestations, water levels and optimum harvesting time. Olives are picked by machine. Instead of field hands, the company hires technicians to operate the robots, and it has teamed up with universities for research.\u201cPortugal has benefited a lot after the tough years we had,\u201d said Jorge de Melo, Sovena\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe mood is much better than it was before, and that\u2019s important for the economy.\u201dYet Portugal\u2019s success is still vulnerable.Portugal\u2019s unions are now threatening strikes to press the government to more fully reverse austerity, increase wages and unlock more public spending to reduce inequality.\u201cWe didn\u2019t go from the dark side to the bright side of the moon,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d\u201cBut when we started this process, a lot of people said that what we wanted to achieve was impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cWe showed that there is an alternative.\u201dTo cement the growth cycle, the government is putting what little investment it makes into targeted initiatives like tax breaks for foreign companies and training for the unemployed.An hour and a half east of Lisbon, in \u00c9vora, a five-acre factory built by the French airplane-parts maker Mecachrome rises from rolling plains fringed with cork trees. Lured in 2016 by government incentives and European Union loans, it invested \u20ac30 million in a vast aerospace park where bulldozers are plowing fields to make way for roads and businesses.Robots forge precision parts for Airbus, Boeing and other industry giants. Most of the 150 technicians were recruited nearby by an unemployment agency that started an intensive retraining program with the government.Luis Salgueiro, 29, an apprentice with Mecachrome, was jobless during the crisis. He eventually got work as a waiter, and then in a tomato factory, before landing again at the unemployment office. At the Mecachrome plant, however, he was helping to code a complex machine to fashion a titanium airplane part. Completing the apprenticeship is expected to lead to a full-time job.\u201cThe future looks really bright for me now,\u201d he said, beaming as he gestured around the factory.Christian Santos, Mecachrome\u2019s director in Portugal, said he plans to hire 150 more workers and to make millions in additional investments in the next three years.\u201cThings are happening in Portugal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an enthusiastic mojo here.\u201dCamilo Soldado contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Ram\u00f3n Rivera's olive-oil business. It is in the Alentejo region, not the Algarve region.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Corporate America\u2019s Short-Term Thinking", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.American companies, according to their critics, are so focused on making quick profits that they have abdicated building for the long term. That idea has captivated policymakers, commentators and even some leading business executives.But there is little evidence to back up the idea that American businesses are overly focused on short-term boosts to profits and stock prices.I have spent three decades analyzing, advising and investing in companies, and I believe American businesses are as willing to fund worthy projects as they have ever been. Investors are fully prepared to back companies focused on the long term. Far from penalizing public companies building for the future, the stock market often rewards them.Consider America\u2019s five largest public companies by market capitalization: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Facebook. All have been investing heavily, and all sport heady valuations.Amazon, in particular, often appears almost disdainful of profits; last year, it earned just $3 billion on its vast $178 billion of revenues. With a stock market capitalization of $805 billion, that gives it a price to earnings ratio of 268. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company trades at 21 times earnings. On the smaller end, many biotech companies, which often have no revenues, let alone any profits, also trade at handsome (some would say absurd) valuations.Away from the public markets, a towering wall of venture capital \u2014 hardly a short-term investment strategy \u2014 stands ready to fund pretty much any vaguely promising new idea.That brings us back to the stock repurchases. Yes, they often bump up share prices. But they are really a consequence of the vast cash reserves \u2014 $2.4 trillion and rising \u2014 held by American companies. When top executives don\u2019t see more attractive investment opportunities, at least not in the United States, it can be a prudent use of that cash to buy back shares in their own companies.As companies return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends, the money doesn\u2019t disappear. Its recipients typically reinvest it in other opportunities. That\u2019s not short-term thinking; that\u2019s efficiency.Advocates of the recent tax legislation say it will provide more incentives for American companies to invest at home. I\u2019d certainly welcome that. But taxes are only part of the equation. Businesses must also see the possibility of attractive returns, which are not always readily available in our relatively slow-growth economy.That\u2019s why many American companies see greater opportunity to expand abroad. Between 2000 and 2015, American multinationals hired 4.3 million people in the United States but added 6.2 million jobs overseas.Meanwhile, spending on factories and equipment in the United States has become a less important part of overall business investment, consistent with the decline in manufacturing\u2019s share as companies shift production to lower-cost countries.That was in 1980. Nine years later, Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, declared that \u201cAmerica looks 10 minutes ahead; Japan looks 10 years.\u201dToday, American technology firms are, of course, dominant, while Sony is a shadow of its former self.Across the spectrum, companies in the United States continue to lead the developed world, and profits are at record levels. If American business had been short-term focused since 1980, profits would be falling, not rising, and our companies would be faltering.Recently, the Business Roundtable \u2014 corporate America\u2019s pre-eminent trade organization \u2014 called for eliminating quarterly earnings guidance as a means of reducing short-termism. Such recommendations are, at best, a distraction. Only 28 percent of major companies even provide quarterly guidance, and those forecasts help set investors\u2019 expectations and smooth market volatility.Shareholders should be able to nominate directors more easily. To better represent owners, the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be split, as they are in many European companies.But corporate executives recoil from those ideas. They prefer to complain about equity markets that often swiftly punish laggards. Isn\u2019t that what investors are supposed to do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4,500 Tech Workers, 1 Mission: Get Democrats Elected", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It was four months and eight days until the 2018 midterm elections, and Anna Eskamani had not spent a penny to promote her political campaign online.Ms. Eskamani, 27, is running to represent Florida\u2019s 47th District in the State Legislature. Like many state-level candidates, she writes her own fund-raising emails and manages her own social media accounts. And with her busy schedule on the campaign trail, advertising online is an afterthought.\u201cMy budget is zero for it right now,\u201d Ms. Eskamani said. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been necessary.\u201dDozens of progressive groups are organizing for Democrats in this year\u2019s midterms. But Tech for Campaigns has focused on a particularly challenging assignment: dragging Democratic campaigns into the digital age, before it is too late.In a year and a half of existence, Tech for Campaigns has become a kind of Democratic Geek Squad \u2014 a national volunteer network consisting of more than 4,500 tech workers with day jobs at companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Airbnb. These volunteers, who include engineers, marketers and data scientists, are matched with Democratic campaigns across the country to provide training on digital skills, such as how to promote themselves on social media, build their email lists and use data analytics to identify potential donors.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake if we don\u2019t build a true centralized digital arm is falling further behind the Republicans and continuing to lose ground, the battles on key issues and elections at every level,\u201d said Jessica Alter, a co-founder of the group and a longtime tech executive. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start now, it will be too late in 2020.\u201dOne of the group\u2019s biggest tasks, Ms. Alter said, is persuading candidates to campaign heavily on social media, rather than relying solely on TV ads and printed mailers. Many Democrats running in 2018 are spending a much smaller percentage of their ad budgets on digital ads than their rivals, sometimes as little as 10 percent versus more than 40 percent for Republicans, according to two political consultants with ties to multiple campaigns.Tech for Campaigns has advised Democrats in about 60 races since it started, including Justin Nelson, who is running for attorney general in Texas, and Rob Quist, who was narrowly defeated in a special congressional election in Montana last year. The group plans to work with 200 campaigns by the end of the year, with a special focus on helping state-level candidates like Ms. Eskamani, who typically do not have the budgets to hire dedicated digital teams.\u201cWe do a lot of things that digital consultants don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cThe most common question we get asked is, \u2018What\u2019s the catch?\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Alter started contacting campaigns last year, she was shocked at how prosaic their technology was. Some campaign workers spent hours manually copying and pasting voter information into email lists. Others were not using basic social media capabilities, such as call-to-action buttons that can be used to ask followers to sign a petition, attend an event or make a donation.\u201cThey have all these really ingrained habits from pre-2016 that are very, very hard to unlearn,\u201d Ms. Alter said.Democrats are often thought to be tech-savvy, because the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were celebrated for their online touch and because much of Silicon Valley backs the party\u2019s candidates. In fact, Ms. Alter said, Democrats in congressional and state-level races have been outmatched by their Republican rivals, who benefited from the party\u2019s heavy tech investments during the Obama years and their enthusiastic embrace of targeted ads on platforms like Facebook and Google.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how not far along we are as a party,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cObama was really good at tech, but it never trickled down to a Senate race, let alone the state-level stuff.\u201dMs. Alter, 38, who sold her start-up last year and now works as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the venture capital firm Social Capital, came up with the idea for a tech volunteer network in early 2017, just after President Trump issued his travel ban targeting residents of several Muslim-majority countries.Outraged about the policy, and looking for a way to help, she enlisted Peter Kazanjy and Ian Ferguson, two friends in tech who shared her liberal politics. They agreed that Silicon Valley tech workers would jump at the opportunity to apply their technical skills to campaigns. How different is selling a candidate online, after all, from selling shoes or shaving kits?\u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d Mr. Kazanjy said. \u201cCampaigns are online/offline e-commerce plays, where the transaction is a vote.\u201dThey sent a Google form to their friends in the tech industry to gauge interest. Within three days, more than 700 people had signed up. The group has since grown to more than 4,500 volunteers, raised more than $100,000 in a crowdfunding campaign, and moved into an office in downtown San Francisco that it shares with a venture capital firm.Nick Hobbs, 29, first heard about Tech for Campaigns while working at Google. Mr. Hobbs, who left the company last year, had always been politically active, but Tech for Campaigns gave him a way to channel his efforts into something productive.\u201cInstead of coming home and watching Netflix, we come home and go to work,\u201d said Mr. Hobbs, who is helping redesign the campaign website of Elizabeth Thomson, a Democrat running in New Mexico\u2019s 24th District.Other left-wing advocacy groups, such as Swing Left and Indivisible, are helping to recruit volunteers and generate grass-roots support in competitive districts. Tech for Campaigns sees its role as behind-the-scenes amplification. Its work is mostly remote, and volunteers use a Slack channel to coordinate as well as regular calls with campaign officials.The group has not been universally welcomed by the party. It has irked some officials and media consultants, whose turf it is edging in on.

{"Headline": "Revealed: The People Behind an Anti-Breitbart Twitter Account", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust after the 2016 election, an anonymously run Twitter account emerged with a plan to choke off advertising dollars to Breitbart News, the hard-edge, nationalist website closely tied to President Trump\u2019s administration.\u201cThe way it happened sucks, but I\u2019m super proud of this thing and of all the people who worked on it and all the people who followed it,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said in his first interview since his involvement in the account was revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that we made advertisers think a little bit and realize what they\u2019re supporting.\u201dMr. Rivitz did not expect to rock the ad and media worlds with Sleeping Giants, which he viewed as an apolitical crusade against hate speech. While he is a registered Democrat, he said he had never been politically active outside of attending \u201cmaybe two marches pre-election.\u201d Most of his work for advertisers was focused on television commercials and did not involve social media. He wasn\u2019t a particularly active Twitter user.But Mr. Rivitz said he was struck by what he viewed as \u201cincredibly bigoted and racist and sexist\u201d content on Breitbart News, including in its comment sections, after his first visit to the site in November 2016. The site had gained prominence because of its ties to Stephen K. Bannon, its former chairman, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\u201cI was pretty amazed at the stuff they were printing, and my next thought, being in advertising, was, \u2018Who is knowingly supporting this stuff?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI thought maybe it would be two to three companies, and I quickly realized within a couple hours it was all placed programmatically.\u201dMr. Rivitz was referring to the automated systems that place most online ads and tend to target consumers based on who they are, rather than which site they are visiting.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like the advertisers would want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI just set up this anonymous Twitter handle and set up an anonymous email and just went for it, because I wanted to contact one advertiser \u2014 a progressive loan company from San Francisco.\u201d (The company, Social Finance, quickly pulled its ads.)Brian Glicklich, a spokesman for Breitbart, said, \u201cThe specific allegations they make about our content being racist, sexist or bigoted are false.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the idea behind Sleeping Giants was to inform advertisers, rather than to force boycotts. Breitbart News saw the account\u2019s mission differently.\u201cSleeping Giants\u2019 political playbook is to attack opposing speech through harassment and false claims to try to drive it out of business,\u201d Mr. Glicklich said. \u201cThey and others have failed at this every time it has been attempted. Democracy flourishes from more conversation, not less, which is why Matt Rivitz\u2019s speech suppression through economic force is among the most reviled techniques of coercion.\u201dMs. Jammi, who said her previous interest in politics had amounted to nothing more than following the news, discussed anonymity \u201cearly and often\u201d with Mr. Rivitz.\u201cInitially, we were kind of freaked out at the alt-right influence, and, obviously, one of our primary concerns was staying safe,\u201d she said.Since Sleeping Giants got its start, a great number of brands have taken steps to make sure that they do not appear on Breitbart. The site had about 649 advertisers on its website last month, showing around 1,902 different display ads, according to data from Moat Pro, a digital ad intelligence product. That was down from 3,300 advertisers and 11,500 display ads in November 2016. (Sleeping Giants\u2019 count of departed advertisers is closer to 4,000.)Critics have accused Sleeping Giants of engaging in a form of censorship, a criticism that Mr. Rivitz rejected.\u201cThere are plenty of conservative- and liberal-leaning news organizations that are doing everything in good faith and are talking about policy without bringing divisiveness and racism into it, and that\u2019s where the break is with some of these websites,\u201d he said.He added that he had received a barrage of threats and harassment in the wake of the Daily Caller article, which also named his wife and friends.Ms. Jammi, who was not named by The Daily Caller, said she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of harassment to expect, now that her role had been made public. She added that she hoped the attention would raise scrutiny of the big-tech platforms that kept advertisers in the dark.\u201cBreitbart is where we started, but ultimately the problem is not Breitbart or The Daily Caller \u2014 the problem is the tech companies,\u201d Ms. Jammi said. \u201cI fully support that right for them to write whatever they want. What I have a problem with is Facebook and Twitter monetizing it.\u201dMr. Rivitz said the Sleeping Giants community had grown so robust that he felt like an administrator. Still, he said, its mission remains the same.\u201cPeople can use their free speech to say whatever they want and print whatever they want, and that\u2019s what makes this country great,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean they need to get paid for it, especially by an advertiser who didn\u2019t know they were paying for it.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking Marriage Class at Guant\u00e1namo", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhile imprisoned for 14 years, a young Yemeni man learns about love from a fellow detainee \u2014 and an iguana.It wasn\u2019t easy to meet anyone where I was for all of my 20s and nearly half of my 30s, at the prison camp at the Guanta\u0301namo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. After I arrived, I was put in an isolation cell, where huge fans outside of each cell ran day and night, making deafening noise to prevent us from talking to each other.Even when we went outside for recreation, we were not allowed to talk to the other detainees. But outside we did meet new friends: the cats, banana rats, tiny birds and iguanas that came through the fences, asking to share our meals.I had a good friendship with beautiful young lady, an iguana. She was so elegant. She used to come every day at the same time, and we would have lunch together. When I went on a hunger strike, I had no food to give her, and I was ashamed to stand there without food as she came up to me. Sometimes the guards punished us for sharing our meals with the animals, but they couldn\u2019t stop me from talking to her.She couldn\u2019t talk back, but she was a good listener. As the years passed, our friendship grew into a strong bond. Finally, after seven years of isolation, I was moved into a communal block where I could talk with my fellow detainees. I was born in a tiny village in the mountains of Yemen and was only 19 when I came to Guanta\u0301namo. I didn\u2019t know much about the world; the world to me was my village. Now, my world was Guanta\u0301namo.Until I was 12, I thought I had been born from my mother\u2019s knee. I learned in school where babies really came from, but there was no dating in my society, so my knowledge remained theoretical. The same was true for most of us. Very few of us had been married or knew much about the relations between men and women. Even so, talking about women was our favorite topic. Not in a bad way; as Muslims we are forbidden to talk about women in a bad way. But we talked about women because it relaxed us. When someone would tell a story about a woman, we all would listen. While being surrounded by men we imagined loving women.We weren\u2019t the only ones who missed women; the male guards did, too. There were very few female guards. One of the older, married detainees saw that the single detainees were desperate to know about women, so he decided to teach us. We used to arrange classes and learn from each other anything that could be taught. For example, a former chef taught a cooking class. He would say, \u201cNow, I will add the onion to the hot oil \u2014 shhhh shhhh,\u201d imitating the sound of frying onions because of course we had no onions or oil or stoves. He would make jokes, asking the students to please taste the dishes to test if they had enough salt or if they thought the meat was ready, even though there was no salt or meat. I didn\u2019t like that class. It just made me hungrier.On our first day of marriage class, our teacher began by asking us each to say what we thought about how men should treat women. We agreed that men should have absolute respect for women, but many of the students said men always were, and always would be, superior to women. Then the teacher asked: \u201cIf you were a woman, how would you answer my question? How would you want men to treat you?\u201dAt first we started laughing, imagining each other as women.\u201cLook at Mansoor with hair all over his body,\u201d one detainee shouted at me. \u201cYou would scare all of the men.\u201d\u201cIf I were a woman,\u201d another said, \u201cI would make you all dream, cry and spend all of your money \u2014 but none of your ugly faces would touch a single hair of mine.\u201dOur teacher let us joke for a while but then said, \u201cAnswer my question, ladies!\u201d I said that if I were going to choose someone to accompany me for the rest of my life, I would want a wife who was better than me.One of the students tried to embarrass me by saying, \u201cSo will you let your wife be in charge? Should men just be like donkeys, serving women?\u201dI argued that men have been thought to be superior throughout history, but look where we are now. War follows war without end. Men never give birth to a single soul. They only take lives.I said that all of us, guilty or innocent, were sitting around Guanta\u0301namo talking about marriage instead of experiencing it because of what men had done. I finished by pointing out that we all knew that when there was a female commander in charge of our guards, we lived more peaceful lives. When the commander was a man, we were more likely to be treated badly.\u201cMansoor is biased toward women,\u201d one detainee said with a laugh.\u201cIf I were a woman,\u201d another said, \u201cI would marry you!\u201dAs we kept meeting for marriage class, our teacher taught us about loving and being loved. He described what it would feel like when we saw and talked to the woman we loved. He told us how we would act on our engagement day. And then we had an entire class dedicated to the biggest day in our lives, the marriage day. We pretended that one of the students was getting married, and we held a traditional Yemeni wedding celebration. We sang and danced as if it were a real marriage.I have never been in love, but now I could feel its sweetness. Just like the cooking class, the marriage class made me hungrier. I regretted not being married before I came to Guanta\u0301namo. I felt there was a missing part of myself, and that part was a wife and family. For a while I had in my cell a photo from a friend of his 10-year-old daughter. I made a frame out of scraps of cardboard with flowers surrounding it and hung the photo on the wall. Whenever visitors came into my cell, I would tell them she was my daughter.When they looked surprised that I had a blond daughter and started asking more questions about the mother, I would say I had never met her, but still, I had a daughter just the same. I gave her an Arabic name, Amel, which means Hope.One night the guards came in and pepper sprayed us and tore down everything in our cells. They threw away my Hope.I could have stopped going to the marriage classes. I could have stopped dreaming about love. But the only thing harder than living a life without love is living a life without pain. Pain tells us we are alive. That we can still feel. Sometimes, pain is like love. Because I could imagine love, even without my photo, I still had hope.When, after many years of not being able to speak to my family, I was allowed phone calls with them, there was talk of perhaps trying to arrange a marriage for me, and I was tempted to accept this hope. But in marriage class, we had discussed the problem of forced marriage in some countries. The idea of girls being sold like sheep hurt me. And so I declined the possibility of such an arrangement.On the last day of marriage class, our teacher told us to always remember how we had answered his first question about how men should treat women. We all had different answers now. He had made his point. He wished us happy marriages and good lives with love in them.In 2016, after being detained for more than 14 years, I was released from Guanta\u0301namo. But I wasn\u2019t allowed to go home to Yemen. Instead, I live in Serbia. I am lonely. I haven\u2019t yet found a woman to be my friend and my wife and teach me the art of love. I don\u2019t even have an iguana anymore. My hope is still alive. It helps me face the hardships of my daily life. I wish hope and love could help us with the hardships we face as nations too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Employee Uprisings Sweep Many Tech Companies. Not Twitter.", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWorkers across the technology industry are forcing their employers to reconsider how their products are being used by the United States government.But it\u2019s premature to declare those giant tech companies as suddenly woke. The government contracts in question are inconsequential to their fortunes.A better test of tech-worker activism would involve a company with a primary product that is being used to inject misinformation and authoritarian speech into mainstream conversation \u2014 and, more to the point, a company that appears to have directly benefited from the toxic flood of political vitriol in which all of us are now drowning.In other words: Will there be an employee uprising at Twitter?The social network favored by President Trump has a complicated political ethos. Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, and the company has reveled in its centrality to viral progressive movements \u2014 the Arab Spring, #BlackLivesMatter, #metoo and #MarchForOurLives were all animated by forces on Twitter.The tension between Twitter\u2019s liberal employee base and the service\u2019s role in news and politics has only heightened recently. For years, Twitter\u2019s business looked gloomy; with about 300 million users, it had a fraction of Facebook\u2019s billions of members, and it struggled to convince advertisers and the mainstream public of its relevance. But in the last 18 months, Twitter found a new focus in the news. The company shed ancillary businesses and tweaked its central feed to highlight virality, turning Twitter into a bruising barroom brawl featuring the most contentious political and cultural fights of the day.Perhaps. But at what cost to the world?Twitter declined to make Mr. Dorsey available for an interview. The company did put me on the phone with Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal, policy, trust and safety, who echoed the idea that there is robust debate within Twitter about its impact on the world.\u201cA lot of our employees are here because they\u2019re tied to the mission that we\u2019re serving and to our purpose in the world,\u201d Ms. Gadde said. She defined that mission as providing \u201ca healthy public conversation,\u201d but acknowledged the company has had trouble defining exactly what such a healthy conversation might look like.To critics, Twitter\u2019s call for outside help in deciding the most straightforward element of its platform feels like part of a familiar pattern at the company \u2014 slow-walking a response to problems that have long been obvious to users, and that grow more obvious by the day.After all, isn\u2019t there enough evidence already that conversations on Twitter aren\u2019t very healthy?Nikki Usher, a journalism professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was the study\u2019s lead author, suggested that there were several ways Twitter could address this disparity, including by providing users with stats on their behavior. She also said that what happened on Twitter had real-world consequences.\u201cBecause it\u2019s this insular community of journalists following other journalists, when people think of someone who they might like to hire, people whose names keep showing up in their Twitter feeds are first of mind,\u201d Dr. Usher said.You might argue that it is too much to ask Twitter to consider its effect on long-simmering social problems like gender inequality. So let\u2019s look at a more direct way that Twitter impacts discourse: Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, which are very likely to become even more important as the political season heats up before the midterms.But what if that \u201cimportant information\u201d conflicts with Twitter\u2019s mission to promote a healthy public conversation?Sooner or later, Twitter\u2019s executives and employees are going to have to make a decision about which is more important, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets or the company\u2019s desire to promote a healthy public conversation. It\u2019s hard to see how both are tenable.Advertisement"}

Businesses in the area like his, he said, had lost anywhere between 15 percent to 40 percent of revenue because of the Mud Creek landslide. Hotels and inns lost more because fewer visitors from Southern California were coming and staying overnight. Visitors from the south could still get to Big Sur through a treacherous detour inland that involved steep cliffs and hairpin turns, but many stayed away.Visitors from the north still came, he said, but they were more likely to visit just for the day.Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline, according to Susana Cruz, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. Before that, the largest landslide had been in 1983, farther north at Pfieffer Burns State Park.An earlier version of California Today misidentified the Golden Gate Bridge as the Golden State Bridge.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Like Facebook and Twitter Are Drawing Lines. It\u2019ll Be Messy.", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut now, for good reason, the absolutist ethos is over.Over the past two years, pressed by lawmakers and the media about the harm caused by misinformation, state-sponsored propaganda and harassment, tech platforms have begun to radically overhaul their attitudes about what people can say online and how they can say it.This is a huge deal, and it\u2019s well past time for the tech companies to take a firmer stand against lies and harassment. Still, as they wrestle with the question of responsibility and where to draw the line on certain kinds of content, we should all get ready for a very rough ride.Here\u2019s why: A mostly hands-off approach has been central to the tech platforms\u2019 growth, allowing them to get to globe-spanning scale without bearing the social costs of their rise. But because they are now so influential \u2014 Facebook alone has more than two billion users \u2014 and so deeply embedded in our lives, a more hands-on approach to policing content will ripple around the world, altering politics, the media business and much else in society.It could also have the opposite effect than what many critics want: better policing their own content could actually increase the power that tech platforms have to shape our lives.I spent much of the last week talking to people who are working on these issues both inside and outside these companies. I came away from these conversations encouraged about their thoughtfulness, but there are few answers to the questions they face that will satisfy many people.After talking to these companies and others, I got a sense of why their efforts to fix their issues are hard to understand. Tech platforms say they don\u2019t want to be rash \u2014 they are all seeking input from many interested parties about how to develop content policies. They are also still exceedingly concerned about free expression, and still lean toward giving people the freedom to post what they would like.Instead of banning speech, they often try to mitigate its negative effects by reaching for technical approaches, like containing the spread of certain messages by altering recommendation algorithms or imposing limits on their viral spread.\u201cThere are nuanced policies for a reason,\u201d said Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of policy. \u201cSome of this stuff is very complicated, and when we craft these policies, it is not a group of people sitting in Menlo Park, Calif., saying where we think the line ought to be.\u201dMs. Bickert said she has set up regular meetings with a range of experts to hash out how Facebook should draw the lines on a host of specific kinds of speech. In general, the company removes content that is illegal, dangerous, fraudulent or otherwise spammy and inauthentic. But for areas that are less black-and-white, like misinformation, it takes a different approach.\u201cWe reduce the distribution of information that is inaccurate, and we inform people with more context and perspective,\u201d said Tessa Lyons, a product manager who heads Facebook\u2019s effort to curb misinformation in the News Feed.To do this, Facebook has partnered with dozens of fact-checking organizations around the world. It limits the spread of news that has been deemed false by showing those posts lower in users\u2019 News Feeds, and it also displays more truthful articles as an alternative to ones that aren\u2019t accurate.Andrew McLaughlin, a former head of policy at Google who now runs an incubator that aims to build technology for progressive political movements, said he was impressed by Facebook\u2019s efforts.\u201cI think I\u2019m representative of a certain crowd of people who once took a really strong sense of pride in the sturdiness of our commitment to free speech on internet platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my views have certainly shifted in the caldron of experiences \u2014 and I am now glad that platforms like Facebook are really focusing resources and energy on malicious, manipulative propaganda.\u201d (He previously consulted for Facebook, but is not currently working for the company.)But I\u2019m less sanguine, because there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about these policies and their effects.I asked Ms. Bickert if Facebook takes potential political repercussions into account when deciding its policies. She told that me her team \u201cseeks input from experts and organizations outside Facebook so we can better understand different perspectives and the impact of our policies on global communities.\u201dThat\u2019s gratifying, but it doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the problem: Facebook is a for-profit corporation that, for both regulatory and brand-image reasons, wants to appear politically unbiased. But if it determines that some political actors \u2014 say, the alt-right in the United States, or authoritarian dictators elsewhere \u2014 are pumping out more false news than their opponents, can we count on it to take action?The same suspicions apply to other platforms: Even though President Trump arguably violates Twitter\u2019s content policies, he has been allowed to stay up. Imagine the outcry if he was blocked.This gets to the larger issue of transparency. Ms. Bickert is messianic about openness \u2014 she points out that Facebook was the first large platform to publish its entire community standard rule book.That\u2019s salutary. But if Facebook\u2019s written policies are clear, how it carries them out is less so. Little is known, for example, about the army of contract workers the company hires to review content that has been flagged \u2014 in other words, the people who actually make the decisions. (Facebook says they are extensively trained and their actions audited.) And because much of Facebook is personalized and many of its rules are enforced through slight tweaks in its ranking algorithm, the overall effect of its content policies may be very difficult for outsiders to determine.That problem also plagues other platforms. Twitter, for instance, has a content filter that governs which tweets are displayed in parts of your feed and search results. But the filter\u2019s priorities are necessarily secret, because if Twitter tells you what signals it looks for in ranking tweets, people will simply game it.\u201cPeople try to game every system there is,\u201d David Gasca, a Twitter product manager, told me.None of these problems are impossible to solve. Tech companies are spending huge sums to improve themselves, and over time they may well come up with innovative new ideas for policing content. For example, Facebook\u2019s recent decision to release its data to a group of academic researchers may allow us to one day determine, empirically, what effects its content policies are really having on the world.Still, in the end we will all be left with a paradox. Even if they\u2019re working with outsiders to create these policies, the more these companies do to moderate what happens on their sites, the more important their own policies become to the global discourse.A lot of people are worried that Mark Zuckerberg is already too powerful. The danger is that we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Combat China\u2019s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtAt the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow?These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn\u2019t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout?Here\u2019s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you\u2019re used to, could plan a role in the future.Does this sound un-American? It shouldn\u2019t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries\u2019 advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries.But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of \u2014 and will own \u2014 tomorrow\u2019s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy.You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in?But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. \u201cLife science and software get a lot of money,\u201d he said.I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump\u2019s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development.But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China\u2019s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry.One huge problem with today\u2019s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now \u2014 as we\u2019re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy \u2014 there\u2019s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise.Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today\u2019s miracles.It\u2019s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes.A federal plan to win this or that industry isn\u2019t guaranteed to work. But at least it will prompt us, as a country, to think about what\u2019s coming.Advertisement"}

As Mr. Steinberg notes below, his crossword had all intentions of being a Thursday puzzle, but the editors may have been short of good Wednesdays and eased things up a bit by shading the squares, giving solvers a target to hit.Either way, this specimen was a lot of fun to solve, both in the fill and in sort of realizing the dreams of a young girl \u2014 me \u2014 who loved to dig in the dirt.10A: ORCS are a common enough Tolkien creature in crossword puzzles, but it looks as if either Mr. Steinberg or the editors are venturing into fresh cluing territory with this one.

When said three times, RHO would be a good name for a fraternity that specializes in crew (\u201cRow, Row, Row!\u201d)70A: This was a tough one for me, but all I had to do was look down at my keyboard.

It turns out that the two symbols both share the same KEY.10D: I had OPEN BOOK for \u201cNot requiring memorization, as a test\u201d before OPEN NOTE, but once I got the NN rebus I realized that BOOK was wrong.44D: I love SKRILLEX, both for his Scrabbly stage name (his real name is Sonny John Moore) and his music.

Read from top to bottom, they spell the name of the dinosaur, TYRANNOSAURUS REX. We just have to put the pieces of Mr. REX back together. The best part is the way Mr. Steinberg was able to cross his revealer, F (OS)SIL (with the OS as a rebus) with the place where we are unearthing this behemoth, the DIG SITE.Another thing I liked about the puzzle was the sheer number of debuts that Mr. Steinberg was able to pack into his grid.

My idea was that the grid would be an archaeological dig site where solvers would uncover the \u201cfossils\u201d one by one, ultimately realizing that they spell TYRANNOSAURUS REX.As for the actual construction process, I came up with this idea while I was waiting for a flight at J.F.K. airport, and I built most of the grid in the terminal. I was especially excited about crossing DIG SITE with F[OS]SIL, and I made a point of making the rebus entries as lively as I could. When I got home, though, I realized there was a problem: My theme entry OEDIPUS R[EX] felt too similar to TYRANNOSAURUS REX. After redoing the bottom, I ended up with the current version.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet Pedro Guerrero. No, Not THAT Pedro Guerrero.", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the Philadelphia Phillies hired a former baseball player named Pedro Guerrero in November to serve as their assistant hitting coach, Roxanna Guerrero received an outpouring of messages.She is not married to the Pedro Guerrero employed by the Phillies. He is 29.The people who called were not the only ones to be confused by the two Guerreros. This case of mistaken identity has been going on for much of the younger Guerrero\u2019s career. Thanks to a job as a major league coach and the success of the surprising, young, National League East-leading Phillies, the younger Guerrero has gotten more attention, albeit misdirected attention.As a player and a coach in the Dodgers\u2019 minor league system, Guerrero received at least two dozen requests a year to sign baseball cards of the other Pedro Guerrero. This year alone, he said, he has received 71 cards and counting.\u201cWhen we get back, I\u2019m going to have like 40 more cards waiting for me,\u201d the younger Guerrero said during a recent Phillies road trip.The elder Guerrero is loving all of this. \u201cIt makes me feel young,\u201d he said, laughing, during a recent telephone interview.If only it were just fans.Soon after the younger Guerrero was hired as a minor league coach for the Dodgers in 2016, the organization mistakenly sent the first three paychecks to the elder Guerrero\u2019s address. Even though he had requested direct deposit into his bank account, the younger Guerrero was told to expect the first few paychecks by mail. They did not arrive.\u201cEventually I complained, and they sent me the address to where the checks were going,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018Florida? I don\u2019t live in Florida. I live in Utah.\u2019\u201dThe Dodgers apologized and reimbursed him for the missed paychecks.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, he\u2019s gotten my checks, too,\u201d the elder Guerrero said.Not exactly, but close. Over the winter, the younger Guerrero was in Utah, where he has made his off-season home since he met his wife in 2009 while he was playing for a lower-level Dodgers minor league affiliate that is based there. In the mail one day came a pension statement intended for the elder Guerrero.\u201cI didn\u2019t reach the big leagues as a player, so I was like, \u2018Oh man, is this for him?\u2019\u201d the younger Guerrero said. \u201cIt was the summary of what he gets monthly. I had never gotten anything before like this of his, and now I did?\u201dGuerrero tracked down a phone number for the elder Guerrero and called. The younger Guerrero jokingly told the older one that he should also send him the pension check. Although both are from San Pedro de Macor\u00eds in the Dominican Republic, they had never talked or met until then.They nearly did meet when the younger Guerrero was 11 and his father, also named Pedro Guerrero, shared a mutual friend with the elder Guerrero. They could not arrange a meeting, but the elder Guerrero signed a baseball card for the younger one, then an aspiring player.The younger Guerrero never saw the older one play. There was no cable in his house when he was growing up, so his family watched whatever was on the local television channels. That meant a lot of Chicago Bulls games, because of Michael Jordan, and Cubs games because of the Dominican star Sammy Sosa.The elder Guerrero\u2019s final major league season was 1992. After the younger Guerrero\u2019s playing career ended in 2013 \u2014 he reached Class AAA but struggled to hit \u2014 he spent a few years in Utah working on telephone towers and antennas for a construction company. Then he built airbags.In 2016, the Dodgers hired him as a minor league coach. He made a strong impression on the farm director, Gabe Kapler. When Kapler was named the Phillies\u2019 manager this winter, he brought Guerrero with him.Both Guerreros find it amusing and puzzling that they are confused for each other. A Google search quickly reveals that they are many years apart and do not look the same. In his baseball cards, the elder Guerrero is often pictured with his trademark mustache and poofy hair. The younger one keeps his hair and beard more closely cropped.\u201cThey should check the birth dates,\u201d the elder Guerrero said of fans.\u201cWe have different skin tones,\u201d the younger Guerrero added.During spring training this season in Florida, a fan handed the younger Guerrero a baseball card of the elder Guerrero.\u201cDespite seeing me face to face, he said, \u2018Pedro, can you please sign?\u2019\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cI looked at it and was taken aback. I said, \u2018Really?\u2019 And I gave it back.\u201d He did not sign the card, believing it would be disrespectful.In the past, the younger Guerrero simply returned mailed baseball cards of the elder Guerrero to the sender. He did not provide a written explanation for the unsigned card because, he said, it would take too long to do so for each request.This year, because he received nearly three dozen baseball cards during spring training, he has saved them all in an envelope to see how many arrive by the end of the season. At that point, he said, he plans to give them all to Phillies relief pitcher Pat Neshek, a baseball memorabilia collector.\u201cThey\u2019ll probably go in the trash,\u201d Neshek said. \u201dI\u2019m not going to lie. I have no use for them.\u201dThat is because the elder Pedro Guerrero, according to Neshek, is known among autograph seekers as a tough player to get an autograph from. The elder Guerrero, who now lives in New York, said he signs, but admittedly not often. (Additionally, he was sick last year. He had a stroke and fell into a coma. He said he is feeling much better now.)The elder Guerrero said the younger one could send the cards to him if he wanted.Neshek said he could relate to the fans who mistook the Guerreros for each other. He too has accidentally sent autograph requests to the wrong player of the same name. There were once two Chris Carpenters in the majors at the same time. On the Phillies, Neshek said, the bench coach Rob Thomson has been confused for Robby Thompson, the former Giants All-Star second baseman. Chris Young, the assistant pitching coach, is mistaken for a retired pitcher and an outfielder on the Los Angeles Angels, all three of whom have the same name.\u201cPeople get confused,\u201d Phillies first baseman Carlos Santana said. \u201cIt happens. People have asked me if I\u2019m related to Carlos Santana, the guitarist.\u201d (They are not.)Santana, however, would never mix up the two Guerreros, especially because he was once a teammate of the younger one in the Dodgers farm system. But it might not matter, because more strong play from the Phillies is likely to mean more exposure for Guerrero and thus more erroneous autograph requests.Told that this article could help clear it up, Guerrero laughed. \u201cOr make it worse,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Spending Is Up, but Aerospace and Defense Workers Are Scarce", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sunny Sunday in March, 29 new United States Air Force recruits took an oath to support and defend the Constitution.This was not just any swearing-in because the man turning civilians into airmen was an Air Force Thunderbird pilot. When Maj. Eric Gorney finished the ceremony on the tarmac at Florida\u2019s Orlando Melbourne International Airport, he climbed into an F-16 and along with five other Thunderbird pilots proceeded to dazzle the tens of thousands of spectators who minutes earlier had applauded the Air Force\u2019s newest members.At a time when all four branches of American\u2019s armed forces are actively recruiting to meet new personnel goals, high-profile performance teams like the Thunderbirds and the Navy\u2019s Blue Angels are powerful tools. Similar recruitment efforts are deployed around the world by the Snowbirds in Canada, the Red Arrows in Britain, and other teams as far-flung as Finland and Jordan. Maj. Ray Geoffroy, a spokesman for the Thunderbirds, said the team\u2019s goal was to \u201crecruit, retain and inspire\u201d the next generation.\u201cThe U.S. defense budget is the big dog in global military spending,\u201d John H. Schmidt, global managing director for aerospace and defense at the consulting firm Accenture, said of the $700 billion spending plan. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increased investments in existing programs around the world,\u201d he said.Searching for people to do the work funded by these budgets puts the defense and aerospace industries in competition with companies like Google, Alibaba and Facebook, names that are more familiar and more firmly rooted in the minds of the digital generation.In this environment, companies are trying to be more creative to get the attention of younger workers. \u201cWhile competition for skills is fierce, we continue to attract and recruit incredible talent globally,\u201d the Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers said in a statement.\u201cIn the past, if you wanted to do cool high-tech stuff, there wasn\u2019t anything else\u201d but the military, Mr. Schmidt said. Now, he added, the military has to address the impression among many young people that it is \u201cold and slow.\u201dThe adrenaline-fueled military air show teams are one way of changing that impression. When show season begins, the Thunderbirds arrive with their F-16 fighter jets. They give journalists and celebrities an opportunity to ride along on a gravity-defying flight, challenging them not to pass out or throw up.But the pilots also work on the ground, officiating as Major Gorney did at enlistment ceremonies. Last year, they also visited 55 schools and 25 hospitals. They met with scout troops and civic organizations, spreading the message that military service can help people \u201cbecome the best version of themselves,\u201d Major Geoffroy said.Thirty-one thousand new enlistees joined the Air Force in 2017, down about 500 from 2016 but higher than the previous six years. More than 1,000 people enlisted in the Air Force at Thunderbird events last year, with 4,000 more expressing interest in the service, according to Brooke L. Brzozowske of the Air Force Public Affairs Office.The public fascination with military performers can be seen around the world. In Finland, which has one-year military or civil conscription for all men at the age of 18, the Midnight Hawks demonstration team flies four BAE System Hawks at air shows and roars over the country\u2019s two annual military parades on Independence Day and Defense Forces Day.\u201cPeople are quite keen about the military,\u201d said Capt. Marc Fuss, a pilot and the team leader. \u201cStill, we need to keep the spirit up and keep them aware of the air force and defense forces and that is the role our display team plays.\u201dThe Royal Jordanian Falcons team promotes tourism through its summer appearances at European air shows and encourages young people to join the air force and learn to fly, according to the retired colonel Ghazi Sadoun, a pilot and team operations leader.England\u2019s Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, known as the Red Arrows, shows off the British-made Hawk T1 jets it flies and the Rolls-Royce engines that power them, also a British product. Watching the Red Arrows turns some spectators into performers, according to the team\u2019s website: \u201cMany of the pilots and other members of the Squadron joined the Royal Air Force as a direct result of seeing the Red Arrows perform as children.\u201dFinding more people to design, create and maintain the systems is critical. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much is in the plane beyond the wow factor of how fast it goes,\u201d Mr. DeLaney said. \u201cIn the F-35, the helmet that the pilot wears is a half-million-dollar piece of equipment and technology. That\u2019s the more enticing thing.\u201dAccording to Mr. Schmidt: \u201cAerospace is on the cutting edge of many technologies.\u201d If in the past the armed forces and the companies that do business with them didn\u2019t make effective use of that argument, that appears to be less the case now with a personnel crisis on the horizon. Whiz-bang displays, however, may not be enough to counter an unwillingness among some tech workers to create software with lethal applications.In April, more than 3,100 Google employees signed a letter to the company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, asking that the company not participate in a Pentagon program to create artificial intelligence for targeting drone attacks.Mr. DeLaney experienced something similar in his business, which provides candidates to companies with military contracts. \u201cSome individuals I recruit have shot me down,\u201d he said, when he approached them about defense-related jobs. Mr. DeLaney said the candidates told him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things that blow up or put people in harm\u2019s way or are a threat to people.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no single big red \u2018easy\u2019 button to be pushed\u201d to overcome these hurdles, said Maj. Gen. Mark Smith, the national commander and chief executive of the Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the United States Air Force.\u201cYoung people have to have the opportunity to get hands-on experience and explore potential career opportunities that are aviation-related or of interest to the air force, like cyber security or maintenance or logistics, robotics and unmanned vehicles,\u201d said Brent Wolfe, secretary general of the Canada-based cadet exchange.As part of the 2018 United States defense budget, a small amount has been set aside to help pay for flight training for cadets who otherwise would not be able to afford it. It is part of the Civil Air Patrol\u2019s mission to promote aviation and careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). General Smith said helping the cadets get a private pilot\u2019s license could \u201cprime the pump\u201d and motivate some to fly for the military and maybe even become the kind of pilots who will inspire the next generation.\u201cThere are a lot of kids that think the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels are amazing and really cool,\u201d General Smith said. \u201cThey give kids an appreciation for what the military is doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.Yet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.Facebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.Facial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201dBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.Rochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.At the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.European regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.Nikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201dFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.People could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.But Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.One patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.Another Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.But legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.The case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.If the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stacy Brown-Philpot of TaskRabbit on Being a Black Woman in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner Office The Detroit native studied at Penn and Stanford, worked for Goldman and Google, and now runs the gig economy pioneer that Ikea acquired in 2017. Stacy Brown-Philpot didn\u2019t grow up aspiring to be the chief executive of a technology company. Instead, she wanted to be an accountant. After nine years at Google, she joined TaskRabbit \u2014 which lets people hire freelancers for odd jobs \u2014 as chief operating officer. She became chief executive in 2016, and last year, she sold the company to Ikea, the Swedish furniture giant. Tell me about your upbringing. I grew up on the West Side of Detroit. My mom raised my brother and me by herself. We didn\u2019t have a lot. My mother worked a job that didn\u2019t pay a whole lot of money, so she had to make a lot of sacrifices. But she prioritized education. She would fall asleep helping us with our homework at night. She always taught us that no one can take your learning away from you. And with that, you can go anywhere and do anything.So I focused on getting good grades. I wasn\u2019t always a popular kid. I didn\u2019t have the best clothes. But I was a smart kid. It\u2019s cool to be smart in Silicon Valley. It\u2019s not cool to be smart on the West Side of Detroit. What was your first job?I had a paper route with my brother. I would help him collect the money. I was like the C.F.O. of that operation, making sure we got paid. And then you went to Penn.I had no idea what an Ivy League school was. I was a fish out of water. My high school was 98 percent black. Penn was 6 percent black. So I had to find community. I had to figure out how was I going to succeed in this environment where most people don\u2019t look like me, and don\u2019t come from where I came from. So where\u2019d you find community?There was a black college house. I didn\u2019t live there. I would just go over there and spend time just sitting around with people that, you know, ate collard greens and fried chicken, just like I did growing up. It just made it safer for me and more confident for me to walk into a classroom and know I knew the answers and speak up. What did you do after graduating from Penn? Look, I still have that degree. I still love accounting. I just wanted to do more. So I went to work at Goldman Sachs in investment banking. You can\u2019t graduate from Wharton and not spend any time in banking. In that process, I worked on a bunch of tech deals in 1999. There were all these users and eyeballs, and these companies are going public at higher valuations. So I got very fascinated with how come this industry is generating so much wealth \u2014 what is this entrepreneurship thing?Once you got to Google, you started managing larger and larger teams.Sheryl saw the potential for leadership, so pulled me into her group to run a 200-person team. I went from managing 14 to 200 people overnight. That was a big step up in not just how I led but how I talked to people, how I communicated. I went from managing direct reports to managing managers, and becoming more responsible as a leader. And then I went to India, and went from managing 200 people to 1,000 people. Was going to India a difficult decision? It threw a monkey wrench in my plan. My husband and I were thinking about starting a family at the time, and India would have delayed that decision. So I go home, and I tell my husband: \u201cThey asked me to go to India, but I\u2019m not going to go. We\u2019re thinking about starting a family.\u201dBut I\u2019d always wanted to live abroad. India was a really important market for Google at the time, and I knew they were going to take care of me. So we decided together, as a couple, to delay the decision to start a family so I could take this career opportunity. So I went back to work and said, \u201cHere are all the things I need to make this work for me.\u201d And they were like, \u201cYes.\u201d Then I went back and asked for some more, because they said yes too fast. How was managing in India different than in the United States? I had to adapt my style. Google, at least in the U.S., was very consensus driven. In India, it was a lot more directive. My style is to naturally be consensus-driven, so I had to immediately adapt.After about a month in India, my assistant came to me and said: \u201cStacy, you\u2019re going to be great here. Everyone loves you. But you have to start to tell people what to do.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI\u2019m already telling people what to do. We\u2019re having these meetings. We\u2019re agreeing.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cNo. You have to actually tell people what to do.\u201d My Detroit upbringing taught me how to be directive. I had to defend myself from bullies. So I knew how to speak up. So I just had to go back to my roots. You\u2019re one of the few black executives in Silicon Valley. How has race shaped your professional experience?I get discriminated against all the time. No one thinks I\u2019m a C.E.O. I sit on a plane and tell somebody, \u201cWell, I run this company.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWhat? You run a company?\u201d And it\u2019s like shocking. You could imagine someone else sitting in that seat where no one would be surprised.Why did you leave Google? Why did you join TaskRabbit? The mission of revolutionizing everyday work \u2014 I just fell in love with it. I mean, I grew up with people who were hardworking, whose jobs were taken away from them because the auto industry was decimated. And here\u2019s this platform that\u2019s creating everyday work for everyday people. What an opportunity. To me, this is going back to my roots in Detroit, which is how do I help people around me? How can I help a community of people do something more than they could otherwise accomplish on their own? Why did you sell to Ikea?A friend of mine gave me some advice, which was: \u201cNow that you\u2019re the C.E.O. of this successful company, people are going to want to buy the company. Make a list of who you would talk to so you don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d So I did that, and Ikea was on the list. The values were aligned. Ikea seeks to eliminate poverty around the world. They create affordable products for people everywhere. When we told our employees, everyone clapped because they were like, \u201cOh, thank god. We\u2019re actually selling to a company that we admire and we respect.\u201d That\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve done the right thing. We took care of our investors, we took care of the team, and we\u2019re taking care of the company. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Magnet for Latino College Students", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn this week\u2019s Race/Related newsletter: A look at the University of California, Merced campus, and a visit to Charlottesville almost a year after the white nationalist rally.As a student at the University of California, Los Angeles decades ago, Alejandro Degadillo accepted that he would only occasionally see fellow students who looked like him. When he did, there was an unspoken sense of connection, the notion that their brown skin meant they shared not only a language or culture but also a mix of pride and insecurity.\u201cWe were reminded every so often that we were part of the elite, and we know the responsibilities we had were not just for ourselves,\u201d Mr. Degadillo said one afternoon this spring while sitting in his office at the University of California, Merced, where he now works as the associate director of the Calvin E. Bright Success Center. \u201cWe have to teach our students that burden, that sense that when they go into the workplace, it doesn\u2019t usually look like this.\u201dWhile the majority of high school students in California are Latino, the same is true at just one campus in the University of California system: Merced. More than two-thirds of the students at Merced are the first in their family to attend college. And many come from cities and towns that are overwhelmingly Latino. So it has often struck Mr. Degadillo that these students have no idea just how rare a campus like Merced is. There are just two dozen public colleges in the country where Latinos are the majority.When I spent time at Merced this year, I tried to understand how its demographics shape the campus experience. In dozens of conversations, it was clear that many of the students hardly saw the demographics as remarkable. They struggled to articulate what might be different at a campus like Merced, particularly compared with other elite colleges, where Latinos often make up less than 20 percent of all students.\u201cThey are the majority, and they don\u2019t initially realize how special that is,\u201d said Mr. Degadillo, who also worked for years at University of California, Santa Cruz, where he regularly spoke to students who missed the kinds of food and music they took for granted at home. \u201cIt was significant; you felt like there was something missing. Students were always looking for someone who could relate to their story. When you don\u2019t have to look for a cultural identity, you can kind of take it for granted.\u201dThe impact of the campus on the state remains unclear: Will Merced push more Latinos through the prestigious University of California system or further marginalize Latino students? Then tell us what your college experience was like. Did you look to people who shared your ethnic background for support? Would you prefer to be part of the dominant demographic group on campus?Jennifer Medina is a national correspondent based in Los Angeles.CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 In the days following the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville last summer, angry residents took over a City Council meeting, screaming and weeping into the microphone.

Those investments would build on billions of dollars that investors have already put into the companies.The investments reflect facial recognition\u2019s embrace by Beijing, which has created a better environment for companies to test the technology than in the West.

", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn accusation that Twitter was suppressing conservative political views drew the attention of President Trump. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on.When President Trump accused Twitter of \u201cshadow banning\u201d Republicans in a tweet on Thursday morning, it was the latest salvo in a long-running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views. Twitter \u201cSHADOW BANNING\u201d prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.When a person is shadow banned, their posts on a platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves. Their experience using a site may not change \u2014 they feel like they are still posting normally \u2014 but other people cannot see the material they produce, said Monica Stephens, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies social media.\u201cShadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down, and that often has to do with, particularly, the content that you are posting,\u201d Ms. Stephens said. \u201cMaybe it doesn\u2019t violate the terms of service, but they make it so other people can\u2019t see that content.\u201dNo, it is not. Vice claimed that Twitter was shadow banning some Republicans because their accounts \u201cno longer appear in the auto-populated drop-down search box.\u201d The profiles appear when conducting a full search, the article noted, but not in the \u201cmore convenient and visible drop-down bar.\u201dBasically, you could still search for the accounts, but Twitter would not automatically suggest them. But that is not what shadow banning means \u2014 or meant before this week \u2014 and on Wednesday and Thursday, the internet engaged in a real-time debate over its definition. In a statement, Twitter flatly rejected the claim made by Vice: \u201cAs we have said before, we do not \u2018shadowban.\u2019\u201dKevin Collier, a tech writer at BuzzFeed News, marveled at the misuse of the phrase by both Vice News and the president. A spokesman for Vice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Thursday.The Republicans mentioned by Vice News included Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican Party; Representatives Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz; and Andrew Surabian, a spokesman for Donald Trump Jr., who does not hold a position within the party. After the story was published, many Republicans said they felt vindicated by its claims.In short, their Twitter accounts remain highly visible. \u201cThat is not at all shadow banning,\u201d Ms. Stephens said. \u201cThis all goes back to a lot of people not understanding how the social media they interact with works.\u201dThat is the evergreen question of life on the internet. It is true that the names of some Republican officials are not auto-generating in Twitter\u2019s drop-down search bar. Twitter has said it is aware of this situation and it trying to fix it.\u201cThe profiles, Tweets and discussions about these accounts do appear when you search for them,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTo be clear, our behavioral ranking doesn\u2019t make judgments based on political views or the substance of Tweets.\u201dWhat does that mean? Well, as even the most casual Twitter user may be aware, the site has a problem with people on it saying and doing terrible things, from Russian election hackers to the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. And on Thursday morning, Vice News updated its original story and headline with a statement saying, \u201cTwitter appears to have adjusted its platform overnight to no longer limit the visibility of some prominent Republicans in its search results.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Please Take My Son\u2019s Wallet", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA life cut short is revealed through reward cards, drink coupons and arcade passes.I know what\u2019s inside: three $100 bills and another $140 in twenties and tens. I sometimes got on his case for carrying so much money. He thought my concerns were overblown, even when one of the bar-based poker games he frequented in Madison, Wis., got held up at gunpoint. (He was thankfully not playing that night.)My wife and I agreed that he had the risk profile of a teenager \u2014 that his frontal cortex wiring was only slowly catching up with his 26 years.Inside with the cash is his first and only credit card, a Visa from our local bank. I have already sent in a request to have it canceled. Underneath the credit card is his insurance card from work, probably still marked with the fingerprints of the emergency room staffer who needed it.Underneath are four expired insurance cards along with his Delta Dental card. We never did convince him that flossing was a good idea, and our strident advice about being able to keep his teeth into old age now just echoes cruelly.In the front pocket is a multipass from Geeks Mania Arcade, where the owners recently shifted from plugging quarters to a 24-hour, play-as-much-as-you-want $15 admission. Zach was not a fan. For $15 in quarters he could play his favorite pinball machines for weeks. He was something of a pinball wizard, traveling for tournaments. On family pizza outings he often would leave behind machines racked with free games.Behind the arcade pass is a free cocktail card from the local bowling alley. He regularly won such prizes at the monthly pinball tournament held there. A nondrinker, he would give them to me to pass along to his old high school tennis coach, who loves to sip cocktails at the bowling alley bar.As a lifelong tennis player and a former club professional, I thought tennis was one of the gifts I could competently pass to my two boys. Like a lot of younger brothers, Zach would tag along when I tutored his older brother. Eager to prove himself worthy of similar attention, Zach would take a hopper of balls to the next court and patiently drop and hit them over the net, retrieve and repeat, for the entire hour.When his brother started playing tennis in local tournaments, Zach was all over me for permission to do likewise. He was tiny for his age and deeply unathletic in a traditional sense, outpaced by his peers in soccer and towered over in basketball. When he was 8, I told him he could enter tournaments when he could reliably serve, a task that seemed to ensure at least a two-year deferral.He dragged a bucket to the local courts and worked endlessly until I had to admit he had met the mark. He played his first 10-and-under tournament an hour south of Madison in Janesville. He didn\u2019t win a game but was ecstatic. There is now a shelf full of tennis trophies in his bedroom, which I guess we\u2019ll leave there. What else would we do with them?Behind the free cocktail card is a gift card to the local movie theater, given by his mother on his birthday months earlier, which he had yet to exhaust. Like most young men, he preferred action movies to slice-of-life dramas. He liked to quote from movies and expected you to immediately recognize the tag lines.Then there\u2019s the AAA membership card we had bought for him, never imagining that the only towing his car would undergo was courtesy of the local police department, who impounded it in accord with the procedural requirements of a fatal accident. He looks so young in his Wisconsin license picture, taken in 2010, when he was 19. Blue eyes, blond hair (thanks, Mom) and 5 feet 4 inches tall (sorry, Dad).The membership was set to expire in December. On my calendar, I still have a reminder to renew. An even younger picture appears on his scratched University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Blugold Visa debit card, which I can\u2019t imagine ever having had a balance since he graduated with an economics degree in 2014. Next to this is a worn BART transit card from the week he flew to San Francisco to visit his brother. (He missed the stop and ended up in Oakland, but they soon connected and we chalked it up to life experience.)On the left side of the wallet is a series of reward cards: a Magical Movie Rewards card I imagine to be some sort of frequent user benefit and a Fire Keeper\u2019s Club card from the Potawatomi Hotel and Casino in Milwaukee. He would occasionally drive there for a Saturday session or for tournaments; he played enough to get free nights.After Zach graduated from college, the local, slots-only casino opened an electronic poker room and he became a regular. I dropped in once to see what this was all about, and the poker room manager chatted me up after I introduced myself.\u201cOh, Zach is one of the big winners,\u201d he said, punching up his balance. He couldn\u2019t share the data with me but added with a sly smile: \u201cIf he needs a new car, he\u2019s good.\u201dMy wife and I were relieved when that poker room shut down and Zach began to apply himself to career planning, passing the first two four-hour actuary tests. The only personal object his work supervisor returned to us after his accident was his study binder for the third actuary test. Perhaps this math reminded him of school, because he went through the screening and became a regular volunteer math tutor at his former high school.Next in the wallet is a Total Rewards World Series of Poker card from Caesars Palace and a similar one from Boyd and MGM. Last summer he and his brother went to Las Vegas and played one of the side events in the World Series of Poker.Zach had been an inveterate game player since his endless demands for another round of Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders. At 5 (with the stature of a 3-year-old), he once dazzled a group of adult spectators by zipping through levels of the Oregon Trail at the demo station at our local Best Buy.It was early in the morning of Sunday, April 22, that my wife and I received Zach\u2019s wallet from the emergency room at University Hospital in a plastic bag along with a pocketful of change and the clicker to his car. We had arranged for him to begin driving my 2009 Mazda after a long battle to persuade him that the 1997 Camry, which had belonged to his grandmother, was no longer safe or reliable.We were convinced he would be better off with roof airbags and side curtains. He protested, claiming he could drive the old Camry for another 100,000 miles, and he was probably right. We arranged for him to pay me $4,000 for the car, something of a bargain in Blue Book terms.I didn\u2019t reveal how I had simply sent this money into a Roth I.R.A. in his name, also the destination for the monthly rent he had been paying us since college, when he moved back home to live with us. We wanted him to have a head start on a fruitful retirement.He had been driving my Mazda for about a month and maybe wasn\u2019t comfortable with it yet. Maybe my obsession with avoiding scratches and door dings had permeated his subconscious. Late on Saturday night, after playing in a poker tournament at one of the local bowling alleys, he had stopped and stepped out of the running car to get directions from a friend to another game.For some reason \u2014 for some stupid, sloppy moment \u2014 he left the car in neutral instead of park, and it began to roll down the slope toward the back wall of the bowling alley. With quickness that belied him on the tennis court, he dashed behind the car to try to stop its momentum, to keep my pristine car scratch free.Instead, the car backed him against the wall and crushed him.In my occasional thoughts about my own mortality, I have envisioned scenarios of my sons going through my things: tossing my files into the recycling bin, sending my books to a bookseller, laughing at my lifetime habit of stuffing receipts into drawers.Now, for me, that order has been perversely inverted. I\u2019m looking at my son\u2019s wallet. I know what\u2019s inside. I hope someone will come and take it away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over, Lenin: Make Room for the Computer Keyboard", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Russia, a country awash in monuments, an unusual landmark honoring technology has become a favorite spot for the I.T. crowd.\u201cThis is cool, because I would not have expected this,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Russia, we mostly have statues of Lenin.\u201d But only Yekaterinburg has a monument to the computer keyboard. At first glance, it looks like a cryptic disused graveyard with odd tombstones laid out in a mysterious pattern. But then you see the letters and the non-letters: ESC, SHIFT, ENTER and all the other ones. The urge to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and see what happens is powerful. The monument comes with no plaque or explanation, so visitors are free to make of it what they will. \u201cKeyboards have a deep relationship to our lives, so they are a good thing to commemorate,\u201d said Rie Ozaki, 42, who had just arrived from Japan. Tetsuo Kagawa, 32, an emergency-room doctor from Tokyo, wandered past, whipped out his cellphone and fired up Google Translate. \u201cIt is a difficult question, what it means,\u201d his phone said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of creating it?\u201d Built directly into the ground, without an underlying base, in this city near the Europe-Asia border, the keyboard is also meant to evoke the meeting between east and west, between technology and nature. The keys used to be quite tall, but have settled into the earth over the years just as real computer keyboards have gotten shorter. Dmitry Kalinin, who helps run a local exhibition and event center that includes a computer museum, said that while Russians have great admiration for I.T. specialists, their work remains slightly mysterious to computer users. \u201cUsually you deal with them when something goes wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have this stereotype that they\u2019re not only tech nerds, but they really do know more about everything than we do,\u201d Kalinin added, recalling a time when, suffering from computer problems, he sought help through an online I.T. forum. \u201cI tried to find some information, and it was like, \u2018What are you talking about, guys?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a word they were saying.\u201d It\u2019s not quite the same as when druids gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. But participants bring snacks and, using their own laptops, play the 1990s computer game Quake, said Sergey Marbyanov, who runs the computer museum. There is also a sort of I.T. Olympics, which includes powerlifting defunct hard drives and competing to see who can throw a computer mouse the farthest. The keyboard monument was financed mostly with money and materials provided by a local tech company, and installed by volunteers who were paid 1,000 rubles a day, or $15.93 at today\u2019s exchange rate, Vyatkin said. It is cleaned and maintained (and its keys occasionally repainted) by keyboard enthusiasts who have taken it upon themselves to do the job.\u201cIt\u2019s great that her life goes on regardless of me,\u201d said Vyatkin, the artist. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that the I.T. people are engaged in it and are promoting it.\u201d According to local lore, couples who can contrive to press CTRL+ ALT+ DEL simultaneously can restart their relationships. \u201cEverybody knows that this combination of keys allow you to close and then open again \u2014 to reset,\u201d Kalinin explained. \u201cThe problem is that you have to use teamwork, and this is hard to do.\u201dTo make a wish, visitors can spell it out by jumping on the correct letters and then hitting ENTER. (Klava purists say this works only if you don\u2019t step on any other letter along the way.)\u201cI once tried, but I failed,\u201d said Marbyanov, who has a favorite letter on the keyboard: J, after Will Smith\u2019s character in the movie \u201cMen in Black.\u201d Back by the river, a Russian couple wandered past. The woman idly hopped on some of the letters, and her companion told her how to use the keyboard to find her heart\u2019s desire (or some equivalent). Perhaps he was a bit hasty.\u201cYes, I jumped,\u201d she responded, \u201cbut I do not want to make a wish.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trade Politics Comes to the County Fair", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "As agricultural life is celebrated at county fairs nationwide, this year offers a new variable: President Trump\u2019s global face-off over tariffs.Supported byFew things in life are more reliable than the county fair. Evoking decades past, they appear every year \u2014 hot and sticky, an emporium of pop-up rides in cartoon colors, fried foods on sticks and contests that bring blue ribbons.Long ripe for political debates, fairs are also places to contemplate the variables of farm and ranch life. Beyond rain, drought and finicky machinery, this year offers a new subject: a global face-off over tariffs.To get a glimpse at a summer of uncertainly, we visited three weekend fairs: one near Indianapolis, another in an Ohio county of about 65,000 people, and still another southeast of San Francisco.MARION, Ohio \u2014 Terry Ackerman wore his \u201cspecial occasion\u201d boots, the ones made of sheepskin, to the Marion County Fair.\u201cI live for the fair,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. \u201cI always feel better about the future of our country after the fair.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not opposed at all,\u201d said Mr. Ackerman, 58, who has farmed since his teenage years and now has about 800 acres of soybeans, corn and wheat, the leading crops around here. \u201cIt would certainly be better if we could progress without tariffs \u2014 there\u2019s no question about that \u2014 but I guess I would say it\u2019s short-term pain for long-term gain.\u201dMarion County, about an hour north of Columbus, does not treat its fair as a summertime rite of a bygone era. Drive around the county seat, where Warren G. Harding staged his \u201cReturn to Normalcy\u201d campaign from his front porch in 1920, and you\u2019ll see signs posted by businesses and civic institutions beckoning visitors to the fenced-in fairgrounds. The fair book for this year\u2019s event, the 168th iteration, ran 92 pages.And on sale day, it seemed no sound \u2014 no midway ride, no crackling caldron of frying oil, no turkey\u2019s gobble \u2014 rose above the cries and pleas of a short-sleeved auctioneer.You could hear him from the parking lot. You could hear him at the stand with $3 chocolate milkshakes. And, of course, you could hear him while you sidestepped hogs and the kids with pig whips.Mr. Ackerman, whose children used to show cattle, has been coming to the fair for decades. In that time, he has become increasingly wary of the trade imbalance between the United States and China. He does not expect, or even necessarily want, a perfect trade balance with Beijing; instead, he talks about a more \u201clevel playing field.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re smart, shrewd people,\u201d Mr. Ackerman says of Chinese importers, \u201cand I tip my hat to them. If I was buying a bunch of grain, I\u2019d be trying to buy it as cheap as I could, too.\u201dMr. Ackerman said he voted for President Trump and credits him with recognizing the trade issue\u2019s urgency. \u201cThere\u2019s enough win-wins that can be had in trade, and I think the United States in the past has not pressed for more of that win-win situation,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said.He hopes that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in recent weeks will inspire what he perceives as a crucially needed shift. But they could convulse Marion County, which, because of its farms and a Whirlpool factory that can make about 20,000 dryers a day, has a larger stake in the trade war than many places. Mr. Ackerman knows he is \u201cnot bulletproof,\u201d but with some hedging and a generational advantage over younger farmers with more debts and fewer savings, he figures he can handle a two-year trade battle.\u201cI spend time figuring out how to manage it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable, but don\u2019t misunderstand: It\u2019s not without concern, but I really think this is going to get worked out.\u201dOn Saturday especially, he did not fret.He bought a turkey at the auction. He lifted the price of a dairy feeder he thought was fetching too little of someone else\u2019s money. And with silence and a series of quick nods, he won a goat raised by his electrician\u2019s daughter.His successful day at the auction left him optimistic. \u201cI plan on doing it until I can\u2019t get up,\u201d he said.PLEASANTON, Calif. \u2014 Hog prices have never been higher at the Alameda County Fair.Garrett Post, 18, got more than $2,000 for his 265-pound pig, Kanan. You could easily get a half-dozen pigs for that price at a commercial auction.But at this fair, overpaying for hogs raised by hobbyist farmers is the point. Unlike hog farmers elsewhere in the country, who are already fearing the impact of new tariffs that China imposed last week on American pork, fairgoers in Alameda County this weekend were more concerned about the trade war\u2019s potential impact on Northern California\u2019s wine industry and the nearby ports.Mr. Trump is already unpopular in this part of the country. The trade war has done little to affect that.The buyer of Mr. Post\u2019s pig, a man in a cowboy hat and black shirt embroidered with horseshoes and a large silver and gold \u201cswine leader\u201d belt buckle, was not a disinterested party.He\u2019s an engineer at Chevron, the oil company, who lives in the Oakland hills with a view of the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge. He is also Garrett\u2019s father. Ron Post bought his son\u2019s pig on behalf of his neighbors, who each paid a share to get fresh cuts of meat from a pig that went on regular walks on the fire trail in the open space behind their homes.And that\u2019s the point of the youth auction at the Alameda County Fair. Local companies, family members, a local politician \u2014 everyone who buys hogs, cattle and lambs at the livestock auction knows they are paying way above market price.\u201cIt\u2019s a great program for the kids,\u201d said Lou Seever, the owner of a tire and auto repair shop who bought more than $20,000 worth of livestock at the youth auction on Sunday.Scott Hagerty, a member of the Alameda County board of supervisors, attends every year, buys pigs and then donates the meat to homeless shelters.Land is so scarce and expensive in the Bay Area that raising pigs here doesn\u2019t make much economic sense.\u201cYou can\u2019t buy a house in this town for under a million bucks \u2014 and that\u2019s a 40-year-old house,\u201d said Mr. Seever, who grew up in South San Francisco.Promoters say raising farm animals keeps the kids out of trouble. And in a part of the country best known for giving birth to Google, Apple and Facebook, raising pigs is a decidedly offline experience.Among the hobby farmers at the auction on Sunday, the trade war with China was not a topic of conversation. But Mr. Hagerty, the supervisor, said local vintners would likely be impacted by China placing tariffs on American wine. Also potentially affected would be the Port of Oakland, which is in Alameda County, and which ships much of the Northern California wines that go overseas.Laura Post, Garrett\u2019s mother and a school psychologist in Palo Alto, said she views the trade war from the standpoint of a consumer.\u201cI\u2019m personally not a fan of all the tariffs that will penalize buyers,\u201d Ms. Post said. As a Democrat, she\u2019s also not a fan of Mr. Trump, whom she describes as a self-centered bully.\u201cI\u2019m not super excited about the political situation right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I live in the Bay Area, and who is?\u201dSHELBYVILLE, Ind. \u2014 The payoff of a tractor pull happens in less than a minute: Your engine roars, smoke billows, and your tractor barrels forward, often flipping up into a wheelie, dragging an impossibly heavy sled along a dirt track until it can go no farther.The rest of the time is spent tending to that tractor, hauling it around inside a huge truck and devoting untold hours to readying it for the next competition.\u201cOnce the sport gets in your blood, it\u2019s just there,\u201d said Ron Mitchell, a farmer who spends his off hours wearing a fireproof suit and helmet, participating in tractor pulls like the one on Saturday evening on the final night of the Shelby County Fair.\u201cYou\u2019ll work a week for one 20-second pull,\u201d he said.Like tractor pulls, farming takes patience. Mr. Mitchell, 53, has a lot of that. He has watched the corn on his fields and on fields around Shelby County, southeast of Indianapolis, grow tall and sturdy this season; old hopes for \u201cknee high by the Fourth of July\u201d have been wildly and happily surpassed.All the while, Mr. Mitchell has also watched reports of a growing trade war with a sense of concern, but also with his trademark patience.Long term, he says, the Trump administration\u2019s conflict with other countries over tariffs will probably end well, with more fair markets. He says that would be good and has long been needed.\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be hard on the farmer here for a bit,\u201d said Mr. Mitchell, who said he usually votes but chose not to in 2016; he wasn\u2019t comfortable with either Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump.Mr. Mitchell\u2019s soybeans have taken off in the last few weeks. The price, meanwhile, has been sinking in recent weeks amid speculation about the trade dispute\u2019s impact. So Mr. Mitchell has been thinking about small ways to cut costs.Hold off on a new combine? Search for lower fertilizer costs?\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait this out,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump won Indiana, and more than 70 percent of Shelby County voters chose him. Still, some at this county fair were more pointedly critical of the administration\u2019s trade fight. Why not remove people from welfare rather than punish farmers who were already making narrow profits, asked one farmer, who declined to be quoted by name.The last night of the Shelby County Fair \u2014 a clear, warm evening with a pinkish sky \u2014 drew a slightly subdued crowd. The Hot Mess, a concoction of French fries, pork, nacho cheese and barbecue sauce, wasn\u2019t going as fast as it does on some nights, nor were the burgers cradled inside doughnuts, burgers inside pancakes, burgers inside French toast.At a \u201cFool the Guesser\u201d booth, the tanned, tattooed host who guesses ages, weights or birthdays for $5, abandoned his subtler pitches for customers, calling out on his microphone at one point: \u201cHelp me out. I\u2019m trying to get a little gas money to get out of town.\u201dAll the same, the truck and tractor pull drew a loud, enthusiastic crowd.Mr. Mitchell spent years searching for the tractor he uses in pulls \u2014 a late 1960s-model Allis-Chalmers 180, the very one that a family friend had used in tractor pulls when Mr. Mitchell was growing up. He spends about 50 summer nights at these pulls, all over Indiana and Kentucky.Could the trade fight cause him to cut back on his hobby?It\u2019s a thought, he said. Maybe he doesn\u2019t buy new tires as often. \u201cOr the night that you really want to beat your buddy, maybe you don\u2019t turn the boost up,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you keep it back and just make a nice pass and hope to beat them without tearing your engine up.\u201dThis night, Mr. Mitchell\u2019s orange tractor whirred and rumbled as the weighted sled was hitched behind it. \u201cGive it up for the hometown boy!\u201d the announcer called out as the tractor\u2019s immense tires began spewing dirt.A few seconds later, his tractor had gone 301.26 feet \u2014 good enough for third place \u2014 and it was all over.Alan Blinder reported from Marion, Ohio; Thomas Fuller from Pleasanton, Calif.; and Monica Davey from Shelbyville, Ind.

{"Headline": "A Novel Chases Its Narrator on the Tour de France", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Bike-racing has produced some good writing in recent years, but almost all as nonfiction \u2014 memoir, biography, travel-writing, literary meditation. There has been little fiction of note, aside from the one supreme example of the Dutch writer Tim Krabb\u00e9\u2019s darkly mysterious existentialist novella, \u201cThe Rider\u201d (originally published in the 1970s). How to account for this paucity? I tell myself two stories, one fancy, the other crude.The first is that bike-racing does not need fiction because the race itself is already a perfect narrative arc, with a cast of characters, panoramic settings, struggles, setbacks, heroism and final resolution. How can a novelist improve on the epic that is every Tour de France?The more mundane obstacle for the would-be fabulist of the peloton is that sportspeople are such unpromising material: The very things that make a professional athlete successful \u2014 single-minded dedication, self-belief verging on narcissism, a requisite lack of imagination \u2014 don\u2019t necessarily make for interesting characters. How does the writer conjure a sympathetic interior life for someone whose chief preoccupations are getting enough calories and sleep before the next day?Joe Mungo Reed tries a structural solution to this conundrum. His debut novel, \u201cWe Begin Our Ascent,\u201d recounts a week toward the end of a Tour de France while interweaving episodes from the life of his unnamed first-person narrator, a middling British racer on a middling Continental team \u2014 the back story of how he met his wife-to-be, Liz, the birth of their son and so on. As a device, this is effective enough: We learn more about the narrator as we go along. And as the novel develops, Reed brings the two strands artfully together.Early in the tale, on the team bus after a stage of the race, our hero receives testosterone drops on his tongue. Ah, a doping story. Although no date is specified, that detail places us squarely in the world of Lance Armstrong in the early 2000s \u2014 in particular, Reed surely relied on the cyclist Tyler Hamilton\u2019s account in his 2012 memoir, \u201cThe Secret Race.\u201d As the Tour goes on, our narrator becomes engulfed in this story and, at the behest of the scheming team director, Liz becomes an accomplice in an elaborate smuggling operation of vials and blood bags.The narrator\u2019s cycling career and his personal life grow more tangled and we know things cannot end well. The \u201cascent\u201d of the title turns into a steep descent. Sure enough, as the Tour reaches a climactic stage, the novel bends the parallel tracks of its narrative together in catastrophic collision. In this formal sense, it\u2019s a well-made fiction. And yet, not a wholly satisfying one.By far the most vivid character is the team director, an uncouth, amoral machiavel. But the rest are underdrawn, including the oddly impassive narrator and Liz, who, though a biologist, has no qualms about the illegal drugs. They seem fond parents, but what do they have in place of values?My other beef is that the descriptions of bike-racing, where Reed strives for transcendence, are filled with false notes that will jar true cycling fans among his readers. He calls a rider in a breakaway a \u201cbreaker,\u201d and uses the term \u201csaddle ointment\u201d for chamois cream, and says that a racer avoids collision by deciding to \u201cglance\u201d his brakes. I wondered if such unforced lexical errors were for literary effect, but chiefly they made me feel as if I were reading a Dutchman\u2019s account of racing processed through Google Translate. (By contrast, Krabb\u00e9 was extremely well served by his translator, Sam Garrett.)Reed is talented, and as debut novels go, this is a decent start. But my impression was that the Tour has once again shrugged off a challenge to its own storytelling prerogative.Matt Seaton, an editor at The New York Review of Books, is the author of a memoir about cycling, \u201cThe Escape Artist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cognitive Test Trump Took May Have Been Undermined by Publicity, Doctors Warn", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWhen I saw that this test was being disseminated to the mass population, and in some cases individuals were being invited to take it online, I wondered whether there would be an effect,\u201d said Dr. Haghbayan, a medical resident at the University of Western Ontario who wrote the letter while at the University of Toronto.The group collected data to show how widely the test\u2019s questions were publicized after Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy and then the White House physician, mentioned it at a news conference in January.\u201cThe fact that the president got 30 out of 30 on that exam, I think that there\u2019s no indication whatsoever that he has any cognitive issues,\u201d Dr. Jackson said.Using a Google News search, Dr. Haghbayan and his colleagues found 190 articles published in the days after the announcement that mentioned MoCA in reference to the president.Search interest for MoCA spiked at the time. But the effect of the news coverage may have outlasted that news cycle, the researchers said.\u201cGiven ongoing interest in age-associated cognitive function, public awareness of specific cognitive tests, such as the MoCA, may continue to increase,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is possible that the MoCA\u2019s applicability may be compromised in individuals exposed to its contents via such mainstream media reporting.\u201dIn an email on Tuesday, the creator of the test, Dr. Ziad Nasreddine of Montreal, acknowledged that the resulting publicity may have had an effect, but argued that it would likely be limited to healthy patients.\u201cFor already mildly impaired subjects, I doubt that the learning effect is significant since these subjects usually have already significant short-term memory loss,\u201d he said. Still, he added, it might be wise for doctors to use less-publicized versions of the exam in order to maintain valid control groups.Doctors have several other methods of assessing cognitive impairment, including alternative versions of MoCA itself, said Dr. Haghbayan, who acknowledged that the letter could bring even more attention to the test.\u201cIt\u2019s all a balance of informing the public,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit would be best to report on it in a more general sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018O.K., Google, Make Me Happy\u2019: In This Novel, Technology Is a Panacea", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The premise of Katie Williams\u2019s first novel for adults, \u201cTell the Machine Goodnight,\u201d revolves around a piece of technology, called an Apricity, that instructs its users how to be content. The central characters include Pearl, who works for the company that makes the machines and believes in the guidance of their individualized \u201ccontentment plans\u201d to the extent that she steadfastly uses them to balance her own life. The machine tells her to make models of prehistoric trilobites, so she makes them.The problem for Pearl is that her teenage son, the distant moody Rhett, doesn\u2019t feel the same way. He doesn\u2019t want to take the swab necessary for the machine to give him a reading. He is scarred by his experience of anorexia (which Williams writes about brilliantly) and, particularly, the way he lost control over his own body \u2014 not just through the illness, but through the treatment that\u2019s been forced on him. He can\u2019t even bear to be touched by his mother, let alone listen to her advice, and so she decides to take matters into her own hands and \u201csolve\u201d Rhett\u2019s unhappiness \u2014 even if it means breaking the law.This is a story of many perspectives, which might feel a little overloaded for some readers, but I thought they all fit perfectly, and offer a comment as well on the fragmented existences we live online.A host of characters orbit around the two figures of mother and son, and we occasionally zoom in on them, getting their perspective \u2014 including Elliot, Rhett\u2019s artist dad and Pearl\u2019s ex-husband; and Pearl\u2019s gullible boss, Carter, a self-made man who is portrayed as someone living a kind of duped and diluted life. (\u201cHis childhood had been a pastiche of evenings watching popular sitcoms, the couches the actors sat upon in their fake living rooms a nicer version of his family\u2019s own couch.\u201d) There is also Zihao, Rhett\u2019s Chinese college roommate, who wants to be taught \u201chow to be American\u201d and is willing to teach Rhett to \u201cbe a human\u201d in return.The book feels like an extended episode of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d and certainly has that show\u2019s taste for dark humor and high-concept philosophizing around our tech addiction, though what raises it above another clever-clever slab of science fiction is that its characters are complex and contradictory and real. For better or worse, you care about them. The mirror may be dark in places, but it shines with a more human light. It\u2019s an entertaining read that draws more inventiveness from character development than it does from the fictional technology.Rhett, in particular, is enthrallingly human. Although he is distant and remote, these qualities make us care about him more, and we share a little of his mother\u2019s investment in his recovery, and feel for the growing bond between them. When a character describes to Rhett the frequency of the phone calls he gets from his mum as being \u201cas much as you can stand, as little as she can\u201d many parents (and their offspring) will surely flinch with painful recognition.What could have been simply a cutting satire \u2014 or thought experiment \u2014 about our tech dependence and craving for quick-fix pop psychology becomes something far warmer and funnier.At the risk of broad generalization, science fiction \u2014 even literary science fiction \u2014 often sacrifices the science for the emotion, or the emotion for the science, yet Williams weaves the two together, and her novel shows how philosophical and sharply relevant fiction, this kind of fiction, can be in this fast-changing century. As we integrate ourselves ever deeper with technology, it makes sense that these themes will and should emerge in novels, and Williams offers a master class in not losing sight of the human element. The irony for a book that could be seen to mock self-help culture is that it is, in itself, the kind of story that \u2014 in the subtlest of ways \u2014 can instruct us, and nourish us, and make us want to live and love a little better.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Fighting Injustice to Facing Death Row: The Bizarre Case of Pastor Glasgow", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe local media in Dothan, a small, unprepossessing city in Alabama\u2019s Wiregrass region, have long followed his story of reinvention from felon to do-gooder who hand-delivered meals, organized unity marches and \u2014 in a place where few were willing to speak out \u2014 crusaded against brutality and racism.Nowadays, though, one thing tops the search results: a mug shot, his eyes hooded, his white goatee jutting out at a defiant angle.In March, Mr. Glasgow was charged with capital murder.And then there is the fact that he did not actually kill anyone.The police say that a passenger in a car that Mr. Glasgow was driving got out and fatally shot another motorist. Under Alabama\u2019s complicity law, also known as the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d statute, an accomplice to a crime is just as guilty as the main actor. To make their case against Mr. Glasgow, prosecutors must prove that he knew, or reasonably should have known, that violence was going to occur. He says he had no idea.\u201cI don\u2019t do violence,\u201d he said when I went down to Dothan to hear the story firsthand. \u201cTo know that I\u2019m the cause, or involved in, a black woman\u2019s death? It\u2019s like the death of me, really.\u201dMr. Stokes and Mr. Glasgow have a history that is Dothanesque. They have been adversaries \u2014 Mr. Glasgow, who is black, once protested when Mr. Stokes, who is white, chained two African-American bail-bond clients to the courthouse doors. Mr. Stokes was convicted of misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment, and complained that Mr. Glasgow had unduly made a racial issue out of it.But it all turned out to be nothing personal: Mr. Glasgow has now requested Mr. Stokes\u2019s investigative services on his very bizarre case.Here\u2019s what happened: On Sunday, March 25, Mr. Glasgow was in the Bottom, the poor neighborhood where he does much of his work, with a friend known as Little John. A young man, Jamie Townes, who Mr. Glasgow says was an acquaintance, approached and reported that his car was missing. Mr. Glasgow believed he had seen the car, a Monte Carlo, a few blocks away.Mr. Townes, a woman named Choyce Bush, Little John and Mr. Glasgow got into the car Mr. Glasgow was driving that day, a borrowed brand-new Toyota Camry, to go look for it.The Monte Carlo had gone on a wild ride, careening through church grounds, fields and ditches, knocking over a street sign and ramming into a tree in someone\u2019s front yard. Finally, with its hood popped open, blocking the driver\u2019s view, it plowed into the front of the Camry on the driver\u2019s side.\u201cWe didn\u2019t find the car,\u201d Mr. Glasgow said. \u201cThe car found us.\u201dAfter the collision, Mr. Townes got out of the back seat of the Camry and, the police say, began firing at the driver of the Monte Carlo, who everyone assumed was a man.It turned out to be Breunia Jennings, a young woman with a long history of mental illness, who in the preceding hours had cut her hair short, fled from a motel barefoot and barely dressed, donned men\u2019s clothing and, apparently, found Mr. Townes\u2019s car with the motor running. The police now believe that she was driving so erratically because she was being chased.There\u2019s more to the story. Mr. Glasgow says that not only did the Monte Carlo hit the Camry from the front, but another vehicle hit the Camry from behind. (Ms. Bush also told the police about a rear-end collision, and Mr. Townes said he was \u201cpunch drunk\u201d from \u201cmultiple collisions,\u201d according to police testimony.) The Camry did suffer some rear damage, but no third vehicle was ever found.Thinking there was some sort of ambush in progress, Mr. Glasgow says, he ducked, and did not see the shooting. Nor, he says, was he aware that Mr. Townes had gotten out of the car.Dothan is a city where judgment is swift and punishment can be harsh. It is the seat of Houston County, which ranks among the top 10 in the nation for death row convictions. It has a relatively new district attorney; the previous one was known for striking African-Americans from juries.But at Mr. Glasgow\u2019s preliminary hearing, where he appeared in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, Judge Benjamin Lewis seemed dubious that criminal charges were warranted.Judge Lewis took the rare step in a capital murder case of allowing Mr. Glasgow to post bond. A grand jury will decide whether to indict him.While he waits, the police, some local news coverage and the Dothan rumor mill have portrayed him as callous and indifferent. Much has been made of the fact that he did not call the police to report the Monte Carlo missing, nor did he call 911 after the accident.To the first point, Mr. Glasgow says, he and his passengers believed the car had been taken by a friend. To the second, the police arrived at the scene moments after the shooting, so he says there was no need to call them.There has been surprisingly little controversy over what may be the most unflattering part of the episode: Mr. Glasgow spent the minutes after the accident trying to commit insurance fraud. The Camry\u2019s owner was concerned that her insurance would not cover the accident, so she hurried to the scene in order to stand in as the driver.At the time, Mr. Glasgow says, he did not know that anyone had died.When Mr. Glasgow learned, hours later at the police station, that the situation was far more serious than just a car wreck, he says he promptly confessed to having been the driver.Mr. Glasgow, 53, says he did not know that Mr. Townes, 27, had a gun. Even so, prosecutors may try to argue that it was reasonable to expect that Mr. Townes, who the police say is a drug dealer, would commit violence. Mr. Townes had previous state charges for theft and drug possession, but not for violent offenses.Mr. Townes\u2019s lawyer, James Parkman III, says his client fired in self-defense, pointing to a Facebook post in which Ms. Jennings said she was going to \u201cstab and shoot\u201d and \u201ccatch a murder case.\u201dIn the eyes of the police, Mr. Glasgow\u2019s association with Mr. Townes is suspicious. But helping people with unsavory pasts is Mr. Glasgow\u2019s calling. It was some two decades ago, during Mr. Glasgow\u2019s most recent of several stints in prison, that he and a friend conceived of a ministry focused on addiction, poverty and life after incarceration. They called it The Ordinary People Society.\u201cThe real story of what happens in America happens in these small towns, and in these small towns there are people whose rights have been completely upended,\u201d said Asha Bandele, until recently a senior director at the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped finance Mr. Glasgow\u2019s work for years.Dothan\u2019s population is about one-third African-American, but the city has an entrenched white power structure: It has never had a black mayor, police chief, circuit judge, county sheriff or school superintendent. It is the type of place where, if you call the police chief or the district attorney with a complaint, he may offer to pray with you right there on the line. In part through the common ground of Christianity, Mr. Glasgow has been able to forge some relationships with white businessmen who help pay for his work.But where some see an advocate, many others \u2014 particularly white people in town \u2014 see a charlatan. The murder charge complicated matters. Though his hearing was packed with supporters, some African-American residents have turned against Mr. Glasgow as well.The city was teeming with unfounded rumors: That Mr. Townes was actually Mr. Glasgow\u2019s son. That they were in cahoots as drug kingpins. That Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Townes had terrorized and raped Ms. Jennings, then hunted her down. I heard that one from Ms. Jennings\u2019 mother, Lakesia Reeves, who said she heard it from an anonymous caller.In that environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Glasgow, too, would believe he is being deliberately targeted. For his opponents, he says, restoring voting rights to felons was bad enough, he says, but the victory of Mr. Jones, a Democrat, in the Senate race was the final straw. \u201cThey want me dead,\u201d he insisted.Accustomed to being an activist for others, Mr. Glasgow now finds himself without a champion of his own. But as he awaits the grand jury\u2019s decision, he has found a new crusade: changing the accomplice law.\u201cI did my time for what I did,\u201d he said, speaking of previous armed robbery and drug convictions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memo From the Boss: You\u2019re a Vegetarian Now", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeWork is no longer a safe space for carnivores.In a memo to employees announcing the new policy, Miguel McKelvey, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief culture officer, said the decision was driven largely by concerns for the environment, and, to a lesser extent, animal welfare.\u201cNew research indicates that avoiding meat is one of the biggest things an individual can do to reduce their personal environmental impact \u2014 even more than switching to a hybrid car,\u201d he wrote. Additionally, WeWork could save \u201cover 15 million animals by 2023 by eliminating meat at our events.\u201dMr. McKelvey, in his first interview since the decision was announced, said the policy was also aimed at raising consciousness among the company\u2019s nearly 6,000 employees.\u201cIt\u2019s multidimensional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming at it from an awareness and a mindfulness perspective. The headline has been \u2018meat-free,\u2019 but this is a much larger effort to develop personal accountability in our team.\u201dWeWork\u2019s enforced vegetarianism could easily be dismissed as just another whimsical human resources directive from a high-flying technology start-up with an inflated sense of self-importance.But the move also represents a more substantial development that is reshaping workplaces around the country: In ways large and small, companies are imposing corporate values on the personal lives of their employees.In some of these cases, the values of a few executives are imposed on workers who must adhere to their employers\u2019 worldview, often relating to issues with scant connection to the business. But WeWork appears to be the first big company to tell its employees what they can and can\u2019t eat.\u201cHuman beings really don\u2019t like when you take choice away from them,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, the former senior vice president of people operations at Google and the author of \u201cWork Rules!\u201d\u201cWhat people are much more amenable to is nudges,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you change the environment that doesn\u2019t remove choice, but sends a signal for people to make a good decision?\u201dMr. Bock has personal experience with vegetarianism. While he was at Google, two of the many cafes at company headquarters tried out \u201cmeatless Mondays,\u201d going vegetarian for just one day a week. Employees rebelled, throwing away silverware and staging a protest barbecue.Meatless Mondays didn\u2019t last at Google. But in time, the company made changes to the cafeterias \u2014 like offering smaller plates and making salad bars more prominent \u2014 that improved employees\u2019 eating habits.\u201cWhen you exercise this level of control over employees, even with good intentions, it often backfires,\u201d said Heather Bussing, an employment lawyer in Northern California. \u201cJust because you really believe this is the right thing to do, not everyone will agree with you.\u201dAt WeWork, a company led by idealistic co-founders who got their start with an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn, the move to vegetarianism is a reflection of their unconventional personalities.\u201cI don\u2019t eat meat, but I don\u2019t consider myself a vegetarian,\u201d Mr. McKelvey said. \u201cI consider myself to be a \u2018reducetarian.\u2019 I try to consume less and be aware of the decisions I\u2019m making. Not just food, but single-use plastics, and fossil fuels and energy.\u201dAs Mr. McKelvey sees it, imposing his values on his employees is a natural part of being a corporate leader today. \u201cCompanies have greater responsibility to their team members and to the world these days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones with the power. Large employers are the ones that can move the needle on issues.\u201dThere is little question that WeWork has the legal right to withhold meat from its employees. Companies have no obligation to feed their workers, much less offer steak and lamb on the menu. (And, of course, none of this applies to companies or individuals who rent space from WeWork.)\u201cCompanies are free to make rules about the things they reimburse or don\u2019t reimburse for,\u201d Ms. Bussing said. \u201cBut usually they have to do with adult movies at hotels and alcohol, rather than what you\u2019re ordering at dinner.\u201dAnd even if WeWork does succeed in using vegetarianism to reduce its carbon impact, it isn\u2019t a given that the decision will make its employees healthier.\u201cAnimals have a place in the human diet,\u201d said Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that eating less meat is good for one\u2019s health and the planet. But to abolish it completely sounds ideological.\u201dEchoing Mr. Bock, Ms. Nestle said a more effective way to promote healthy eating was to offer employees a variety of options. \u201cMost companies that are trying to promote healthy diets among employees are doing it in ways that are less coercive,\u201d Ms. Nestle said. \u201cHere you don\u2019t have any choice.\u201dThere will be some wiggle room at WeWork. Seafood will still be permitted on company menus and expense accounts. And employees who \u201crequire a medical or religious accommodation\u201d can request an exemption from the enforced vegetarianism. (Mr. Bock was not convinced this would work. \u201cEven then, you have to self-identify and let somebody know about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be the person eating carne asada while everyone else is eating the lettuce bowl.\u201d)\u201cWe could have introduced a series of nudges, but then we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation,\u201d Mr. McKelvey said. \u201cAnd awkward conversations are how we learn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d she\u2019d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can\u2019t miss. She wasn\u2019t just curious. She was planning this the whole time.The first iteration of the company was only these lists \u2014 where to go and what to buy once you get there \u2014 via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey rag\u00f9 and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter\u2019s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, \u201cI love what you\u2019re doing with Goop.\u201d G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn\u2019t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a \u201cgodmother\u201d to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and \u201cgave permission\u201d to start thinking about how to monetize it.By the time she stood in that Harvard classroom, Goop was a clothing manufacturer, a beauty company, an advertising hub, a publishing house, a podcast producer and a portal of health-and-healing information, and soon it would become a TV-show producer. It was a clearinghouse of alternative health claims, sex-and-intimacy advice and probes into the mind, body and soul. There was no part of the self that Goop didn\u2019t aim to serve.\u201cI want to help you solve problems,\u201d G.P. said. \u201cI want to be an additive to your life.\u201d Goop is now worth $250 million, according to a source close to the company.For all the students\u2019 questions about those newsletters and their use of all kinds of three-letter acronyms, it felt to me as if everyone was missing the point. G.P.\u2019s business began in 2008 and was incorporated in 2013, but it really started when she was being hunted by the paparazzi and living in such a lonely, high-altitude world that she could basically be friends with only Madonna. Or even before that when, as a 19-year-old, she would run lines with her mother, the actress Blythe Danner, and Danner noticed that it was all too easy for her, that there was something preternatural about her talent (an assessment one of her former co-stars also said to me almost verbatim). Or maybe even before that, when some combination of her parents\u2019 DNA formed a genetic supernova that would allow for her name to appear in the same paragraph as the word \u201cluminous\u201d 227 times when searching in a LexisNexis database.They nodded, mesmerized, stars and dollar signs in their eyes. They took notes, but why? When G.P. said \u201caspirational,\u201d she wasn\u2019t kidding. Her business depended on no one ever being able to be her. Though I guess it also depended on their ability to think they might.Before we knew it, the wellness point of view had invaded everything in our lives: Summer-solstice sales are wellness.

Who says that only certain kinds of people are allowed to give us the answers?These phenomena gave an easy rise to Gwyneth Paltrow, who was at first curating teas and lingerie and sweaters she thought you\u2019d like. But people were looking for leaders, and she was already committing public displays of ostentatious wellness: She showed up at a movie premiere with cupping marks on her back; she let bees sting her because I don\u2019t know why. Suddenly Gwyneth Paltrow, the movie star, was a major player in an industry that was big business.Other celebrities followed. Jessica Alba\u2019s Honest Company was worth more than $1 billion at its peak, but it really offers mostly cleaning and beauty products. Miranda Kerr has a line of organic beauty products. Amanda Chantal Bacon\u2019s Moon Juice, a line of supplements, is a ship launched directly from Port Goop. None of them aim to treat every single aspect of the human as wholly as Goop does. Nothing is as elemental an extension of its source as Goop is.We ate salmon hand rolls. She was trying to be low-carb today, but it wasn\u2019t happening. There was too much going on. The wellness summit, a daylong immersion in Goop-endorsed products, panels, doctors and other \u201chealers,\u201d was a \u201cheavy lift for the team.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s intense, man,\u201d she said. She reached behind her to her bookshelf, which held about a dozen blue bottles of something called Real Water, which is not stripped of \u201cvaluable electrons,\u201d which supposedly creates free radicals something something from the body\u2019s cells. \u201cIt\u2019s insane, and then I have to do a lot on the day, and I really don\u2019t like speaking in public, and I have to keep getting up in front of a crowd.\u201dThe summit is great, don\u2019t get her wrong. All three so far have sold out, with tickets ranging from $500 to $4,500, the highest of which included two dinners with G.P. plus two nights at Casa del Mar. But lately she has been wondering if the summit does everything it needs to. She worries that she\u2019s just serving the same customers over and over. She met a woman who took a very long bus ride from she thinks rural Pennsylvania to the Goop summit in New York in January. \u201cSeventy-nine percent of our American customers aren\u2019t in New York or Los Angeles,\u201d where these summits are held, she said; they\u2019re in secondary markets.So how do you bring them in? There have been pop-up Goop stores everywhere from Dallas to Miami. There would be a digital pass to the summit. But you can\u2019t taste a plate of ancient grains and avocado in citrus dressing on a computer. You can\u2019t feel someone push warm oil with a jade roller over your skin through an iPad. You can\u2019t eat a piece of chocolate that will supposedly not just regulate your hormones but restore your sex life \u2014 chocolate! \u2014 on your phone. You can only watch some panels and one-on-one conversations. So she\u2019s thinking they might take the thing on the road. Can you believe this? She was incredulous. She still remembers sitting in her kitchen in London, celebrating a day when $45 had come in because of an advertising partnership.The newsletter was at first kind of mainstream New Age-forward. It had some kooky stuff in it, but nothing totally outrageous. It was concerned with basic wellness causes, like detoxes and cleanses and meditation. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that it began to resemble the thing it is now, a wellspring of both totally legitimate wellness tips and completely bonkers magical thinking: advice from psychotherapists and advice from doctors about how much Vitamin D to take (answer: a lot! Too much!) and vitamins for sale and body brushing and dieting and the afterlife and crystals and I swear to God something called Psychic Vampire Repellent, which is a \u201csprayable elixir\u201d that uses \u201cgem healing\u201d to something something \u201cbad vibes.\u201dThat was the year after G.P. met Elise Loehnen, 38, a former magazine editor who had been ghostwriting for G.P.\u2019s friend, the extremely extreme personal trainer Tracy Anderson, in whose business G.P. is a minority stakeholder. Loehnen wasn\u2019t just interested in wellness; she was obsessed with it. Wellness, she argued, isn\u2019t just about a spa you\u2019re going to or a cleanse you\u2019ve started or a diet you\u2019re on. It\u2019s how local your food is. It\u2019s how the chickens you eat all went to the right schools. It\u2019s the water you drink. It\u2019s the cures you never thought possible. It\u2019s the level of well-being you didn\u2019t even know to ask for.With Loehnen as editorial director, Goop began publishing extended Q. and A.s with doctors and healers like Alejandro Junger, a cardiologist who created an anti-inflammatory regimen and recently talked on Goop\u2019s podcast about frog venom as a psychedelic for healing, which, O.K.! Steven Gundry, a cardiac surgeon, believes that lectins, a protein in some foods, are dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases. (There are a great many people who do not believe this.) Anyone from an acupuncturist to a psychic to an endocrinologist to a psychologist addressed questions that the modern woman couldn\u2019t seem to find answers to: Why am I so unhappy? Why am I so tired? Why am I so fat? Why don\u2019t I want to have sex anymore?There were stories that talked about bee-sting therapy (don\u2019t try it; someone died from it this year) and ashwagandha and adaptogens and autoimmune diseases \u2014 an autoimmune disease at every corner, be it thyroid disease, arthritis or celiac disease; trust them, you have one. Last year, G.P. gave a platform to her friend Shiva Rose, a healer who talked about inserting a jade egg into the vagina, which she says concubines did and which she claimed could help prevent uterine prolapse. This did not go unnoticed! They sold a brush that would help your lymph flow, a salt shampoo that would detoxify your scalp, a water bottle with rose quartz in it that would infuse your water with positive energy.Goop knew what readers were clicking on, and it was nimble enough to meet those needs by actually manufacturing the things its readers wanted. When a story about beauty products that didn\u2019t have endocrine disrupters and formaldehyde got a lot of traffic in 2015, the company started Goop by Juice Beauty, a collection of \u201cclean\u201d face creams and oils and cleansers that it promised lacked those things. When a story about \u201cpostnatal depletion,\u201d a syndrome coined by one of the Goop doctors, did even-better-than-average business in 2017, it introduced Goop Wellness, a series of four vitamin \u201cprotocols\u201d for women with different concerns \u2014 weight, energy, focus, etc. Goop says it sold $100,000 of them on their first day.With assaults coming from all sides, Goop began to dig its heels into the dirt, not only because dirt is a natural exfoliant and also contains selenium, which is a mineral many of us are lacking and helps with thyroid function. Now Goop was growing only more successful. Now Goop was a cause, and G.P. was its martyr.A woman who has worked for G.P. for a long time stood beside her, cooking an entirely separate dinner for G.P.\u2019s children. The meal we would eat \u2014 the clams and the bread \u2014 took only a half-hour to make, but G.P. said it could have taken only 15 minutes if we weren\u2019t talking so much. It is a recipe out of her fourth cookbook, \u201cIt\u2019s All Easy,\u201d which she wrote in the wake of her divorce from Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay. Suddenly, as a single mother, she wanted to create recipes that followed her particular set of food values but that she could execute quickly.G.P. asked what I would like to drink. I asked for a glass of red wine. G.P. gave the nod to someone over my left shoulder. I turned to see Jeffrey, the same man in a shawl-collar sweater who opened the door for me earlier. He nodded back.Chris Martin walked in and sat down at the kitchen island and introduced himself. He saw my tape recorder and immediately told me that though I seemed nice and trustworthy, he had no interest in being part of my article, so please keep anything he says out of it.A very good-looking young boy appeared. \u201cHi, lover,\u201d G.P. said. The boy, whom I recognized as her youngest child, Moses, immediately came to my side, made socially appropriate eye contact and shook my hand. \u201cHello, nice to meet you,\u201d he said. Moses is 12, about the same age as my older son.My phone rang. It was the mother of my son\u2019s friend, back home in stupid New Jersey, and I realized she wouldn\u2019t be calling if not for something gone awry. I apologized to G.P. and picked up the phone. The mom told me that my son was insisting that I was supposed to be picking him up. \u201cI\u2019m in California!\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m with Gwyneth Paltrow!\u201d She said she\u2019d pass the message along and proceed as usual. G.P. said something, but I couldn\u2019t concentrate because I was trying to understand how my 7-year-old didn\u2019t know that I was out of town. Had I not said goodbye?A teenage girl orbited herself into the kitchen. She stuck her hand out to me. \u201cI\u2019m Apple. Nice to meet you.\u201d She had a fine, assured grip and a blunt bob and eyeliner and looked like a child version of the Wes Anderson character Margot Tenenbaum, which, of course, she was.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d G.P. asked.\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d Apple said, frustrated, rubbing her eyes with her fists. She sounded exactly like her mother, down to the slight, soft nasal on the vowels: hiiii, Aaapple, guuuys, wooow, tiiiiired.G.P. stuck out her lips and clucked sympathy.\u201cI started watching \u2018The Office,\u2019 and I find it so funny,\u201d Apple said.\u201cThe English one?\u201d G.P. asked.\u201cNo, the U.S. one.\u201dThe children followed Martin into another room so that they could practice their musical instruments with him. As Moses left, he asked G.P. if he should leave both doors open so she could hear him play. She said, \u201cYes. I want to hear you.\u201d Then, to me: \u201cHe\u2019s going to play AC/DC. He keeps such good time.\u201d They were going to become musicians, she just knew it.She wasn\u2019t going to have more kids. That she also knew. Her business, her age, which is 45 \u2014 not impossible, but still. She\u2019d wanted a third. She told me that after she asked how many I had, and I told her I had two children as well, and it was wonderful, but I was sad I didn\u2019t have a third.She told me I should rethink it while I\u2019m still young enough. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s not nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI really wanted another one.\u201d I nodded solemnly. (Later, I cried.)Brad Falchuk, a writer and director, who is also Ryan Murphy\u2019s producing partner, entered the kitchen. He and G.P. had just announced their engagement on the cover of the second issue of Goop magazine, whose theme was, conveniently, sex and love. I congratulated them.\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, standing behind her, his arms around her waist and his face buried in her neck. She registered his snuggle and returned it with a return-snuggle body spasm without stopping her cooking actions.I heard the first few notes of \u201cBlackbird\u201d and looked up and around for the speakers. I\u2019d never heard such a beautiful version. \u201cWhere is it coming from?\u201d I asked. Again G.P. nodded her chin over my shoulder, my right one this time, and I turned around to see Apple on a couch behind me, strumming her guitar. Apple told me she doesn\u2019t like to use a pick. She likes the calluses.\u201cApple, that\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d G.P. said. I turned back to G.P. in astonishment. She smiled. In front of me, our glasses had been filled again.G.P. and Falchuk and I ate the clams with the grilled bread in a candlelit dining room with a fireplace off pewter dishes from Match, which I admired. \u201cThey\u2019re getting kind of old,\u201d she said. Her dress remained white. Mine had clam juice down the front.After dinner, G.P. and I sat in her living room on the floor. I had read that she smokes one cigarette a week. I had brought a pack of cigarettes to test this out. I used to smoke but stopped more than 10 years ago. She had her own pack of Nat Shermans hidden away somewhere and told me that these days it was more like a few times a year. Falchuk sat with us, tan and smiley, but wouldn\u2019t smoke. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a cigarette in my life.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a doctor\u2019s son,\u201d she said. Then, to him: \u201cWill you be mad?\u201dHe smiled at her and shook his head. Her feet were bare now, and they had a perfect, substantial arch, just as the Romans intended, engineered to support her statue body. I bet they were a Size 8. People make shoes so that feet like those can wear them. We blew smoke up the chimney.I drove back to my hotel to find that a family that owned a Mercedes dealership would be hosting an impromptu all-night party around the pool and that I would never get any sleep. I thought about my children, one of whom plays the flute, but unwillingly, and therefore won\u2019t practice. Yes, I thought about my children, only one of whom might shake your hand while the other would sooner spit on it, though they will both reliably do an elaborate orchestration of armpit farting while I\u2019m trying to hear myself think. I thought of my mother and father, and an earlier conversation I had with my sisters that day about where to arrange our parents in a room for one of our kids\u2019 bar mitzvahs so that they wouldn\u2019t interact, so raw still are the wounds 35 years after their divorce. I thought of my big, disgusting Size 11 feet, which are wide and flat and have the look of scuba flippers and which designers have shod only begrudgingly. I thought of the third child I don\u2019t have, the one I ache for. The car salespeople danced below.I thought about the word \u201caspiration,\u201d how to aspire seems so noble, but how aspiration is always infused with a kind of suffering, and I smoked another cigarette.That issue, like the second issue (the one with a cover photo of her and Falchuk and the words \u201cIn Deep\u201d), was $15 on newsstands and a product of a partnership with Cond\u00e9 Nast. At first, it seemed like a perfect fit. \u201cGoop and Cond\u00e9 Nast are natural partners, and I\u2019m excited she\u2019s bringing her point of view to the company,\u201d said Anna Wintour, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s artistic director and editor in chief of Vogue, when the deal was announced in April 2017. The print product would be a collaboration \u2014 Goop content overseen by a Vogue editor.It didn\u2019t work out. \u201cThey\u2019re a company that\u2019s really in transition and do things in a very old-school way,\u201d G.P. said. The parting was amicable. \u201cBut it was amazing to work with Anna. I love her. She\u2019s a total idol of mine. We realized we could just do a better job of it ourselves in-house. I think for us it was really like we like to work where we are in an expansive space. Somewhere like Cond\u00e9, understandably, there are a lot of rules.\u201dThe rules she\u2019s referring to are the rules of traditional magazine making \u2014 all upheld strictly at an institution like Cond\u00e9 Nast. One of them is that they weren\u2019t allowed to use the magazine as part of their \u201ccontextual commerce\u201d strategy. They wanted to be able to sell Goop products (in addition to other products, just as they do on their site). But Cond\u00e9 Nast insisted that they have a more \u201cagnostic\u201d editorial approach. The company publishes magazines, not catalogs. But why? G.P. wanted to know. She wanted the Goop magazine to be a natural extension of the Goop website. She wanted the reader to be able to do things like text a code to purchase a product without even having to leave her inert reading position and wander over to her computer. A magazine customer is also a regular customer.But the other rule is \u2014 well, the thing couldn\u2019t be fact-checked. Goop wanted Goop magazine to be like the Goop website in another way: to allow the Goop family of doctors and healers to go unchallenged in their recommendations via the kinds of Q. and A.s published, and that just didn\u2019t pass Cond\u00e9 Nast standards. Those standards require traditional backup for scientific claims, like double-blind, peer-reviewed studies. The stories Loehnen, now Goop\u2019s chief content officer, wanted to publish had to be quickly replaced at the last minute by packages like the one on \u201cclean\u201d getaways.These questions had been plaguing Goop for a while \u2014 not just what is a fact, or how important is a fact, but also what exactly is Goop allowed to be suggesting? In 2016, a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus began an inquiry into Goop for deceptive marketing claims about the life-optimizing powers of Moon Juice products, which appeared on the Goop site as a key ingredient in a smoothie that G.P. drank every morning. (Goop voluntarily stopped making these claims.) And last summer, the watchdog organization TruthInAdvertising.org (TINA) sent G.P. a letter that referred to numerous instances of deceptive marketing claims \u2014 that the site\u2019s products cured, treated or prevented inflammation, autoimmune diseases and more. Goop replied and adjusted some of its claims in the short period the letter allotted, but TINA found its response inadequate and reported Goop to the district attorney\u2019s offices in both Santa Cruz and Santa Clara. (The district attorney\u2019s offices would not comment on the matter.)But something strange happened. Each of these pronouncements set off a series of blog posts and articles and tweets that linked directly to the site, driving up traffic. At Harvard, G.P. called these moments \u201ccultural firestorms.\u201d \u201cI can monetize those eyeballs,\u201d she told the students. Goop had learned to do a special kind of dark art: to corral the vitriol of the internet and the ever-present shall we call it cultural ambivalence about G.P. herself and turn them into cash. It\u2019s never clickbait, she told the class. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural firestorm when it\u2019s about a woman\u2019s vagina.\u201d The room was silent. She then cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled, \u201cVAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!\u201d as if she were yodeling.As of June, there were 2.4 million unique visitors to the site per month, according to the numbers Goop provided me. The podcast, which is mostly hosted by Loehnen and features interviews with wellness practitioners, receives 100,000 to 650,000 listens per week. Goop wanted to publish articles about autoimmune diseases and infrared saunas and thyroids, and now it can, on its own terms \u2014 sort of.After a few too many cultural firestorms, and with investors to think about, G.P. made some changes. Goop has hired a lawyer to vet all claims on the site. It hired an editor away from Cond\u00e9 Nast to run the magazine. It hired a man with a Ph.D. in nutritional science, and a director of science and research who is a former Stanford professor. And in September, Goop, sigh, is hiring a full-time fact-checker. G.P. chose to see it as \u201cnecessary growing pain.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t as if the appetite for Goop\u2019s content was going away. I\u2019ve spoken to dozens of people who feel better after a detox cleanse, and science can\u2019t really tell them why.I once went to an internist twice, complaining of preternatural exhaustion, only to be told that I was depressed and sent home. On the third visit, she begrudgingly took my blood and called me later to even more begrudgingly apologize and tell me I had a surprising case of mononucleosis. I know women who\u2019ve been dismissed by their doctors for being lazy and careless and depressed and downright crazy. Was it any wonder that they would start to seek help from sources that assumed that their symptoms weren\u2019t all in their head?In her office, G.P. opened her MacBook. There was a guy this whole situation reminded her of, and she had forgotten his name, but a quick Wikipedia search and, ah, there it was: \u201cIgnaz Philipp Semmelweis, German,\u201d she read to me. Semmelweis, once described as a \u201csavior of mothers,\u201d discovered that cases of puerperal fever could be significantly cut by washing hands before surgery.Here she shook her head. \u201cThis is so sad. This gives me chills.\u201d She continued reading, \u201cIn 1865, Semmelweis was committed to an asylum where he died at 47 of pyaemia after being beaten by the guards only 14 days after he was committed.\u201d (There is debate about how Semmelweis died.)She stood up. Her posture was a marvel. \u201cYou ask what is happening when someone says, \u2018Have we just thought about this?\u2019 That\u201d \u2014 being beaten to death in an asylum \u2014 \u201cis what happened to this guy.\u201d\u201cWhere do you think it ends for you?\u201d I asked her, getting up from my chair.She laughed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m committed to an asylum.\u201dOr maybe it\u2019s just that G.P. disrupted the contract between the celebrity and the civilian who is observing her. In a typical women\u2019s magazine profile, the implicit pact is that the celebrity will not make the woman feel bad by implying that the woman could have what the celebrity has if only she would work: \u201cIt\u2019s all in my genes, what can I say!\u201d the celebrity proclaims. But G.P. was different. She would talk openly about the food habits and exercise obsessions that allowed her to look the way she did. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to sit home and not exercise and criticize other people,\u201d she told Elle magazine in 2011. \u201cMy life is good,\u201d she wrote on Goop\u2019s website, \u201cbecause I am not passive about it. I want to nourish what is real, and I want to do it without wasting time.\u201d People think they want celebrities to speak honestly, but we\u2019re not really that happy when they do.We talked about this one morning at a suite at the Carlyle, where she lay across a sofa like a poem. She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes. (I had taken to, when barefoot, extending the sesamoid part of my foot without pointing my toes, so that my feet looked like Barbie feet, which created an arch where I had none. \u201cSee?\u201d I\u2019d say to my husband in bed. \u201cThis is what her feet look like just regular.\u201d)She didn\u2019t know why people felt the way they did. She said the decision to stop acting and pursue Goop was not difficult, but it had nothing to do with her reputation. \u201cI really liked acting,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut at a certain point, it started to feel frustrating in a way not to have true agency, like to be beholden to other people to give you a job, or to create something, to put something into the world.\u201d She was doing three or four or five movies a year, and the primary relationship in those films was with Harvey Weinstein. \u201cThe one time that Harvey propositioned me was really almost the least of it in terms of how onerous that relationship was, and it was very quid pro quo and punitive, and I always felt like I was on thin ice, and he could be truly horrible and mean and then be incredibly generous. It was kind of like a classic abusive relationship.\u201dWhat can she say? It\u2019s hard to talk about herself like this. How can she really understand who she is in the culture anyway? She\u2019s the only one who can\u2019t see herself clearly. All she knows is what she hears, and she once heard that she eats in front of the mirror naked.The hatred used to feel personal to her, but it doesn\u2019t anymore. Now it feels as if she\u2019s watching a soap opera. She remembers the week that Star Magazine called her the most hated celebrity in the world. \u201cI remember being like: Really? More than, like, Chris Brown? Me? Really? Wow. It was also the same week that I was People\u2019s Most Beautiful Woman. For a minute I was like: Wait, I don\u2019t understand. Am I hated to the bone or am I the world\u2019s most beautiful?\u201dAnyway, this was an old conversation, she insisted. \u201cI really notice as the business grows, there\u2019s a lot less of that, and I think people are like: Oh, this is real, and I feel like that\u2019s sort of, you know, a nine-months-ago story. You know what I mean?\u201dI didn\u2019t. I was introduced to G.P. through Bill Burton, a communications strategist known for his work for Barack Obama. That\u2019s not really how stories about start-ups or celebrities typically get done. I have a Google alert for her (as I do for everyone I\u2019m writing about), and each day, that alert goes off and is somewhat filled with pictures of her in a bikini on a yacht but is mostly filled with pus and bile \u2014 for her supposed smugness, her jade eggs, her ability to smoke a cigarette without becoming an addict. Bloggers at New York magazine\u2019s The Cut regularly mock Goop\u2019s gift guides (to which G.P. said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what The Cut is\u201d).So this is why people hate her? \u201cBecause I have discipline?\u201d she said. She remembers reading that Michio Kushi, the father of macrobiotics, smoked cigarettes sometimes. She wanted to be like that. It\u2019s something she cultivated.I said, don\u2019t you see? The last cigarette she had was in February, sitting on the floor next to her chimney with me. It was June. I smoked now. I walked down the street sucking on cigarettes the way I did in my youth. I recently got into bed with my poor son, and he told me that I \u201csmell like the city.\u201dShe doesn\u2019t understand it. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s perfect. She is the way she is because of hard work. How could people hate her for that? It\u2019s just hard work. It\u2019s just intention. The content is free, and it\u2019s all right there. Go to her website. Do some meditation. Just eat more produce. Take some time for yourself. Hydrate.We\u2019re so hard on one another, G.P. said. We\u2019re so hard on ourselves, too. \u201cThat\u2019s all we do as women,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just kick the [expletive] out of ourselves. It\u2019s like that inner critic is so vicious, and it\u2019s like: Why do we do that? It\u2019s so nuts.\u201d She continued: \u201cPeople say that there\u2019s no link between emotions and consciousness and physical illness. And yet look at the plethora of autoimmune diseases around you. One man to 10 women have autoimmune. We literally have turned on ourselves.\u201dEveryone glowed. Everyone wore flowing dresses and wide-legged jumpsuits. There was a woman asleep on one of the couches. Also: a manifestation workshop; acroyoga, where we bobbed up and down on scarves hanging from the ceiling; a medium who told me my grandmother was standing next to me telling me I have thyroid disease; a man who stuck two ungloved fingers into my ears and said he \u201cfixed\u201d my jaw, which there was nothing wrong with. Trust him, he said, he\u2019s not a doctor. He\u2019s not even a physical therapist. He\u2019s a weight trainer, and he said he has a list of 2,000 people waiting to get fixed by him. All these people, wasting their money on traditional medicine, when he\u2019s willing to take you into his office and lay you on a table and make you good as new without the hassle of insurance.This always struck me as funny about the wellness world: how some people would brag about their mainstream credentials (\u201cTrust me,\u201d they\u2019d say, with a straightening of their tie. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor\u201d), while others felt that their legitimacy lay in the fact that they had no credentials. (\u201cTrust me,\u201d they\u2019d say, jamming their thumbs mockingly toward the doctors. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d)I pulled down my pants for a man in scrubs who was giving out B12 shots, never telling him my secret, that I\u2019d been taking the Goop vitamins and my urine was already a fluorescent yellow \u2014 no, gold \u2014 a superfood elixir.A woman called an akashic-records healer who reads your past, present and possible future lives sat me down and asked about my foot pain. I asked her how she knew I had foot pain. I wasn\u2019t limping. She said, \u201cYou have flat feet.\u201d I nodded, incredulous. \u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cI have flat feet.\u201d She told me that 13 lives ago, my feet were chopped off as punishment for a crime. As a result, since then, whenever I reincarnate (which is every 100 to 500 years because I like to rest between incarnations), my feet are flat because I like the surety of them entirely touching the ground.What I\u2019m saying is: There was nothing that couldn\u2019t be healed at the summit.The next morning, I had another article to write. But my hotel was on the beach, and the ocean was just a block away. I still had a bottle of Madame Dry Rose Water, which is \u201cbotanically infused, positively charged\u201d water that is filtered through rose-quartz crystals, and a bottle of Lifewtr, which is just water without vowels. I thought, for maybe the first time in my life, that work could wait. Self-care. Wellness. It started now. I had a long trip home ahead of me, and now I was someone who said \u201cself-care.\u201dI finished my waters and headed to the airport, where I dropped my rental car and boarded the Hertz bus. But something was wrong at the airport, or it was just Los Angeles being Los Angeles, and the bus didn\u2019t move. The normally 10-minute ride was now 20, and then 30, and then 40. I had to go to the bathroom so badly. My terminal was at the end and there was a stop at every single other terminal \u2014 even Air China. At 50 minutes, I realized I could no longer hold it and alerted the bus driver. Someone suggested I just get off at the next terminal and then pick the next bus up again. I screamed that I couldn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t have time! My kids and husband were waiting for me!Finally, I got off two terminals early. I ran through the check-in area, screaming: \u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom? Where\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d I peed my beautiful pee wondering what the point of it all had been. I ran through the next two terminals till I finally got to the United check-in area. I cut the line, screaming still, \u201cI was on a Hertz bus for an hour!\u201dI dropped off my suitcase just before the cutoff. I ran through the airport, my new smoker\u2019s cough slowing me down. I went through security but didn\u2019t have time to get something to eat at the fancy place, and so I got a premade fried chicken sandwich, which I would eat and feel every preservative and every sodium molecule course through my blood.As I was boarding, my sister called me.\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked.The image of the reiki workshop I\u2019d gone to at the summit returned to me. The practitioner had us lie on the floor and announced that we were all sharing one another\u2019s energy, and I didn\u2019t know how to feel about that, as if I hadn\u2019t consented to it. She said, \u201cThe future is your best teacher.\u201d She waved her hands over us like a sorceress. She gave us each a charged rose crystal that was shaped like a heart but flat and told us to put it in our bras. At the end, we lay, eyes closed, and put our hands on our hearts, and I opened my eyes before everyone else and saw all these women dressed in light colors, lined up like desperate, exquisite corpses, their hands over their hearts, totally inert.We are doomed to aspire for the rest of our lives. Aspiration is suffering. Wellness is suffering. As soon as you level up, you greet how infinite the possibilities are, and it all becomes too awful to live without.I told her, \u201cIt was ridiculous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vaginal \u2018Rejuvenation\u2019 Treatments May Be Unsafe, the F.D.A. Says", "Date": "2018-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced that it had warned several companies to stop marketing laser devices for procedures billed as \u201cvaginal rejuvenation,\u201d saying they were dangerous and deceptive treatments.The agency originally permitted the lasers and related energy-based devices onto the market for treatment of serious conditions, like cancer, genital warts, or surgery including hysterectomies.But in recent years, manufacturers have been heavily promoting the lasers for symptoms related to vaginal atrophy, menopause, urinary incontinence and sexual function. Cosmetic, spa treatments using laser and other products for vaginal health have also become popular among younger women.Some treatments use the devices to destroy or reshape vaginal tissue, which the manufacturers say can solve some problems related to dryness or other ailments. The F.D.A. disagrees. But even though the agency originally approved the devices for certain treatments, it is legal for doctors to use them for off-label conditions.\u201cThese products have serious risks and don\u2019t have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner. \u201cWe are deeply concerned women are being harmed.\u201dDr. Gottlieb also said he was concerned that deceptive marketing of these devices might prevent some patients from getting appropriate therapies for severe medical conditions.The F.D.A. said the full extent of the risks is unknown, but that the agency has found cases of vaginal burns, scarring, and lasting pain following the treatments. The agency has received 14 reports of adverse events related to the treatments, including burning sensations and significant pain.The companies targeted by the F.D.A. were Inmode; Sciton; Alma Lasers; Thermigen; BTL Aesthetics, BTL Industries; Venus Concept and Cynosure. Some companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Jane G. Mazur, a spokeswoman for Hologic, Inc. whose subsidiary sells the MonaLisa Touch, said they were reviewing the F.D.A. notice.\u201cWe are evaluating the letter in full and will collaborate with the agency to ensure all product communications adhere to regulatory requirements,\u201d Ms. Mazur said.Domenic DiSisto, general counsel for Venus Concept, said the Venus Fiore device is not currently marketed or sold in the United States, and that the company had modified its website.The F.D.A.\u2019s letters are considered a step short of a formal warning. The manufacturers are asked to provide details on the product and on what basis they are assuming approval.The agency has been under pressure to speed up approval of medical devices. Critics have said that the F.D.A. device approvals are already going too fast and happening with insufficient oversight. In the announcement Monday, Dr. Gottlieb said the agency would strengthen its studies of devices after they have been approved for sale.No federal agency or medical society has figures for the amount of these procedures done every year, but a casual search through gynecology practices shows they are becoming prevalent \u2014 despite opposition from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The medical society has issued several statements noting that the devices, including the MonaLisa Touch, do not have F.D.A. clearance or approval for treatment of menopausal symptoms, as advertised.\u201cObstetrician-gynecologists should be cognizant of the evidence regarding innovative practices\u201d and should be wary \u201cof adopting new or innovative approaches on the basis of promotions or marketing,\u201d the college said.Dr. Cheryl B. Iglesia, director of the section of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said the laser technology held promise, but that more study was needed to understand the safety as well as which patients the devices might help.\u201cI think the F.D.A. is trying to be conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not want the marketing to be ahead of the science on this.\u201dBut some doctors already say the devices work well for their off-label use. In a testimonial on its website, Alma Laser featured a video of Dr. Leslie Apgar, a Maryland gynecologist, who said she was pleased with the Femilift, as well as the company\u2019s assistance with marketing.\u201cWith Alma I was able to get the Femilift system that I wanted, along with the marketing solution that included a new website fully optimized for Google and all the other search engines,\u201d Dr. Apgar said in the video. \u201cIt has worked out extremely well for me, as I have gotten new patients weekly directed to my practice.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from the Food and Drug Administration, misidentified the manufacturer of a device marketed for vaginal rejuvenation. The manufacturer of the device is Venus Concept, not BTL Aesthetics, a subsidiary of BTL Industries. The article also misstated the name of the device; it is the Venus Fiore System, not the Venus Fiore RF Ablation System.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Stop Your Smart TV From Tracking What You Watch", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMillions of smart TVs in American homes are tracking everything you watch for the sake of advertisers. If that doesn\u2019t sit right with you, here\u2019s how to turn it off.Your smart TV is probably tracking everything that appears on the screen. While ad tracking is par for the course on the internet in 2018, smart TVs are particularly interesting. They don\u2019t just track the shows you stream on their built-in apps: they can recognize any show you\u2019re watching, any game you\u2019re playing, or any ad that appears on the screen \u2014 from any device connected to the TV.First, if you don\u2019t use the smart features on your TV, you can block this tracking by simply disconnecting your TV from the internet. Either unplug the Ethernet cable or disconnect it from your Wi-Fi network in the TV\u2019s settings. Without internet access, the TV can\u2019t send information to anyone, meaning your data stays at home. However, it also means your TV\u2019s built-in apps won\u2019t be able to stream any movies or shows, so this solution works only if you get your streaming from a set-top box like the Apple TV (or don\u2019t stream at all).If that isn\u2019t an option, you can keep streaming from your TV and turn automatic content recognition off. The instructions are a little different depending on what model TV you have, but here\u2019s where to look on the most popular brands.If you have a Samsung smart TV, open the home menu and head to Settings > Support > Terms & Policies. Turn off the \u201cViewing Information Services\u201d and \u201cInterest-Based Advertising\u201d options. (Some older models may call this feature \u201cSyncPlus and Marketing\u201d instead.)For LG sets, press the Settings button on your remote and head to All Settings > General > LivePlus and turn it off. You may also want to turn off personalized advertising from All Settings > General > About This TV > User Agreements from the General page. Vizio users will find this option by opening the menu and looking under System > Reset & Admin. Highlight the \u201cViewing Data\u201d option and press the right arrow to turn it off. Some older sets may call this \u201cSmart Interactivity\u201d instead. TVs from TCL, Philips, Sharp and some other brands use Roku as their built-in smart software. On these TVs, you can disable Automatic Content Recognition by opening the home screen heading to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience and disabling \u201cUse Information for TV Inputs\u201d. You may also want to head to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and turn on \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d.Your TV isn\u2019t the only thing tracking your usage. Independent set-top boxes like the Roku and Apple TV don\u2019t use Automatic Content Recognition \u2014 the feature that scans everything from your screen \u2014 but they do still have certain tracking features built-in, usually logging which apps you use and when. If you\u2019re interested in increasing your privacy, you may want to disable these features as well. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find them:There\u2019s no way to escape all tracking, of course, especially if you\u2019re streaming. These settings may limit some data collection, but even they won\u2019t stop the streaming services themselves: apps like Netflix will always track what you watch to provide recommendations, and there\u2019s no getting around that. So if you want true privacy, you\u2019ll need to divorce yourself from streaming services entirely. You\u2019ll just need to decide how much you really care.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bots of the Internet, Reveal Yourselves!", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bill in the California legislature would regulate bots by making them disclose their automated nature. But how?Robert M. Hertzberg\u2019s hatred of bots is personal.Mr. Hertzberg is a state Senator from California and last year, after he introduced a bail reform bill, he noticed that automated accounts on Twitter and Facebook were attacking him and his position. He is currently seeking re-election, and one of his opponents in the Democratic primary was a bail agent.For example, he said, one account rapidly responded to tweets about the bill in real time with the message: \u201cUnconstitutional bail reform doesn\u2019t work and is racist.\u201d So Mr. Hertzberg introduced another bill this year, the first of its kind in the United States, that would compel automated social media accounts to identify themselves as bots \u2014 in other words, to disclose their non-personhood. Because bots are only effective if they seem convincingly human. Right? Still, bots are easy to make and widely employed, and social media companies are under no legal obligation to get rid of them. A law that discourages their use could help, but experts aren\u2019t sure how the one Senator Hertzberg is trying to push through, in California, might work.For starters, would bots be forced to identify themselves in every Facebook post? In their Instagram bios? In their Twitter handles?Oren Etzioni, the chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, applauded the spirit of the law but was not as sold on its letter. \u201cThis is groundbreaking legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on a trajectory where reality, the very fabric of the information we see, can be altered in an unprecedented fashion. When that\u2019s done, as the law says, with an intent to mislead, that\u2019s a huge problem.\u201dBut \u201cyou don\u2019t want to measure twice, regulate once,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the wrong laws on the books and have unintended consequences.\u201d \u201cNot only will it not fix the thing you\u2019re trying to fix,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019ll cause a lot of collateral damage at the same time.\u201d But even with the changes, the bill summons significant constitutional questions, said Ryan Calo, a co-director of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington, and Madeline Lamo, a former fellow at the lab. Ms. Lamo said that language in the bill about bots \u201cinfluencing a vote in an election\u201d ran into a problem that has plagued campaign finance regulations and election-related speech laws: It can be difficult to distinguish speech about political issues from speech explicitly intended to influence voters.Mr. Calo cited as an example a driverless car law passed by Nevada in 2012, which met with protest from luxury carmakers. They were miffed that the technologies in their cars fell under the loosely drawn definition of autonomous vehicles. The bill was revised and passed the following year.\u201cEmbarrassingly it was the first definition of artificial intelligence I\u2019ve ever seen in a state statute, and they had to strike it out and rewrite it,\u201d Mr. Calo said.With the bot bill, he said, similar issues could crop up.\u201cPolitical commentary comes in different forms,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine a concerned citizen sets up a bot to criticize a particular official for failing to act on climate change. Now say that official runs for re-election. Is the concerned citizen now in violation of California law?\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Gillula said that the bill sought to address a problem that may have been somewhat overhyped.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone say conclusively that Russian bots swung the election,\u201d he said, noting that he was not an expert on American political discourse. \u201cGiven that people are concerned but there is no conclusive smoking gun proof of concrete harm, I really hesitate to jump to \u2018let\u2019s get something because its such an emergency.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe political industrial complex is designed to protect the status quo, not to invent the future,\u201d he said. \u201cInventing the future means you have to think differently, be more inventive, be more creative.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "My 8-Month Search for $900 Sneakers", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperOrdinarily, this column has rules, an enclosed rhythm: visit store, take in its offerings, offer impressions. But this is not how most of my \u2014 or anyone\u2019s \u2014 actual shopping is done. It is a longitudinal, polyvalent process. It happens on the couch or on the phone as often as in a store. It is about chasing a specific thing as often as it is about the happenstance of discovery. And it is about failure. So much of shopping is about coming up short. By percentage, most of my time devoted to shopping is unsuccessful: styles that don\u2019t work, garments that don\u2019t fit well, wild goose chases.Since last fall, I\u2019ve been failing in spectacular, repeated, mortifying fashion in the pursuit of one particular item: Balenciaga Triple S sneakers, in the beige, green and yellow colorway.But all those disappointments made for an excellent case study on the way we shop today: the collapse between the luxury marketplace and street wear-inspired drops, the ways in which the perfect-information promise of internet commerce is a sham, how the hype cycle has become a series of unnavigable spikes and also a long arc all at once.They were released commercially late last summer. One night in September, I was driving on the Upper East Side \u2014 it happens! \u2014 and spotted them in the Balenciaga store window on Madison. A couple of weeks later I went back to get them.They were as heavy as small watermelons and as beautiful as Lalique vases. Each shoe was roughly the volume of my head. The floor pair happened to be my size, and I was surprised that when I tried them on, they didn\u2019t look unreasonably clunky. They had aerodynamic spirit. I looked like a K-pop star.It seems quaint now, in retrospect, to expect to saunter into the store, request my size, pay and leave. But fall 2017 was a simpler time in luxury sneakers.From that day, I remember mostly that the sales clerk was tall. With a blend of exuberance and pity, he told me no, the shoes were just for show. They\u2019d sold out. I left my number, hoping for a call. It never came.When I want something badly, it becomes an unbearable itch. When it involves solving an unsolvable puzzle, good sense goes out the window. I set useless Google alerts, called Balenciaga customer service a couple of times, searched Grailed, eBay and so on. No dice. By December, I got serious. I called every Balenciaga store in the country. Some snickered, some were helpful, some told me they already had \u201cpresold\u201d their restock orders. A couple had unspoken-for pairs, but not the colorways I wanted. Only one store, the SoHo location, said it was planning to restock and simply put them out on the floor.I stopped in with a friend to sniff around and struck up a conversation with a friendly young clerk named Maya who offered to reach out if my preferred colorway ever came back in stock, which it almost certainly would not.Still, a couple of weeks later, I got a text asking if I was interested in the all-black version of the shoe \u2014 a compromise, but not a terrible one. I headed over on a filthily rainy day to try them on. There were two options: one distressed and one more polished. I went with the more polished one because it felt more versatile, and because I thought that might answer the bell that had been ringing in my head for months.It did not. Contemplating the Triple S-size hole in my wardrobe became a daily habit. I bought a jacket that I believed would go great with the sneakers I feared I\u2019d never get. I griped about them on a podcast, maybe two. At a party one night in January, I saw Pusha-T wearing the Dover Street Market limited-edition Triple S in my size \u2014 you can read the size right on the toe box, one of the shoe\u2019s signature filigrees \u2014 and seriously considered asking to buy them from him when he was through wearing them.At a certain point, unable to sate my desire, and long past reason, I decided to investigate the world of bootlegs, in search of a fake that was extremely credible or extremely noncredible. For about six weeks in December and January, I emailed with the anonymous agents faithfully. They followed up on order updates, letting me know about items that were out of stock, or were slightly different than advertised. It was, up until that point, the most reliable and satisfying human exchange I\u2019d had on this whole quest.They arrived, three crushed shoe boxes in a heavily taped cardboard box covered in Chinese lettering. The sneakers themselves were made carelessly, with paint where it\u2019s not supposed to be and stitching that comes apart, but they make me laugh every time I look at them. I wore them to MoMA\u2019s bootleg party in January, and no one noticed.At around the same time, Balenciaga announced that it would be shifting production of the Triple S from Italy to China. When the 2.0 versions started trickling out, some changes were obvious: The Chinese remake is about a pound lighter per shoe and less distressed than the original. It is itself something of a bootleg.Though I was still pursuing the Italian originals, futilely sending several notes to one Grailed user who was selling the only pair in my size, I decided on full-scale assault to get a pair of the new versions. I set up some columns in Tweetdeck and began keeping tabs on the thriving underground system of bots and monitors that specialize in grabbing sneakers as soon as they are made available for sale online. I focused especially on the Twitter accounts @Bkantha1 and @BkanthaLinks (now @LINKSZN), which seemed to have the most austere approach, and set up tweet notifications for each account. A little later, I began following a guy who lives in Hong Kong, seemingly in his late 20s, who has a surfeit of cash, a penchant to vomit hashtags and a nascent interest in street wear. He would reliably retweet every tweet about a Triple S restock. I set an alert to receive notifications when he did.My phone quickly turned into an heavy-traffic orchestra, notifications dinging at all hours. More than once, I was rousted from sleep by an alarm, and I instinctually grabbed the phone and looked at the screen through mostly shut eyes to see if it was about the pair I was still craving. Many times I clicked through immediately, only to find that it was already sold out.Once, when I was up writing at around 4 a.m., an alert came through for a Barneys listing of the black and pink women\u2019s Triple S, and I snapped up the biggest available size, hoping they might fit. When they arrived, I tried them on, and they were like sausage casings. I was worried they\u2019d split if I ever had to run in them. I mournfully returned them.For a sneaker that\u2019s being aggressively bootlegged \u2014 and judging by the pictures on Russian and Chinese web stores, at a reasonably high level \u2014 this was a service I would have happily paid for. (It is free when you purchase.)In March, out of nowhere, someone accepted my totally reasonable, not outlandish bid. I was excited, but maybe a bit wary. A couple of days later, they arrived with a StockX tag dangling from the left shoe. They were beautiful, but they felt a bit too clean, and the stitching of the size number on the left toe box was slightly distressed. I held them up against the real ones I\u2019d bought at the SoHo store, and they were eerily similar. I searched YouTube for videos offering guidance on how to spot fake Triple S\u2019s \u2014 there are oodles for Yeezys and Jordans \u2014 but the only ones I could find appeared to have been made by bootleggers themselves. (Nice try!) I sat on them for a few weeks, slightly skeptical. Eventually, I sold them. And then, in early May, the deluge finally came. First, a random late-evening notification led to the exact pair I craved on the Saks Fifth Avenue website, which I ordered and which never came. The FedEx tracking page was a grueling taunt. At one point, on the day of alleged delivery, I went downstairs from my apartment to meet the FedEx truck, which turned out to be nothing more than a Budget rental truck with an ocean of boxes in the back and two extremely harried workers trying to sort through them, all of this at around 9 p.m. (I assumed that the package was stolen by an observant handler somewhere along the way. But after a couple of weeks in tracking purgatory, the package began moving south and ended up at the Saks store in Bal Harbour, Fla., the phone clerk who finally issued my refund \u2014 several weeks late \u2014 told me.)There was no prize for finally fulfilling this arduous task, no celebration. Suddenly, I had the shoes, and I was long, long over them. The months had taken their toll. At some point, my need to acquire had replaced raw aesthetic desire. It didn\u2019t help that in the public imagination, they were coveted, then memed, then played out, then strangely forgotten. There was a new generation of bulky sneakers, some even more absurd: the Dior Homme B22, the Versace Chain Reaction, the Guccis with the Sega font crisscrossed by bands of crystal.Also, now, nine months from when I first put a pair on my feet, only to be told they couldn\u2019t stay there, they were suddenly everywhere. They mocked me in the ads on my Instagram feed, and in the ones that trail me across the internet. Here we are! Easily available! I began to resent them, sitting in a box I\u2019d opened only once, on the day I picked them up from the store. One day last month, though, I was wearing something with a hint of bright green and I realized that I had the perfect sneakers to go with it. Lacing them up didn\u2019t provide quite the same thrill as when I pranced around the Upper East Side Balenciaga store. Instead, the satisfaction was something different, like wearing something you\u2019ve had for so long that it\u2019s become familiar, a foregone conclusion. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Searching for Missing Migrants in the Desert Near the Mexican Border", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.What would you do if your brother went missing in the California desert? For Rafael Luna, an immigrant from Mexico, the answer was simple: Find him.The organization was founded six years ago in San Diego by working people, mostly immigrants themselves, who saw a need to help families find some kind of closure. While illegal border crossings have plunged in recent years, the number of migrants dying along the border is climbing; more than 400 people were found dead in 2017.With the Border Patrol pushing border crossers into more remote areas, and with a heat wave punishing parts of the Southwest, forensic researchers say the number of migrants dying around the border may actually be much higher, providing the \u00c1guilas with many grisly reports of such tragedies.Sometimes the relatives of missing migrants accompany the \u00c1guilas on their grim task, as Mr. Luna did one recent Saturday, just an hour\u2019s drive from prosperous San Diego. He joined more than 20 volunteers who piled into aging 4x4s and then fanned out on a stretch of barren federal land.After trekking under the desert sun, using satellite images and intelligence gleaned from other migrants, they found the body of a man who seemed to have been trying to find shelter near a boulder in his last moments alive. Next to him, in bag of belongings, was a Mexican ID card with the name of Adrian Luna, who went missing two months ago while crossing the border.\u201cThat was my brother,\u201d Mr. Luna said after absorbing the shock of finding the remains, and thanking the \u00c1guilas for their help in finding the body. He and the volunteers placed a simple wooden cross where the remains were found. \u201cNow, maybe it\u2019s time to move on,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)I would not encourage Latino high school seniors to apply to Merced as a first choice. The greater opportunities to become acquainted with world class faculty weigh heavily in favor of Cal and UCLA as first choices. I believe that we need more diversity at these campuses where Latinos and African-Americans are woefully under-represented. I also take issue with the growing percentage of out-of-state students attending UC. State residents support the system through their taxes and should have a significant preference over non-state applicants.- Joanne NoganoI grew up in Merced, and while I chose to go to another UC for undergrad, many of my friends in the area stayed at home and attended UCM. They saved on living expenses and were able to enjoy many of the benefits of a smaller school (smaller class size, more resources for labs, etc.). Yes, Merced has yet to reach the higher tiers of its sister schools. But that only happens with funding, time, and a continued commitment from students to never let their potential be limited by the branding of their upbringing. Make no mistake, there are students at Merced right now who will someday change the world. As Californians, I pray we continue to help them and others find their path forward.- Josh SarmaUC Merced is a fantastic example of the type of public investment that this state, and this country, used to make in the middle of the 20th century, but doesn\u2019t anymore. It should be viewed as a beacon for how government ought to operate. Instead of investing in the prestige of existing universities, we should invest in creating more universities and more capacity to serve our growing population.- Ira KaplanCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "How Parents Solve Summer", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe put the question to Times readers: What are your kids doing this summer? Here are some answers.Director of the Gender Initiative at The TimesThis was the summer I vowed to be organized. There would be no frantic morning phone calls to sign up my kids \u2014 5 and 7 \u2014 for last-minute sports camp. There would be no gaps in coverage that would yank me out of work meetings. There would be no winging it. I would get out ahead of the problem and pull together an organized, cost-effective, well-planned summer. But as I began to pin things to the schedule, I found that some camps were ridiculously expensive. Others were already sold out. Some camps wanted to lump my two boys in the same age group section when they would really profit from being apart. By the week of June 25, the summer planning document had all but petered out. Was I alone in this mess? Many parents wrote of cobbling together activities to fill the weeks. Some alternated vacation time with their spouses to ensure coverage. Others sucked it up with expensive camps. Some pulled out all the stops planning fantastic kid-centric adventures. Others furnished their kids with iPads. But whatever the solution, almost every respondent worried over the problem. The summer months caused no end of stress over the workdays missed, vacation days used, money meted out. This was far from easy whether parents worked full-time or not.\u201cThere is a huge disconnect between the amount of vacation and holidays given to the average American worker and the amount of summer vacation for a schoolchild. I am not sure how the average family fills in the gaps,\u201d writes Elena Olson, mother of 4-year-old Delaney. Big BudgetsAt the higher end, $12,000 covers day camp and sleepaway camp for Leslie Rubin\u2019s two children, but \u201cit is a serious struggle for us to afford summer camps,\u201d writes the Brooklyn mother. \u201cI don\u2019t know how working class or poor families manage it.\u201d In North Miami, Lindsey Korbin estimates she spends between $2,000 and $2,500. \u201cMy son goes to some specialized camps for a few weeks (such as art camp and marine biology camp). We spend about $500 to $700 on camps and probably another $1,500 on day/weekend trips and activities. We don\u2019t do a lot during the school year, so it balances out.\u201d\u201cOver $3,000\u201d is the price tag for Laurie Blount\u2019s son in Portland, Ore. \u201cWe invest in a series of weeklong camps, one themed for outdoor activities (hiking, rafting, fishing) and one theme revolves around science and technology \u2026 We also do evening swim lessons most of the summer.\u201dHoyoung Maeng of Bethesda, Md., recalls a summer when she spent $5,000 on camps. \u201cCrazy.\u201dMany parents also cut costs where they could, often relying on family members to play the safety net.\u201cSending my son to my parents for a few weeks saves a bundle,\u201d writes Elizabeth Adams, a mom of two from Takoma Park, Md.A Patchwork of ActivitiesArt camp, marine biology camp, baton twirling, drum corps, sleepaway camp, an adventure center, the arboretum, swimming lessons, exchange programs, family visits, volunteering \u2026 the diversity of things to do was mind-boggling.\u201cMy 6- and 8-year-old girls do various weekday camps,\u201d writes Albuquerque-based Carrie Engelstad, a mother of four. \u201cArt and drama, sports, gymnastics and zoo camp, each for one week. I stay at home with the 3- and 4-year-old while I am working on a master\u2019s in statistics. We also take several family vacations for family reunions.\u201dBut even the most organized parents struggle to keep up with the agenda. Kids too, as Kate Drewry of St. Louis, Mo., points out:\u201cWe\u2019ve cobbled together a complex matrix of day camps (six in all). And of course they each have different drop-off/pickup procedures, rules about lunches, supplies to bring each day, early- and aftercare options, etc. My husband made a master calendar for us to keep track of where she\u2019s going each day of the summer, and it\u2019s still hard to keep straight. Last night before bed, my daughter asked, \u2018Which camp do I have tomorrow? Zoo camp?\u2019 \u2018No honey, it\u2019s science camp tomorrow.\u2019\u201d Is More School the Answer?Parents were divided on whether a longer school year would help. Many suggested that school should transition to a year-round model, while some felt that the school year should be stretched just a little to reduce the length of the summer vacation. Colleen Biggs, who lives outside of Seattle and is a mother of two teenagers, says she would prefer year-round school \u201cso my kids aren\u2019t off school for 12 weeks straight. I would also like more summer school options for kids to get ahead, rather than just for remedial education.\u201d\u201cSometimes I wish we could go to a year-round school plan. It would make it easier to juggle child care. There would be less of an issue with the summer slide,\u201d muses Kathie C. from Glen Allen, Va.Heather R. Hofstetter of Houston also mentions the idea of year-round school. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer an agrarian society, and there\u2019s no real reason for a 12-week break in the summer.\u201dKarin Siedlecki, a mother of twins in Dunwoody, Ga., thinks \u201cschool-sponsored, lower-cost public programs would be ideal, in creative arts/sports/language areas, which they do not get enough of during the school year. More relaxed schedule, no homework, all the fun parts of learning.\u201dIf You Could Reinvent SummerThere was no shortage of ideas on how to improve the summer, whether through activities or cost-cutting measures.\u201cI would love for most of the kids in our neighborhood to play together all day and for the parents to chip in and hire a responsible teenager (or two) to act as a point person for making lunches, applying Band-Aids, accompanying the kids on the bus downtown. I just wish there was less adult-led structure to my daughter\u2019s life in summer. She seems to have a hard time being \u2018bored,\u2019\u201d writes Kayt de Fever of Portland, Ore.\u201cI think that optional summer school sessions should be a solution, and not only for those children that didn\u2019t do well during the year. It will help the younger children stay accustomed to a schedule and keep their brains sharp while helping working parents take less days off and spend less money,\u201d suggests Asia Mills of Bayonne, N.J.Jennifer Bridges, a mother of two girls in Boise, Idaho, likes the idea of \u201cswapping vacation weeks with some friends who live out of town. Sort of a city mouse/country mouse camp, for free.\u201dSome see summer as altogether too short. \u201cMake it longer!!! Like when we were kids \u2014 truly 3 FULL months of bliss.

But the company is prepared to go public again, in part to help finance further investments in its businesses.In an email to employees, Mr. Musk said that producing 5,000 cars per week meant that Tesla \u201cjust became a real car company.\u201d But now comes another challenge: It must reliably maintain production \u2014 if not increase it \u2014 for years.The company disclosed it was still sharing information of users\u2019 friends, such as name, gender, birth date, current city or hometown, photos and page likes, with 61 app developers nearly six months after it said it stopped access to this data in 2015. Facebook said it gave these 61 firms \u2014 which ranged from the dating app Hinge to shipping giant United Parcel Service Inc. a six-month extension for them to \u201ccome into compliance\u201d with the 2015 policy. In addition, five other companies \u201ctheoretically could have accessed limited friends\u2019 data\u201d because of access they received as part of a Facebook experiment, the company said in the document.Whether Walt Disney or Comcast emerges as the winner in the fight for most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s businesses, one thing is clear: Mr. Murdoch will bid goodbye to the majority of a media empire that he has assembled over decades.He added that Murdoch\u2019s strength is \u201cto look both at where the world is today and what is the right path for the future. ...

Investors often view a lack of transparency as a reason to be cautious about a company. With Facebook, they did not.The commission\u2019s stated mission is to protect European consumers by assuring them the benefits of competition. But the commission does not seem to have considered the possibility that Google\u2019s search engine and browser have achieved such high market share because consumers prefer them, or that consumers might also like having the apps already installed on their phones.Under a measure that could go to a vote as soon as Aug. 8, the city would stop licensing new for-hire vehicles \u2014 except wheelchair-accessible ones \u2014 while the council took a year to study the industry.

Even though oil prices recently have risen, the government is running a budget deficit this year after announcing the biggest fiscal stimulus package in the country\u2019s history.Among other arguments, the agency said in a release Thursday that it did not support the Winklevoss\u2019s argument that Bitcoin markets, including the Gemini Exchange, are \u201cuniquely resistant to manipulation.\u201d It also highlighted issues of fraud and investor protection.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ready for Vacation? Here\u2019s the Best Tech for Trip Planning", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixFlipping through printed travel guides and paper maps is pass\u00e9. Tech tools are far more efficient at keeping your plans organized and easily accessible. As a frequent traveler, I always turn to a few time savers: building your own Google maps, using an itinerary management app and keeping important travel notes in a digital spreadsheet.Not everyone wants to be as organized about trips as I do, of course; some people may simply want to roll with whatever comes their way. At the end of the day, your goal is to have fun on vacation.Planning a trip thoroughly with tech tools may sound like giving up spontaneity. But in reality, it frees up time that you would have otherwise lost whenever you asked yourself, \u201cWhat am I going to do today?\u201d It can reduce family arguments about what to see next on a trip. And it still allows for discoveries along the way.So here\u2019s a guide to using tech to plan your trip for maximum enjoyment.Using the Google map creator on a computer browser, you can look up points of interest like museums, restaurants and hotels and pin them on a map. To make the pins easy to read, you can color-code them or mark them with symbols \u2014 like an icon of a spoon and a knife for restaurants, or an icon of a bed for hotels. You can add notes to each point of interest, like a few words about the type of food served at a restaurant. You can also create \u201clayers\u201d to help organize your trip \u2014 for example, I create a new layer for each day of the trip. After making your custom map, you can call it up via the Google Maps app on a smartphone, in a menu labeled Your places.The main benefit of this exercise is that the visual context of a map can help you plan each day around the proximity of points of interest. For example: When planning a trip to Taiwan this year, I created a layer for Day 1 and pinned a museum in northern Taipei along with some restaurants and a fish market in the area. After visiting the museum, I tapped on the nearest pin and loaded directions to walk to it. Using this routine, I visited nearly everything I wanted to see on the 10-day trip.In the bad old days when I went on trips without custom maps, I jotted down a list of places I wanted to visit. Each day, I wasted far too much time, phone battery and cellular data figuring out which landmark to visit, how to get there and what to do afterward.There\u2019s another way custom maps save time. When your friends are visiting a country you have traveled to and bug you for your \u201cbucket list\u201d recommendations, you can simply send a Google invitation to the friend to view your map. That is far more useful than sharing a list of places to go.Pulling up itineraries can be a hassle because over the course of a longer vacation, there are so many items to juggle for flights, car rentals and hotel reservations for each city you visit.Between the two apps, I prefer TripIt. It has a simpler interface that shows my trip information in a cohesive timeline; Google crams extra features into its app like coupons and recommendations for things to do.Here\u2019s how TripIt fits into my planning. I create a separate email account just for trip itineraries. After booking a flight, a car rental or a hotel, I forward the confirmation emails to that email account. When I am booking hotels or figuring out what to do each day, my TripIt timeline serves as a reference for where I am going to be.If you want to be an extra-thorough planner, a spreadsheet can go a long way. My partner, who is a self-proclaimed power traveler, enjoys compiling travel spreadsheets containing information about the country, a pre-trip checklist, a summary of the general itinerary and a list of lodging.Here\u2019s an overview of how a travel spreadsheet looks. One sheet labeled About includes information about the country, like the exchange rate or cultural etiquette (to tip or not to tip?). Another sheet, labeled Pre-trip Checklist, contains a packing list and tasks like informing your credit card company that you are about to travel. An itinerary sheet summarizes the general trip plan, including the cities you will be in on each date. Finally, the Lodging sheet has a quick list of hotels along with their addresses and the check-in and checkout dates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler Loses Sergio Marchionne With Bumpy Road Ahead", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFiat Chrysler Automobiles was facing an uncertain future even before the man who led its unlikely turnaround became gravely ill.Now, the hard decisions fall to the new chief executive, Mike Manley, who has been running the arm of the company that is easily its best reason for optimism.The Italian-American automaker has reported steady earnings, driven by the Jeep and Ram brands that have been run by Mr. Manley. But the Fiat, Dodge and Chrysler nameplates contribute little to its bottom line.The company lags its rivals in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, and gets three-quarters of its profits from North America, where the entire industry is experiencing a slowdown.Competitors like General Motors and Ford Motor have sped ahead with development of electric vehicles and self-driving technology, while Fiat Chrysler has been slow to do the same. It does not operate its own financing company, a competitive advantage for its rivals who are able to offer attractive discounted loans and leases.And the possibility that President Trump could push for tariffs on imports of cars and auto parts has sent uncertainty rippling through the entire industry.\u201cSergio has done an incredible job revitalizing the company since Chrysler\u2019s bankruptcy in 2009,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm. \u201cBut there\u2019s more work to be done. There\u2019s still a lot that needs to be addressed.\u201dNow Fiat Chrysler, which has seen its stock lose around a fifth of its value since January, must do it without Mr. Marchionne, 66, who has led the company for 14 years. The company declined to comment on Mr. Marchionne\u2019s condition, but the decision to replace him on a Saturday, effective immediately, was a clear sign that his prognosis was poor.The carmaker\u2019s shares fell more than 5 percent at one point in morning trading in Europe on Monday before recovering some of those losses.Fiat Chrysler will provide a fresh glimpse of its finances on Wednesday when it reports its second-quarter results. Wall Street analysts expect a rise in earnings, driven almost exclusively by robust Jeep and Ram truck sales. A year ago, it reported second-quarter net income of 1.2 billion euros on revenue of \u20ac27.9 billion.The company\u2019s profitability is perhaps the central issue that Mr. Manley will have to tackle. Profit amounted to about 6 percent of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s revenue last year, well short of the 11 percent achieved by General Motors. In June, Mr. Marchionne and his executive team laid out a business plan that calls for spending 45 billion euros to develop more than two-dozen new vehicles, including electric models, all while slashing costs by \u20ac9 billion \u2014 a tough balancing act for an automaker. The goal is to more than double its profit margin by 2022.American dealers expressed confidence in Mr. Manley. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with his selection,\u201d said Wes Lutz, owner of a Chrysler Dodge Jeep franchise in Jackson, Mich., and chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about product. He\u2019s worked on the retail side, so he understands dealers. Any time you have a C.E.O. who understands dealers, you usually have good market share, so I\u2019m excited about Mike Manley.\u201dMr. Manley, who was not available for an interview, has the unenviable task of replacing Mr. Marchionne, a larger-than-life executive who quoted both philosophers and pop music lyrics with ease and pushed his workers to match his boundless energy.Ms. Lindland said that Mr. Manley \u201cis a different kind of character.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s quieter,\u201d Ms. Lindland said. \u201cNobody has the force of personality that Sergio had, but Mike can motivate people. He\u2019s been doing that at Jeep.\u201dMr. Manley took over Jeep in 2011 and has nearly tripled its global sales. The company expects to sell 1.9 million Jeeps this year, and its models are now produced in 10 plants in six countries. When Mr. Manley took over, Jeeps were only made in four plants, all in the United States.\u201cMike has been one of the major contributors to F.C.A.\u2019s success and he has a remarkable track record of accomplishments,\u201d John Elkann, the great-great grandson of Fiat\u2019s founder, Giovanni Agnelli, said in an email to Fiat Chrysler employees.Mr. Manley will have to rely heavily on the sport-utility vehicle line going forward. Consumers in the United States, China and elsewhere are increasingly opting for roomier models like S.U.V.s, and pricier Jeeps like the Grand Cherokee generate hefty profits. With its heritage dating back to the rugged military vehicles used in World War II, Jeep also has a global appeal that other Fiat Chrysler brands lack. Under the company\u2019s five-year business plan, Jeep is scheduled to introduce a midsize pickup truck next year as well as 14 new hybrid or battery-powered models. In China, Jeep would offer four fully electric models.Mr. Manley \u201chas to grow Jeep in China,\u201d said Tom LaSorda, a former Chrysler chief executive. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201dIn the United States market, the new models can\u2019t come soon enough, especially the seven-passenger Jeep Grand Wagoneer that\u2019s scheduled to arrive in 2020. \u201cWe needed that vehicle yesterday,\u201d said Mr. Lutz, the dealership owner. In the first six months of this year, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s United States sales rose 5 percent, due exclusively to higher Jeep sales.Fiat Chrysler also plans to spend heavily to develop new models for its Ram, Alfa Romeo and Maserati lines, all of which are solidly profitable. But the future for the company\u2019s other brands is uncertain.Chrysler only offers two models and has little presence outside America. Dodge has been reduced mainly to selling big, powerful sports cars, a segment whose sales are declining. Fiat Chrysler also spent billions of dollars to introduce Fiat small cars to American buyers, but so far this year it has only sold about 8,000 Fiats in the United States. The company sells that many Ram trucks in one day.In light of the shift in the market, Mr. Manley will probably eventually have to address the question of whether to kill Dodge or Chrysler, and whether to continue to sell Fiats in the United States, Ms. Lindland said.But the Chrysler brand could have a future in autonomous vehicles, even though Fiat Chrysler has done little to develop its own self-driving cars.Mr. Marchionne long expressed doubt about investing in technology whose future is unknown, but Fiat Chrysler has partnered with Waymo, the self-driving car company that was spun out of Google. It is supposed to produce up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans that Waymo will equip and use for a driverless ride service it is starting.\u201cThey need to make sure they don\u2019t fall too far behind on autonomy, and Waymo may be the way they do that,\u201d Ms. Lindland said.An earlier version of this article misidentified Fiat\u2019s founder and also misstated John Elkann\u2019s relationship to him. Fiat was founded by Giovanni Agnelli, not by Gianni Agnelli, and Mr. Elkann is Giovanni Agnelli\u2019s great-great-grandson, not his grandson. An earlier version of a picture caption with the article misstated the given name of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s new chief executive. He is Mike Manley, not Mark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guy V. Molinari, Power Broker in New York and Beyond, Is Dead at 89", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGuy V. Molinari, the longtime Republican kingpin of Staten Island who represented New York City\u2019s least populous, most conservative county as an assemblyman, congressman, borough president and political paterfamilias, died on Wednesday in a Manhattan hospital. He was 89 and had been a lifelong resident of the island.His son-in-law, Bill Paxon, said the cause was pneumonia.Mr. Molinari was a dominant force on Staten Island for two decades, but his influence also reached City Hall, Albany and Washington in Republican alliances with Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki, and Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush.Irascible, pugnacious, a Marine in the Korean War and a lawyer for 20 years before entering politics, Mr. Molinari was elected to three terms in the State Assembly in the 1970s and to five terms in Congress in the 1980s, and was borough president from 1990 to 2001. He won 10 straight elections before losing a 1995 race for district attorney.Off the island, Mr. Molinari was known for flare-ups and feuds with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and others \u2014 and for his prescient political endorsements. He was the first New York City politician to endorse Mr. Giuliani for mayor, in 1988, six years before he took office. Early on he supported Mr. Pataki, Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, becoming state chairman of Mr. Bush\u2019s victorious 1988 race for the White House.But after endorsing George W. Bush for president in 1999, Mr. Molinari abruptly retracted his support, apparently miffed that he had not been chosen as state chairman for the 2000 campaign; he also broke ranks with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and others who refused to follow him in supporting Senator John McCain\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination. He denounced them in terms that had Republican eyes rolling.The Staten Island Advance chronicled Molinari family events, from the birth of a grandchild to a cat\u2019s new litter. Everyone called him Guy, and voters were not surprised when he knocked on their doors or slapped their backs at the supermarket.In an overwhelmingly Democratic city, Mr. Molinari was one of the prominent Republicans of his era, a forceful advocate for 380,000 islanders, many of Italian and Irish descent and many of them police officers, firefighters and civil servants, who often seemed to regard the problems of the rest of New York City across the harbor as distant thunder.In Albany and Washington, he fought for better transportation and against pollution in his borough, the site of many oil depots. He successfully opposed a new power plant, and he won a bid to cut tolls on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge for residents. He also took an obligatory stance for Staten Island\u2019s secession from the city, a hopeless yet perennial issue among islanders who felt they received short shrift.And at the helm of a formidable political machine, Mr. Molinari, one of the last of the city\u2019s old-time power brokers, decided who would get patronage jobs and who among his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s would run for the City Council and the Legislature, for judgeships and seats in Congress. Candidates who faced tough races were always assured of his presence on the campaign trail, which often guaranteed victory.Although Staten Island has traditionally been a Republican bastion in the city, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the borough 3 to 2. But voters often cross party lines in general elections, splitting tickets and electing as many Republicans as Democrats. Mr. Molinari sometimes represented the Conservative and Right to Life Party lines as well as the Republican line on ballots.Guy Victor Molinari was born on Nov. 23, 1928, in Manhattan, one of several children of Sigmund Robert Molinari and Elizabeth (Majoros) Molinari. His family later moved to the Midland Beach section of Staten Island. His father, an Italian immigrant known as \u201cFighting Bob,\u201d was a real estate broker and an assemblyman from 1943 to 1944, but failed in later bids for the State Senate and for borough president.Guy graduated from New Dorp High School in 1945 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Wagner College on Staten Island in 1949 and a law degree from New York Law School in Manhattan in 1951. After serving as a Marine sergeant in Korea, he passed the bar in 1953 and for two decades practiced law on Staten Island.In Congress, he supported President Reagan\u2019s agenda of tax cuts and smaller government, voted in 1983 against a national holiday in honor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and was a persistent critic of the Federal Aviation Administration, arguing that cutbacks of air traffic controllers were leading to unsafe conditions. He opposed abortion and social welfare programs.In local politics, he castigated Mayor Edward I. Koch, whose third term was mired in scandal, and he supported Mr. Giuliani in his race for mayor in 1989 against the Democratic candidate, David N. Dinkins, who won.Quitting Congress to become borough president, a largely ceremonial role that had lost power in a City Charter revision, struck many Molinari supporters as a nod toward semiretirement. But for 12 years, from Jan. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 2001, he remained remarkably active in politics and public affairs, presiding over his beloved borough from a huge, ornate, wood-paneled office at Borough Hall in the St. George neighborhood.He provided crucial support for Mr. Giuliani\u2019s successful 1993 mayoral race, and was Mr. Pataki\u2019s New York City campaign chairman in his winning 1994 campaign for governor. But the mayor and governor, who rarely saw eye to eye, both distanced themselves from Mr. Molinari after his remark about the sexual orientation of Ms. Burstein, the candidate for attorney general.There were other strains. In 1994, Mr. Molinari accused Mr. Giuliani of betraying Republicans when the mayor supported President Bill Clinton\u2019s anti-crime bill, and he said Mr. Giuliani was \u201cfinished\u201d when the mayor supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democrat, over Mr. Pataki in the race for governor.In the late 1990s, Mr. Molinari was instrumental in closing the Fresh Kills landfill, filing a federal lawsuit over methane and other gases that violated the Clean Air Act, and calling in political debts to ensure support. The landfill was closed in late 2001 as Mr. Molinari was stepping down as borough president, his incumbency ended by term limits.In 2009 Mr. Molinari received a call from an aide to Mr. Bloomberg, who had enjoyed his initial support but had become an independent and denounced political parties as a \u201cswamp of dysfunction.\u201d The mayor now needed old allies in his race for a third term.\u201cWhat do we have to do to win back Republicans?\u201d the emissary asked.\u201cApologize,\u201d Mr. Molinari said.An earlier version of this obituary misstated where in New York City Mr. Molinari was born. It was Manhattan, not Staten Island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stream These 10 Emmy Nominees You May Not Have Seen", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere has always been a disparity between critical acclaim and viewership numbers for this consistently excellent series from Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg about Soviet spies in suburbia, but latecomers can be assured that the ending will pay off their investment. The sixth and final season unspools as a nuclear deal between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan brings an end to the Cold War that the central couple, Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, have been fighting so faithfully and catastrophically. The growing divisions within the K.G.B. are manifested in their marriage, which faces its stiffest test as forces gather to upend their cover as a normal American family.Scratch the surface of any do-it-yourself TV cooking and craft show and there\u2019s a whiff of existential despair, a natural byproduct of the relentlessly cheery attitude of hosts who create dishes and tchotchkes for guests that never arrive. \u201cAt Home With Amy Sedaris\u201d evokes that feeling through spectacularly deranged comedy: Although Sedaris\u2019s down-the-dial Martha Stewart labors under a sign that reads \u201cBeing Alone Is A-OK,\u201d she craves company so much, she lets a murderer (Michael Shannon) into the house in the Agatha Christie-themed season finale. Paul Giamatti, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Dratch, Chris Elliott and Michael Stipe are among the many friends who pop in for cameos, but it\u2019s Sedaris, in multiple roles, whose manic brilliance sets the tone.The premise for this black comedy from Bill Hader and Alec Berg makes it sound frivolous and disposable, like a TV version of \u201cGrosse Pointe Blank,\u201d following a contract killer who mingles with ordinary people during off hours. But while \u201cBarry\u201d gets plenty of laughs from Hader\u2019s former-Marine-turned-hit man wandering into the Los Angeles theater scene \u2014 particularly Henry Winkler\u2019s standout performance as a vain yet lovable acting teacher \u2014 the series\u2019 inaugural season grew darker and more emotionally rich as it progressed. Suddenly, a show about a killer\u2019s whimsical side project morphed into a tragicomedy about the torments of a man who can\u2019t transcend or escape the life he\u2019s chosen.The second season of this frank comedy by Pamela Adlon was wrapping up just as news broke that her co-creator and frequent writer, Louis C.K., had been involved in sexual misconduct. Yet the show makes it easy to imagine Adlon\u2019s character, a divorced actress struggling to raise three daughters on her own, persevering through such a terrible setback and continuing to do the best she can. Season 2 of \u201cBetter Things\u201d opens with Adlon\u2019s Sam Fox deftly peeling her 16-year-old away from a suitor 20 years her senior and reaches a touching apotheosis with \u201cEulogy,\u201d in which Sam asks her loved ones to eulogize her while she\u2019s still alive. As ever, she\u2019s bruised but unbowed.Back when he was one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after genre specialists, the creator of \u201cGodless,\u201d Scott Frank (\u201cDead Again,\u201d \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and \u201cMinority Report\u201d), conceived the show as a feature film. But he could never raise the money from a studio system in which the Western had fallen out of favor. By expanding it for a seven-episode Netflix series, Frank takes \u201cGodless\u201d in several directions at once, lifting from sources as diverse as Howard Hawks\u2019s classic jailhouse shoot \u2019em up, \u201cRio Bravo,\u201d and the pitiless Judge Holden character from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d The compelling hook at its core, however, is a besieged town run by the widows of men who lost their lives in a mining accident. Do they even need men? Or rather, will they have a choice?What happens to a show after it essentially blows up its entire premise? That was the question that lingered between the first and second seasons of this much-loved, ratings-deficient afterlife comedy from NBC, which had to pivot from a twist that made its title ironic. Creator Michael Schur (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d) surely has a grand plan in mind, but the second season felt improvised in the best possible sense, shuttling Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and her fellow Good Place residents through multiple fake utopias and celestial bureaucracies, all under the eye of Ted Danson\u2019s cackling architect. But for as much as \u201cThe Good Place\u201d had to change, the show still clung to its optimistic theme about the capacity for self-improvement and how it might be rewarded down the line.After writing and starring in the caustic black comedy \u201cFleabag,\u201d creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge turned to Luke Jennings\u2019s novella series \u201cCodename Villanelle\u201d for her follow-up, a cat-and-mouse thriller that has the same tart, irreverent edge of her previous work. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is a psychopathic assassin, barely contained by the shadowy organization that employs her, and Eve (Sandra Oh) is an MI5 analyst who leaves her post and risks losing everything in an obsessive quest to track her down. As the first season unfolds, Villanelle and Eve start to develop an odd intimacy, as if the efforts to monitor the other inadvertently resulted in a dangerous and unsavory tango. Their relationship nudges \u201cKilling Eve\u201d far-off its expected course and lands the show in fascinating new terrain.The creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) is one of a small handful of television writers whose voice is instantly recognizable \u2014 fast and quippy, with a gift for stylized dialogue that recalls Old Hollywood screwball comedies. With \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d Sherman-Palladino has finally found a period that fully accommodates her sensibility, giving her the opportunity to tell a personal story about a Jewish comedian asserting herself in a male-dominated field. In the impeccably realized world of 1958 New York City, \u201cMidge\u201d Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) plays the role of dutiful housewife until her husband leaves her and she reinvents herself as a stand-up comedian at a Greenwich Village comedy club. Sherman-Palladino spins Midge\u2019s domestic crises into uproarious stage material and keeps the laughs coming as Midge\u2019s life is turned upside down.Based on a series of novels by Edward St Aubyn, \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d sounds like an insufferable dirge, following an upper-class addict as he reels from the death of his abusive father in the 1980s. But although the show does marinate in grief, privilege, self-pity and escalating drug and alcohol consumption, it is also mordantly funny and unexpectedly heartbreaking, grounded by a tour de force performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role. The voiceover narration grants direct access into Patrick\u2019s addled thought processes, but it\u2019s Cumberbatch\u2019s fits of arrogance and despair that hold the series aloft, making it possible to think well of a hero who treats others nearly as shabbily as he treats himself.Amid the current mini-boom of true-crime documentary series, \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d stands out for the complicated questions it raises about spiritual questing, immigration rights and the true beneficiaries of religious freedom in America. The directors Maclain and Chapman Way unearth the forgotten story of the provocative Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his efforts to relocate his followers to a barren ranch in Wasco County, Ore. The Rajneeshees seem like a dangerous cult, as evidenced by its leader\u2019s fleet of Rolls Royces and growing weapons cache, but \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d approaches this story with an even-handedness that doesn\u2019t make them so easy to dismiss. The doc also has an endlessly fascinating anchor in Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh\u2019s former secretary, who led the commune with intimidation and devotion behind the scenes.Advertisement"}

What are the most crucial tech tools that you pack?Funny thing is, I\u2019d be traveling much lighter if I weren\u2019t dragging around so much tech!Because I\u2019m carting all my own stuff and moving every four or five days, I have to think a lot about size and weight. My MacBook Pro and iPhone X are essentials, as are a Bluetooth keyboard (which I hook up to my phone to write articles when I don\u2019t have my computer), a 2TB hard drive, and a USB-C dongle with multiple USB ports and an SD card reader.You shoot lots of photo and videos to document your travels. What do you do to stay organized or do quick edits on the road?I\u2019m new to iPhones \u2014 I had a Samsung phone I loved before this trip \u2014 and the magic of Airdrop has been a revelation to me. It lets me send photos to my computer and ruthlessly delete them from my phone.What apps have been most useful to you for planning trips or finding things to do?I like to book directly through hotels and airlines, and TripIt has saved me from endlessly searching through my email to find confirmations. You forward emails to the app, and it organizes the information into legs of travel. The app even helps you check into your flights.As for planning, I work with a researcher at The Times, and we communicate over Google Docs. But I\u2019ve found there isn\u2019t a single tech substitute out there for reading articles or random blogs, or doing a web search on \u201cwhere to eat in X,\u201d or asking locals where they like to go.Before I get to a city, I like to take all the recommendations I have and enter them into Google Maps. That way I can strategize my must-sees, but also know where to eat once I finish with that museum.It\u2019s a tossup between Maps and Evernote for which app I use most. Paper clutter is my constant enemy. To avoid taking brochures, I photograph each one I might want to refer to later and put it into Evernote.And a VPN, or a virtual private internet network, is a huge help in countries where I don\u2019t know the language. It makes my phone believe I\u2019m still in the States so my web searches come up in English.Which country has struck you as the most fascinating in terms of how it uses tech? What stood out about it?I was impressed by some 20-somethings from Mexico City who had planned their entire Baja Peninsula vacation through YouTube video searches. And I loved that in Oslo all the buses had USB chargers built into the wall. Not all of them worked, but it was the thoughtfulness that counted.Are there any common tech problems that people seem to experience everywhere? I expected to have bad cell reception in remote northern Iceland, but in Buffalo I couldn\u2019t call a ride share from outside my hotel \u2014 and I have Verizon! In New York State!Hotel Wi-Fi is notoriously awful worldwide. It\u2019s really important as a traveler to anticipate a lack of connectivity. Print out or take a screen shot of important tickets. Save your maps offline in Google or use Maps.me, a worldwide network of offline maps for your phone.Outside of the tech for work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? Is there an app or a piece of tech that you used at home that you would never use on the road?This was a surprise to me, but I had to cancel my Amazon Prime on the road. When I\u2019d fret about losing something, people would always say, \u201cYou can order it off Amazon!\u201d And you can \u2014 if you time it to ship three destinations down the road.But the real issue is returns. I\u2019d get a shipment and find out it had to be sent back through three different carriers, and I\u2019d have to hunt down extra boxes and pay for return shipping \u2014 plus find a shipping place that handled multiple carriers and was open when I could get to it. Instead, I\u2019m having a lot of fun shopping locally.Podcasts, too, were a big part of my New York City life. But on the road, I\u2019m less willing to take the safety risk of putting in earbuds on public transit. And I don\u2019t want to. Being on this trip is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I want to be tuned in as much as I can.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s not exactly in physical shape to run laps around Orange County Pavilion\u2019s outlet stores (he suffers from Hypoglycemia), but thankfully he\u2019s got a Segway.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Emerges as Clear No. 2 in Cloud Computing", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Thomas M. Siebel often faced skepticism when encouraging big companies to adopt internet-style cloud computing. Many companies, he said, had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers.Now his customers have a different concern: One cloud service isn\u2019t enough.And Mr. Siebel is adapting. After initially working closely with Amazon, a pioneer in cloud computing, C3 IoT now also has a technology and marketing partnership with Microsoft. And it is negotiating a similar agreement with Google.For a few years, it looked like Amazon would run away with the cloud computing business, piling up market share as it has with online shopping. But in the past couple of years, many companies have decided that they don\u2019t want to depend on Amazon alone, and are spreading out their business.That has helped Microsoft most of all. And the software giant has emerged as a strong No. 2 in the cloud market. Microsoft provided further evidence of its rise in the cloud business on Thursday, when it reported its most recent quarterly financial results.Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit, which supplies cloud-based computer processing and storage, and competes most directly with Amazon Web Services, grew by 89 percent over the same period a year ago. The company also reported strong growth in its other cloud offerings.Microsoft\u2019s profit increased 5 percent to $8.8 billion, or $1.13 a share. That was slightly above analysts\u2019 average forecast of $1.08 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters IBES.Revenue rose 17 percent to $30.09 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in June, higher than the Wall Street consensus estimate of $29.21 billion.The competition to supply the foundation layer of computing and software \u2014 the cloud-era equivalent of an operating system \u2014 is heated and costly. The biggest players, analysts estimate, are spending up to $10 billion a year on their global networks of data centers.This core cloud business is a $60 billion-a-year market, which grew by 50 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Synergy Research Group. In that fast-growing market, Amazon holds a 33 percent share, unchanged since the end of 2015. Over the same span, Microsoft\u2019s share climbed from 7 percent to 13 percent, and Google\u2019s doubled to 6 percent.John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research, predicted that the cloud giants will get bigger and capture a steadily rising share of corporate technology spending \u2014 especially as they add new capabilities, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, to their services.\u201cThe information technology market is going to increasingly gravitate towards a small number of hyperscale cloud providers,\u201d Mr. Dinsdale said.In a recent research report on that market, Gartner identified three top-tier companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google. And it listed only three others, Alibaba, Oracle and IBM, as their competitors.\u201cIt\u2019s a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft at this stage,\u201d said Raj Bala, a Gartner analyst. \u201cGoogle is making headway, nipping at their heels, but it\u2019s still behind the leaders.\u201dFor Amazon and Google, cloud-computing services were a natural outgrowth of their original businesses \u2014 e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google. Both companies were born on the internet.Not so for Microsoft, which has made the most striking transition to the cloud. Its heritage, corporate wealth and industry dominance was based on selling packaged software and its Windows operating system for personal computers.Microsoft\u2019s later forays into new markets were typically late and hobbled by the company\u2019s Windows fixation. Its failed mobile operating system, for example, was widely criticized as a kludgy attempt to shoehorn Windows onto a smartphone.The company\u2019s path to cloud computing was lengthy and sometimes halting, even if the technical roots stretch back many years. Its MSN online service and Internet Explorer browser had their heydays in the 1990s. More recently, the company poured resources into its Bing search engine.In 2008, two years after Amazon entered the cloud market, a team of the Microsoft\u2019s brightest scientists set to work on a cloud project, code-named Red Dog. In 2010, Microsoft introduced its cloud service, but it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Before he became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive in 2014, Satya Nadella held senior roles in its cloud, online services and search businesses. Once he took over, Mr. Nadella accelerated investment in the cloud unit and focused Microsoft\u2019s sales teams on the business, analysts say.Unlike his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer, Mr. Nadella\u2019s career was not steeped in Windows and the business model of packaged software. The traditional software business relied on product licenses with hefty payments up front rather than the pay-for-use subscriptions of the cloud world.\u201cTechnology was not really the obstacle for Microsoft, the problem was the business model,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cNadella has changed the strategy and the culture.\u201dAmazon holds some formidable advantages in the cloud market. It has the most customers \u2014 some spending more than $100 million a year \u2014 and more than 2,000 consulting partners to help companies use increasing amounts of Amazon cloud services. Many corporate technology managers see Amazon as the safe choice.But Microsoft has the advantage of being mainly a supplier of technology to businesses, unlike Amazon and Google. Its longstanding relationships with corporate customers, analysts say, are helping Microsoft gain ground as mainstream companies increasingly move to cloud technology. Microsoft has recently announced cloud deals with companies including Walmart, General Electric, Bayer, Starbucks and Campbell Soup.Microsoft\u2019s offerings have steadily improved, but even Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer for Azure, pointed to the company\u2019s roots in business as a driving force.\u201cThe relationships we have with companies, understanding their needs, is really helping with these migrations to our cloud,\u201d Mr. Russinovich said.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Giants Win a Battle Over Copyright Rules in Europe", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a fight nearly as old as the internet.On one side are news organizations, broadcasters and music companies that want to control how their content spreads across the web, and to be paid more for it. On the other are tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue that they funnel viewers and advertising revenue to media outlets, and free-speech advocates, who say that regulating the internet would set a dangerous precedent and limit access to information.That battle flared up in Europe on Thursday. Two powerful industries faced off \u2014 technology against media, platforms against publishers \u2014 in an unusually aggressive lobbying campaign in the European Parliament over a bill that would impose some of the world\u2019s strictest copyright laws, which would have required tech companies to filter out unlicensed content and pay for its use.On this occasion, tech prevailed; the proposal was voted down.\u201cMaking content available on the internet does not come without responsibility,\u201d said Eleonora Rosati, an associate professor on intellectual property law at the University of Southampton\u2019s law school in England, who has been tracking the bill. \u201cRights holders want to control how their content is made available, shared and indexed.\u201dMedia businesses like Axel Springer of Germany have become frustrated because even as their content has spread online, it is platforms like YouTube, owned by Google, and Facebook that have grown into advertising powerhouses on the back of the material.Those media companies have been seeking a rewrite of Europe\u2019s copyright laws that would give them more power to restrict how their content is distributed. They also cited concerns that Silicon Valley was not playing a strong enough gatekeeper role when it came to curtailing hate speech, violent extremism and fake news.Supporters of the bill argued that stricter copyright laws would give content creators more leverage against internet behemoths such as Google. Publishers have long complained that such companies profit from the work of others.\u201cThe real issue is Google\u2019s market power,\u201d said Lionel Bently, a law professor at the University of Cambridge who focuses on copyright. \u201cThe content industry feels it can\u2019t negotiate on a level playing field.\u201dInfluential policymakers in Brussels such as the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, have seemed receptive to such arguments. A proposal was put forward to require websites to use filtering technology to block unlicensed content from being posted and to obligate them to pay fees for news articles and other material posted online.The proposed rules would have added up to a sweeping change to copyright law.Operators of websites have long been protected from liability when unlicensed content is posted by a user. Instead, they are required only to remove infringing material once it is brought to their attention. In effect, if someone posts a movie clip on YouTube, or shares the text of an article on Reddit, those websites are not held legally liable.The new European proposals would put more responsibility on website owners, creating a potentially costly problem for sites that depend on user-generated material.The most contentious provision of the plans would require websites to use filtering software to screen such content before it was posted. YouTube already has a system to weed out unlicensed material, but the European rules would have gone further by requiring others to use similar tools. Another requirement, favored by book and news publishers, would prevent websites from using pieces of their content without authorization.Critics of the bill argued that it would lead to many unforeseen consequences, warning that it could even affect satirical content or the use of images in internet memes. They said it would restrict what was available online, and some described a provision requiring permission before websites used publishers\u2019 content as a \u201clink tax.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that those algorithmic filters are going to be able to decide that something is fair use, parody, a meme or a mash-up,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Brien, international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit group that opposed the bill.In defeating the proposal, the technology industry showed that it still held considerable influence, even as it has faced widespread criticism over privacy violations, the spread of misinformation, accusations of anticompetitive business practices and concerns about smartphone overuse.The coalition against the proposal that came together over the past month was similar to defenders of net neutrality in the United States, a mix of corporate giants and open internet activists. They said the copyright bill would limit the access to information and would overburden operators of websites, especially those without the resources of an American tech giant, with the costly task of screening user-generated content before posting it.Wikipedia said on its website that the measure \u201cthreatens online freedom and creates obstacles to accessing the web, imposing new barriers, filters and restrictions.\u201dMr. Gambini said he had received hundreds of messages from individuals and organizations attempting to win Mr. Tremosa\u2019s support. There was one from a Polish business group, he said, another from an artists\u2019 organization, and others still from news publishers and associations representing tech companies.He added that one message had come from the musician Paul McCartney, who wrote to members of the European Parliament in support of the tighter copyright rules.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Lang Lang\u2019s Return Is a Big Deal for Classical Music", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Lang has retained establishment cred, remaining one of the handful of go-to stars for opening night and gala concerts at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. His return to the stage on Friday \u2014 to headline the season opener at Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra\u2019s summer home in the Berkshires \u2014 is being closely watched not only by his fans, but also by the music industry.\u201cEveryone needs Lang Lang to come back and do what he does in such a unique fashion,\u201d said Mark Volpe, the Boston Symphony\u2019s managing director. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean playing the piano; I mean the bigger picture. There are other great pianists, but he has a personality, he\u2019s got a presence.\u201dIn April 2017, Mr. Lang announced that he had an inflammation in his left arm and planned to cancel a few months of concerts. He has been on a severely curtailed schedule ever since.\u201cI was not paying so much attention, I was already tiring, and I pushed to practice,\u201d Mr. Lang said. He added that he had worked too fast to teach himself an unfamiliar, unusual work because he was on a tight deadline, with several orchestras waiting to hear if he would perform the piece with them.It is harder than ever for a classical musician to become famous worldwide. The recording industry, with its promotional machinery, is a shadow of its former self. Fans can more than ever choose what they listen to \u2014 and filter out everything else. Breaking through the way Mr. Lang has over the past 20 years is rare.The select group of artists who can still sell out concerts on the strength of their names includes Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Joshua Bell and Ren\u00e9e Fleming \u2014 and Mr. Lang.\u201cIn the good old days, there used to be a lot of those, 25, 30, 40 years ago \u2014 people who could sell benefits, sell pension fund concerts,\u201d said Thomas W. Morris, who ran the Cleveland Orchestra and the Boston Symphony. \u201cThere are a lot less of them today, so when he\u2019s not around, it\u2019s felt.\u201dTake opening night galas, which are typically important fund-raisers for orchestras, with high ticket prices and programs designed to appeal to donors and trustees. In the two years before his injury, Mr. Lang played 10 opening galas with major American orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony.Mr. Lang is such a draw that he was invited to play the opening night concert at Carnegie Hall last October \u2014 even after he was restricted to a single hand. One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Maxim Lando, who was 14 at the time, sat beside him and served as his left hand in a truly unusual two-piano, five-hand arrangement of Gershwin\u2019s \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d with the jazz pianist Chick Corea. The audience went wild; the critics, less so.Mr. Graffman said that Mr. Lang had been diligent in his recovery, and that he had encouraged his former pupil to heed the advice of his doctors. \u201cIf the doctor said 20 minutes, don\u2019t play half an hour,\u201d Mr. Graffman said.Top-flight orchestras respect him and line up to work with him. Mr. Morris remembered a performance of Bartok\u2019s Second Concerto, \u201cwhich is a bear, and, my goodness me, his command of that was staggering.\u201d In this sense, he is different from classical crossover artists like the singer Andrea Bocelli and the violinist Andr\u00e9 Rieu, who don\u2019t generally appear with major ensembles.Mr. Lang was originally scheduled to play Tchaikovsky\u2019s First Concerto, with its bravura Romantic gestures, to open Tanglewood\u2019s season. But he decided instead on Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, which requires crisp, clear articulation along with style and elegance.He will stay with Mozart for his next scheduled concerts, including the opening of the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland on Aug. 17. More galas (and more Mozart) are scheduled for the fall \u2014 including the Cleveland Orchestra\u2019s 100th anniversary concert, conducted by an early supporter, Franz Welser-M\u00f6st.Mr. Lang signed with Universal Music Group just before his hiatus, after a seven-year stint with Sony Classical as his label. \u201cFor our perspective,\u201d said Dickon Stainer, in charge of Universal\u2019s global classics division, \u201cwe\u2019re particularly thrilled that in two weeks\u2019 time he\u2019s going to the studio in Beijing to make his first record for us since his return.\u201dZachary Woolfe contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pursuit of $1 Trillion: Amazon Closes In on Apple", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer.Amazon\u2019s market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple\u2019s market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006.Investors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple\u2019s.But Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon\u2019s move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon\u2019s gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon\u2019s increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.By comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company\u2019s market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday\u2019s close.Amazon\u2019s time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion.Apple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Sale: Survey Data on Millions of High School Students", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOWELL, Mass. \u2014 Three thousand high school students from across the United States recently trekked to a university sports arena here to attend an event with an impressive-sounding name: the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders. Many of their parents had spent $985 on tuition.Months earlier, the teenagers had received letters, signed by a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, congratulating them on being nominated for \u201ca highly selective national program honoring academically superior high school students.\u201dThe students all had good grades. But many of them were selected for the event because they had once filled out surveys that they believed would help them learn about colleges and college scholarships.Through their schools, many students in the audience had taken a college-planning questionnaire, called MyCollegeOptions. Others had taken surveys that came with the SAT or the PSAT, tests administered by the College Board. In filling out those surveys, the teenagers ended up signing away personal details that were later sold and shared with the future scientists event.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I sought out filling in my information for the College Board to sell to other companies,\u201d said Adriana Bay, 19, a sophomore at Vanderbilt University this fall who was solicited by the future scientists event when she was in high school. \u201cYou are giving them the liberty to profit off your information.\u201dThese marketing programs are generally legal, taking advantage of the fact that there is no federal law regulating consumer data brokers. They also face little oversight because federal education privacy laws make public schools, and not their vendors, directly responsible for controlling the spread of student data.But the handling of student surveys is receiving heightened scrutiny, particularly in the wake of revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that siphoned off the data of Facebook users who took a personality questionnaire.For high school students who want to receive materials from colleges and scholarship organizations, nonprofit college admissions testing services, like ACT and the College Board, offer optional surveys. Many colleges, universities and scholarship organizations buy such survey data to pinpoint prospective students.As marketing materials on the ACT site put it: Purchasing the names of \u201cracial and ethnic minorities is a great way to increase diversity at your campus.\u201d Other survey services, however, sell students\u2019 personal information far beyond colleges.Scholarships.com did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cI find all of this really troubling,\u201d said Marianne Stephens, the college counselor at Shorewood High School, a public school in Shoreline, Wash. After students there received mailings from a slew of leadership events, Ms. Stephens posted a \u201cSham Alert\u201d on her school\u2019s website describing many student recognition programs as \u201cessentially well-packaged marketing schemes.\u201d The alert also said students could opt out of college surveys that share their information.\u201cStudents and families don\u2019t realize that the data may come back to them as misleading marketing,\u201d she said.Richard Rossi, executive director of the National Leadership Academies, the company behind the future scientists event, said the program accurately described itself as selective because it accepted only students with at least a 3.5 grade point average.\u201cDoes that make it less appropriate to tell them they are special?\u201d Mr. Rossi asked. \u201cIn my mind, no.\u201d\u201cI felt excited to hear words from people who were successful in science to inspire me,\u201d said Sebastian Gonzalez, a high school junior interested in engineering who came to the event with his parents from Northern California.But critics say survey services may categorize students in ways that could expose them to predatory marketing or exclude them from important opportunities.Paul Weeks, ACT\u2019s senior vice president for client relations, said his organization allowed only colleges, universities and scholarship organizations to use its database, which includes details like students\u2019 family income, religious affiliation and test score range. ACT also prohibits clients from sharing students\u2019 data with third parties, he said.He added that the National Leadership Academies requested and was denied access to student data in January.Last week, ACT acquired the company that owns MyCollegeOptions, one of the services that shared information with the future science leaders event. Ed Colby, a spokesman for ACT, said his organization would \u201ccontinue to abide by the highest standards of data privacy.\u201d (Until June, The New York Times had a contract with MyCollegeOptions to distribute codes for free trial subscriptions. The Times did not receive information about students.)But the College Board allows universities to share students\u2019 data with certain educational partners, said Zach Goldberg, a spokesman for the College Board. And one of those universities disclosed students\u2019 survey data to the for-profit National Leadership Academies.In a follow-up email, Mr. Goldberg said his organization \u201cwas troubled\u201d by the inquiry from The New York Times and was suspending the university that shared students\u2019 data while it conducted an investigation. He added that the College Board had previously terminated accounts when users violated its policies.Mr. Rossi, the National Leadership Academies\u2019 executive director, said his company planned to be more transparent about how it selected students.\u201cThere\u2019s been a shift, and people now need to know, deserve to know: \u2018Where does this all come from?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rossi said. \u201c\u2018How did you get my name?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yelp Can\u2019t Be Ordered to Remove Negative Posts, California Court Rules", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe California Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Yelp, the local search and reviews site, did not need to remove negative comments posted by a user, in a case closely watched by the industry for its implications for online free speech.In a 4-to-3 opinion, the court said that federal law protected internet companies from liability for statements written by others. The decision to remove posts is at the company\u2019s discretion, the court said.The role of moderating speech on online platforms has become a hotly contested topic, as the reach and influence of companies like Facebook and Google have grown. But the companies have long argued that the companies are not liable for posts published by others on their platform.The case concerned a San Francisco lawyer, Dawn Hassell, who had accused a client of posting defamatory statements against her on Yelp. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled that the posts were defamatory and instructed the client and Yelp to take them down.The order was upheld by both a second judge and a state appeals court.Yelp argued that the lower court decisions could provide a legal pathway for businesses seeking to have negative posts removed. The company also referred to the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 federal law that protects internet companies from liability for third party users\u2019 posts.The act, the ruling said, is meant \u201cto promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material.\u201dHowever, opponents argued that this free speech approach could prevent victims of online abuse from seeking a legal remedy.Ms. Hassell\u2019s lawyer, Monique Olivier, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cstands as an invitation to spread falsehoods on the internet without consequence\u201d and that Ms. Hassell was considering an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.Dissenting justices argued that because Yelp was inviting its users to post and read reviews, the company could be held complicit in users\u2019 refusal to remove posts.\u201cThe internet has the potential not only to enlighten but to spread lies, amplifying defamatory communications to an extent unmatched in our history,\u201d Justice Mariano-Florentino Cu\u00e9llar wrote.Aaron Schur, a lawyer for Yelp, said that the company examined the reviews about Ms. Hassell\u2019s business and did not find them to be libelous.\u201cAlso at risk are the separate speech rights of individuals that use online resources,\u201d Mr. Schur said, \u201csuch as those that post comments on news articles or consumers who choose to describe their business experiences online, which may be squelched through manipulations of our judicial system.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a lower court action in the case brought by Dawn Hassell. A San Francisco Superior Court judge ordered one of Ms. Hassell\u2019s clients and Yelp to remove a post from the site.

{"Headline": "Mushrooms, Magma and Love in a Time of Science", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewBack then the humanities (classics and philosophy, especially) were understood as masculine academic pursuits. It was the more genteel disciplines of natural science, astronomy, chemistry, botany and anatomy, to which women of a certain class gravitated.Orra White Hitchcock (1796-1863) was one of the most remarkable women from this more egalitarian age of scientific study. She had a deep knowledge of botany, zoology and paleontology, and she was also an artist \u2014 though that \u201calso\u201d would have seemed unnecessary to her. She produced two albums of botanical illustrations, and later, as introductory materials for her husband\u2019s classes, she diagramed volcanoes, sketched the skeletons of extinct fish and mammals, and drew undulant squids and octopuses on large cotton sheets.This show, organized by the museum\u2019s chief curator, Stacy C. Hollander, proves Hitchcock to be an artificer as much as an observer, imagining dramatic new ways to express the world\u2019s beauty and, as she saw it, its sacred order. It also demands we drop some of our contemporary assumptions about academic disciplines, to understand an age when \u201cscience\u201d was not so rigidly delimited, and stretched beyond the natural world to encompass theology and art.Orra White was born to a family of wealthy farmers in Amherst, Mass., the only daughter who survived infancy. She exhibited a particular talent for science and mathematics \u2014 one of the earliest documents here is a ledger of logarithms, meant for determining syzygies of the moon and sun, that she worked out at age 14. But she also had an aptitude for art and made proficient copies of illustrations in the books she was reading, whether of European royalty or of crazed Romantic lovers wandering through the forest.Before she was out of her teens she was teaching both art and the \u201cexact sciences\u201d at Deerfield Academy, where she encouraged her students to paint in watercolor, to draw maps and to undertake careful studies of flowers and grasses. The principal at Deerfield was Edward Hitchcock \u2014 a serious young geologist-in-training with a melancholy streak, who admired her religious zeal (she had a conversion experience while at Deerfield) as much as her scientific sophistication.The Hitchcocks married in 1821, the same year Edward took up as a Congregationalist pastor in Conway, Mass. That summer, as a kind of honeymoon project, they set themselves the task to document every species of mushroom in the vicinity of their home. Orra\u2019s second book, \u201cFungi Selecti Picti\u201d (\u201cSelected Painted Mushrooms\u201d), featured 100 mycological specimens whose tops she painted with watery inks of gray, brown and amber and whose undersides she detailed with pen. I imagine Edward and Orra setting out after prayers to find some new mushroom, crouching in the Massachusetts moss, holding a fungus up to the clear light of day, he counting the gills while she sketched the shape of its cap. This was love in the time of science.Edward was named professor at Amherst in 1826, teaching chemistry, natural history and geology and later becoming president of the university. For the next 36 years, Orra produced large-scale diagrams and illustrations for Edward\u2019s lessons, for which she received neither pay nor fame. Those that survive prove not only the breadth of her scientific knowledge, but also the creativity with which she expressed it.She painted skeletons of a woolly mammoth, its tusks curving inward like loop-de-loops, or else an extinct cousin of the tapir known as a Palaeotherium, which she imagined trotting along with a coat of spotted gray. She drew an octopus, its tentacles tangled above its bulbous head like the roots of an onion; then she imagined a monstrous kraken, gobbling the deck of a three-masted schooner.Orra\u2019s diagrams for Edward\u2019s natural history and geology lessons are almost wholly abstract, and often reduce the natural world to bands of solid color, outlined with lines of black. An illustration of valleys take the form of rolling stripes of mauve, indigo, chartreuse and teal. The core of the earth, in one representation of planetary volcanic activity, is a disc of monochrome peach.When most geological diagrams used color sparingly if at all, Orra embraced a palette of wild variety, chosen through her own scientific expertise. Many could be mistaken as abstract paintings 80 years before the coming of nonobjective art.These freer and less figurative classroom paintings were not shown publicly. It\u2019s therefore tempting to judge them now as undersung \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d \u2014 as Orra\u2019s silent support for Edward, who was the \u201creal\u201d scientist. But that misunderstands just what it meant to have a scientific mind in the years before American science\u2019s professionalization. Science, for both the Hitchcocks, was not a stand-alone academic discipline so much as a pervasive approach to the world at hand, woven entirely into their carnal and spiritual domains.Soon after her death scientists would discover that order is not the natural state of the universe, that entropy is the way of all things. But for Orra White Hitchcock, the discovery and depiction of nature\u2019s workings overlapped seamlessly with all the other parts of her life, and fused with family and church into a single vision of the world\u2019s splendor. Science was another facet for her religious convictions, and another facet, too, of her love.Follow Jason Farago on Twitter: @jsf.Advertisement"}

Ms. Iadarola, 33, was with her parents, Roxy and Anne Fernando, and her 14-month-old daughter, Carmela Iadarola. They came in to pick up a loaf after an errand brought them to the old neighborhood, where Ms. Iadarola grew up.Bread secured, they walked around the small shop, which is tucked into a stretch of strip malls on the North Shore of Staten Island, marveling at how little had changed. Mr. Fernando raised his hand up to just above his hip to show how little his daughter was when they use to come to Alfonso\u2019s. The family was delighted to find the chocolate mousse cake they use to get for Dhanya\u2019s birthdays.\u201cIt\u2019s the same cake,\u201d Ms. Iadarola said.The store almost never existed. When Alfonso Campitiello was growing up near Salerno in southern Italy, his parents put him in seminary, hoping he would become a priest. But he had other plans. Mr. Campitiello escaped three times until his parents finally gave in and allowed him to pursue his dream to be a baker.Alfonso eventually immigrated to the U.S. and honed his skills at the Plaza Hotel, for instance, before opening Alfonso\u2019s on Staten Island in 1970. In 1978, the store moved a few blocks to Victory Boulevard in the Westerleigh neighborhood and has been there ever since.Alfonso\u2019s son Anthony Campitiello, 51, runs the original store as well as an outlet in Cranford, N.J., and his brother, Vincent Campitiello, has another Alfonso\u2019s on Staten Island, about six miles south of the original location. Three of Anthony\u2019s daughters have also joined the operations, helping manage the stores and bake the goods. Alfonso retired to Florida more than 20 years ago, but Anthony said not much has changed.\u201cHe could make his own mixes if he walked in,\u201d Anthony said.There have been a few innovations in Alfonso\u2019s absence. Not long after the advent of the Cronut, the pastry shop experimented with its own hybrid, mashing up the classic Italian rainbow cookie with a doughnut. The result is a confection in three layers, red, green, and white, each stuck together with raspberry jam and dipped in chocolate. Amazingly, it wasn\u2019t an immediate hit.\u201cWe aren\u2019t in Manhattan,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThis is still Staten Island.\u201dBut the cookie/doughnut experiment eventually caught, as foodies made the pilgrimage to Westerleigh and Instagrammed the photogenic treat.\u201cPeople want to eat pretty things,\u201d Angie, one of Anthony\u2019s daughters, said.One such fan is Elvis Duran, host of \u201cElvis Duran and the Morning Show\u201d on Z100, who said he discovered Alfonso\u2019s not long after moving to New York in 1988. Now he gets back there with his fianc\u00e9, Alex Carr, a zookeeper at the Staten Island Zoo, at least a half-dozen times a year. He regularly shares his praise of Alfonso\u2019s on his radio show.\u201cUsually good-looking cakes don\u2019t taste good,\u201d he said. Alfonso\u2019s cakes, he said, were an exception.A lot of the business is still classic Italian sweets like cannoli and sfogliatelli. There is also a brisk cake business with a lot of repeat customers. Alfonso\u2019s does everything from traditional wedding towers to a special-order Day of the Dead cake covered in skulls. Increasingly, gender reveal parties have become popular. With those orders, they sometimes field visits from family members who aren\u2019t interested in waiting for a party to find out the surprise.\u201cI\u2019ve been bribed by future grandmas,\u201d Dianna Campitiello, another of Alfonso\u2019s daughters, said.Most purchases are less high stakes. Ruth Geedeh, 18, came in on a recent afternoon to pick up desserts for her friend\u2019s birthday. She lives about 20 minutes away and has bakeries closer to home, but stumbled onto Alfonso\u2019s when she Googled \u201cbest cakes in Staten Island\u201d for her sister\u2019s graduation a couple of years ago and now comes back regularly. Sometimes very regularly.\u201cI got two cakes today and am coming back for another one tomorrow,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the past two decades, antitrust enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe. Mr. Zingales is a co-host of the podcast Capitalisn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the first time. Just last year the European Commission (the administrative arm of the European Union) fined Google $2.8 billion for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in the search engine market, a charge that the American Federal Trade Commission had dropped a few years earlier. Is this the first salvo in an incoming trade war or a form of tax-thy-neighbor policy? Dangerous, because it will deflect from asking the real important question: Is there something wrong with American antitrust? Perhaps there is a reason Americans are paying so much more for smartphones in the United States than Europeans are. In the old days America was laughing at the \u201cnational champion\u201d strategy pursued by Continental Europe, where domestic consumers\u2019 interest was sacrificed to project local companies into the world. It seems that the table has turned now. The Google fine should not be used to escalate the commercial tension with Europe, but to start a soul searching about the proper level of government intervention to preserve competition in America.

{"Headline": "Google Shrugs Off $5.1 Billion Fine With Another Big Quarter", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 European authorities took their best swing, but it appears that Google hardly felt it.Alphabet\u2019s stock rose 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, and some analysts recommended the company\u2019s shares. With the regulatory issue settled, they said, Google could get back to focusing on selling ads across the internet.\u201cIt\u2019s like a delivery company having to pay for a parking ticket,\u201d Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst, said of the penalty, which Alphabet accounted for in the second quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a meaningful fine in the context of the size of this company.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s previous record fine was also aimed at Google, a $2.7 billion levy it imposed last year for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in its search results. Google booked that charge in the same quarter a year ago \u2014 and still posted a $3.5 billion profit.More substantive than the fine are the changes that will come to the company\u2019s Android software, which backs 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. European authorities ordered Google to stop effectively requiring phone makers in Europe to install Google\u2019s search engine and Chrome internet browser on their devices in order to use the Android software.Such a change could mean fewer people using Google\u2019s search engine on their phones, which would undercut an advertising business that is fueled by users clicking on ads in mobile search results.But it is Google that is responsible for crafting a remedy, and it will have much incentive to propose one that limits the impact on its business. After Google complied with last year\u2019s European Union\u2019s charges related to its shopping service, competitors complained that its solution did little to reduce the harm to their businesses.Google is \u201clooking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said on a call with analysts on Monday.Mr. Pichai said Google planned to appeal the charges, though it still must implement a remedy by mid-October or risk more fines. (The company said it was depositing the fine payment in a holding account while the legal process unfolds.) He said last week that Android lowered prices for consumers and encouraged competition in the smartphone market by helping handset makers compete with Apple. Google has said that it provides Android for free to phone makers and it must recoup its expenses by including its services with the software.Europe\u2019s new data privacy rule, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, appeared to have had little effect on Google\u2019s bottom line. The law, which restricts how companies obtain and handle users\u2019 information, sent many businesses scrambling to comply earlier this year. But some analysts believe Google and its partner in the digital-advertising duopoly, Facebook, stand to benefit from the rules because they can afford to comply while smaller competitors might not.Mr. Wieser said that after reviewing Google\u2019s earnings, the privacy rule \u201cprobably helped, at least in the European numbers.\u201d Alphabet\u2019s revenues rose 26 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East over the same period a year ago, though some of the increase was related to currency fluctuations.Alphabet\u2019s revenues in the quarter increased 26 percent to $32.7 billion as users clicked on more of the ads that Google serves atop its search results and before YouTube videos. Alphabet earned $11.75 a share in the quarter, excluding the fine, easily beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $9.54 a share.Advertisement"}

His administration has imposed stiff tariffs on aluminum and steel imported from European Union companies, and is also considering placing similarly hefty levies on European cars and car parts.The fine, of 4.34 billion euros, was by far the largest ever handed down in Europe for antitrust violations, and was coupled with a demand that Google loosen its grip on its Android mobile operating system or risk further financial penalties.It was the latest move by European regulators to crack down on American technology companies. Officials across the region have pursued tougher rules on data privacy and competition, while also investigating Silicon Valley firms over their tax practices and other matters.

Then her friend got a crush on someone else.Holding it up between us, I said, \u201cDude, you may be a femme. But you are a sloppy one for sure.\u201d She laughed hard, leaning forward and covering her mouth. Then she calmed, suddenly serious, and said, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s you?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant. She said, \u201cWhat if we\u2019re here in five years and we\u2019re it for each other?\u201d \u201cLike, what if in five years we look at each other and realize it\u2019s time to date?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201clike what if in five years it\u2019s you and it\u2019s this friendship and maybe we date other people but at the end of the day it\u2019s you?\u201d I smiled, imagining the two of us older than our mid-20s, still sitting below big trees in rainstorms, laughing and not wanting to get out of the car. She gazed ahead. \u201cI am so terrified of hurting you.\u201d I put down the lipstick and reached for her. \u201cMirah, you are the safest person I have ever loved.\u201dShe put her face in her hands and cried, and all I could see was her thick black hair, her jean jacket with the \u201cfierce love\u201d pin. That night was the first time Mirah and I acknowledged just how much our lives had molded around each other. Neither of us knew how to describe what we were. When someone asked if we were dating, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re in love.\u201dMirah smiled when she heard the story. She made her profile picture the two of us laughing on a bench. One day she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the best when I show up to parties and people ask me where you are.\u201d We spent evenings on my front porch reading articles aloud with titles such as \u201cMarriage Is Murder,\u201d \u201cThe Future of Queer\u201d and \u201cAgainst the Couple Form.\u201d We dreamed about what our lives could look like if we gave ourselves permission to be free from conventions. I was mortified at the thought of absorbing into a couple, and I knew it would be difficult, but I wanted to build a life of commitment where friendships mattered as much as romantic partnership. She emailed me a tweet from someone that said, \u201cThe best decisions I have ever made were made possible by my inability to invest in heterosexual narratives of love. The fact of being queer weirdly saved me from so much loneliness, even as it demographically made intimacy so much harder to find.\u201dI sent back a line of heart-eye emoji, and later, parked below my apartment windows on an early winter evening, Mirah put her arm around my shoulders and said, \u201cSammy, you are my epicenter.\u201dAnd for a while I was. Mirah picked me up for work every morning, I made her lunch on Sundays, and we made a beeline for each other in crowded rooms. She became No. 1 on my speed dial; we talked every day.When I thought I had bedbugs, she was the one I called in a panic. She came over with an acupressure mat, an iPhone tuned to the sound of waves and a flashlight.\u201cI\u2019m anxious,\u201d I said as I lay crying on the floor.\u201cI know,\u201d she said as she stood above me. For the first time I admitted (just to myself, in a whisper) how good it felt to rely on someone. Mirah pried me open and slowly I trusted she would be there, every time, solid. I started picturing my life with her always in it. Whatever shape our relationship took \u2014 because we had insisted on the permission to let ourselves change \u2014 I expected the changes would be small and that she would be central. But then Mirah told me about a woman she was going to date. This person wasn\u2019t like the cute queers Mirah had dated during our friendship, all of whom were already dating someone else, or emotionally unavailable, or not nearly astounding enough for her. This was someone Mirah had an actual, genuine crush on. She told me, like a confession, that she wanted romantic partnership, and that she might even want it to be primary, the central thing she builds her life around. And I wanted to shrivel that feeling inside of her until it atrophied and died. But I couldn\u2019t, so I strained to fit her vision of what she wanted.\u201cMaybe we should date,\u201d I said. Couldn\u2019t we make that work? Weren\u2019t we already in love and spending time together and talking every day?She shook her head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to kiss you.\u201dAnd I had to admit that sometimes I imagine her lying next to me, and like a thought experiment I pretend we\u2019re lovers. I picture us laughing, and I brush her hair behind her ear. I hold her hand and count the rings she wears. I feel how small she is, only 5 feet and skinny, and I say, \u201cTell me everything about your day.\u201dShe looks at me with bright eyes, but it stops there. I never kiss her. Just imagining it gives me a tight, wound feeling, and I know we\u2019re not the ones to do that with each other. So I was silent for a long time and then said, \u201cThe question for me, Mirah, is in the event of an apocalypse, whose house are you running to?\u201d The tender part of me that had come to rely on her was screaming. I added in a terrified but certain voice, \u201cI am running to you.\u201dAnd then the woman who had pried me open, who had told me in the same car and under the same windows that I was her epicenter, stared through the windshield and said coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in hierarchies.\u201dIn the days afterward I tried to talk myself out of feeling hurt. I convinced myself I was holding on too tightly, asking too much, being unreasonable. But the truth is I wanted Mirah to turn to me and hold back laughter while she said, \u201cOf course I would run to you,\u201d as if it were the most obvious thing. People tell me, \u201cThis is normal\u201d and, \u201cThis is what happens when friends fall in love.\u201d But I was completely unprepared.But Mirah wasn\u2019t choosing me. Worse, I was going to have to watch her choose someone else. And worse still, I couldn\u2019t rail against her decision because we had promised to let each other change.I almost walked away, as if this all had been an experiment and a terrible mistake. But I couldn\u2019t. Underneath the hurt that she would choose someone else and the embarrassment of having come to rely on her, I didn\u2019t want to give up on radical friendship. And I didn\u2019t want to give up on Mirah. I would have to put her down by saying, \u201cShe gave in to the thing we reviled.\u201d Or put myself down by saying, \u201cMy dreams are impossible, I expect too much.\u201d And none of that felt right. A few weeks after our apocalypse conversation, Mirah and I went to a party together and she cupped her hand around my ear. \u201cI put you as my emergency contact,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere it asked for relationship, I wrote, \u2018family.\u2019\u201dIn that moment, under dimmed lights, I got the same beaming feeling I get every time she chooses me, and I saw that she doesn\u2019t want to lose me, either. But something had shifted, and I didn\u2019t smile. This time, I was the one who sat rigid and stared ahead \u2014 because it wasn\u2019t enough. I was quiet, wondering how it all fit together, and I realized, not with relief but with clarity: Neither of us knows how to do this.Sammy Sass is a graduate student and writer in Boston.Advertisement"}

Since he and two close friends \u2014 none of whom then worked in politics \u2014 led the formal launch of Swing Left in January 2017 with the aim of flipping the House of Representatives to Democratic control in the 2018 midterms, Mr. Todras-Whitehill has quickly acclimated to his newfound prominence in the world of grass-roots politics.Swing Left\u2019s mission of identifying 78 swing districts, 23 of which would have to be flipped in order to return the Democrats to power in the House, has found a receptive audience. The group has more than 400,000 members and has raised more than $9 million in donations so far.\u201cI like the fact that they come from outside politics,\u201d said Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief and Cond\u00e9 Nast creative director, an early supporter of the group. (At one point, another attendee at the St. James event, the actor Mandy Patinkin, whirled around to take a picture of Ms. Wintour on his smartphone.) \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have very good hearts and are super smart, but they\u2019ve been doing it in the same way for a long time.\u201dIn some ways, Swing Left\u2019s strategy is strictly a numbers game. The group did not vet or support specific candidates based on a set of issues. Instead, it decided to raise money earmarked for whoever won the Democratic primaries in targeted districts, keeping the contributions in escrow \u2014 in so-called district funds \u2014 until general election campaigns began. Mr. Todras-Whitehill wondered whether it was even possible to raise money if the group did not know the identities of the candidates it would ultimately support. Swing Left\u2019s lawyers assured him it was.\u201cYou turn the music off and you have a lot of people who had been drinking,\u201d Ms. Lim said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, when the speeches started, \u201ceveryone just listened. I don\u2019t know if it was an \u2018A-Ha\u2019 moment, but people were engaged.\u201d\u201cI felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want to bother people,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sedgwick said. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not really bothering them. I\u2019m passing along something that\u2019s crucially important for the future of our country.\u2019\u201dIn many ways Swing Left is modeled less on a political organization than on a Silicon Valley start-up. Its founders saw a need for a product \u2014 one that allowed people to easily identify their nearest swing district by simply typing in their ZIP code and seeing what nearby races they might want to get involved in.In a glassy conference room inside a midtown WeWork space the day following the St. James gathering, Mr. Todras-Whitehill, 37, asked, \u201cWhat do tech start-ups focus on?\u201d and then answered his own question. \u201cThey focus on having a clean, appealing product that fills the need of the user,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd one of the big innovations is thinking about our user \u2014 our volunteers as we call them \u2014 almost as a customer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s built into our DNA from the very beginning.\u201d (Swing Left identifies districts to target through a variety of factors including 2016 results, polling, past presidential elections and demographic and geographic indicators.)What began as an all-volunteer organization now has 25 full-time staff members, including one who deals with human resources issues. Two of the original founders have since left the organization, and a professional political organizer has been brought on board: Matt Ewing, a former national field director for MoveOn.org, who is now the group\u2019s chief community officer.It goes without saying that it didn\u2019t take much for Mr. Todras-Whitehill and the others from Swing Left to win over the audience. After the event, sitting in the darkened theater, Mr. Roth joked the location and crowd wasn\u2019t just blue, but \u201cnavy blue\u201d bordering on \u201ccerulean.\u201dMr. Todras-Whitehill\u2019s involvement began on the morning of November 9, 2016, in a coffee shop in Amherst, Mass., close to where he now lives. As he thought about the election results the day before, he began to focus on the midterms two years later. He knew there would be little chance of retaking the Senate in 2018, given how few Republican seats would be at risk, and instead turned his attention toward the House.But the 2016 election results made getting involved feel more urgent, and Mr. Todras-Whitehill began looking for his nearest swing district. With some effort he found it. He then wondered why he had to do that much work. Where was the app?And that was the start. Mr. Todras-Whitehill reached out to a high school friend from his Upper West Side childhood, Joshua Krafchin, an entrepreneur, and his wife Miriam Stone, a branding strategist, both now living in the Bay Area. The couple quickly signed on.They thought about potential names, like \u201cAdopt-a-District\u201d and \u201cMake America Blue Again\u201d before settling on \u201cSwing Left.\u201d\u201cIt sounded like a movement,\u201d Mr. Todras-Whitehill said. \u201cAt that moment in time, we needed more than just a tool. We needed a movement.\u201dWith a cadre of a dozen friends from technology, marketing and media, they developed a website to fill a need they saw lacking: An easy apparatus to let people know which nearby congressional seats could possibly change from red to blue, and potential opportunities to make that happen.For instance, let\u2019s say you type in 80203, a ZIP code in the reliably blue enclave of Denver, Colo. What pops up is a map of the neighboring 6th District, anchored by Aurora, currently held by the Republican congressman Mike Coffman, along with the information that while Mr. Coffman \u201cwon this district by only 31,254 votes (8.3 percent)\u201d in 2016, it was also carried by Hillary Clinton that year and thus should be in play for 2018. (Says the site: \u201cDemocrat Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger and tireless advocate for veterans, can flip this critical seat!\u201d)Though some wanted their site, to go up as soon as possible, Ms. Finocchi preached patience. She had gone to college at Columbia University with Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone and saw Swing Left as an opportunity to act on her frustration over the 2016 vote. But, with most of the others, Ms. Finocchi had no experience in politics, having worked mostly in fashion and the arts.\u201cKnowing people were going to be thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Finocchi, said of the inauguration, \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s give people something to talk about the day before.\u2019\u201dThey had initially hoped to sign up 20,000 people by the end of March. Within a matter of days, however, that number had reached 200,000. This came about thanks to Twitter posts by celebrities like Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, and hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook. Roughly 10,000 people offered up their professional skills and expertise as a way of assisting the group. (Swing Left is technically a \u201cHybrid PAC,\u201d an organization that the Center for Responsive Politics, defines as having \u201cthe ability to operate both as a traditional political action committee, contributing funds to a candidate\u2019s committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures.\u201d)The group was something very real now, something that needed shape and structure. Also it didn\u2019t help that two of Swing Left\u2019s founders \u2014 Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone \u2014 had their second child soon after the organization began, forcing them to retreat from full-time leadership roles.Over the next few months, Swing Left began to build upon that initial fervor. On February 12, 2017, the group held a conference call that drew registrations from 17,000 people. The group encouraged the formation of house parties in different districts \u2014 the first round of which generated 700 across the country.But as Swing Left grew, it also had challenges with staffing. The organization could no longer have people exist in a quasi-volunteer role when the demands on their time demanded real salaries. In late March 2017, Swing Left established a \u201cDonate\u201d button on its home page. To date, Swing Left has raised over $9 million, half of which has been designated to candidates via district funds, with the rest allocated for a massive get-out-the vote effort this fall. That includes the funding of full-time staff salaries that range from roughly $4,000 to $10,000 per month.\u201cIt was a relief to feel that we could put aside our other obligations and make this our full-time focus,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cWe\u2019d all been burning the midnight oil because we had other responsibilities. It was great to be able to go back to my family and say, \u2018That thing? Now it\u2019s my job.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Year After White Nationalist Rally, Charlottesville Is in Tug of War Over Its Soul", "Date": "2018-07-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 In the days following the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville last summer, angry residents took over a City Council meeting, screaming and weeping into the microphone. They blamed leaders for failing to stop hordes with guns, swastikas and Confederate flags from descending on the city.\u201cWhy did you think that you could walk in here and do business as usual after what happened?\u201d Nikuyah Walker, one of the activists there that day, bluntly asked the sitting mayor.Today, in a sign of how much has changed since white nationalists rallied here and shocked the nation, Ms. Walker is mayor herself, the city\u2019s first black woman to serve in that role.Instead of uniting the right, the rally\u2019s purported goal, it empowered a leftist political coalition that vows to confront generations of racial and economic injustice. But despite the dramatic overhaul of the city\u2019s leadership, wholesale change has been slow to take hold.The bronze Confederate generals that ignited the rally still sit on horseback in public parks. Activists still demand their removal. A judge still forbids it.The local man who planned the rally still walks around town, scuffling with people who scream \u201cmurderer\u201d when they see him.Ms. Walker, though, faces huge challenges.\u201cShe wants to totally transform the status quo,\u201d said Dave Norris, an early supporter who served as the city\u2019s mayor from 2008 to 2012. \u201cBut what she\u2019s up against is a community that\u2019s rather fond of itself and rather enamored with the status quo.\u201dAfter the rally, residents cried at concerts held to raise money for victims. Store windows displayed cards memorializing Heather Heyer, the woman who died after being struck by the car that barreled into a crowd. The City Council, once divided over the fate of the Confederate statues, voted to shroud the figures in black tarps.But the residents, who united briefly in shock and grief, quickly divided into those who blamed the violence on outsiders who invaded their beloved city, and those who saw the rally as a revelation of the ugly reality of racism within the city itself.At lunchtime at Court Square Tavern, across the street from the courthouse and the park where a statue of Stonewall Jackson stands, patrons trade news about which alleged assailant is coming into court that day.\u201cIt\u2019s people from out of town bringing that negativity to Charlottesville,\u201d said Debbie Weisser, the tavern\u2019s manager. In the group of troublemakers from out of town, she includes anti-racism activists who demanded the statues\u2019 removal, prompting a rally by the Ku Klux Klan in July last year and the Unite the Right event in August.\u201cIn the 28 years that I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve never heard so much talk about those statues,\u201d she said.Despite its self-image as liberal and racially tolerant, few black faces can be spotted in the expensive restaurants or luxury condos downtown, even among the employees, she said. And she noted that the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, Jason Kessler, lives in town and attended the University of Virginia, the largest institution here.\u201cThis notion of \u2018outsiderness\u2019 is interesting,\u201d Dr. Douglas said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come from elsewhere.\u201dMonths before the rally tarnished Charlottesville\u2019s image, Ms. Walker, 38, had announced her bid for City Council with the slogan: \u201cUnmasking the Illusion.\u201d She ran as an independent, a signal that she intended to challenge the establishment Democrats who have run the city for decades.Unlike anyone who had been elected to the Council in decades, Ms. Walker was born and raised in Charlottesville. Not a seasoned politician, Ms. Walker became known for helping low-income residents navigate the city\u2019s bureaucracy. A parks and recreation aide who earns $14.40 an hour, she shamed the city into paying its temporary and seasonal workers a living wage. A former resident of a low-income housing development known as Friendship Court, she went door to door, organizing residents to give them a greater voice in the plan to transform the development into mixed-income housing.Instead of squeezing a few dozen affordable housing units out of developers, she wanted to add thousands. Instead of merely providing \u201cimplicit bias\u201d training for police officers, she wanted an end to \u201cstop and frisk.\u201dThose proposals may have sounded radical before the rally, but to many residents who were soul searching in its aftermath, they made sense. Anti-racism and anti-capitalist activists fired up in the rally\u2019s aftermath hit the streets for Ms. Walker\u2019s campaign. On Election Day, she received more votes than any other candidate.\u201cIt\u2019s hard growing up in Charlottesville, and being black in Charlottesville,\u201d Ms. Walker told the crowd that night. \u201cThere are so many people who are brilliant and talented and they never make it because of the conditions of this city.\u201dIn January, after Ms. Walker was sworn in, four out of five city councilors voted to make her the new mayor, including Michael Signer, the mayor she had excoriated just five months earlier.\u201cI believe that thousands of people would welcome Ms. Walker into this role,\u201d Mr. Signer said.But many in the business community watched Ms. Walker\u2019s ascendance with dread. She had vowed to vote against a $75,000 marketing grant to the downtown business association to help bring tourism back. And she seemed more focused on publicizing the city\u2019s sins than its successes.\u201cIt\u2019s a little unsettling for people who are trying to run businesses,\u201d said Jon Bright, owner of the Spectacle Shop who is also president of the North Downtown Neighborhood Association. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting here with all these people who are screaming and focused on turmoil, and our mayor was one of them.\u201dAnd two busloads of people, white and black and including public housing residents partly funded by the city and wealthy residents who paid their own way, traveled together on a pilgrimage to the lynching museum in Montgomery, Ala., to memorialize a black man who was murdered by a Charlottesville mob in 1898. The group, which included Ms. Walker, brought soil from the site of the lynching. Pilgrimage organizers hope to display a memorial marker in Charlottesville that will help put the Confederate statues in context.But despite these efforts, the town remains divided and struggling to mend. Even the notion of healing itself has become politically fraught, viewed by some as a premature call to return to business as usual.\u201cWe\u2019re not ready to heal yet,\u201d Wes Bellamy, a city councilor who is an ally of Ms. Walker\u2019s, said at a Council meeting last fall, in emotional remarks that ended with him giving the black power salute.These days, Ms. Walker, who declined to be interviewed for this article, talks less about healing the town than she does about uplifting its most vulnerable members. She has tried to give a new Civilian Review Board powers to oversee police conduct and squeeze more money out of the University of Virginia to help low-income residents.But there is only so much that she can do. The position of mayor in Charlottesville is a largely ceremonial and part-time role, with few formal powers. Ms. Walker complained publicly that she was unable to get a response from city housing officials about a 76-year-old woman being evicted from public housing.Activists who helped elect Ms. Walker, meanwhile, continue to dominate City Council meetings, venting their outrage at everything from a community engagement session that they felt was too corporate, to a flier advertising ornamental trees that they viewed as promoting gentrification.At a City Council meeting in May, a mostly white crowd of activists heckled the founder of Charlottesville\u2019s public defender\u2019s office after he appealed for civility. They protested the newly-appointed police chief, RaShall M. Brackney, the first black woman to serve in that role, even though she has the support of Ms. Walker.He didn\u2019t tune in long enough to see a woman injured in the car attack limping to the microphone, her leg still in a brace.\u201cI can\u2019t just leave last summer behind,\u201d said the woman, who is white and identified herself as Star Peterson. She demanded that the city acknowledge the failures of last summer.\u201cWe will not move on so easily,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a promise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Urges Congress to Regulate Use of Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lengthy blog post about the potential uses and abuses of facial recognition, Bradford L. Smith, the company\u2019s president, compared the technology to products like medicines and cars that are highly regulated, and he urged Congress to study it and oversee its use.Tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, and Mr. Smith\u2019s unusual entreaty illustrates how powerful technologies involving artificial intelligence \u2014 including facial recognition \u2014 have set off a contentious battle among tech executives. These technologies have the potential to remake industries. They could also reduce workers\u2019 job prospects or result in unequal opportunities for consumers, leading some to argue that the products are too risky for tech companies to deploy without government oversight.Mr. Smith\u2019s appeal also comes as Silicon Valley is facing withering scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy experts. Several companies have been harshly criticized in recent months for their role in spreading false information during the 2016 election, and exploiting users\u2019 personal data. In response, some businesses, like Facebook, have expressed more openness to regulation of practices like political advertising.With many of its rivals under fire, Microsoft has aggressively tried to position itself as the moral compass of the industry. Company executives have been outspoken about safeguarding users\u2019 privacy as well as warning about the potential discriminatory effects of using automated algorithm to make important decisions like hiring.Now that facial recognition has become a new lightning rod for critics, Microsoft is taking the lead in calling for some regulatory restraint.The powerful technology can be used to identify people in photos or video feeds without their knowledge or permission. Proponents see it as a potentially important tool for identifying criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that the technology could enable mass surveillance, hindering people\u2019s ability to freely attend political protests or go about their day-to-day lives in anonymity.In calling for government oversight of facial recognition, Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of any new state efforts to tightly regulate the technology. Mr. Smith, the company\u2019s president, suggested that governments around the world examine both law enforcement and commercial uses of the technology.\u201cShould law enforcement use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould the law require that companies obtain prior consent before collecting individuals\u2019 images for facial recognition?\u201dIn the European Union, many of these questions have already been settled.Civil liberties and privacy advocates said they both welcomed and felt wary of Microsoft\u2019s push for government regulation, questioning how committed the company was to strong user privacy controls.April Isenhower, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said that the company had long been committed to privacy, including pushing for a national consumer privacy law in the United States since 2005.Tech companies are spreading facial recognition in part because it provides a powerful way for them to connect consumers\u2019 online and real lives.In addition to using facial recognition for its own consumer services, Microsoft \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 also sells the software to others.Mr. Smith wrote in the blog post that Microsoft was examining its own development and marketing of the technology.He also said Microsoft had rejected facial recognition requests from certain customers \u201cwhere we\u2019ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,\u201d and that the company was committed to \u201cestablishing a transparent set of principles\u201d for the technology.Microsoft employees recently protested the company\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that has been involved in the separation of migrant children from their families at the border. In his blog post, Mr. Smith wrote that the company\u2019s contract with that agency \u201cisn\u2019t being used for facial recognition\u201d or to separate families.Ms. Isenhower, the Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about whether the company provided facial recognition services to other government agencies or whether it had put any specific restrictions on its customers\u2019 use of the technology.

{"Headline": "San Francisco Officials to Tech Workers: Buy Your Lunch", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The corporate campuses of the Bay Area\u2019s technology companies have become independent fiefs with dry cleaning, gyms, doctors, shuttle buses and bountiful free meals, made by the best chefs poached from the region\u2019s famous restaurants. Now, local officials are knocking at the gates.And they are coming for the food.Two San Francisco supervisors introduced an ordinance last week that would forbid employee cafeterias in new corporate construction. It is not clear whether the measure will pass, but it is a direct attack on one of the modern tech industry\u2019s most entrenched traditions.The ordinance, which seeks to force tech workers out of their subsidized cafeterias and into neighborhood restaurants, is the latest attempt by San Francisco leaders to make the tech companies that are migrating north from Silicon Valley adapt to life in the city.Though San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors is not expected to consider the cafeteria ban until the fall, local reaction to it has fallen along the city\u2019s typical, pro- and anti-tech fault lines.\u201cThese tech companies have decided to leave their suburban campuses because their employees want to be in the city, and yet the irony is, they come to the city and are creating isolated, walled-off campuses,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor who is co-sponsoring the bill with Ahsha Safa\u00ed. \u201cThis is not against these folks, it\u2019s for them. It\u2019s to integrate them into the community.\u201dMr. Peskin\u2019s ordinance is also aimed at getting more out of a tax deal given to tech companies that would agree to move into a troubled area called Mid-Market. In 2011, the companies were given tax breaks on payroll and stock options with the hope that they would bring jobs and investment to the neighborhood, just a short walk from San Francisco\u2019s City Hall.Within a few years, a number of companies like Twitter, Square and Uber moved into Mid-Market. But despite initial excitement over the opening of a number of restaurants and shops, the neighborhood has not yet flourished the way many had hoped.Open drug use is still common on the streets around Twitter\u2019s headquarters. Some of the big restaurants that moved in have already moved out because they were not drawing enough customers. A few stories up, in a forbidding Art Deco-style building, Twitter employees enjoy free meals in an expansive corporate cafeteria. Tight security on the ground floor keeps the problems of the street away.\u201cWe gave huge tax breaks to revitalize neighborhoods,\u201d Mr. Peskin said. \u201cBut instead, they\u2019re all walled into their tech palaces.\u201dExisting tech kitchens would be grandfathered in under the proposed ordinance, so that anyone who has in-office meals now would keep them. But newcomers would have to learn to eat out or brown bag it.\u201cI\u2019m not taking away anybody\u2019s lunch,\u201d Mr. Peskin said.\u201cThere\u2019s never been anything on the scale of what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d said Ms. Berlin, who wrote a history of the industry called \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered what\u2019s lost in this trend to just constantly stay in your own ecosystem. What are the risks in these siloed monocultures?\u201dTo some tech workers, targeting their free food feels more like scapegoating for the city\u2019s problems than like sound policy. San Francisco had drug and homelessness issues long before Twitter came along. Tech companies cannot be blamed for local policies that have helped to derail new housing construction. And not every computer programmer, they note, is a millionaire.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat,\u201d said James Manning, 43, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories, where in-office meals are heavily subsidized. \u201cThe idea the food doesn\u2019t need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.\u201dAs he talked, Mr. Manning was having lunch (barbecue ribs) on a foray outside his office \u201cas a treat\u201d because he was meeting up with friends.\u201cIt\u2019s the food equivalent of going out for drinks,\u201d he said.Certainly, not all tech companies in San Francisco offer employees free meals. Salesforce, the largest tech employer in the city, does not. And Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame, a start-up that offers free credit scores, said the cafeteria ban could help him compete for workers.\u201cThis could even the playing field a bit,\u201d he said. He said his company had just recruited someone from Google, which is hard because it cannot match the food spread.Katherine Chiao, the co-owner of Kagawa-Ya Udon, a Japanese bistro that shares a building with the Uber and Square offices in Mid-Market, said the corporate cafeterias were making local restaurants \u201cunsustainable.\u201d Workers do not come downstairs to eat, she said.\u201cAll the restaurants that moved in here, we\u2019re just sitting ducks,\u201d Ms. Chiao said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to go down next?\u201dIn the center of Mid-Market, downstairs from Twitter, is a buzzing grocery store and food court called the Market. The food hall includes a poke bar, an organic chicken sandwich counter, a wine bar and a Malaysian restaurant. But it is hard to compete with free.Michael Cohen, the Market\u2019s managing partner, said he visited some of the tech company cafeterias and was shocked to see people not only eating their free lunches \u2014 they were picking up a few things to eat at home.\u201cThey\u2019re grabbing extra fruit, snacks, drinks, right out of the refrigerators,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong grocer, and I saw people shopping.\u201dStill, he offered as a caveat, the bigger issue for him is crime, street chaos and the staggering expense of security (there are several security guards at the door and inside). Recently, someone took off their pants in the store and had to be carried out by a guard, only to come back and urinate on a window.\u201cI\u2019ve operated grocery stores all over the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis environment is the most challenging I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201dSitting outside the Market were two tech workers dressed in layers for the San Francisco summer chill, wearing corporate badges on drawstrings. Free food, they said, was more necessity than luxury.\u201cI\u2019d personally rather have the cash,\u201d said Tim Bellay, 40, a software engineer at Microsoft, which has a local office.\u201cIf I have food upstairs, I\u2019m not going to pay for it, no way,\u201d said K. C. Clawson, 35, who does business analytics for Microsoft. \u201cI\u2019m so cheap.\u201dWhat then do they spend their money on?\u201cRent,\u201d Mr. Bellay said flatly.\u201cRent,\u201d Ms. Clawson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other choice. Even on weekends. You know, I used to go out. I used to go out to restaurants all the time. I used to love it. Now in San Francisco, when I don\u2019t eat at the office, I cook.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Latest Hot E-Commerce Idea in China: The Bargain Bin", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Apple, Gucci, Tesla. Many Chinese shoppers love their top-shelf brands.But another big slice of the population goes gaga for a 40-cent pair of earrings, a $1.50 wireless smartphone charger and 50 rolls of toilet paper for $4.75.These are the shoppers on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app that drew close to 350 million customers in the past year, more than the entire population of the United States. Its parent company is expected to list shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Thursday, just three years into its existence.They live outside the country\u2019s prosperous megacities, in the cities, towns and hamlets that over a billion Chinese call home. They skew older, less internet savvy. And they absolutely cannot resist a bargain, even if the stuff they\u2019re buying isn\u2019t exactly top of the line.In the southern city of Foshan, Li Tianqiang and his wife sell rice noodles and other breakfast food out of a three-wheeled truck to hungry factory workers. Over the past two years, Mr. Li, 45, has bought nearly $1,000 worth of merchandise on Pinduoduo \u2014 the equivalent of around two months\u2019 income for him. Among his purchases: an inflatable paddle boat, a fishing bag and a cherry-red motorized car for his young daughter to drive around.Mr. Li knows he is a little addicted. And regretted purchases? He has a few.Some were made out of curiosity. In other cases, the items were of such lousy quality that he threw them out after they arrived. The toys he has bought for his daughter \u2014 including dolls, a violin and a keyboard \u2014 have been particularly bad, he said.It is all so inexpensive, though, that he said he didn\u2019t mind the occasional misfire.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really,\u201d he said of his spending on the app.For many years, China was a byword for shoddy goods produced at mass scale. But that is changing. Wages are rising, forcing manufacturers to compete on quality. Communist Party leaders want to nurture brands known globally for their innovations. Gadget makers such as Xiaomi and Huawei are investing heavily in design, chasing cool and cachet.To shop on Pinduoduo, however, is to be reminded that many Chinese consumers still check prices first, and that low-end suppliers remain a big part of the country\u2019s economy. The Pinduoduo app\u2019s main page is a bottomless cascade of groceries, fast fashion, household sundries and electronic bric-a-brac \u2014 all carrying wildly improbable price tags.A pair of stretchy, \u201cPlayboy\u201d-brand men\u2019s pants: less than $3. Eleven pounds of rice: $4. A four-pack of boxer briefs printed with an image of a wolf\u2019s head: $2. A purple water kettle with \u201cLOL\u201d written along the bottom: $3. A pink, around-the-neck smartphone stand that lets you lie down and watch videos at the same time: $1. A vibrating electric belt that goes around the midsection and supposedly helps shed fat: $6.Shipping is always free.Pinduoduo wants shoppers to involve their online friends in the process. Group orders receive discounts. New users who persuade others to sign up are rewarded with one of a selection of free purchases. Tiny pop-ups within the app provide relentless, real-time updates on what others are buying, creating a sense of urgency. Everyone is getting great deals and you are not.Between the deliriously strange product selection, the next-to-nothing prices, the barrage of coupons and deals, and the ease with which purchases are made, the experience feels less like shopping and more like playing a shopping video game. In regulatory filings, the company calls the app \u201ca combination of Costco and Disneyland.\u201dPinduoduo started operations only in 2015. The app is a platform for merchants to sell products: Sellers pay for their wares to be promoted on the app, and pay a fee for each sale. The company, which is based in Shanghai, has grown swiftly enough to attract powerful backers including the venture firm Sequoia Capital and the Chinese internet giant Tencent. It expects to raise $1.4 billion in this week\u2019s share offering. That would give the company a valuation of more than $20 billion.Because it offers so much cheap stuff, however, Pinduoduo is still way behind its rivals in the total value of goods sold. The company, which is unprofitable, said that its average shopper spent less than $90 on the platform last year. That translates into revenue per shopper of a dollar and change.\u201cThis is the lowest quality of traffic you can get,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. And if older people are driving Pinduoduo\u2019s popularity, Mr. Zhu added, then its prospects for long-term growth are grim by default.His own mother complained to him when two of the nine mangoes she had bought for $1.50 on the app turned up rotten, Mr. Huang told Caijing. Still, he said, she continued to use Pinduoduo. \u201cIf you can buy seven good mangoes for $1.50, you\u2019re not losing out,\u201d he said.For the most part, Kang Xia agrees. Ms. Kang, a 52-year-old retiree in the southwestern city of Chengdu, has used Pinduoduo to buy shoes, clothes, gadgets \u2014 \u201cquite a lot,\u201d she said, although the quality isn\u2019t always great.This spring, she got stung by two bad purchases. First, there was a $5 wardrobe with colorful fabric panels and a \u201creal wood\u201d frame. One touch was all she needed to realize the thing was no good. Then she bought a chiffon skirt with a floral pattern \u2014 less than $6, including a yellow T-shirt to wear with it \u2014 that arrived with a jagged tear down the side.Ms. Kang said she is now less likely to buy things on Pinduoduo solely because they are cheap. But she still looks at the app every day.For the established big shots of Chinese e-commerce, it is unwelcome news that many shoppers will buy very nearly anything if the price is right.To retain customers and avoid regulators\u2019 ire, Alibaba, which served more than 500 million buyers last year, has fought sales of fakes on its Taobao marketplace. The retailer JD.com, which had around 300 million buyers, has courted upmarket brands and cultivated a reputation for reliability.\u201cFrom time to time, there are new players, but the question is whether they can sustain themselves,\u201d Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said at a recent event in San Francisco. \u201cWe are also climbing.\u201dTerry Yao lives in Dandong, a small city in China\u2019s northeast. After looking at some sneakers on Pinduoduo \u2014 pairs that should retail for more than $100 were going for a tiny fraction of that, he said \u2014 he made up his mind about the authenticity of the platform\u2019s products.\u201cChina has developed so much,\u201d said Mr. Yao, 28. \u201cBut if residents of these third- and fourth-tier cities can only use things like Pinduoduo, it feels to some degree like a big failure. We\u2019ve gone backward.\u201dBut Pinduoduo does not have to be stuck in the bargain bin forever, said Tian X. Hou, founder of T. H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. Now that it has used low prices to attract so many users, it can do as Alibaba did and go premium.\u201cOnce you have this trust, you can grow out of the current business and create a new business,\u201d Ms. Hou said.That might turn off the most fervent deal hunters. But it could raise Pinduoduo\u2019s profile among other consumers.Zhang Huajin, 34, a manager at a tech company in Guangzhou, bought an iPhone 7 Plus on Pinduoduo this month. Or he thought he did. What arrived was a smartphone, but it was not made by Apple.Mr. Zhang got his money back, though. And if Pinduoduo improves quality control and helps big brands sell directly on the app, he will probably buy from there again, he said.Taobao managed the transition, he said, and shoppers\u2019 expectations shifted accordingly. On Taobao, Mr. Zhang said, \u201ceverybody already knows what kinds of product should be sold at what price.\u201dZhang Tiantian and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Hate Her. She\u2019s Just the (Subway) Messenger.", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace Notes\u201cO.K., bot,\u201d someone wrote back recently when Haley Dragoo answered him on Twitter, as if Ms. Dragoo\u2019s message had been generated by a robot. She wasted no time setting him straight: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a real person.\u201dIn fact, she is a 26-year-old who once described herself as \u201cfeisty and opinionated.\u201d \u201cI always keep things light and fun,\u201d she wrote in the same biographical sketch, \u201cand love making people laugh.\u201dAt the job she has now, she mostly keeps her opinions to herself. And while she keeps things light, she probably won\u2019t make people laugh.Ms. Dragoo writes alerts that appear on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s websites and on its Twitter feeds, so she often delivers news that ruins people\u2019s days or nights \u2014 when antiquated signals fail; when overcrowded trains spend too much time in stations, holding up trains behind them; when someone pulls an emergency brake cord; when delays cascade across different lines. Starting Monday, her words will appear on a new platform, MYmta, an app that the agency has been testing.One of the top executives with the transit agency \u2014 Veronique Hakim, whose title is managing director and who is Ms. Dragoo\u2019s boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss \u2014 said Ms. Dragoo\u2019s job is to translate \u201csubway speak\u201d into \u201cwhat our customers can understand.\u201d Ms. Dragoo says she also applies another skill to her job: \u201cde-escalating,\u201d which she says involves taking people\u2019s anger at the subway down a notch, or trying to. She serves as an antidote, countering hostile tweets with matter-of-fact information and an unstated message: \u201cWe hear you.\u201dShe says she provides updates that should be provided anyway. \u201cI take the train every day,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on, too.\u201dIt is probably no surprise that passengers accustomed to impersonal and often unintelligible communications on the subway sometimes have trouble believing that anyone at the transit agency is actually reading their tweets. Ms. Dragoo says she sends out 100 to 150 tweets a day in response to individual tweets from passengers \u2014 more when, as she put it, \u201cwe have a lot going on.\u201d Ms. Dragoo\u2019s tweets are posted on the transit agency\u2019s Twitter account for the subways, @NYCTSubway, and she signs the messages that go to individual Twitter users \u201cHKD,\u201d with her middle initial, for Kimberly.MYmta is part of an effort to remake what Ms. Hakim called the agency\u2019s \u201cdigital rails,\u201d its digital infrastructure. Officials say this was one of the big lessons of last summer, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo coined the phrase \u201csummer of hell\u201d to describe the consequences of service changes necessitated by major track repairs at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.\u201cWe knew we had to do stuff on the tracks and in stations,\u201d Ms. Hakim said. \u201cWe also knew we had to change the way we communicate.\u201d She described the transit agency\u2019s web presence as \u201cvery busy, very confusing and doesn\u2019t work well on your mobile device.\u201dShe said that developing MYmta meant changing the culture in an agency with long experience in issuing pronouncements but much less in reacting to feedback.\u201cWhat is the M.T.A. good at? Monologues,\u201d Ms. Hakim said. By contrast, she described the philosophy behind the development of MYmta as: \u201cYou tell me what you\u2019d like, and I\u2019ll see if I can make it work on your device.\u201d\u201cHaving people rate us, that\u2019s new territory for us,\u201d she said.The agency says its social media volume has skyrocketed in the last year, more than doubling every month. But for all the technology behind MYmta, it depends on people \u2014 Ms. Dragoo and 16 others who work in the Rail Control Center in Midtown Manhattan, the high-level hub for the subway system. There are metal detectors at the main entrance and, down an airy corridor, double sets of doors that unlock after an employee holds an identification card up to an electronic reader.Beyond those doors is a room that looks like an election-night television studio \u2014 large, with lots of people who look very busy at lots of desks.At the rail center, there are moments when people talk over chatter on the radios on each desk \u2014 the \u201csix wire,\u201d as the subway radio system is known. Train crews and dispatchers use it, but some high-ranking managers at the command center can jump in.If the six wire is like an old-fashioned party line, the transit agency has added a digital-age equivalent: the messaging program Slack. Transit employees using both Slack and the six wire provide the information Ms. Dragoo and her colleagues rewrite for social media, as was the case last Monday, when this message appeared from a dispatcher:\u201cIncident: Train going out of service (mechanical problems) Queens Bound Z train at Myrtle Avenue. Queens Bound JMZ trains are delayed because of a train going out of service at Myrtle Avenue. Queens Bound trains are running on the local track from Marcy Avenue to Myrtle Avenue.\u201dIn about a minute, Ms. Dragoo typed: \u201cQueens-bound J, M and Z trains are running local from Marcy Av to Myrtle Av because of a train with mechanical problems at Myrtle Av.\u201dThe agency is releasing MYmta after inviting more than 2,000 people to try it out over the past few months. One was Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a transit advocacy group. He said that for once, the agency had been responsive to suggestions.\u201cWe sent them a three- or four-page memo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had the experience until now of sending over a four-page memo saying, \u2018Here\u2019s what you need to fix,\u2019 and having them say, \u2018O.K., why don\u2019t you come in and you can walk us through it.\u2019\u201cAnd lo and behold, in subsequent iterations, there it was,\u201d he said, adding that some of his group\u2019s suggestions had involved accessibility for disabled people and that the agency had subsequently created an accessibility app-within-an-app. \u201cWe thought, that\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he said.Overall, he said MYmta was \u201cnot perfect yet, but it\u2019s good.\u201dSarah M. Kaufman, the assistant director of New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation, also tried out MYmta and called it \u201ca massive improvement over the previous digital properties of the M.T.A.\u201dStill, she said, \u201cthe information can be somewhat masked\u201d \u2014 meaning, she explained, that it sometimes took too many clicks to find what she was looking for. She said it was too intricate for people who needed basic information about the subway, like how or where to buy a MetroCard, or what a ride would cost.At the control center, Ms. Dragoo said the transit agency hired her when she decided to move to New York from California, where she had been a social media specialist. \u201cI interviewed with eight companies, and it was all social media,\u201d she said. \u201cI had applied on the M.T.A. website months before. I had kind of forgotten.\u201cThey said they were making a jump into social media,\u201d Ms. Dragoo recalled.So what was her opinion of the subway? \u201cBefore I started, I had kind of a nonopinion,\u201d she said. \u201cI was not a daily rider, so I had a very rudimentary opinion \u2014 I knew it\u2019s massive, I knew a lot of people used it, I didn\u2019t feel one way or another, to be honest.\u201dAnd now?\u201cI think people think it\u2019s a lot worse than it is, this catastrophic mess all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to put a moratorium on talking about the trains with my boyfriend. We had to say no talking about the trains. He\u2019s part of the public. They just see the bad parts. They don\u2019t see the strides we\u2019re making and how this information that we put out makes a difference. They\u2019re caught up in the negative part.\u201dShe read her message about the Myrtle Avenue delay. She read it again, saying under her breath that she did not want to send out a message with a mistake in it, and then she read it aloud. \u201cO.K., good to go,\u201d she said as she unchecked a box on her computer screen and sent it out. It appeared on the beta version of the new app before it showed up on the website.Ms. Dragoo, who grew up in Connecticut, said she had mastered the subway system on the job.\u201cI thought that would be the hardest thing to learn,\u201d she said. \u201cI picked it up so quick. It\u2019s like learning a language in the country you\u2019re in. When you\u2019re immersed, if you don\u2019t learn, there\u2019s a problem.\u201dNow, she said, \u201cI hear the six wire in my dreams.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade Wars? Three Funds Made Solid Profits Anyway", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter \u2014 as well as over the last five years \u2014 by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.\u201cSemiconductors are China\u2019s largest import, even more than oil,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies.\u201dMs. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances. GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.\u201cCancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., if you get cancer, you\u2019re likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time. In China, 65 percent of treatment is still chemotherapy.\u201dA challenge for an investor in emerging-market small caps is a dearth of the corporate disclosures and market regulation that developed-world investors take for granted. Ms. Hsiao said she compensated by sleuthing.\u201cI\u2019ll interview ex-bosses and ex-co-workers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I visit a factory, I always ask to see the defects. How do they define a defect? If a little scratch qualifies as a defect, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to cheat me on the numbers.\u201dMs. Hsiao\u2019s fund, which has a net expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 2.37 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. For the five years that ended June 30, it returned an annualized average of 14.78 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re usually overweight the U.S. because that\u2019s where the best intellectual property is,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cBut after the Trump victory, we went underweight because stocks went up so much, and emerging markets were in crisis.\u201dMr. Eiswert called himself a \u201ccareful contrarian\u201d about emerging markets and said he waited for crises to buy companies he liked.The fund\u2019s largest emerging-market bet \u2014 the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant \u2014 is also its largest holding. (Alibaba is based in China but has American depositary receipts that trade in the United States.)\u201cFacebook, Amazon, Google \u2014 there are elements of natural monopoly in those businesses,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s similar with Alibaba. And monopolies are good ways to make money.\u201d Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s holding company, Alphabet, are also top holdings.The fund has a heavy slug of technology stocks \u2014 about a third of its assets, compared with only a fifth for the typical world stock fund tracked by Morningstar. That allocation may reflect Mr. Eiswert\u2019s background: He spent about a decade as a tech analyst and tech fund manager for T.

With video and audio streaming, companies like Netflix and Spotify can offer far cheaper alternatives than the cable TV and purchased music they\u2019re replacing.\u201cThe average American pays something like $125 month for cable,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cNetflix is $12 a month.\u201d That price difference has helped to spur the growth of Netflix, which is one of the fund\u2019s holdings.Mr. Eiswert\u2019s fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.84 percent, returned 3.06 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 16.48 percent over the last five years.It buys mainly real estate investment trusts but can also hold stakes in two of its sibling funds \u2014 DFA Real Estate Securities Portfolio and DFA International Real Estate Securities Portfolio.\u201cWe\u2019re in 22 countries around the world, both developed and emerging,\u201d said Joseph H. Chi, a fund manager and one of the leaders of portfolio management for Dimensional Fund Advisors, the fund\u2019s parent.The fund aims to give investors broad-based exposure to real estate. Dimensional doesn\u2019t make many real estate investments in its other stock mutual funds because many clients already have some exposure through vacation homes and rental properties, Mr. Chi said. Its separate real estate funds let them fine-tune their overall asset allocations.Mr. Chi said this fund didn\u2019t make bets on individual securities, gathering up promising ones and avoiding potential laggards, but rather held a broadly diversified basket of real estate investment trusts \u2014 nearly 450 in all. The holdings are generally weighted by market capitalization \u2014 the larger a REIT\u2019s market cap, the larger its place in the fund.Though the fund is actively managed, it focuses on minimizing costs and generally keeps turnover very low, recently about 2 percent.\u201cTurnover is expensive, so we\u2019re very cost sensitive about how we trade,\u201d Mr. Chi said.The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.24 percent, returned 5.36 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 7.43 percent over the last five years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix, the Stock Market\u2019s Big Hope, Disappoints", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen rising interest rates and trade tensions weighed on the stock market in recent months, investors could always comfort themselves with four words: \u201cThere is always Netflix.\u201dNot on Monday.Netflix disappointed investors with news that it added substantially fewer subscribers in the second quarter than expected. The company\u2019s stock, which had more than doubled this year as the wider market stalled, plunged 14 percent after the close of regular trading.While Netflix\u2019s revenue and profits are still surging, the shortfall in subscriber growth is a reminder that companies priced for perfection can disappoint when optimism seems to be at a peak. And the slip-up will revive skepticism about Netflix\u2019s business model.Netflix had forecast that it would add 1.2 million new United States subscribers in the second quarter, but it signed up only 674,000. Internationally, the company gained 4.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, below Netflix\u2019s expectations for five million. Revenue rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $3.91 billion but was slightly below the total that Wall Street analysts had expected.Netflix is hardly in trouble. Paid subscriptions were still up 26 percent from a year earlier. And in recent quarters, subscriber numbers exceeded Netflix\u2019s projections, so Monday\u2019s disappointment may not amount to much in the scheme of things.Still, the company\u2019s stock shows that Netflix has a lot to live up to. The company\u2019s share price, after Monday\u2019s plunge, is equivalent to 107 times the per-share earnings that analysts expect Netflix to make this year. This price-to-earnings ratio is far higher than it is on the stocks of many other technology companies. Bullish investors may contend that such a ratio is justifiable, given that analysts expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to keep growing quickly. Profits are expected to rise 58 percent this year, and 66 percent next.But the subscriber growth fell short at what could turn out to be a challenging time for Netflix. It\u2019s facing competition from Amazon, Hulu, Google and, perhaps, Apple. The Walt Disney Company is buying much of Fox, in part, to bolster its planned streaming service. And, of course, AT&T has big ambitions for Time Warner, which it is acquiring for its video content. Big hit shows, like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d helped Netflix attract new subscribers. The more companies striving to produce blockbusters, the harder it may become for Netflix to maintain the pace of its subscriber growth.And in a drawn-out fight, in which everyone is spending large sums on programming, investors may find it harder to overlook Netflix\u2019s negative cash flows. The company made $674 million in the first half of this year. But its operations used up $755 million of cash during that period.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mi Amor!\u2019: Tearful Scenes as Immigrant Reunions Begin in New York", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reunions in New York began Tuesday night and continued at a trickle Wednesday morning \u2014 a handful of families whose children were among the youngest of those separated at the border.All the adults were fitted for ankle bracelets, their tether to the federal government. They left for the next stages of their journey, released and headed to relatives\u2019 homes all over the country, with little more than the dirty clothes in which they crossed the border. But they had the most important thing.Denis Rivas was back with Joshua, 4, after not even speaking to him since they were separated a month ago. Maria Guinac was with her three children, too \u2014 the youngest, Gustavo, turned 3 while she was being held in Texas. Javier Garrido was with his 4-year-old, William, who had been taken from him in the middle of the night in Laredo, Tex.A court order had mandated the government to reunify parents with children younger than 5 who had been separated from their families by Tuesday. But in many cases the deadline was missed.But according to a Trump administration official, authorities anticipated that as of early Thursday morning, they will have reunified all children under age 5 who are eligible under the court order for reunification with parents in the United States.Federal workers had labored late into the night to push through reunifications, but still there were glitches. Several parents flown in to detention centers near New York in the days leading up to the deadline had been taken to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, only to have to return to detention at the end of the day \u2014 because their ankle monitors were not working.Some of them were stirred again in the wee hours of Wednesday to return to Federal Plaza, where the three parents finally saw their children later that morning. The children were wearing new, unfamiliar clothes; their hair was combed and they carried backpacks so new that some still had the tags on.They were impassive as their parents embraced them; the tears came slowly. \u201cMi amor!\u201d Celia Del Carmen Delgado cried as she first saw her 3-year-old, Adela, after more than two months. At first, she said, Adela just stared at her.\u201cIt was as if she was remembering me,\u201d Ms. Delgado said.Then the little girl started to cry.An agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement handed each parent a stapled packet with the terms of their release, and left. Lawyers, workers from nonprofits and volunteers sat with the parents, going through the paperwork and helping them make arrangements to join relatives. In one case, a parent\u2019s flight had been paid for with airline points donated by volunteers.As the parents waited for flights and for relatives who were driving in from out of state to pick them up, volunteers arranged for two families to head to a home in Brooklyn to shower, eat and rest. They called other volunteers, asking them to bring fresh changes of clothes, a car seat from Target, and medicine for Adela, who had a nagging cough.Mr. Rivas and his boy Joshua were driven to the airport by a volunteer, who did not wish to give his name. They were bound for North Carolina, their original destination, where they planned to stay with Mr. Rivas\u2019s mother and sister. On the way to the airport, the volunteer bought Mr. Rivas a burger. He vomited; he hadn\u2019t eaten in three days, and said in detention in El Paso, Tex., he had eaten little more than bread.At the airport, Mr. Rivas presented the only documents he had: those given to him that day by ICE, which contained their grainy photographs. But he was told they could fly. Mr. Rivas was told he would receive a pat-down and his belongings \u2014 his son\u2019s yellow duffel bag \u2014 would be inspected.The volunteer who drove Mr. Rivas to the airport handed him $20 for a snack before the flight. As Mr. Rivas waited in a security line, a guard looked down at the boy, who stood by him, looking sleepy, and commented on how cute he was.Elsewhere in the city, at a facility affiliated with the nonprofit Catholic Charities, which was providing legal services for the children, two more fathers held their sons in their arms. Believed to be the first children in New York to have been reunited with their parents, on Tuesday, the 4-year-old boys had been living in the same foster home.One of the men, Javier Garrido, a construction worker from Honduras, broke down in tears as he described being separated from his son in Laredo, Tex. It was 4 a.m., and he and William were asleep in a freezing holding pen known as the \u201cicebox.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden they came asking for the boy. They told me, \u2018He\u2019s going.\u2019\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re taking him? And me?\u201dThe agents took William by force, Mr. Garrido said through tears, and told him the boy would be put up for adoption.Like the other families, he would be joining relatives out of state \u2014 his were in Louisiana \u2014 while lawyers sort out their cases. Both men may have unwittingly agreed to expedited orders of deportation, further complicating their futures, according to Mario Russell, the director of Immigrant and Refugee Services for Catholic Charities.The immediate concerns for the parents, however, now also include figuring out daily life with an ankle monitor. They were still unclear how the technology worked, having to Google instructions on showering and charging the devices.Liz Robbins, Caitlin Dickerson, Mariana Alfaro and Mark Abramson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Was it at a barbecue in Midland, Tex., followed by a first date at a miniature-golf course? Or did she ask a loud neighbor in a Houston apartment building to pipe it down, and he turned out to be the notorious George W. Bush?\u201cI\u2019d wonder whether everything everyone said was true,\u201d Laura dreamily recalls, as if picturing a lovably frat-boyish Prince Charming. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t keep a job. He was an alcoholic, a womanizer, and just generally wild.\u201dThe barbecue was real, but an encounter at the Chateaux Dijon complex sounds so much more fun. It also connects better to the real mystery at the heart of Mr. Allen\u2019s play, which is economically directed by John Vreeke: What the heck did Laura Welch see in the rapscallion she married?When they met, Mr. Bush was a glib, hard-partying intellectual lightweight, making him an unlikely soul mate for a self-described (in the show) \u201cmoderately sexy librarian\u201d whose one vice was smoking. But every time Mrs. Bush speaks of George, her smile softens, her stare gets lost in a romantic haze.A big issue is that while Mr. Allen brings up several of the events that punctuated the Bush administration, including the 2000 election and Sept. 11, he struggles to connect the private and public spheres. The Bushes are also presented as being pretty much ideology-free, which was certainly not the case.But then deep down \u201cLaura Bush Killed a Guy\u201d is not a political satire but a romantic comedy about mutual redemption: \u201cI\u2019m the girl that sadness made,\u201d Mrs. Bush concludes. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s George.\u201d This may be the only time a mention of the 43rd president could elicit an \u201cAwwww.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When a company wants to settle, it needs to \u201creach out immediately after\u201d getting the E.U.\u2019s initial complaint or statement of objections. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in this case and then of course it takes the route that it has now taken,\u201d Vestager said of the settlement talks, which haven\u2019t been previously reported. \u201cSo no surprises.\u201dBanks don\u2019t have to disclose to American regulators their holdings of derivatives housed in certain offshore entities. The critical variable is whether the American parent company is legally on the hook to bail out its foreign subsidiary if it gets into trouble. As long as the answer is no, the foreign entity isn\u2019t subject to the Dodd-Frank requirements.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all appear to use the loophole \u2014 though mostly only for a fraction of their derivatives trading.The automaker\u2019s memo, sent by a global supply manager, described the request as essential to Tesla\u2019s continued operation and characterized it as an investment in the car company to continue the long-term growth between both players.Tesla reportedly requested a \u201cmeaningful\u201d amount of money, though it\u2019s unclear from how many companies.Was that wise?

{"Headline": "Europe and Asia Move to Bolster Global Systems That Trump Has Attacked", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 From trade to regulation to security, America\u2019s traditional allies are accelerating their efforts to buttress a global system that President Trump has seemed prepared to tear down.After months of stunned indecision, they have undertaken a flurry of efforts intended to preserve the rules-based order the United States created after World War II and championed ever since.The most obvious example came on Monday, the same day a stunned world watched Mr. Trump praise President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a competitor after having dismissed Europe as an economic \u201cfoe.\u201d A few thousand miles away, in Beijing, the leaders of the European Union and China held a long-scheduled meeting of their own.In the past, expectations for such meetings were low, given the conflicts on trade and human rights between the Europeans and the Chinese. But while those differences remain, this summit meeting produced an unusual joint declaration and a common commitment to keep the global system strong.The next day, the Europeans traveled to Japan and signed the biggest free-trade agreement in history, just the sort of deal the Trump administration has criticized.Both France and Germany have started study groups on how to deal with the United States under Mr. Trump and how to find areas of leverage, especially on trade. The European Union is preparing whopping tariffs to counter Mr. Trump if he imposes \u201cnational security\u201d tariffs on cars, a big issue for Germany.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, goes to Washington on July 25 to discuss the budding trade war.\u201cThe one thing you could say in Trump\u2019s favor is, he\u2019s brought the world together on trade,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia.\u201cIt\u2019s Trump versus the world,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than all the other countries getting into trade disputes with each other, what\u2019s happening is there is a surprising amount of cooperation and comity.\u201dThere are caveats, of course. The United States remains the world\u2019s leading economic and military power, and the Europeans in particular hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s successor will eventually return to embrace the global system. Europe still harbors considerable ambivalence about getting too close to China, which talks more about open trade than it actually practices.So for now, the Europeans and others are making contingency plans. More than that, the language of pushback against Washington is strong and striking.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the Europeans that both sides should \u201cjoin hands to defend multilateralism and a rules-based free-trade system,\u201d echoing comments he made at Davos in January 2017, before Mr. Trump started imposing tariffs.The European Council president, Donald Tusk, said that \u201cit is the common duty of Europe and China, but also America and Russia, not to destroy this order but to improve it.\u201d That duty is not simply to shun trade wars, he said, \u201cbut to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.\u201dMr. Tusk added: \u201cThere is still time to prevent conflict and chaos.\u201dBut the absence of American participation has for now set off a scramble for alternative partners.The European Union-Japan trade agreement, for instance, was accelerated last year when Mr. Trump abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal President Barack Obama and the Japanese intended as a bulwark against China.The European Union and China are not natural allies on trade. The Europeans, unlike the Trump administration, continue to push China on human rights violations. And in the past two years, in the face of Chinese investment, the Europeans have become much more critical of China\u2019s industrial espionage, its cavalier attitude toward intellectual property and its ambitions to overtake the West in advanced technologies.China has used special summit meetings with European Union members and aspirants, especially those in Central Europe and the Balkans, to push strategic infrastructure investments \u2014 creating obligations and debt that could undermine the bloc\u2019s unity.European businesses have also grown disenchanted with the difficulties of operating in China, particularly rules about data retention and the presence of Communist Party units in workplaces.Still, both the European Union and China have benefited from the rules-based order Mr. Trump has challenged. So, oddly, he has given them reason to bridge their differences. China, in particular, is looking to Europe to help shore up the World Trade Organization so it can fend off a serious trade war with the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats on Chinese exports have alarmed Beijing, said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Beijing is making every effort to avoid publicly escalating its trade dispute with America, the council has said, but it is also rediscovering the merits of greater engagement with Europe. Chinese authorities, in particular, have sought to demonstrate to Europe that economic reforms are coming.Simon Fraser, a former top British diplomat now with the management consultancy Flint Global, said that European trade officials remained frustrated with China.\u201cTrump has a point on China trade, and we want to work with the U.S. on this in the W.T.O., but we can\u2019t because Trump is slapping tariffs on us,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is being pushed into a trade war no one wants, and again Trump has a good idea, but is going about it the wrong way.\u201dWith China muting some of the demands of previous summit meetings \u2014 primarily that Europe grant it \u201cmarket economy\u201d status \u2014 the Europeans found more agreement with Beijing than in the past, while carefully keeping a distance.\u201cThe European Union and China found some common ground at their summit, but even with Trump in the White House, the Europeans are mindful of the alliance with the United States of more than 50 years,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, the former head of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cCommon ground was found without changing sides.\u201dThe Europeans and Chinese also agreed to work on a bilateral investment treaty, another European concession.It was a dramatic change from the summit meeting of a year ago, noted Mr. Leonard. \u201cLast year was particularly grotesque,\u201d he said. \u201cXi Jinping told Davos he was a champion of multilateralism and then refused to sign a joint statement with the European Union unless it granted China market economy status. But now that China finds itself under pressure, it is keen to have a common statement.\u201dChina is taking steps to show it is more open to foreign investment, including approving a $10 billion petrochemicals project by Germany\u2019s BASF that does not require the joint venture structure typical of foreign investment. Ms. Fallon called it a favorable deal \u201csymbolic of the importance to China of Germany,\u201d about which Mr. Trump seems to have a special animus.However unlikely China and the European Union are to form a common front against Washington, both sides showed a willingness to compromise on the communiqu\u00e9 at a time Mr. Trump has waged his attacks.That is also true of the Japan-European Union trade deal, which cuts customs duties on European wine and cheese in exchange for gradually lowered tariffs on Japanese cars.For Japan, the deal represented a clear hedge against Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on Japanese cars, but it also gave Europe the kind of access to Japanese agricultural markets that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have granted to the United States if it had joined.For the European Union, a positive summit with China and a clear statement about cooperation to reform the W.T.O. and against unilateralism \u201cis clearly pointed at the United States,\u201d Ms. Fallon said.\u201cThe Europeans want to show that we have other options \u2014 and the trade deal with Japan is another display that we have other options.\u201dSteven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.

{"Headline": "The \u2018Social Hygiene\u2019 Campaign That Sent Thousands of American Women to Jail", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.One October morning in 1918, an 18-year-old named Nina McCall walked out of the post office in St. Louis, Mich., where she lived with her widowed mother. Waiting for her on the sidewalk was the town\u2019s deputy sheriff, who ordered her to report to the local health officer for a medical exam. Why he singled out McCall we may never know, but the exam left her bleeding, traumatized and outraged. When the officer declared her to be infected with gonorrhea, McCall protested that she had never been intimate with a man. At which point, as Scott Stern writes in his impressively researched book, \u201cThe Trials of Nina McCall,\u201d the doctor \u201cturned on her and thundered, with all the authority of his position and his gender, \u2018Young lady, do you mean to call me a liar?\u2019\u201dStern\u2019s is the first book-length account of the \u201cAmerican Plan,\u201d a government-sponsored \u201csocial hygiene\u201d campaign under which thousands of American women between the early years of the 20th century and the 1960s were forced to undergo gynecological exams, quarantine and detention, all in the name of protecting the country\u2019s citizens from sexually transmitted infections. Stern was a freshman in a lecture course at Yale when his professor mentioned that government efforts to combat sexually transmitted disease had included confining prostitutes to concentration camps. As Stern recounts, he stopped taking notes and turned to Google: \u201cI typed in \u2018concentration camps for prostitutes.\u2019 Nothing. I went to Wikipedia and entered the same search. Nothing. This was strange.\u201dStern, now a law student at Yale, went on to spend years examining records, including administrative notes, century-old news stories and social workers\u2019 field reports. The book he eventually pieced together, which in earlier form earned him an undergraduate thesis award, is startling, disturbing and terrifically readable. Using McCall\u2019s saga as a narrative spine, Stern chronicles the nationwide network of laws and policies targeting prostitutes and any other woman whose alleged sexual activity made her a potential carrier of venereal disease.No proof that a woman was selling sex for pay was required in order to haul her in for testing. Local police and health officials targeted women who in their view acted too flirtatious, enjoyed themselves too much around soldiers or simply worked as waitresses. In one Louisiana town near an Army installation, a woman was forcibly examined because she\u2019d been spotted dining in a restaurant alone. Women of color were rounded up in especially high numbers; Stern cites officials who \u201centhusiastically warned that nonwhite women were less moral, intent on infecting soldiers and that blacks in particular were a \u2018syphilis soaked race.\u2019\u201dOn paper, the laws of the American Plan were gender-neutral, applicable to \u201cany person reasonably suspected by the health officer of being infected with any of the said diseases.\u201d In practice, the laws targeted women, and those judged to be infected were quarantined in jails, converted hospitals and former brothels fitted out with barbed wire-topped walls. Breakouts and rebellions were common: In Los Angeles, women hacked through a fence with a stolen butcher knife; in Seattle, they tied up the guards in sheets and busted through plate glass. \u201cIn one wing of the horribly overcrowded Louisville jail,\u201d Stern writes, \u201cquarantined women staged a riot about once a week.\u201dAmerican authorities didn\u2019t invent the blame-loose-women approach to stamping out venereal disease; they imported it from Europe. In 19th-century Paris, Stern reports, under what was known as the French Plan, prostitutes were made to bare their genitals before health inspectors. Those found to be infected could be jailed and compelled to undergo mercury injections, then the standard, if mostly ineffective, treatment for venereal disease. (\u201cThrobbing pain, kidney damage, inflammation or ulceration of the mouth and terrible skin rashes\u201d were typical side effects, Stern writes.)It wasn\u2019t until the 1940s that doctors understood that penicillin could knock out syphilis and gonorrhea. When Nina McCall was quarantined in 1918 \u2014 bullied into three months inside a Michigan \u201cdetention hospital\u201d \u2014 she was injected with the toxins then still in fashion: mercury and, Stern surmises, remedies based on arsenic. Her teeth loosened. Her hair started falling out. She pleaded to go home. She insisted she\u2019d been falsely suspected of consorting with \u201csoldier boys\u201d; Stern found evidence suggesting that she may never have had a sexually transmitted infection.We know all this now because after McCall was finally allowed to leave, she was sought out by a woman of means who hated the American Plan, had heard about her case and proposed that McCall sue the government for damages. Stern presents an intriguing cast of characters and ratchets up the tension as McCall\u2019s lawsuit materializes: Her benefactress is a Christian Scientist opposed to government-mandated medical treatment; two of the lawyers on either side are bitterly combative rivals. The trial transcripts supply fine courtroom drama, but the story doesn\u2019t end there. McCall lost her case, and Scott relates both her troubled adulthood and the fascinating debates over the American Plan that continued to roil for decades, both inside and outside the legal system.Cynthia Gorney, a professor emerita at the School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, is the author of \u201cArticles of Faith: A Frontline History of the Abortion Wars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Used Apple\u2019s New Controls to Limit a Teenager\u2019s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixEven as people have embraced the smartphone as one of the most powerful tech products, they are keeping a wary eye on the addictiveness of turning on the device to check for social media updates, read websites and play games. Some studies have tied extended screen time to distraction in classrooms, sleep deprivation and depression.First, a primer on how Screen Time works. The feature, which lives inside the iPhone\u2019s settings, shows a dashboard of data about your iPhone use. You can look at your stats for the day or week, including the amount of time you spent on specific apps and on the phone over all. Inside the dashboard, you can create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games. When you run out of time with an app, it locks you out.Over the last three weeks, I studied Sophie\u2019s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on \u2014 Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter \u2014 I placed a few time limits on each of us.Here\u2019s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt \u201ctriggered\u201d (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat.\u201cIt was just a pattern for me \u2014 to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I\u2019m trying not to do that.\u201dBut in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie\u2019s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie\u2019s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself).These early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple\u2019s new software.Here\u2019s a weekly diary on how Screen Time altered our phone use.Sophie and I had a rough start with the experiment because of technical difficulties. Apple\u2019s iOS 12 is still in beta, meaning an unfinished version of the software system is being tested by app developers and early adopters \u2014 and we ran into major bugs.For most of the first week, a bug prevented me from seeing Sophie\u2019s Screen Time statistics. But at the end of the week, after Apple released a software fix, her weekly stats appeared. They revealed that she had used her phone for six hours and seven minutes a day on average over the week. I could also see that Sophie was sometimes sneaking glances at her iPhone past midnight, when she was supposed to be asleep.After I shared the data with my editor, she bombarded Sophie with a flurry of disapproving text messages and fiery emoji.Meanwhile, my stats showed that I had used my phone for three hours and 46 minutes a day on average over the week. The majority of my time was spent using the Twitter app Tweetbot, and a significant amount was wasted playing Zynga Poker.With Screen Time now working properly, I placed limits for both Sophie and myself. For her, I set a 30-minute limit on gaming and a 60-minute limit on social networking. To help her sleep, I also turned on Downtime, a setting that disables most parts of the phone for a set time, from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.I gave myself the same one-hour limit for social networking apps. But instead of setting a limit for games, I opted to nip my Zynga Poker addiction in the bud by deleting the game and kissing my dreams of being a fake-money billionaire goodbye.Even though Sophie was initially incensed about being locked out of Snapchat after an hour, she eventually came around to enjoying the limit.In fact, she asked for more limits. She said she was wasting too much time reading articles on the Safari browser, so she asked for a 90-minute limit there. She also requested that I keep all the limits on until she finished the monthlong summer camp she was just beginning.I happily obliged. \u201cI raised her so well,\u201d I told my editor.As for me, I realized that when I ran into my limit on Twitter, I would find other ways to stay glued to my phone. I caught myself repeatedly checking my bank account and loading the same news sites over and over.Sophie\u2019s progress was remarkable. Mine not so much. By the end of that week, she managed to cut her average phone use to four hours and 44 minutes a day, down 23 percent from the previous week. (I\u2019m sure the trauma from her mother\u2019s outburst of emoji had something to do with it.)My average screen use barely decreased \u2014 to about three and a half hours a day.At the beginning of the third week, phone use continued to steeply decline for Sophie.On some days that week, Sophie\u2019s phone use was lower than mine. On Tuesday afternoon, her screen time dipped to about two and a half hours, whereas mine had already exceeded three hours.At this point, I felt pathetic. (If I were young, I might have said I felt \u201ctriggered.\u201d) I asked myself: What kind of parent am I if I\u2019m more addicted than my teenage daughter to a smartphone? Who would listen to this degenerate?When I shared this revelation with Sophie, she chuckled and replied: \u201cYou use your phone more than me?\u201dSo for the rest of the week, I kept pushing myself to beat her. I logged out of Twitter after each time I used it in the web browser. I stopped checking my bank account, assuring myself that no more money would magically appear.It felt similar to competing with friends on Fitbit to see who could accumulate the most steps \u2014 the only difference here was that I was trying to win by doing less.On Friday, my phone use was one hour and 51 minutes. Sophie\u2019s was three hours and 17 minutes. With a fist pump I exclaimed, \u201cWhat now, Sophie?\u201dYet in the end, my average daily use for the week was three hours and 36 minutes. That\u2019s largely because on the Fourth of July and throughout the weekend I spent a total of eight hours driving \u2014 with Google Maps running on my phone screen. That doesn\u2019t seem as if it should count against my Screen Time since my eyes were mostly on the road.But alas, with Sophie averaging just over three hours a day, I lost fair and square.I checked in with Sophie to ask how she felt after completing the experiment. She said that other than being a bit more focused on homework for her camp, and sleeping with fewer interruptions, she felt about the same.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying having my phone but not being able to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it increases my good habits, though.\u201dShe also made one more request: \u201cCould you add another limit for Netflix?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Gets Left Out of the Urban Tech Boom?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Perry writes about race, structural inequality and urban schools.In the mid-1980s, when I was on my high school\u2019s cross-country team, I used to run along Penn Avenue from my hometown, Wilkinsburg, into the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. I never knew exactly during those days where I entered or exited either city.Buttressed by the nearby Westinghouse Electric complex, Wilkinsburg\u2019s downtown flowed into East Liberty. Wilkinsburg was mixed, about 53 percent black, and the black residents of Wilkinsburg, including my adoptive parents, worked and went to school in both places. You could easily miss the changing color of the street signs from green (Wilkinsburg) to blue (Pittsburgh). The smell from the Nabisco factory, just across the border on the Pittsburgh side, was a better signal. The buttery smell of Ritz crackers welcomed me into the bigger city.The 1990s were especially hard on both Wilkinsburg and East Liberty. Westinghouse laid off thousands of workers. The Nabisco factory closed in 1998. With fewer jobs available, dozens of my classmates sold drugs, ending up addicted, in jail or dead from related violence. I was lucky; I left for college and made a career for myself in other cities.More important, Wilkinsburg is losing people, mostly white. From 1990 to 2010, its population fell to 15,930, from 21,080, and the population changed to more than two-thirds black. Those who remain are more likely to be poor: The poverty rate among Wilkinsburg families rose to 20.9 percent in 2016, from 14.3 percent in 1990. In Wilkinsburg, the largest employer, as it has been for years, is New LifeCare Hospitals, with 260 employees.What makes these two places so different? In Pittsburgh, as in any other city, economic growth is a direct result of strategic investments in leadership, talent and infrastructure. These resources have helped places like East Liberty attract new companies and new jobs. What\u2019s missing in Wilkinsburg is investments in people with real links to black-owned businesses, entrepreneurs and historically black institutions, which cultivate conditions for economic and social growth. Many of the academic institutions and businesses that regularly receive investments in the metro area have no deep ties to black communities. Consequently, those dollars don\u2019t go beyond those social networks.Whether it\u2019s Amazon, Google or their future competitors, as the tech industry pours money into Pittsburgh, it needs to look more closely at where exactly that money is going.It could be going to Wilkinsburg. The town has great infrastructure. It has its own exit off Interstate 376 and great access to public transportation. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Carlow University are a bus ride away. But it has gotten little investment other than a small nonprofit business incubator and a project by the Wilkinsburg Community Development Corporation to raise $6 million for a train station restoration project.Real estate developers have shown some interest in Wilkinsburg, and many residents welcome that interest if it will bring people \u2014 black or white \u2014 back to the town. But if that investment is narrowly focused, there is a danger: It may bring only gentrification and displacement, rather than aiding local businesses.Derrick Tillman, a local developer, is trying to build affordable housing and market-rate housing, but he says he has not been able to break into the funding networks that are helping parts of Pittsburgh. \u201cWe\u2019ve struggled to attract the funds that could catalyze Wilkinsburg because we\u2019re not part of investment capital circles for large-scale projects,\u201d he told me.Wilkinsburg is a proud black city. And I believe it has real potential. For the first time, the mayor is black, the police chief is black and the head of the school district is black. And small businesses are returning to Penn Avenue. This could be the time for Wilkinsburg\u2019s great comeback.Investors and technology companies looking to expand in Pittsburgh and other cities have to do more to make sure that the benefits of their growth are not limited to their own social networks. And legislators must do more to hold tech companies accountable to a social contract built to enhance the quality of life for all of a city\u2019s residents \u2014 not just a tech company\u2019s well-paid employees.Ten years ago, Pittsburgh was no different from the many other industrial cities badly in need of a new identity. At some point, someone made a strong case to investors that certain people and institutions in Pittsburgh should be trusted \u2014 researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and other anchors of the revival. Those individuals and organizations were able to convert that trust into growth. Investors, civic leaders and philanthropists need to extend that trust to everyone.Andre Perry is a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour years ago, Alexandra Van Houtte was a fashion assistant in Paris. She would sit in the back offices of magazines like Grazia, Glamour or international editions of Vogue for countless hours researching and cataloging looks for fashion shoots. The monotony and inefficiency of scrolling for a particular look through sites like Style.com or Women\u2019s Wear Daily \u2014 a chore undertaken by generations of junior assistants and stylists across the globe \u2014 got her thinking about how it could be made better.\u201cFor a multibillion-dollar industry that prided itself on being forward thinking, the whole system was totally hopeless,\u201d said Ms. Van Houtte, 29, who studied Mandarin at college in Britain before starting her career in fashion.When, Ms. Van Houtte wondered, would it be fashion\u2019s turn to develop a transformative platform to make the lives of those doing her job easier?

Even my parents started having their doubts about where the business could go.\u201d\u201cInvesting early on in disruptive ideas is always a big risk, but it\u2019s one I\u2019ve taken many times because you become a co-founder and partner as well as an investor,\u201d said Ms. Busquets, who later introduced Ms. Van Houtte to a secondary major investor, Adrian Cheng of C Ventures. \u201cAlexandra\u2019s business plan immediately made sense to me,\u201d Ms. Busquets said.The business does not have a subscription fee, nor does it have advertising. It generates cash from its roughly 25,000 users (who use the site roughly three times a week) in four ways. There is a consulting arm for brands on digital and social media growth, and a fast-growing shopping component that allows for purchase of featured looks via affiliated links.More meaningful, however, is that smaller labels or those without runway shows can pay a monthly rate to be featured on the database alongside bigger houses, thus thrown into the sightlines of busy editors and stylists. Emerging labels pay around 150 euros (about $175), while more established brands pay 450 euros ($520).\u201cWithin a week of being on Tagwalk, I was getting editorial requests from a different level of industry power player, those inside a bubble that had been so hard to crack before,\u201d said Rosh Mahtani, the founder of Alighieri, a jewelry label sold on Net-a-Porter. \u201cBut the really valuable part of the partnership is data. Insight into what trends people are looking at on Tagwalk, or key words that are consistently popular, has helped me shape my next creative and commercial steps, from how many pieces to produce to what kinds of stones or materials to use.\u201dFor Tagwalk, mining and selling data analytics is where the real money is. Though the user base is still relatively small, the influence of those who regularly visit the site is big, making access to their behavioral habits extremely valuable to those who want to better understand them. Nearly all of the biggest brands in the industry are keen to know which shows got the most searches for the fall 2018 season. According to Tagwalk, the top three in New York were Calvin Klein, Phillip Lim and Bottega Veneta, while in London it was JW Anderson, Erdem and Christopher Kane. In Milan, Gucci ran ahead of the competition (followed by Dolce & Gabbana and Prada); in Paris, Dior came in ahead (barely) of Chanel, then Saint Laurent.\u201cWe can immediately see, and tell a brand, which looks are the most searched for, by whom and in which countries, as well as how a brand\u2019s collection has fared compared to other brands overall,\u201d Ms. Van Houtte said.\u201cWe think it\u2019s a simple idea but with revolutionary potential,\u201d she added with a grin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wages Are Rising in Europe. But Economists Are Puzzled.", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie \u2014 at least in Europe. Just don\u2019t ask why, or whether it will last.In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track.Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged.The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe.\u201cThis is one of the big economic questions of our time,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London.Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens\u2019 paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth.When official data last month showed that hourly wages in the eurozone rose 2 percent in the first three months of 2018 \u2014 finally \u2014 the central bank got the signal it was looking for. It announced it would end its main stimulus measure at the end of the year. At a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council on Thursday, that plan was reaffirmed.And because officials don\u2019t know for sure why wage growth recovered in the region, they can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s sustainable. Japan has seen surges in wage growth that quickly sputtered.Back in simpler days, falling unemployment usually led to higher wages. Employers had to compete harder for workers, and paychecks rose across the board. Inflation also went up, at least temporarily, as businesses passed on the higher cost of labor to customers.But in recent years the relationship between growth, wages and inflation has become much harder to understand. Economists have devoted enormous energy trying to explain why inflation and wages remained stuck in neutral even as unemployment in countries like Germany fell to record lows.Economists there offered numerous theories to explain the phenomenon. The decline of unions has taken away employees\u2019 bargaining power, some said. Globalization, outsourcing, and the easy flow of money and information across borders have also forced workers in wealthy countries to compete with those in poorer ones.Another suggestion is that the rise of companies like Apple, Google and Amazon has concentrated power in fewer companies and squelched competition. And the so-called sharing economy, exemplified by Uber or Airbnb, has made many people into freelancers with few benefits.Flat wage growth in Germany during the last two decades coincided with reforms that allowed companies to opt out of collective bargaining agreements, weakening union power. In France, where union agreements applied to whole industries and were binding for companies, wages continued to climb and inequality was less pronounced.But France paid a price. While unemployment fell below 4 percent in Germany, it remains above 9 percent in France. The implication is that companies may not hire as much if they are locked into union wage contracts.Professor Sch\u00f6nberg pointed out that pay in Germany has begun rising again, suggesting that the effect of reforms was temporary. At a certain point, low unemployment does still seem to lead to higher wages. It just may take longer than it used to.That is no doubt what the European Central Bank is counting on. Wages are a key issue for the bank because, by law, its job is to keep inflation at or close to 2 percent. It would be hard to believe that inflation is on an upward trend without an accompanying rise in pay.Even after five years of steady economic growth, until recently inflation in the 19-nation euro area remained stubbornly below the official target. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in May and 2 percent in June, but the numbers were not very convincing. The increases were due almost exclusively to a steep rise in energy prices, which fluctuate often.Wage growth \u201cwas the key variable we would look at for convergence of inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in June after a meeting of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council.Still, economists are far away from any consensus on why wages have taken so long to rise even when companies gripe they can\u2019t find the people they need.Mr. Talavera of Oxford Economics argues that unemployment data does not measure large numbers of workers who have given up looking for jobs. When demand for labor recovers, these people join the work force again, acting as a buffer and preventing labor shortages.This hidden reserve of workers is bigger than economists thought, Mr. Talavera said. But in Europe it appears to have finally been exhausted. \u201cThat is one of the reasons you haven\u2019t seen wage growth picking up substantially,\u201d he said.If he\u2019s right, that should mean that wages will continue to rise.The fact that low wage growth has afflicted virtually every wealthy country, though, suggests that there are deeper forces at work that are not yet fully understood.Aviv Nevo, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, summed up the mood of uncertainty about the dynamics of wages and prices by referring to the idea of the streetlight effect, where researchers look for information only where it is easiest to find, rather than probing further.During a discussion in Sintra, Professor Nevo said, \u201cWe\u2019re all drunks looking under the lamppost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry.The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions?Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences.This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices.One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights \u2014 not unlike splitting AT&T into eight \u201cBaby Bells\u201d nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission\u2019s verdict on Microsoft\u2019s dominant market position in the 2000s.But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants.In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies \u2014 such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence \u2014 to upend existing industries.\u201cOld economy\u201d companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants.Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase.

{"Headline": "Martin Sorrell Is Gone From WPP, but That Doesn\u2019t Mean He\u2019s Gone Quiet", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingMartin Sorrell reigned as one of the most influential leaders in the advertising industry for three decades as the chief executive of the marketing colossus WPP. After he abruptly resigned in April following an investigation into alleged personal misconduct, the normally sharp-tongued, frenetic 73-year-old slipped unexpectedly out of sight.But not for long.Then last week, Mr. Sorrell clashed more directly with his former employer, with both vying to purchase the same Dutch marketing firm.Lawyers for WPP sent a letter to Mr. Sorrell on Tuesday telling him that he was risking his future stock awards, worth millions of dollars, by aiming to buy the Dutch firm, according to a person who reviewed the letter and shared its contents on the condition of anonymity. The letter said that WPP started considering an acquisition of the firm, called MediaMonks, in November 2017. Mr. Sorrell, who was then still running the conglomerate, \u201cwas heavily engaged in this process,\u201d it said, even traveling to the Netherlands to meet with the company\u2019s management team.That would make his separate pursuit an \u201cunlawful diversion of a maturing business opportunity from WPP,\u201d and would most likely breach his confidentiality agreement, which would threaten the stock awards, the letter said.A spokesman for Mr. Sorrell said the claims were inaccurate and represented \u201ca weak and feeble attempt by WPP to destabilize\u201d S4 Capital\u2019s bid for MediaMonks.The scuffle has put a spotlight on Mr. Sorrell\u2019s ambitions after WPP, which he founded in the 1980s, and his efforts to push past his unceremonious exit.\u201cBidding on the same thing as WPP, is that a coincidence \u2014 of all the things in the world?\u201d said Jon Bond, co-chairman of the digital marketing firm Shipyard, who has co-founded and led several agencies and met with Mr. Sorrell over the years. \u201cIt feels like more of an emotional reaction than a thought-out calculated approach because he\u2019s on the rebound. My question is what\u2019s the strategy, and be careful, because revenge is not a strategy.\u201dWPP, where Mr. Sorrell remained a shareholder, declined to comment.\u201cI think WPP expected him to be perhaps toxic and therefore not able to raise capital,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cThey maybe underestimated the degree to which he now has a massive chip on his shoulder and really wants to be able to prove himself.\u201dMediaMonks, when asked about the bids and whether it had discussed the allegations regarding Mr. Sorrell with its clients, said it did not comment on speculation. The digital production company, founded in 2001, has 11 offices globally and about 750 employees that it refers to as \u201cmonks.\u201d It has worked with companies like Lego, Google, Bose and Ikea on creative projects from gaming apps to documentaries.\u201cI still think he will be very successful in attracting agencies,\u201d Greg Paull, a principal at R3, a consulting firm, said of Mr. Sorrell. \u201cHe\u2019s built so much good will in the business, there will be enough entrepreneurs wanting to work with him in a more hands-on structure.\u201dWPP had not publicly made an issue of Mr. Sorrell\u2019s plans until the MediaMonks pursuit. In last week\u2019s letter, lawyers for WPP wrote that Mr. Sorrell was privy to \u201cextensive\u201d confidential information about MediaMonks, which \u201che was only able to acquire through his role at WPP.\u201d It called his subsequent pursuit of the firm \u201can unlawful diversion of a maturing business opportunity.\u201dMr. Bond was skeptical about whether that would serve as much of a deterrent.\u201cI don\u2019t think he cares that much about that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s in his 70s and made enough money that it\u2019s not going to matter. I think that\u2019s probably not as important to him as winning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Instagram Account That Sought Harassment Tales May Be Unmasked", "Date": "2018-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince October, advertisers have been riveted by an anonymous Instagram account called Diet Madison Avenue, which solicited reports of sexual misconduct in the ad industry and published the names of alleged harassers. But now, the account has been deleted and its creators\u2019 names could be made public through a defamation lawsuit brought by a man who claims Diet Madison Avenue posted false allegations about him that cost him his job.The lawsuit was brought in May by Ralph Watson, the former chief creative officer of the Boulder, Colo., office of the Crispin Porter & Bogusky advertising agency. Mr. Watson, 50, said that the agency unfairly dismissed him in February and that he had been unable to find work after Diet Madison Avenue called him a sexual \u201cpredator\u201d and alleged that he had harassed multiple young women he worked with. The account called him an \u201cunrepentant serial predator\u201d and suggested that if Crispin Porter truly supported the #MeToo movement, it would fire him. Mr. Watson was dismissed for cause days later.\u201cMany high-level people in the industry have told him that he will never work again unless he can publicly clear his name,\u201d said Michael Ayotte, a lawyer in Hermosa Beach, Calif., who is representing Mr. Watson. Mr. Ayotte said that there were industry peers who believed that Mr. Watson was innocent but feared there would be a backlash if they hired him, including the risk of \u201cbeing seen as unsympathetic to the #MeToo movement.\u201dMr. Watson filed a separate lawsuit on Friday against Crispin Porter, which is owned by MDC Partners, for wrongful termination and other charges including age discrimination. He claimed that the agency fired him based on Diet Madison Avenue\u2019s posts without conducting a proper investigation, specifying claims against him or naming his accusers.In a joint statement with MDC, Crispin Porter said that it stood by its decision to \u201cterminate Mr. Watson\u2019s employment,\u201d and both companies said they intended to \u201cvigorously defend themselves and their employees\u201d against the lawsuit brought by Mr. Watson.The Diet Madison Avenue suit, filed in Los Angeles, named the account and a string of Jane and John Does, representing dozens of people it believed were associated with the account. Their identities could be revealed if Instagram is subpoenaed and ordered to turn over subscriber information. The court could grant the subpoena depending on how it interprets Mr. Watson\u2019s defamation claim, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland and the author of the book \u201cHate Crimes in Cyberspace.\u201d\u201cWhat the court\u2019s going to do in a searching way, realizing free speech and anonymous speech is on the line, is ask: Is there a real lawsuit here?\u201d she said. If it decides that Mr. Watson has a solid defamation case based on the facts alleged in his complaint, she said, then Instagram could be subpoenaed.Instagram could refuse to comply, but the decision is likely to come down to how the posts were phrased, said Nate Cardozo, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization.\u201cThe situation where Instagram would push back would be if the statements were not actually capable of being defamation,\u201d Mr. Cardozo said. That could include opinions, he said, like: \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of bad things about Ralph Watson and I believe the women who are accusing him.\u201d But, he said, the posts by Diet Madison Avenue stated as fact that Mr. Watson was a predator who \u201ctargeted and groomed women.\u201dMs. Citron said that the lawsuit underscored the risk of creating anonymous forums like Diet Madison Avenue rather than bringing allegations to the news media, civil rights groups or human resources departments.\u201cIf what they\u2019ve written is true, then they\u2019ve got to get a lawyer and defend themselves \u2014 it\u2019s expensive and time-consuming and they may very well not have any liability, but it\u2019s brutal getting there,\u201d she said. \u201cI imagine these folks don\u2019t have a huge amount of resources. They\u2019re already vulnerable as it is, given they\u2019re writing about being harassed, and they\u2019re probably young women at work. I wish they hadn\u2019t done it.\u201dThere are issues for the other side, too.\u201cThis trial is not going to be easy on the plaintiff because he\u2019s going to be deposed and cross-examined and his H.R. history from the first day of his first job ever to now is all going to be exposed,\u201d Mr. Cardozo said. \u201cSo he better be real sure that these are false; otherwise, suing was an absolutely terrible idea.\u201dKat Gordon, the founder of the 3% Movement, which promotes the role of women in creative leadership in advertising, said that she found it implausible that the account \u201cwould concoct something totally fake and that an agency that had knowledge of this employee would just blindly fire him.\u201d Still, she said, \u201cif you are going to lose your job, you are entitled to know what was said about you and by whom and have a chance to defend yourself.\u201dThere is also the question of whether messages about harassment that were sent to the account could be exposed through the lawsuit. Private parties cannot obtain such content from Instagram by law, Mr. Cardozo said, but lawyers could try to get the court to order Diet Madison Avenue to turn over that content. If the group refused to comply, then they could be held in contempt, he said.Emma Llans\u00f3, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said the case was an interesting example of \u201cthe roles these tech companies play in facilitating people\u2019s speech.\u201d The decision that the court will make will be challenging, she said.\u201cThe reason that people are making these sorts of accounts anonymously is because of the fear of reprisal that they face \u2014 that\u2019s a key part of why we have a First Amendment right to anonymous speech,\u201d Ms. Llans\u00f3 said. \u201cOn the other hand, defamation and untrue statements that are damaging to people\u2019s reputations are also something our laws protect against.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or follow her on Twitter: @sapna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Boxing Taught Me About Love", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveAfter being assaulted in a park, a young woman sought refuge in marriage. When that didn\u2019t work, she stepped into the ring. I was 32 and living in Washington Heights the year I should have fallen in love. Something else happened instead: A man tried to rape me on my way home from work.It was mid-October, and I was walking in a park near the George Washington Bridge. I had been caught off guard by how quickly darkness fell that evening and was already feeling spooked when I caught sight of a man running through the bushes beside the path.Despite the fear, I forced myself to stop and stare, to wait for him to see that I had noticed him.Robbed of the chance to take me by surprise, he had to think of another way to play it. So before he attacked me, he walked beside me for maybe 20 yards, saying, albeit clumsily, some of the most romantic things a man can say to a woman: that I was beautiful, that he wanted to be with me forever, that he wanted to marry me.He also said, mixed in with the romantic stuff, that he knew where I lived, that he had been watching me. We came to the bridge over the railroad tracks. As a train passed under, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die tonight.\u201dThen he grabbed my throat, pushed me against the fencing, forced his tongue into my mouth, pulled at my clothes.He was wrong; that wasn\u2019t my night to die. I drove my thumb deep into his eye, made him let go of me and walked away: bruised, breathless, spitting the taste of him from my mouth. Shaking with fear, I forced myself not to run, because I had learned in self-defense class that running makes you prey.I called the police and they came, but they didn\u2019t find him. I went to my apartment and brushed my teeth, but I never slept there again because the stranger had said he knew where I lived.So I called a guy I had started seeing, Ralph, and moved in with him, more or less, that same night. Within a year, Ralph and I were married. Two years later, we had a daughter.I got married, I now realize, because I was afraid.I brought an immense sense of gratitude and relief with me into marriage, and not only because I was recovering from a traumatic attack. Already, in my mid-30s, I had been scared of ending up alone.Gratitude and fear are strong emotions, but they may not be the right ones to sustain a marriage. Ours lasted five years; the divorce, a bitter one, dragged on for three.During those years, I lost touch with that grateful feeling; I wouldn\u2019t remember it at all if I hadn\u2019t written it down. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful to him,\u201d I had scribbled in the pages of a sketchbook, \u201cfor giving me refuge.\u201dIf I had found those pages during the divorce, I might have thrown them out, denied they ever existed. But I only found them recently, when I came to understand that I\u2019m still facing all the same fears.Now, at 47 \u2014 six years after my divorce \u2014 I\u2019m that much closer to ending up alone. You might say I already have ended up that way. I own my home; I have some semblance of a career; my daughter will soon be a teenager. People have started to ask me why I\u2019m single.I tell them I\u2019m not looking for love anymore, but this is a lie. When I see two lovers kissing or hugging, even onscreen, my heart jumps and begs like a dog to treats. But taking the next step seems beyond me. I\u2019ve begun to wonder if that October night is the reason. Those two events \u2014 being attacked, getting married \u2014 happened so close together that they are perhaps too tangled up in my mind to separate.I\u2019m not the first to notice that romantic comedies sometimes hinge on stalker-ish obsession. I have never been the most trusting person, and now I may be so wary that normal signs of interest read as signs of danger.I don\u2019t watch romantic comedies anymore.I have taken up boxing. My trainer tells me I have a tendency to drop my right hand. \u201cThat leaves you open,\u201d he says, aiming a punch that stops short of my jaw. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be open.\u201dHe\u2019s right: I don\u2019t want to be open. Even so, I start dating, mostly because everyone says I should.\u201cYou have to treat it like a job,\u201d a friend\u2019s father tells me. \u201cMake a spreadsheet.\u201d He found his girlfriend on a dating site.My profile describes me as \u201csweet,\u201d \u201cshy,\u201d \u201ca good listener.\u201d The prevailing wisdom says you need good pictures, which I have. Maybe they\u2019re too good. One man complimented me on my pictures, which was nice of him, but then he started sending me porn. This, it seems, is part of dating online: People send porn.\u201cYou need to make a list,\u201d my friend Lisa says. Lisa found love online after listing the qualities she wanted in a man: passionate, funny, close with his family.I don\u2019t have a list. All I want is what I\u2019ve always wanted, to love someone who loves me back the same way.I think about putting that in my profile, but it sounds too sincere, too unguarded. I am not like that anymore; it would be misleading. And what if I were to put that out there and all I got back was porn?I meet men for drinks but sip club soda. In six months of dating I go to dinner only once, drink alcohol only twice. It isn\u2019t that men don\u2019t want to buy me dinner; they do. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t make myself trust these strangers.I make a rule that I\u2019ll only meet people for coffee, but then a guy shows up high for our coffee date and I rule out coffee dates. It starts to seem, admittedly, like I\u2019m finding excuses not to get invested.By now I\u2019m boxing four mornings a week. In a shift from our typical conversations about keeping up that right hand, my trainer tells me one day that he writes love poetry. He knows I\u2019m a writer; he asks if I\u2019ll read it.\u201cOf course,\u201d I say. But I\u2019m unprepared for what he shows me. For one thing, it\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s about a woman he dated; they\u2019re not together anymore.\u201cDid she read this?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d He shrugs.I sit with the shock of this. I try to imagine showing my ex-husband those sketchbook pages about gratitude. It\u2019s an act of vulnerability that, for me, is past imagining. How is this boxer, the embodiment of toughness, more capable of taking emotional risks than I am?I\u2019m not that strong, not yet. If I learned one thing from marriage, it\u2019s that finding a man to protect me isn\u2019t the answer. I don\u2019t need that anymore; maybe I never did. I protected myself that October night, and if anything, I\u2019m tougher now. But maybe there is another kind of strength I need to learn.\u201cYou should stay with this,\u201d I tell the boxing poet. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201dI get better about keeping my right hand up. I change my online profile, taking out \u201cshy\u201d and \u201csweet.\u201d No one reads that stuff, anyway. Instead, I start using \u201cbloodthirsty,\u201d \u201ccapricious\u201d and \u201ctyrannical.\u201dThe number of swipes doesn\u2019t seem to change. Who are these men who look at pictures and don\u2019t read words?My last profile reads: \u201cVicious and frightening ice queen seeks charismatic, indomitable king. Intense qualification process culminates in a fight to the death with my other suitors. Swipe if u dare!\u201dMen swipe as usual, because, well, why not?Still, I go home one night after a pretty normal date \u2014 with a guy who clearly hadn\u2019t read what I wrote \u2014 and delete everything.It doesn\u2019t feel like a major decision. I don\u2019t think much about it until a friend mentions she\u2019s being recruited for a job at a big online dating site. \u201cThey\u2019re rebranding,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s your user experience been like?\u201d\u201cI stopped doing it,\u201d I say. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t making me feel anything I wanted to feel.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re giving up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201dAnd I\u2019m not. I just don\u2019t want to make spreadsheets and lists. I don\u2019t want to date someone for the sake of dating someone. I want the real thing.Despite everything, I still believe he\u2019s out there. Life isn\u2019t worth living without at least the idea of someone to love. But if he really exists \u2014 my charismatic, indomitable king \u2014 not only will he have to find me, he\u2019ll also have to battle through my defenses.The good news, my love (if you\u2019re reading this), is there isn\u2019t really a fight to the death. That part was a joke.Advertisement"}

Yellow police tape wrapped around the block while broadcast reporters searched for stories to be aired on that night\u2019s news. It was my first time covering a mass shooting, but I was unsettled by how familiar it seemed. It felt like I was on location for a TV show, walking around the different parts of the set, saying \u201cI know this place.\u201d The wretched reality is that we all know this place. The imagery produced in response to mass shootings is so ubiquitous that it has almost become a guideline for how to process this type of American violence: police tape, crime scene, shooter\u2019s home, press conference, candlelight vigil, mourners, flowers, crosses, signs. The cycle is so frequent that it maintains the illusion that these individual shootings are somehow all part of the same event \u2014 that they\u2019re chapters of a long, terrible novel. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much,\u201d a woman said at the home of Jarrod Ramos, the alleged shooter, after honking at me from her car. \u201cI can\u2019t handle it anymore. I know you have your job to do, but my family lives here.\u201dIt was the first time in my career I felt like a vulture. I apologized and told her I wish I didn\u2019t have to be there, then she pointed out that I was standing in Mr. Ramos\u2019 parking spot. She let me take a quick picture. I apologized twice more, then drove away.Now, a week after the shooting, Americans are uncomfortably holding our collective breaths until this happens again. We hope it won\u2019t but we know it will, and once it does we will again mobilize with the swift fortitude of it Just Being the Way Things Are Here. We will make the same pictures, ask the same questions, have the same political arguments, show the same police tape, and wait in our purgatory for it to happen again and again and again.For all eternity, Sisyphus was made to roll a giant boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down when he had nearly reached the top. As Americans, will we keep rolling this boulder back up the mountain every week, every month and every year, forever? As a journalist all I can do is present these days as they unfold, with the honesty, compassion and sensitivity that the treatment of a suffering community requires.

{"Headline": "Russia Was My Obscure Interest. Now Everyone Is Paying Attention.", "Date": "2018-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Gessen was born in Moscow and frequently writes about Russia.For someone like me, who has been writing and thinking about Russia for most of my life, the past few years have made for a strange experience. I read the news like everyone else and am horrified. Then I visit Russia and find myself conflicted and confused.I was born in Moscow in 1975, in what was then the Soviet Union, and came to the United States with my family when I was 6 years old. We moved to the Boston area and lived with some friends from back home, the Moshkeviches. Then, with some help from a local charity, we were able to rent a place of our own.My parents loved Russian culture, Russian literature, Russian films, but they did not like Russia, at least as it was then. They did love America \u2014 for its freedom and its plenty. People we knew told the story of the Soviet immigrant who burst into tears the first time she saw an American supermarket with its mind-boggling abundance. They did not tell the story to laugh at the immigrant; they told it because they felt the same way. How could a place have so many brands of mayonnaise? So many different fruits? So many kids\u2019 cereals?As for me, I wanted to fit in. Month by month, year by year, I shed my Russianness; as Chekhov once said about his serf parentage, I squeezed my Russianness out of myself drop by drop. My parents had left, and that was that. We were Americans now.My mother died of cancer when I was a senior in high school. She was a literary critic who focused on Russian literature and had been in our family the person most attached to Russia. Her death could easily have severed our Russian connection; instead, for me, it did the opposite. I decided as a college freshman to take classes in Russian history and literature as a way of staying connected to her somehow. I was going to do it for a semester and then move on. This was the early 1990s, just after the Soviet Union collapsed; getting a spot in the Russian history and literature seminar was not exactly difficult.But instead of moving on, I stayed. Before I knew it, I was off to Russia for my junior year abroad. As soon as I graduated, I started writing about Russian culture and politics and translating Russian texts.It seemed I had arrived too late. By the time I started publishing on Russia, the Boris Yeltsin era had collapsed in ignominy and Mr. Yeltsin himself had been replaced by a small gray ghoul named Vladimir Putin. Interest in Russia declined, then cratered. For years the only reliable way to sell an article about Russia was to focus on someone who had been killed or arrested, or to find some other creative way of underscoring how evil Mr. Putin was.I remember an editor emailing me in 2009 to ask if there was any truth to the story that Mr. Putin preferred Dostoyevsky to Tolstoy. I was perplexed. A quick Google search revealed that a desperate colleague had, in fact, produced an article about how the Tolstoy estate at Yasnaya Polyana was being neglected, surely the result of some nefarious Putinist plot.That was depressing. It was depressing because the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to thousands of deaths, and it was also depressing because of what Russia would now inevitably become: a pariah among nations, locking itself into Fortress Russia, fearing the world around it.I was depressed, too, by the news coverage in the United States, especially postelection. It almost entirely neglected the long history of American meddling in the internal affairs of many, many countries, including Russia itself. Some of it was perfectly understandable anger at Russia\u2019s role, however marginal, in electing Mr. Trump; but much of the Russia talk threatened to crowd out an examination of all the other reasons Mr. Trump was elected.As for me, as a Russia watcher, it was good for business. At the university where I teach, I got the green light for a new class on Russia, and students even signed up. This would not have happened a few years earlier. So why did I feel so bad about the whole thing?Perhaps it is simply this: Having lived in Russia, I know in my bones how complicated a place it is. Living in Russia is not a nonstop exercise in getting arrested, tortured, shot. People go about their lives. They buy groceries, look at their phones, go on dates, get married. They go to work in the morning, look for parking, try to get to the gym. They tell jokes. And in the meantime, yes, people are getting arrested; some are being tortured; some are being killed.In Moscow last spring, I experienced this cognitive dissonance all over again. I hadn\u2019t been there in a few years, and I was surprised by the changes I saw. There were many more subway stations \u2014 since 2009, the city has opened more than 20 new stations. In that same time, New York, to great fanfare, has opened four. There were numerous new coffee shops, affordable small restaurants and people bustling about. No one would mistake it for Paris, but still, the city would have been barely recognizable to someone transported there from, say, 1998.At the same time, as soon as you turned on the television, there it was: total paranoia about NATO bombers; aggressive, ill-informed arguments about geopolitics; bad movies about World War II. The political atmosphere is poisonous. Mr. Putin is in charge for six more years and has convinced himself and those around him that the country would collapse if he left. Russia has entered another dark period in its history, and there is no end in sight.But if there\u2019s one thing we have learned in the past year and a half of the Trump presidency, it\u2019s that people do not exist in the political atmosphere constantly, or even most of the time. On Facebook and Twitter they may; while watching cable news they do. The rest of the time, though, most of us are able to do other things.That\u2019s not necessarily good \u2014 in times of emergency, it\u2019s bad. But it can\u2019t be an emergency all the time, not even in Mr. Trump\u2019s America, not even in Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia. There are many aspects of Russian life, Russian thought, even Russian politics, that are not under the purview of Vladimir Putin.So what is it like for a longtime Russia watcher? I guess it\u2019s like having your favorite obscure band become famous for some stupid act, like destroying a hotel room \u2014 the hotel room being, in this case, the postwar global order. But I don\u2019t know. I never really had a favorite obscure band. Russia was the closest thing I had to an obscure interest. I was a fan of their early albums \u2014 \u201cLate Socialism,\u201d \u201cPerestroika,\u201d \u201cDeindustrialization\u201d \u2014 but everyone listens to them now.An earlier version of this article gave incorrect information about the number of subway stations that New York has opened since 2009. It is four, not three.Advertisement"}

The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Water Wars of Arizona", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "FeatureAttracted by lax regulations, industrial agriculture has descended on a remote valley, depleting its aquifer \u2014 leaving many residents with no water at all.Supported byA small woman with a tight smile and a bright orange streak in her hair, Lori was immediately unnerved by the sight. Like all homes in the valley, where there are no reservoirs or rivers, the Paups\u2019 house drew its water from a private well drilled into the underlying aquifer. According to the real estate listing, the well reached a depth of more than 300 feet. Lori, who is 51 and a mother of five, reminded herself of this when, a few moments later, the sand appeared to clear and the water again looked normal. Busy with other projects, she scribbled a note to call the previous owners, figuring there was dirt clogged in the kitchen pipes. Soon enough, she forgot about it.A few days later, Lori and her daughter Amy were doing laundry when the washing machine stopped filling with water. Then, a few hours later, the dishwasher conked out, too. Craig, who had serviced his own diesel truck for some 20 years, inspected both machines but couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with either. It was the pipes feeding them that seemed to be the issue; they merely trickled, then sputtered out sand. Having lived in the rural mountains of Pennsylvania, Craig and Lori were both familiar with wells; they picked the house on East Hopi for its sweeping views eastward to the Chiricahua Mountains but also for the solitude that came with owning a remote piece of property, which was only possible so long as they had their own source of water. But as worrisome as the incidents seemed, they didn\u2019t yet form any recognizable pattern. One evening sometime later, Lori drew a bath and left the room. When she returned a while later, she found the tub stood only half full, the water murky with silt. She watched, over the next few moments, as a thin layer of sand settled along the bottom.A local driller arrived for an inspection a short while later. Visible from most rooms in the house, the well consisted of a five-horsepower pump, an eight-inch-wide borehole and a screen that filtered dirt and rock from the aquifer\u2019s water. Although the well was somewhat old, it appeared to be in good working order, the driller explained, capable of pumping 25 gallons a minute, enough to supply a home many times larger than the Paups\u2019. The stoppages and intrusions of sand, he went on, in all likelihood signaled that the water level had begun dipping below the mouth of the pipe, causing the pump to act as a vacuum for sand. The problem wasn\u2019t the well, in other words; it was the aquifer, which had retreated below where the well could reach it.\u201cYou\u2019re running out of water,\u201d Lori recalls the driller telling them. There was no way of knowing how long the remaining water might last.Over the next few weeks, as the Paups asked around, they heard from one neighbor, then a half-dozen more, who had begun finding sand in their water. Soon, at least 100 families from all across the valley had failing or dry wells. On Sept. 24, after scores of angry families demanded action, a regularly scheduled visit from state representatives turned into a de facto emergency water meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. Word of the dry wells had traveled quickly around the state, and Michael J. Lacey, who was then the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (A.D.W.R.), made the three-hour drive from Phoenix for the standing-room-only meeting. The politicians had hardly begun to speak when men and women in cowboy hats grew impatient and cut them off, shouting, \u201cWater!\u201d For the next two hours, Lacey tried to retain control as panicked families rose one after another and told their stories.The Paups didn\u2019t attend the meeting, but they needed only to drive a few miles in any direction to see where their water was going. Stretching outward from downtown Willcox, the hub of the valley, lay a sprawling latticework of recently cultivated farms and nut orchards. Local farmers had watched over the last decade and a half as waves of industrial farms arrived, tilling so much land that dust storms began darkening the sky. These enormous corporations were descending on the valley for the same reason homesteaders had a century ago: the year-round growing season and the lax regulation. Compared with those for rivers and lakes, few laws govern the extraction of groundwater today. Aquifers across the globe are beginning to quietly dry up under the compounded strain of increased food production and a two-decade stretch that now includes the 10 warmest years in recorded history, sending farmers plumbing deeper for deposits of water.At the meeting, residents accused farmers of sucking the water out from under them and the state of shirking its responsibilities. Lacey, the A.D.W.R. official, argued that the state couldn\u2019t put water back into their wells. The only solution for homeowners, the officials explained, was to chase the water downward, by deepening their wells a few hundred feet. The cost of this, residents knew, was $15,000 to $30,000 \u2014 as much as half the value of some homes in the valley.With most of their life savings invested in the home, the Paups couldn\u2019t afford to move or drill deeper, so in early October Lori and Craig held a family meeting, talking with their children about a system of water rationing, as they watched the well\u2019s output dwindle from 100 gallons a day to 50. (The average household in Phoenix uses more than 540.) Showers, they explained, would have to be fewer and faster. They set up buckets to catch runoff and poured leftover dishwater in the toilet. By the end of their fourth month in Arizona, it wasn\u2019t unusual for the Paups to go two or three days without running water. Unthinkable just a few months before, a single thought began to occupy Lori\u2019s waking hours: \u201cWhat happens when we run out?\u201dMost North American aquifers lie beneath the Western United States and date back to the beginning of the continent as we know it. Six million years ago, as the Rocky Mountains thrust upward, rivers gashed deep channels in the crust, separating ranges with basins that gradually filled with eroded rock, trapping water beneath it. One of the largest aquifers in the world, the Ogallala, which runs through eight Plains states, is not a vast subterranean lake, as one might imagine, but a 174,000-square-mile layer of waterlogged earth, moving and twisting through strata of dry rock like a wet article of clothing in the laundry bin. Subject to eons of pressure, every aquifer arranges itself differently, forming vast networks of coves and seams of water, some a thousand feet thick but others just a thin vein. Aquifers are unimaginably complex and incredibly fragile; once tapped, they can take more than 6,000 years to replenish.Among the most vulnerable aquifers are those underlying the desert basins of the American Southwest. The Sulphur Springs Valley, in Arizona\u2019s far southeastern corner, is one such basin. Surrounded on three sides by steep mountain ranges, the valley is an unusually flat and level 1,900-square-mile expanse of sagebrush and tanglegrass, which acts as a massive natural vessel for rain and snowmelt. In geological terms, it is a \u201cclosed basin,\u201d as none of its water rejoins a river. Instead, it pools at the center, percolating into the ground. Centuries of evaporation have transformed this ancient lake bed into a dry alkali flat, inhabited today by a migratory roost of 30,000 sandhill cranes. Beneath it, buried in layers of sediment, lies all the water that never flowed to the ocean. Some of it is more than 20,000 years old.Around the turn of the 20th century, when sulfurous water was discovered bubbling out of the ground, cattle ranches and homesteads began to proliferate across the valley. One of the first deep water wells was drilled around 1915, when Texas farmers began adopting the oil industry\u2019s turbine pump. Overnight, this innovation allowed agriculture to stray deep into arid climates, and in the span of a generation, the valley became home to a thriving agricultural economy. In the late 1990s, during the first few years of what would eventually turn out to be a 19-year-and-counting Arizona drought, only about 15,000 acre-feet of water were estimated to have percolated into the aquifer each year, while 100,000 were being pumped out; as the valley continued to warm throughout the 2000s and 2010s, with rainfall and snowmelt plummeting, estimates for recharge went unrecorded, as annual pumping soared to 200,000 acre feet. Once, it had been possible for ranchers to develop natural springs into watering holes using only a shovel. Now, after watching water levels drop 100 to 300 feet in 35 years, some farmers wondered how long they could go on.Until the last three decades, the technology to make detailed maps of these underground waterways did not readily exist. It wasn\u2019t until 2015, in fact, that NASA published its first comprehensive study of global groundwater reserves. The mission began in 2002, with the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace), two satellites that follow each other in orbit, measuring changes in gravitational pull. The mission\u2019s primary purpose was to look at ice-sheet depletion, but over the next several years Dr. Jay Famiglietti, the senior water scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and his team noticed that many of the most significant sites of water loss were actually below ground. Of the planet\u2019s 37 major aquifer systems, they discovered, 21 were on the verge of collapse. In the Great Plains, farmers had exhausted a third of Ogallala\u2019s potable water in just 30 years. In California, the Central Valley aquifer was showing signs that it could drop beyond human reach by the middle of this century. But the worst declines were in Asia and the Middle East, where some of the planet\u2019s oldest aquifers were already running out of water. \u201cWhile we are so busy worrying about the water that we can see,\u201d Famiglietti told me, \u201cthe water that we can\u2019t see, the groundwater, is quietly disappearing.\u201dIn the United States, it is disappearing most rapidly in the rural agricultural belt extending from Kansas to California. Without ready access to more traditional stores of water, many farmers have been forced to rely even more heavily on groundwater, pitting them against local residents watching their wells go dry. In 2014, in Tulare County, Calif., 7,000 people ran out of drinking water. The next year, wells hit a record low, as 64 percent recorded declines nationwide and one in 30 failed in Western states. Squeezed by drought and tightening regulations, large farms started to seek out lesser-known pockets of cheap water. In rural Arizona, where there are essentially no groundwater regulations governing irrigation, they found an ideal destination. \u201cWhat the smart money is doing is looking around and saying, \u2018Where else can we go where there is no regulation?\u2019\u2009\u201d Robert Glennon, a professor of water law and policy at the University of Arizona and the author of \u201cWater Follies,\u201d told NPR in an interview. \u201cAnd that is Arizona.\u201dArizona was particularly attractive to Middle Eastern farmers. A policy of unregulated pumping on the Arabian Peninsula had, in 40 years, drained aquifers that had taken 20,000 years to form, leaving thousands of acres fallow and forcing Saudi Arabia and others to outsource much of their agricultural production. In 2014, a Saudi Arabian-owned company, the Almarai Corporation, bought 10,000 acres in the town of Vicksburg, northwest of Sulphur Springs Valley, planting alfalfa to ship halfway around the world to feed Saudi cattle. Then, a United Arab Emirates farming corporation, Al Dahra, bought several thousand-acre farms along both sides of the Arizona-California border. These purchases were perfectly legal, but many residents felt these newcomers were essentially \u201cexporting water.\u201d At least once, the Sheriff\u2019s Department in Vicksburg deployed five deputies to stand guard at a town-hall meeting.With less rain and snow reaching the desert floor, overpumping has rendered a semi-renewable resource finite, touching off the kind of resource war perhaps more familiar to coal camps and oil boomtowns. Hydrogeologists use the phrase \u201cgroundwater mining\u201d to describe situations in which the rate of water withdrawal exceeds the rate of replenishment. For some, the metaphor offers a stark lesson. \u201cIf we know we\u2019re mining the water, let\u2019s just say it,\u201d said Richard Searle, when I visited at his ranch outside Willcox. At 63, Searle still cuts a frontiersman\u2019s profile; a cutting-horse competitor and former bank manager, he is descended from a prominent ranching family and formerly served as county supervisor. Part of the reason groundwater mining in the valley hadn\u2019t forced a reckoning earlier, he said, was that water was ubiquitous to the point of being invisible. Local farmers were never required to put meters on their wells, he pointed out, which meant that nobody knew exactly how much water was being pumped, much less how much was left. \u201cLong term, people say we should search for a solution,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t want to be the ones to suffer.\u201dSeated at his desk, Searle reached and opened a glass cabinet, lifting out arrowheads and a stone ax blade that he dug out of his ranch over the last 50 years. \u201cYou know, we weren\u2019t the first ones here in this valley, and we weren\u2019t the first ones struggling with water,\u201d he said. His face turned pensive, and he spoke for a time about the ancient Hohokam and Tohono O\u2019odham tribes, which traversed this part of the Sonoran Desert for thousands of years without digging deep wells. \u201cBut the mining industry isn\u2019t a long-term industry,\u201d he continued. \u201cName me a long-term mining community. Ajo, Pearce \u2014 those are ghost towns. Pecos was like this: a natural resource mined until the town fell apart around it. If we die, it\u2019ll be a slow one. If the whole county dries up, it\u2019ll be just a blip on the radar.\u201dOver the previous decade, the price per pound for pecans and pistachios has roughly doubled, driven largely by demand from China. But those nuts, like almonds, require an exorbitant amount of both water and capital to farm. An average orchard can cost more than $20,000 an acre to clear and raise, in part because the trees don\u2019t bear nuts for five to 12 years. In the valley, where land is a fraction of the price of California\u2019s, the principal cost for nut farmers is water. During sapling years, trees consume only about two acre-feet of water a year but grow to require as much as six acre-feet when mature, among the highest of any crop. To ensure a consistent supply of water from an aquifer already plummeting deeper every year, farmers often drill a well every 160 acres, each to a depth of at least 1,000 or 1,500 feet. One farming conglomerate, expanding from Minnesota, bought or drilled 293 wells, some pumping more than 2,000 gallons a minute.Suddenly, the very qualities of the valley that had nurtured generations of family agriculture \u2014 its cheap ground, its lack of groundwater regulation \u2014 seemed to threaten its existence. In the span of a few months, Intent to Drill notices increased almost fivefold, as Chase Farms and the National Pecan Company, two of the largest pecan growers in the world, bought and consolidated several thousand-acre farms. Soon, tree-nut orchards blanketed about 20,000 acres, forcing the state to put a six-month moratorium on new farms. (Today, there are 35,000 acres of tree nuts in the valley.) The groundwater had created, as local farmer Ted Haas put it, \u201ca gold-rush mentality,\u201d which in the next five years yielded a dozen new vineyards, as well as 20,000 acres of corn and wheat and 16 greenhouses for NatureSweet Tomatoes, the country\u2019s largest producer. As yearly water consumption doubled, the sands and gravels within the aquifer began to shift and collapse, causing the elevation to sink more than 15 feet in places. About 50 miles of earth fissures ruptured the surface of the valley, even splitting a major highway in half.To Seitz, the farmers\u2019 arrival seemed like a blessing at first. \u201cThere\u2019s more outside money moving in, and it\u2019s great for the area,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for the John Deere dealership. I\u2019m in the crop-consulting business \u2014 if I sell product, it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s good for irrigation companies.\u201d But a few weeks after the community meeting, Seitz sent a concerned email to 15 of his clients and business partners. \u201cWe need to get together and figure this water thing out,\u201d he wrote. As more farms arrived and more families lost water, Seitz had come to realize that the boom was \u201cgood for the area on one hand, but we\u2019re still shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d Most of the recipients were, like Seitz, prominent local farmers who owned modest, family-run acreages with long legacies in the valley.Seitz knew the responsibility of preventing further groundwater loss would in all likelihood fall to its greatest perpetrators: farmers. He also knew that to do so they would in all likelihood have to accept what their ancestors had come to this corner of the desert to avoid: regulation. Seitz figured that placing some sort of limit on groundwater use was the only way to stabilize the aquifer. It was also the only way to protect farmers who had been in the valley for generations against industrial-scale operations that could simply pick up and move to other untapped seams of water once the valley\u2019s aquifer was too deep, salty or expensive to draw from. But imposing regulations on corporate farms also meant imposing regulations on friends and neighbors \u2014 and on themselves. If they were going to save the aquifer, the farmers would have to administer policies harming their own livelihoods.When the group first met at the Elks Lodge, pushing card tables together, the mood was somber. Coverage of the valley\u2019s dry wells had fed months of bad press, strengthening the growing perception that agriculture was stealing water from impoverished homeowners. A local petition was circulating, with 500 signatures, demanding a moratorium on agriculture drilling. With the U.S.D.A.\u2019s recent designation of the county as a natural disaster area because of drought and the A.D.W.R. conducting a survey of dry wells in the valley, government action felt imminent. It seemed to Seitz and the others that if they didn\u2019t come up with a solution, one might be imposed on them.Most groundwater rights in Arizona are still based on the frontier legal doctrine of \u201creasonable use,\u201d which holds that a landowner retains the right to pump as much water as he or she pleases, so long as it\u2019s put to a \u201creasonable use\u201d such as farming. In 1980, Arizona became the first state to pass groundwater reform, effectively deeming groundwater a public rather than a private resource. But in the years since, few regulatory safeguards have extended beyond the boundaries of Tucson and Phoenix. Outside those places, little has changed since statehood in 1912: A farmer needed only to file an Intent to Drill notice and pay a $150 permitting fee and was then free to pump as much as desired. For valley farmers, growing high-water crops like alfalfa and nuts, this often meant about 2,000 gallons, roughly the capacity of a tanker truck, every minute, 24 hours a day, with only intermittent breaks for several months. In 2017 alone, one farm pumped 22 billion gallons, nearly double the volume of bottled water sold in the United States annually.For nearly all the men in the room \u2014 white and weather-beaten, in late middle age, having spent several decades on horseback \u2014 the \u201claw of the largest pump\u201d was the only one they had ever known. But no one in the room needed to be reminded of the challenges they faced: a rapidly warming climate, bottomed-out commodity prices and out-of-state funding that could afford to drill more and deeper than they could. Pinned between corporate farms draining the water out from under them and a community blaming them for it, the men began to speak openly of a future where their children could not live in the valley.For the next year, the farmers met monthly for four hours, ironing out a proposal for a \u201cwithdrawal fee\u201d on agricultural wells \u2014 the word \u201ctax,\u201d Seitz says, was carefully avoided \u2014 plus a freeze on large-scale irrigation and a limit on high-water-use crops. In effect, they would create a management zone, protecting the aquifer, and by extension their own farms, from deep water exploration by new and corporate competitors. They had only just begun to finalize the proposal in the early spring of 2015 when word of the closed-door meetings began to spread. Many felt any restriction on water would devalue property and, worse, deal yet another blow to the declining self-rule of rural culture. Townspeople arrived at committee members\u2019 homes at all hours, accusing them of theft.By the spring of 2015, Seitz feared that the longer they deliberated, the more bad blood would be stirred up. In nearby towns, similar disputes over water turned violent. Already, Seitz had lost several customers, and neighbors had begun turning away from him at the grocery store. One morning he awoke to an op-ed in The Arizona Range News accusing another committee member, Mark Cook, of being an outside operator. \u201cI have dug graves, helped bury some 100 old-timers that were homesteaders,\u201d an elderly resident wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t recall any of Mr. Mark Cook\u2019s people in the valley.\u201d (Cook, in response, supplied the newspaper with a list of farms in his family dating back to the 1880s.) In nearby San Simon, calls for a drilling ban provoked several fist fights, some among longtime friends. Farmers felt betrayed to see other farmers, sometimes people they went to high school with, take sides against them. There were even rumors of death threats against those pushing the water proposal.But by late May, the start of the summer growing season, it began to take half a day to eke out five gallons, barely enough to flush the toilet twice. Unable to rely on the well\u2019s outflow, Lori began each morning by filling a bucket for dishes, then placing glasses and bowls under each faucet with the tap open, hoping to catch any residual water. She put stoppers in each drain and set up a gray-water station in the kitchen. \u201cWe don\u2019t use any water until we need it,\u201d Craig told his kids, who were frustrated mainly by the short showers. It had become commonplace by then for some in the family to bathe only once every four or five days and for scarcely long enough to wash their hair. Trying to see how far they could stretch each gallon, Lori and Craig gave their children incentives to come up with novel ways to conserve. At one point, David rigged up an outdoor shower that used bottled water, warming it up by laying a black PVC pipe across a piece of sheet metal in the sun.For Seitz and the farmers, watching families like the Paups suffer was by turns exasperating and motivating. Some felt that embracing the desert lifestyle meant learning its tough lessons \u2014 one of which, as Seitz says, is \u201cyou either drill deeper or you don\u2019t survive.\u201d But others acknowledged that families didn\u2019t have access to the sort of loans and Department of Agriculture support that farmers did. And as summer came to a close, the committee began to think about ways their proposal might assist local families.A few months later, shortly before the next legislative session, Seitz and five other farmers gathered in a basement conference room at the capital, in Phoenix, to present their proposal. Seven of the original 14 committee members decided against making the trip. After weathering months of phone and email attacks, a few of them had bowed out of the committee completely. One of them later told his brother that he would never serve on a board again. \u201cWould you rather arbitrate water use in the Sulphur Springs Valley or peace in Israel?\u201d his brother asked me. Others simply felt there were too many forces already marshaled against them, including the state\u2019s strong agriculture and ranching lobbies.Dressed in jeans and cowboy boots, Seitz explained to several state representatives and lawyers that there was clear evidence the aquifer was at serious risk of failure. Given that climate models offered little hope of restoring the aquifer to \u201csafe yield\u201d \u2014 in which percolated water and withdrawals are roughly even \u2014 the committee instead proposed stabilizing it by limiting water-intensive crops and charging fees for irrigation-related extraction. \u201cIf nothing else, we need to slow the decline,\u201d Seitz said. The fees generated by their proposal would be used to fund aquifer recharge, a process by which water is returned to the aquifer through a vast network of soaking pools. But the fund would also go a step further, Seitz continued, by supplying aid to those families who had lost their water supply, like the Paups.\u201cWe felt sympathy for them,\u201d Seitz later told me. \u201cOn some level, we know we\u2019re responsible.\u201dLeaving the capital, Seitz allowed himself to feel, as he put it, only \u201ccautiously hopeful.\u201d Watching the water war unfold seemed to have made some of the state representatives nervous to intervene, and the cattle and ranching lobbies had each voiced vehement opposition to any change in regulation, however regionally focused. Sensing the bill\u2019s probable failure, the farmers stopped at Texas Roadhouse and over rounds of beers took solace in having tried to remedy things democratically. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a lot of government involvement,\u201d Seitz told me, \u201cbut something like this, on water issues, the government really needs to be involved.\u201d It was the only way to keep neighbors from being pitted against neighbors. A few months later, after the end of the legislative session, Seitz learned the proposal was never drafted into bill form.For the last few years, Bales\u2019s deliveries have been the sole measure of water security for many families in the valley, including the Paups. The 525 gallons that he delivered to them every week or so still required rationing, but the tank\u2019s presence brought the Paups their first semblance of normalcy in years. When we arrived at their house, just past 8 a.m., Bales and David Paup went about filling the tank, along with a new thousand-gallon auxiliary one, with the studied efficiency of routine. As the fear of losing water has subsided for the Paups, a sense of fatalism has settled in its place. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all gone, they\u2019re going to leave,\u201d Craig said, referring to the farmers. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all going to be stuck here with what? Nothing.\u201dAs the Paups entered their fourth year without running water, they were left with a single inescapable problem: their home. Expenses related to hauling water to their house cost them nearly $200 a month, effectively increasing their mortgage payment by 50 percent. Little outlays \u2014 laundromat, bottled water, air-conditioners \u2014 had begun to add up, and Craig had been forced to take monthlong trucking routes on the East Coast. Unable to recoup the four years of equity they had put into the home and unable to move on without it, they felt trapped. With little possibility of selling the house or seeking redress, Lori and Craig had begun talking about abandoning it. They saw dozens of their neighbors walk off their property over the last few years, including a close friend, Billy Frisbee, whose camper caught fire after his well pump combusted from filling with sand. Many of the empty homes lay just a few blocks away, piles of furniture and clothes still visible inside.In March, the Paups received an offer to become the caretakers of a ranch one mile away. The ranch consisted of 11 acres, a mobile home similar to their own and a newly deepened well. All the same, Lori was hesitant. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to go,\u201d she told me. \u201cBecause there\u2019s farming everywhere.\u201d Earlier that month, the largest water user in the valley, Riverview, announced plans to double its local dairy operation, adding another 8,000 cows to its 20,000 acres, some of which nearly bordered the Paups\u2019 potential new home. Looking at the property on Google Earth, hemmed in by bright green crop circles, Lori felt the move might be a gamble. But so, too, was staying. After discussing it as a family, the Paups left the house on East Hopi Drive in late April and moved to the ranch.Before moving, the first thing Lori did was walk into the kitchen to test the water pressure. \u201cIt was nerve-racking,\u201d she told me, when we talked over the phone a few weeks later. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering what might happen when you turn on the sink. What it could mean.\u201d She had been dreading this moment for days. The thought of it paralyzed her. After taking a few moments to collect herself, she opened the tap. Water poured out, crystal clear.For now, the ranch has running water. But the Paups continue to practice much of the same conservation routine as before: using gray water, taking quick showers. As Lori pointed out, their situation remains, at heart, unchanged: awaiting safeguards, as the aquifer retreats quietly beneath them. \u201cI\u2019d like to be somewhere permanent,\u201d Lori said the last time we spoke. \u201cEventually.\u201dIn the midst of the tensions in Willcox, the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, announced the creation of a water-conservation committee, aimed at groundwater security and reform. Even so, this year only two rural groundwater bills have been introduced in the State House. Each proposed, among other things, to lift regulations, in order to make way for a 7,000-home and a 28,000-home development, respectively, just outside the Sulphur Springs Valley. In a promotional video for one, which boasts vineyards and at least one golf course, the developer calls southeastern Arizona \u201cthe best kept secret in the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s important to note that just because an account\u2019s follower count dropped doesn\u2019t mean the user bought fake followers. Suspicious accounts are known to follow some of the most popular accounts to make them look more authentic.\n  101,278,643\n    \n\n  20,163,303\n    \n\n  21,780,123\n    \n\n  20,439,043\n    \n\n  31,852,083\n    \n\n  37,341,300\n    \n\n  29,887,138\n    \n\n  56,168,965\n    \n\n  41,295,834\n    \n\n  24,097,593\n    \n\n  21,693,444\n    \n\n  23,364,619\n    \n\n  27,988,683\n    \n\n  33,428,424\n    \n\n  28,347,867\n    \n\n  76,457,737\n    \n\n  26,389,899\n    \n\n  21,505,919\n    \n\n  58,496,037\n    \n\n  25,718,071\n    \n\n  36,541,926\n    \n\n  33,171,590\n    \n\n  27,174,724\n    \n\n  70,374,040\n    \n\n  27,817,518\n    \n\n  43,998,297\n    \n\n  26,514,461\n    \n\n  64,253,609\n    \n\n  83,252,174\n    \n\n  30,666,523\n    \n\n  32,043,577\n    \n\n  20,173,767\n    \n\n  76,065,731\n    \n\n  106,798,246\n    \n\n  19,585,868\n    \n\n  86,762,098\n    \n\n  104,019,781\n    \n\n  34,401,419\n    \n\n  41,892,776\n    \n\n  50,798,385\n    \n\n  24,057,034\n    \n\n  29,613,130\n    \n\n  18,871,186\n    \n\n  32,305,674\n    \n\n  28,521,782\n    \n\n  27,020,690\n    \n\n  32,896,778\n    \n\n  40,372,081\n    \n\n  55,853,514\n    \n\n  39,371,864\n    \n\n  41,070,397\n    \n\n  50,229,482\n    \n\n  28,561,340\n    \n\n  20,584,218\n    \n\n  56,186,099\n    \n\n  54,000,031\n    \n\n  20,728,755\n    \n\n  27,097,559\n    \n\n  26,478,680\n    \n\n  33,613,042\n    \n\n  45,434,934\n    \n\n  28,822,932\n    \n\n  19,441,883\n    \n\n  39,975,850\n    \n\n  41,594,342\n    \n\n  35,185,850\n    \n\n  25,161,011\n    \n\n  56,818,963\n    \n\n  73,393,455\n    \n\n  30,542,105\n    \n\n  22,741,219\n    \n\n  23,266,823\n    \n\n  22,438,969\n    \n\n  23,336,117\n    \n\n  21,407,431\n    \n\n  37,920,062\n    \n\n  23,298,649\n    \n\n  29,308,730\n    \n\n  19,619,365\n    \n\n  34,477,742\n    \n\n  24,122,658\n    \n\n  23,232,162\n    \n\n  23,060,423\n    \n\n  23,852,753\n    \n\n  40,371,282\n    \n\n  35,732,751\n    \n\n  21,558,732\n    \n\n  33,809,713\n    \n\n  20,120,223\n    \n\n  26,518,166\n    \n\n  27,319,395\n    \n\n  19,284,055\n    \n\n  43,108,699\n    \n\n  23,092,386\n    \n\n  26,556,178\n    \n\n  25,728,294\n    \n\n  22,262,104\n    \n\n  23,513,122\n    \n\n  3,979,290\n    \n\n  367,322\n    \n\n  162,245\n    \n\n  112,398\n    \n\n  448,841\n    \n\n  348,499\n    \n\n  292,694\n    \n\n  214,562\n    \n\n  1,613,953\n    \n\n  133,334\n    \n\n  3,634,981\n    \n\n  103,607\n    \n\n  439,995\n    \n\n  382,540\n    \n\n  2,344,487\n    \n\n  144,692\n    \n\n  1,099,374\n    \n\n  359,769\n    \n\n  126,900\n    \n\n  117,791\n    \n\n  111,016\n    \n\n  351,507\n    \n\n  272,197\n    \n\n  413,545\n    \n\n  208,721\n    \n\n  367,768\n    \n\n  125,145\n    \n\n  236,424\n    \n\n  123,921\n    \n\n  583,019\n    \n\n  139,629\n    \n\n  544,483\n    \n\n  152,634\n    \n\n  155,846\n    \n\n  198,834\n    \n\n  219,551\n    \n\n  3,628,673\n    \n\n  139,992\n    \n\n  391,568\n    \n\n  428,541\n    \n\n  427,791\n    \n\n  216,524\n    \n\n  1,251,543\n    \n\n  401,918\n    \n\n  712,137\n    \n\n  413,270\n    \n\n  195,399\n    \n\n  476,186\n    \n\n  125,934\n    \n\n  177,216\n    \n\n  250,533\n    \n\n  1,003,227\n    \n\n  134,627\n    \n\n  121,910\n    \n\n  1,151,892\n    \n\n  1,458,987\n    \n\n  137,312\n    \n\n  131,992\n    \n\n  369,329\n    \n\n  684,595\n    \n\n  120,426\n    \n\n  7,851,917\n    \n\n  575,488\n    \n\n  178,008\n    \n\n  4,523,250\n    \n\n  485,338\n    \n\n  292,545\n    \n\n  186,823\n    \n\n  956,439\n    \n\n  111,786\n    \n\n  134,903\n    \n\n  811,325\n    \n\n  984,932\n    \n\n  123,201\n    \n\n  1,054,719\n    \n\n  5,040,667\n    \n\n  5,374,019\n    \n\n  5,268,965\n    \n\n  10,635,247\n    \n\n  18,557,710\n    \n\n  2,120,543\n    \n\n  9,231,202\n    \n\n  13,030,766\n    \n\n  1,043,922\n    \n\n  1,080,339\n    \n\n  1,609,500\n    \n\n  6,306,624\n    \n\n  1,381,796\n    \n\n  3,365,005\n    \n\n  2,085,140\n    \n\n  1,523,071\n    \n\n  3,762,179\n    \n\n  17,760,705\n    \n\n  6,969,409\n    \n\n  7,277,810\n    \n\n  1,013,042\n    \n\n  2,622,568\n    \n\n  3,037,852\n    \n\n  1,923,845\n    \n\n  26,556,178\n    \n\n  3,219,299\n    \nBelow are accounts that The Times confirmed were clients of Devumi.

{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m Not the Only Young Conservative\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe sat down with a few attendees to hear what it\u2019s like for them to be red in schools they say are overwhelmingly blue. The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity.Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J.Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I\u2019m not the only young conservative here. It\u2019s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism.What does \u201cconservative\u201d mean to you?I\u2019m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you\u2019re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves.Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier?A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I\u2019m in a class and I share my political opinion, I\u2019m basically the bigot, that\u2019s what I\u2019m called. In my literature class we were reading \u201c1984,\u201d and my teacher compared \u201c1984\u201d to President Trump\u2019s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down.Where do you get your information from?I watch a lot of Fox News. I try to get a lot of news from sources that aren\u2019t controlled by big corporations. Sometimes I get news from the internet. I like Rebel Media \u2014 it\u2019s not controlled by a big company.What have you learned from the summit?It\u2019s making me more confident to go back to school. There are lots of liberals at my school, and I\u2019ll feel less embarrassed about saying what I believe and really standing for it. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, I like that he can\u2019t be controlled. Trump communicates directly with the people. He tells the people exactly what they want, he hears their concerns, and he\u2019ll deal with it.Mason Scioneaux, 18, is from Vacherie, La., and will be a freshman this fall at the University of Mississippi.Why did you come here?A friend and I started a political science group during our junior year of high school. We saw a lack of political interest on both sides. It was the 2016 election, a huge time to voice your political opinions. We\u2019ve been very active in south Louisiana, making connections with local politicians. We saw the opportunity to attend the summit, and the slate of speakers was very impressive.It\u2019s important to be politically open-minded, not necessarily to subscribe to a certain person, whether it\u2019s President Trump or Hillary Clinton. For me, it\u2019s important to listen and decide for myself what I believe to be right and true.What were the political beliefs of your classmates? Our high school was kind of split between conservatives and liberals. Our community was like that, too. The parish my high school is in is very liberal, and the parish I live in is split. It\u2019s an area you can\u2019t really define, between conservative Baton Rouge and more liberal New Orleans. My high school is about 70 percent white. The friend I\u2019m here with is a conservative Latino.I think this generation is now getting more opinionated than any generation before. We\u2019re more politically aware, and it\u2019s definitely because of social media. People go on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and have access to so much direct information, like what President Trump tweeted. They\u2019re not just voting as their parents vote. Young people are being fed information, they don\u2019t have to seek it. On one hand, it\u2019s an era of conservatism aligned with Trump. I\u2019m a Trump supporter, but I\u2019m going to criticize him. You get more moderate conservatives who are more open-minded than others, fiscally conservative but more socially liberal. Blindly following any person is what gets us into trouble.What is your vision for America?The biggest problem in America is polarization. It would be refreshing to see people on both sides come together to discuss how to fix our problems. Today it seems everyone is either on the deep right or deep left, with just name-calling and personal attacks. We need less politics and more problem-solving. We have to be willing to compromise, both sides have to give and take. One thing I\u2019d like to see is term limits on members of Congress. It would put pressure on them not to be complacent and to work for the people\u2019s interests, rather than political lobbyists.Where do you get your information?I\u2019ll go on Google News and open articles from Fox News, CNN, Politico and The New York Times. If you\u2019re always getting news from CNN, that\u2019s going to make you a liberal. If it\u2019s from Fox News, that\u2019s going to make you conservative. I try to stay aware. Writing off climate change, that it\u2019s a hoax, is over the top. Ignoring the problem and denying it isn\u2019t going to do anything.Grace Klassen 18, will be a freshman this fall at North Dakota State University. Her best friend, Clare Hillen, also 18, will be a freshman at George Washington University. Both are from Minneapolis.Why did you come here, and what have you learned?Was your high school also conservative?What is your vision for America?Where do you get your information?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Said to Quickly Withdraw Approval for New Facebook Venture", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For Facebook, success in China was brief. Very brief.Then the registration disappeared, and references to the subsidiary were partly censored in Chinese media.Now the approval has been withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named because the person was not authorized to speak on the record.While the about-face does not definitively end Facebook\u2019s chances of establishing the company, it makes success very unlikely, the person said. The decision to take down the approval, the person added, came after a disagreement between officials in Zhejiang and the national internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, which was angry that it had not been consulted more closely.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to respond to a request for comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the Zhejiang provincial government and the municipal government in Hangzhou, Zhejiang\u2019s provincial capital, did not respond to requests for comment.The strange incident underscores how much of a challenge it has become for the globe-spanning social network to get into China \u2014 even just to open an innovation center.Its main platform has been blocked in China for almost a decade. Its other services, such as Instagram, were once popular in China, but have since also fallen behind the government\u2019s filters. While Facebook had hoped to dip a toe in the market and work with Chinese developers, its very presence appears to have become a large, and incendiary, political question here.The kerfuffle also illustrates how complicated China\u2019s bureaucracy can be. Foreign companies seeking to expand here must navigate a vast and decentralized government in which provinces, cities and ministries all vie for influence and power. While one part of the government may be happy to support a foreign company like Facebook, that could ruffle feathers elsewhere. Facebook seems to have fallen victim to such a case.The government turnaround is only the latest incident in the long, strange history of relations between the world\u2019s largest social network and its largest internet market.For Facebook, angering officials at China\u2019s internet regulator could make progress particularly difficult, especially as new personnel have just taken over managing the relationship with the Chinese government.Stepping in to replace her has been Zhang Jingmei, who created the company that ran the anonymous Colorful Balloons app, and William Shuai, who was once a low-level Chinese official. Both were listed on the board of the newly created, and quickly disappeared, subsidiary in Zhejiang.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Los Angeles and Its Newspaper, Explained by Three Buildings", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Three important buildings, designed by three important architects, tell the story of modern Los Angeles and its newspaper.The first was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann and built in 1935 as a new and modern home for The Los Angeles Times, and its distinctive Art Deco style has been an iconic fixture of the city\u2019s skyline.The second, designed by Rowland H. Crawford, is an office tower built in 1948 as the home for a new afternoon newspaper. That project failed, partly because the old street cars went away as the city embraced the automobile, but the building endures.The third was designed by William L. Pereira, a 1973 office building to accommodate the top brass of the Times Mirror Co., the newspaper\u2019s corporate parent. It was built at a time when the paper was growing under the publisher, Otis Chandler, who expanded the paper\u2019s coverage, elevating it into the upper echelon of the country\u2019s great newspapers.Mr. Schave has spent the last 10 years, working alongside Harry Chandler, Otis Chandler\u2019s son, preparing an application to gain monument status for the buildings, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent Omni from developing the site, but would restrict it.He said he started the process shortly after Sam Zell, the Chicago businessman, took ownership of the paper. He immediately sensed that paper \u2014 and the building \u2014 was not in good hands.It was just a coincidence that the city\u2019s Office of Historic Resources accepted the application only recently, just as the newspaper was packing up to move. (The city\u2019s Cultural Heritage Commission will hear the case on July 19.)Struggles over the future of old buildings in Los Angeles can be long, nasty and complicated affairs, pitting historians and conservationists against deep-pocketed property developers.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)This week the Times Magazine tackles one of the fundamental issues of our age: Have the giant tech companies grown too powerful?The article offers the first easy question to ask of the big tech companies: What are they, really? Certainly not what they tell consumers they are.(Twitter and Facebook, for example, are not merely places to hang out with or meet people, but entirely new forms of discourse built around advertising.)And the companies most vulnerable to easy questions tend to be the ones that can no longer be understood in terms of former competitors or current peers \u2014 because they don\u2019t really have any.Read the full article here.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Facebook Gains Status in China, at Least for a Moment", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has registered a subsidiary in the city of Hangzhou, according to a Chinese government filing, which said the company had gotten approval last Wednesday. The subsidiary was financed with an investment of $30 million, according to the records.Yet late Tuesday, in a sign of possible complications, the corporate registration was taken down from the Chinese government website, and some references to the new subsidiary appeared to be censored on social media in the country.The moves indicated how complicated it remains for Facebook to navigate China, where it has been blocked for almost 10 years. If the subsidiary is allowed to proceed, it will be a toe in the water here for the Silicon Valley company. Facebook said it wanted to use the subsidiary to coordinate with Chinese developers in the closely censored market.Even to release an app in China, Facebook is likely to need a separate license from regulators. To go further and introduce one of its larger products, like its social network or messaging service, would require further negotiations over issues like data storage and security. Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing service, Instagram, and its messaging platform, WhatsApp, are also blocked in China.\u201cWe are interested in setting up an innovation hub in Zhejiang to support Chinese developers, innovators and start-ups,\u201d said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman, referring to the province in eastern China where Hangzhou is. \u201cWe have done this in several parts of the world \u2014 France, Brazil, India, Korea \u2014 and our efforts would be focused on training and workshops that help these developers and entrepreneurs to innovate and grow.\u201dThe ruling Chinese Communist Party deems all social networks that it does not ultimately control, like Facebook and Twitter, as potentially destabilizing. A series of sophisticated internet filters block residents from gaining access to such sites. Networks within China often self-censor, but are still held closely accountable by government regulators.If Facebook started introducing services in China, it would probably face questions about whether to censor content or share data with Beijing. The latter could be a particularly tricky issue for the social network while it is under scrutiny by the United States government for its handling of user data.Facebook\u2019s fortunes in China follow some progress here for Google, which has also seen its products slowly squeezed out of the market. Over the past year, the search giant has set up an artificial-intelligence research lab in China and introduced several services, including an A.I.-powered sketching game.The legal representative for Facebook\u2019s new China subsidiary was the same employee who registered the company that launched Colorful Balloons: Ivy Zhang, Facebook\u2019s chief representative and head of business development in China.Also on the board of the new subsidiary with Ms. Zhang is William Shuai, Facebook\u2019s China government affairs representative and a former government relations executive at the Chinese search engine Baidu and LinkedIn. Before holding those positions, Mr. Shuai was briefly a low-level official in the Chinese government.Paul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How to Make This the Summer of Missing Out", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-CareYou could say I had the epiphany when, in the middle of a flight to Los Angeles \u2014 and a busy New York workday \u2014 the Wi-Fi stopped working. Two very odd things happened in quick succession. First: I did not fall out of the sky. Second: After recovering from the initial fury-implosion, I worked more intently and productively than I had in ages. What was this strange, unburdened feeling, I wondered, as I stepped off the plane hours later? Turns out the internet had a word for it already: JOMO.It\u2019s a lot like that age-old wisdom about being present \u2014 only retrofitted for a world in which missing an email could be a fireable offense, and deleting Bumble could mean you don\u2019t go on a date for another three months. Like it or not, we need our technology devices; we just don\u2019t need them as much as we think we do. JOMO is about finding that balance. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about setting boundaries,\u201d said Cara Wenig, 30, a sales rep and JOMO practitioner. \u201cIn my work, it is really important to respond quickly and to be on top of things so it\u2019s not as if I can completely unplug. But I can be more mindful about it.\u201d Given JOMO\u2019s Luddite bent, it\u2019s (perhaps) surprising that the tech industry has recently come on board. This spring, Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, took the stage at the company\u2019s annual developer conference with the words \u201cJoy of Missing Out\u201d projected behind him. Apple announced, soon after, its own stab at digital health: a \u201cScreen Time\u201d dashboard, which gives you a peek into your digital use, and enhanced \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d functions.\u201cWe see time and time again that the constant distraction is making people feel very unhappy,\u201d said Ashley Whillans, a behavior scientist, who has been studying the relationship between happiness, time and money. All of which means missing out can be a good thing. But how best to do it?If you\u2019re wondering whether you may also be engaging in unhealthy tech habits, here\u2019s a helpful pop quiz:Do you own a smartphone?That\u2019s it. Because if you answered yes, you\u2019re essentially carrying around what the Center for Humane Technology, an organization working to spur reform in the tech and media industries, calls a \u201cslot machine\u201d in your pocket. Play it enough times, and you\u2019re bound to get hooked. This isn\u2019t an accident. This is big business.\u201cTech companies have spent the last 10, 20 years building internet and mobile products that are addictive on purpose,\u201d said Dan Frommer, the editor in chief of Recode. \u201cThere is a threshold where utility becomes addiction, and I think it\u2019s safe to say a lot of the most popular products today have taken it too far.\u201dToday, many of us are mindful about what we put into our bodies because we know how certain foods make us feel: Gluten may make one sluggish, say, while sugar can worsen anxiety. But what about when it comes to our minds? Imagine what that extra hour of mindless scrolling is doing to it. Don\u2019t think of JOMO as a detox, but more like an integral part to a healthy, well-balanced nutrition plan for your brain. You may not always want to do it, it may not always feel natural or fun, but, like that kale smoothie you choke down or the probiotics you spring for at Whole Foods, you do it because it\u2019s good for you.Begin to cultivate the expectation that you may take a while to respond to text messages and emails. If you feel undue pressure from family and friends, you can let them know ahead of time that you may not always be available. Google\u2019s \u201cdirector o\u2019 design\u201d (his real title), Glen Murphy, said one of the most surprising realizations he took out of his digital well-being research was how much \u201csocial factors\u201d played a role in determining \u201cexpectations of responsiveness.\u201d Certain people like to respond to things right away, while others take their time. The problem is, friends and colleagues may have certain expectations no matter which camp you\u2019re in. If you don\u2019t respond quickly, they freak out. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \u201cI think we all have the friend or the boss that takes days to respond to an email,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWe can all strive to have that freedom.\u201dNext time you find yourself about to binge-watch that next series on Netflix, remind yourself what you could be doing instead, like catching up with a friend on the phone, or simply getting more sleep. Of course, the last episode of say, \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d may win out \u2014 but at least you\u2019ll be choosing it with intention.Ms. Whillans\u2019s research suggests that we\u2019re pretty bad at recognizing the opportunity cost that comes with spending money, and even worse at seeing the opportunity cost when it comes to time. \u201cWe don\u2019t spontaneously recognize all the things we\u2019re not getting by saying yes to something,\u201d Ms. Whillans said. She has found, however, that if people were reminded of what they were giving up to spend that extra hour online, or doing chores \u2014 namely, time they could be spending with family, friends or learning a new skill \u2014 they often choose to give up on the time-sucking activity, and feel happier in the process.There\u2019s a reason abstinence often doesn\u2019t work: It\u2019s too difficult. \u201cThe measures that a person can take are what we call Band-Aids,\u201d said Max Stossel, the head of content and storytelling at the Center for Humane Technology. \u201cUltimately we really need changes like the ones Apple and Google are just starting to explore. We only have so much willpower to resist.\u201d\u201cIt will be really crucial to see how these companies will follow through with the announcements,\u201d Mr. Frommer said. \u201cAre they just following a trend for good P.R., or is this the kind of thing they really value and build into everything they offer.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Android Users, Europe\u2019s Google Ruling Leaves Unanswered Questions", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSpecifically, the authorities dinged Google on its practices with Android, the mobile operating system that the company provides to makers of devices. The size of the fine and the remedies that regulators ordered Google to make were consequential, both symbolically and in how handset manufacturers may incorporate Android into mobile devices in Europe in the future.But what does that mean for you if you own an Android phone? Here\u2019s a rundown.Android is one of the most prevalent mobile operating systems, used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones.Google freely provides the Android operating system to third-party handset makers. As part of the arrangement, Google requires Android phone makers to pre-install 11 Google apps on their phones. That strategy has helped Google\u2019s signature products \u2014 search, maps, Gmail and the Chrome internet browser among them \u2014 reach more than one billion people.The European Union ruled that Google abused its power by forcing phone makers like Samsung, HTC and Huawei to make those services the primary products on their phones in order to gain access to other Google apps.Now the regulators want Google to change its ways so that other players, like rival search engine providers and browser makers, can meaningfully compete. Specifically, the European Union wants Google to stop tying together its search, browser and app store products for handset makers.That remains unclear. Let\u2019s use a current example: When you buy a Samsung phone, it comes with two browsers, two virtual assistants and two messaging apps, among other doubles. That\u2019s because Samsung pre-installs its own apps alongside Google\u2019s apps, which it was required to include.The regulators would love it if Google simply let handset makers like Samsung ship Android phones loaded with their own browsers and app stores instead of Google\u2019s. Yet the European Union is letting Google decide how it wants to comply with its ruling. Keep in mind that Google is staffed with some of the world\u2019s top lawyers and engineers, who will probably find compliance solutions that have a minimal impact on its business.The other thing is that handset makers are in a tough predicament. They probably wouldn\u2019t want to strip their phones of Google\u2019s apps, simply because many customers enjoy using the search giant\u2019s products.There\u2019s only a slim chance that you will see any changes.The implications of this ruling involve many ifs.If Google decides to make any noticeable changes at all, the changes might appear only for European Android users who have phones with the newer Android operating system. American government officials have expressed interest in taking a tougher stance on regulating tech companies, but Europe has largely acted by itself in its regulatory actions against Silicon Valley titans.So other than Google\u2019s having to pay a big fine, the ultimate effect of the European ruling may be blunted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alfred Alberts, Unsung Father of a Cholesterol Drug, Dies at 87", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlfred W. Alberts, a largely unknown hero behind the first cholesterol-lowering statin approved in the United States, died on June 16 in Fort Collins, Colo. He was 87.His son Eli confirmed the death, at a rehabilitation facility. Mr. Alberts had a heart attack two weeks earlier and then bypass surgery. A resident of Wyckoff, N.J., he had been visiting his son in Colorado at the time.\u201cHe was my right-hand man,\u201d Dr. Vagelos said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe were more like brothers, like twins.\u201dIn the late 1970s, Mr. Alberts discovered the chemical compound that led to the drug lovastatin, a leading remedy for high cholesterol. (Statins are a class of drugs that help lower cholesterol levels in the blood.)But even fellow scientists did not always know who Mr. Alberts was.\u201cHe never sought publicity outside Merck,\u201d said the Nobel laureate Dr. Michael S. Brown, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. \u201cHe never sought attention. He was basically a shy person.\u201dAs a result, he said, Mr. Alberts \u201chasn\u2019t gotten a lot of credit.\u201d(Dr. Brown and his colleague Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein were awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for discovering the protein on cell surfaces to which cholesterol binds.)At the time of Mr. Alberts\u2019s discovery, cardiologists and public health experts had been at a loss to help people with high cholesterol levels. Diet and exercise had modest effects, at best. Although a few drugs were available, they produced difficult side effects.But since 1964 scientists had known that there was a path to a better drug, and that it depended on the discovery of a compound that blocked what some called the pacemaker enzyme. That enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, is needed to synthesize cholesterol. The more of it that is around, the faster cholesterol will be made.The challenge was to find that compound and ensure that it would be safe for humans to take as a drug. There were many claims to success, but none held up.Dr. Vagelos, who had just begun a job as head of research at Merck, suggested that Mr. Alberts take on the task.\u201cI said, \u2018Oh, my God, we are behind already,\u2019\u201d Dr. Vagelos recalled. \u201cThen I said: \u2018The hell with it. We are a lot faster than they are. Let\u2019s go ahead.\u2019\u201dSuddenly Daiichi Sankyo stopped all tests of its compound. The company would not say why, but the rumor was that it was causing tumors in dogs.That did not bode well for Merck.\u201cTheir compound was an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase,\u201d Dr. Vagelos said. \u201cOurs was an inhibitor of the same enzyme. If the rumor was true, that it was causing tumors in dogs, the implication was that it would cause cancer in humans. We could not put humans at risk. I decided we would stop all studies.\u201dHe continued: \u201cAl was depressed by this. He was emotionally tied to the compound and was sure it would ultimately be found to be safe.\u201dWith the drug, in which he had invested so much hope, yanked from clinical studies, Mr. Alberts considered leaving Merck, his wife, Helene Alberts, said in an interview. He stayed, though, while the company\u2019s safety assessment team tested the drug. It ultimately concluded that lovastatin did not cause cancer.Lovastatin, the first statin on the market, was approved in 1987. Mr. Alberts, whose own cholesterol was elevated, took it himself.The drug\u2019s success was the triumph of his life.\u201cBehind every drug there are heroes,\u201d Dr. Brown said, and Mr. Alberts was \u201can unsung hero\u201d of lovastatin.When Mr. Alberts recently displayed the first signs of a heart attack, he was on vacation with his family in Steamboat Springs, Colo. He went to a small nearby hospital, where an emergency room doctor called Mr. Alberts\u2019s doctor in New York.The New York doctor said, \u201cDo you know who you have there?\u201dThe emergency room doctor, Ms. Alberts said, \u201cran out and Googled him.\u201dWhen the doctor was arranging for Mr. Alberts to be taken to the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora by a medevac helicopter, he told the doctors there that Mr. Alberts had discovered lovastatin.And when Mr. Alberts arrived in Aurora, the medical personnel there greeted him like a celebrity. \u201cPeople wanted his autograph,\u201d his wife said.\u201cHe became a rock star,\u201d Dr. Vagelos said.Alfred William Alberts was born in Manhattan on May 16, 1931, and grew up in Brooklyn, attending Erasmus Hall High School and Brooklyn College. He was 21 when he met Helene Cuba, who was 17, on a blind date. Both were the only children of divorced parents. They married two years later.After a stint in the Army, Mr. Alberts was accepted into a Ph.D. program at the University of Kansas, in Lawrence. But Ms. Alberts, who had accompanied him, came to feel isolated in northeast Kansas, and two years later Mr. Alberts transferred to the University of Maryland to finish his doctorate in cell biology.While there, Ms. Alberts said, his financial support from the G.I. Bill ran out, and he needed money to support his family.One day, at the end of a biochemistry course, the professor, Earl Stadtman, a biochemist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., asked his students, \u201cDoes anybody need a job?\u201d If so, he said, see him.Mr. Alberts leapt at the opportunity. He abandoned the Ph.D. program, even though he had done all the required research and had only to write a dissertation, and took a job as a lab technician at the Institutes. He assumed he would be working with his revered professor, Dr. Stadtman. Instead, in 1959, he ended up working for Dr. Vagelos, who taught him biochemistry.In 1966, Dr. Vagelos accepted a job as head of the biochemistry department at Washington University in St. Louis. Mr. Alberts wanted to come along, although Dr. Vagelos advised him not to, reminding him that he had a secure government job at the N.I.H.\u201cI warned him not to come because he did not have a Ph.D.,\u201d Dr. Vagelos said.But Mr. Alberts insisted on going, and he succeeded there. He was promoted to assistant professor and then associate professor of biochemistry with tenure.Besides his wife and his son Eli, Mr. Alberts is survived by another son, Mitchell; a daughter, Heather Alberts; and two grandchildren. After his bypass surgery, Mr. Alberts was taken from the university hospital in Aurora to the Fort Collins rehabilitation facility to be near Eli.In 1975, when Merck offered Dr. Vagelos a job as head of research, Mr. Alberts again wanted to join him, and again Dr. Vagelos warned him away, reminding him that he had a secure position at the university and that his future at Merck would by no means be assured.Once again, Mr. Alberts ignored the advice and chose to accompany Dr. Vagelos, signing on with Merck at its headquarters in northern New Jersey.Although Mr. Alberts shunned publicity and did not like to write medical papers, Dr. Vagelos cited him as a co-author on many of his. But he gives Mr. Alberts full credit for lovastatin.\u201cThat was Al\u2019s discovery,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the name of the town in New Jersey where Mr. Alberts lived. It is Wyckoff, not Wycoff.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battling Fake Accounts, Twitter to Slash Millions of Followers", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter will begin removing tens of millions of suspicious accounts from users\u2019 followers on Thursday, signaling a major new effort to restore trust on the popular but embattled platform.The reform takes aim at a pervasive form of social media fraud. Many users have inflated their followers on Twitter or other services with automated or fake accounts, buying the appearance of social influence to bolster their political activism, business endeavors or entertainment careers.Twitter\u2019s decision will have an immediate impact: Beginning on Thursday, many users, including those who have bought fake followers and any others who are followed by suspicious accounts, will see their follower numbers fall. While Twitter declined to provide an exact number of affected users, the company said it would strip tens of millions of questionable accounts from users\u2019 followers. The move would reduce the total combined follower count on Twitter by about 6 percent \u2014 a substantial drop.Officials at Twitter acknowledged that easy access to fake followers, and the company\u2019s slowness in responding to the problem, had devalued the influence accumulated by legitimate users, sowing suspicion around those who quickly attained a broad following.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to incentivize the purchase of followers and fake accounts to artificially inflate follower counts, because it\u2019s not an accurate measure of someone\u2019s influence on the platform or influence in the world,\u201d said Del Harvey, Twitter\u2019s vice president for trust and safety. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a really important and meaningful metric, and we want people to have confidence that these are engaged users that are following other accounts.\u201dThe market for fakes was also hurting Twitter with advertisers, which increasingly rely on social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 mini-celebrities who promote brands and products to their followers \u2014 to reach customers. In recent months, advertising and marketing firms have put pressure on Twitter, YouTube and other platforms to help ensure that influencers have the reach they claim. Last month, the consumer goods giant Unilever, which spends billions of dollars a year on advertising, announced that it would no longer pay influencers who purchased followers and would prioritize spending advertising dollars on platforms that took steps to stamp out fraud.In an interview on Tuesday, Unilever\u2019s chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, praised Twitter for its decision. \u201cPeople will believe more and read more on Twitter if they know there is less bot activity and more human activity,\u201d Mr. Weed said. \u201cI would encourage and ask others to follow.\u201dTwitter locks an account \u2014 blocking it from posting or interacting with other users \u2014 when the company suspects that it is automated spam, or that it has been compromised, usually by having its password hacked or leaked. Most spam accounts are quickly removed. But until now, even after Twitter privately identified an account as suspicious and locked it, that account would still be included among the legitimate followers of a user.Most of the time, according to Twitter, the locked accounts are not included in the monthly active user count it reports to investors each quarter, a critical Wall Street metric for social media companies. But the locked accounts were nevertheless allowed to inflate the follower counts of a large swath of users.That choice helped propel a large market in fake followers. Dozens of websites openly sell followers and engagement on Twitter, as well as on YouTube, Instagram and other platforms. The Times revealed that one company, Devumi, sold over 200 million Twitter followers, drawing on an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, each sold many times over.Tens of thousands of automated accounts were created by stealing profile information from real users, including minors. One such victim, a teenager named Jessica Rychly, had her account information \u2014 including her profile photo, biographical information and location \u2014 copied and pasted onto a fake account that retweeted cryptocurrency advertisements and graphic pornography.Twitter officials believe that the new policy will disrupt the marketplace for fake followers and curb abusive practices used to create fake accounts: Since suspicious accounts will now be stripped from users\u2019 followers, the company hopes there will be less incentive to purchase fakes in the first place.Twitter has also begun to permanently remove more suspicious accounts. After The Times\u2019s investigation was published in January, Twitter removed over a million accounts from the followers of Devumi customers \u2014 accounts that the company said violated its spam policies.Twitter estimates that as a result of Thursday\u2019s changes, the average user will see his or her follower number drop by four \u2014 but that number would be much higher for some accounts.\u201cAs part of our renewed focus on public healthy conversation, and certainly some of the information that The New York Times was able to provide in their story, we felt it was an important step to take,\u201d Ms. Harvey said.Advertisement"}

The comedy evenings did well \u201cjust because there was a need for it.\u201d The first Asian AF was staged in Los Angeles that November; the New York version followed less than a year later.The comedian Jenny Yang took part in the premiere and deeply appreciated the need for Asian representation: When she started out in comedy, in 2010, she set up a Google alert for \u201cAsian-American women comedy.\u201d\u201cI was like, \u2018Who else is out here?\u2019\u201d she recalled thinking, and received hits about once a month at most \u2014 mainly when the comedian Margaret Cho was in the news.As a new standup at the time, she found it difficult to relate to colleagues at open-mic nights: They were mostly younger, mostly white and mostly men. And their material? \u201cBad marijuana and masturbation jokes,\u201d she said.For Ms. Yang, these ventures were not about self-promotion. Instead, it was \u201cthis bigger thing that I feel I wanted to be a part of, which is to be able to showcase people that aren\u2019t typically seen on mainstream comedy stages.\u201d\u201cThere is something to be said about doing this kind of work in a more well-known, mainstream comedy space like U.C.B.,\u201d she added.\u201cIt elevated the awareness of our show,\u201d Mr. Choi said.In both Los Angeles and New York, Asian-American stars like Ms. Cho, Randall Park and Kelly Marie Tran have appeared as special guests. Ken Jeong stopped by the Manhattan show last month when it was part of the Del Close Marathon.\u201cThat\u2019s been the fun part, seeing who we can get,\u201d Mr. Choi said.To get a slot on the main stage of the ColdTowne Theater in Austin, \u201cit was very helpful to be able to point to Asian AF and be like, hey, they sell out every show, there\u2019s a market for more,\u201d the co-founder Yola Lu said by email.Through the series, Mr. Choi said, performers have been invited to audition for TV roles and hired at other venues. Mr. Choi is hopeful that such connections are a sign that one day the showcase won\u2019t need to exist anymore.\u201cRight now we need it because of representation, but I hope there will be a day where it\u2019s like, \u2018No, you know what? This show does not need to exist anymore, because we solved it,\u2019\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWe solved diversity, we solved representation. Will that day come any time soon? I don\u2019t know. But I do feel like right now it\u2019s important, and I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re doing it.\u201dThe next Asian AF show is Friday at U.C.B. in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.

{"Headline": "Half a Century of Shoe Leather: On the Beat With Sam Roberts", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the late 1960s, one of my first assignments for a New York newspaper was a fashion profile, a subject about which I then knew \u2014 and, 50 years later, still know \u2014 next to nothing. Despite my lofty goals for going into journalism, I later realized that all my lame profile probably accomplished was qualifying the editor\u2019s wife for a discounted dress. I settled for the satisfaction of deleting the fashion designer\u2019s name from the first paragraph and mockingly began my article this way: \u201cWill the ever climbing hemline and plunging neckline ever meet in what would be a historic navel engagement?\u201dMy career survived. In the ensuing half-century of covering New York for The Daily News and The New York Times, hemlines have risen and fallen. The city had its ups and downs, too; my tenure as a reporter and editor so far has spanned seven mayors and a revolution in the way that news is delivered. Radio and television were not, as predicted, newspapers\u2019 death knell. But digital technology has sent readers and advertising stampeding to the internet. The slashing of The News\u2019s staff by half this week is the latest casualty.There\u2019s more at stake than nostalgia, though. We\u2019re already suffering mightily from the loss of local news coverage as we seek global audiences, with public officials not being held accountable and civic engagement continuing its decline.I started at The Daily News in 1968, just a few weeks after graduating from college. Many reporters there had only high school educations, but they practiced tabloid journalism at its best. They were steeled by a healthy irreverence for authority and committed to the common man (particularly if he happened to be white).And in those days, access to public figures and public buildings was far less restricted. Government seemed less remote. Power brokers, unprogrammed by media consultants, openly bloviated about back-room deals. Process brokers like Howard Rubenstein, a friend and adviser to Mayor Abraham D. Beame, could borrow a typewriter in City Hall and unabashedly draft a news release denouncing the mayor on behalf of the sanitation workers\u2019 union, one of his public relations firm\u2019s clients.We also never took ourselves too seriously. As an editor confided to the movie director when \u201cSuperman\u201d was being filmed at the Daily News building, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of actors pretending to be journalists working for me, too.\u201dThe Daily News\u2019s city room still evoked \u201cThe Front Page.\u201d I presided as city editor as stranded couples got married there. Criminals surrendered (including one self-described fugitive whom no one wanted). The columnist Jimmy Breslin exchanged letters with Son of Sam (gaining the killer\u2019s confidence, no doubt, by congratulating him on his deft use of a semicolon). We spirited George Willig away after he climbed the World Trade Center to get his exclusive account (it helped that Willig\u2019s father was a pressman), and doggedly held officials\u2019 feet to the fire to revive Bushwick, a dying Brooklyn neighborhood devastated by the 1977 blackout.The Times took itself more seriously, in part because it is taken more seriously. My first assignment at The Times, in 1983, was not about fashion, but foreign policy. I didn\u2019t know much about that either, then, but the consequences of making a mistake were greater than a dress or a dressing down. If I had misquoted the secretary of defense in his speech about the Middle East that day, I might have started a war.(A few months later, as I was blissfully churning out elongated treatises on urban affairs, an editor confided his initial concern that I might have had difficulty adapting from abbreviated tabloid style. \u201cLittle did I know,\u201d he told me, with mixed emotions, \u201cthat I\u2019d be dealing with years of pent-up frustration!\u201d)The clamorous newsroom that resonated with clacking typewriter keys and reporters barking for copy boys has now hushed. Glowing two-dimensional video screens have supplanted the paper that displayed today\u2019s news and became tomorrow\u2019s fish wrap \u2014 an evanescence that now seems eternal compared with web pages that are reconfigured instantaneously as algorithms measure (and sometimes dictate) headlines, story placement and even texts to attract the readers who keep us in business.Google makes getting information so easy that I sometimes feel guilty. I remember telling Jimmy Breslin one morning that I felt queasy and might work from home. \u201cI have two words for you,\u201d he replied. \u201cWally Pipp.\u201d He reminded me that Pipp was the Yankee first baseman who called in sick with a headache in 1925. Lou Gehrig filled in for him \u2014 for the next 2,130 games, until 1939. (I\u2019ve kept Pipp\u2019s photograph on my desk ever since.)For all its benefits, digital journalism presents other challenges. The speed with which we can erase online mistakes may inevitably make us sloppier (better to be second than sorry as we measure scoops, like stock trades, in fractions of a second).Now that the internet has made the public our partners in news gathering, we need to reconcile the advantage of having readers perched on our shoulder as muses with a potential drawback: glancing constantly over our shoulder wondering how they may second-guess what we write.We did make mistakes over the years. We were far too slow to report and embrace the social and political upheavals by racial and ethnic minorities, women, and gay people \u2014 movements we take for granted today as commendable progress. They seemed to threaten a convenient status quo that came from being too cozy with some of the people we covered.Maybe we caroused too much then, also, although the after-hours collegiality provided a graduate education in journalism; and when a computer failure once wiped out all of the day\u2019s copy, we were able to instantly summon reporters with one phone call to the right bar.But while the way we deliver news is changing exponentially, the fundamental goals of news gathering haven\u2019t really changed at all: Tell a compelling story that answers who, what, when, where, why and how. Make it relevant. And place it in perspective, because the past \u2014 whether it flashed by this morning in a fleeting tweet, or happened 50 years ago and was forgotten \u2014 is never far behind.A previous version of this article misstated the number of games in which Lou Gehrig filled in for Yankees first baseman Wally Pipp between 1925 and 1939. It was for 2,130 games, not 2,120.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A $5.1 Billion Fine for Google Won\u2019t Fix Tech", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean and American officials need to find more effective ways to ensure competition in industries dominated by a handful of big players. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The European case is strongest when it argues against Google\u2019s exclusionary requirements \u2014 that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google\u2019s and users can easily download software by other developers \u2014 something many people do. This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google\u2019s to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition. For his part, President Trump absurdly sought to turn the European Union\u2019s case into another example of how European officials are taking \u201cadvantage\u201d of the United States.Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done. It is also difficult to foresee and prevent bad outcomes. That\u2019s why it is important that lawmakers and regulators use all the tools they have to encourage competition and fair play.Advertisement"}

For me, a very casual Marvel fan, \u201cInfinity War\u201d was a decent bad-guy-assembling-a-doomsday-weapon showdown story.But for my neighbor, it was as if Thanos had twiddled the perception-altering reality stone on his Armageddon gauntlet, unveiling a manifestation of the movie rich in detail and reward, strewn with delicious Easter eggs. We were watching \u201cInfinity War\u201d in the same space, but on entirely different planes.All of which brings me to Hulu\u2019s \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d beginning Wednesday, a version of which I am about to review for you. But only my version.\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is based on the work of Stephen King. If the title \u2014 the author\u2019s fictional Maine stomping ground \u2014 is not clue enough, the opening titles feature close-ups of pages from \u201cSalem\u2019s Lot,\u201d \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d and \u201cThe Shining.\u201d It\u2019s as if you\u2019re about to fall into the pages of his novels \u2014 books, beloved by millions, that I haven\u2019t read.It\u2019s not like I\u2019m unexposed to the work of Stephen King. I live in America; \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cCarrie\u201d may as well be articles of the Constitution. I\u2019ve enjoyed some of his books\u2019 screen adaptations, like Hulu\u2019s \u201c11.22.63\u201d from 2016. But I\u2019m not a superfan. At best, maybe a medium fan.\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is an original work (Mr. King is a producer) that borrows from his oeuvre. And while the series is ostensibly created for obsessive and newbie alike, the first episodes \u2014 heavy on atmosphere but weak on character \u2014 feel like the creators expecting affection for his past creations to do a lot of the work.At Shawshank state prison \u2014 that reference, I get! \u2014 the warden, Dale Lacy (Terry O\u2019Quinn), has developed a theory about the malignancy afflicting the town, involving a nameless prisoner (Bill Skarsgard, Pennywise from the recent adaptation of \u201cIt\u201d), being held in apparently extralegal circumstances.The prisoner\u2019s case draws in Henry Deaver (Andr\u00e9 Holland), a Texas defense lawyer and Castle Rock native whose hometown memories are, of course, unhappy. He\u2019s long been blamed for the suspicious death of the pastor who adopted him. With his mother, Ruth (Sissy Spacek), fading into dementia, Henry\u2019s only ally in town is his childhood friend, Molly Strand (Melanie Lynskey).Molly, now a jittery, pill-popping adult, has the challenging job of selling real estate in a burg that\u2019s both economically depressed and, you know, cursed. As she understatedly puts it to a client, \u201cThere is a lot of history in this town, not all of it good.\u201d\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is smothered by that history. The premiere is all mood and tease. The camera lingers on a name tag, \u201cPANGBORN,\u201d letting Kingophiles know that we\u2019re meeting a returning character, the retired town sheriff (now played by Scott Glenn), and sending the rest of us to Google.The impressive cast is rounded out by Allison Tolman, Frances Conroy and Jane Levy. But no character has a chance to develop in the pokey early episodes, which prioritize atmosphere, jump scares and hint-dropping. (The series is produced by J.J. Abrams, of puzzle narratives like \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d along with Sam Shaw of \u201cManhattan.\u201d)Even the mordant dialogue (a victim of decapitation is said to have gotten \u201c10 percent off on the funeral\u201d) doesn\u2019t establish individual character voice so much as a familiar King vibe. You\u2019ve heard the phrase, \u201cThe location is a character\u201d? Here, the town of Castle Rock is an ungenerous co-star, elbowing out its colleagues.The series improves in the third and fourth hours, each of which focuses on specific citizens and how they\u2019ve adapted (or not) to life in a town that\u2019s struggling and spiritually sick. But almost halfway into a 10-episode season, \u201cCastle Rock\u201d hasn\u2019t made the case that you should care, beyond a generic sense of spooky mystery \u2014 or, maybe, a pre-existing attachment to the Stephen King Extended Universe.That\u2019s where I need to leave it to you. \u201cCastle Rock\u201d \u2014 certainly well-acted and produced, with some striking set pieces \u2014 may work well for completists. But it isn\u2019t so successful as TV.Certainly you can pull this sort of thing off, as did \u201cFargo\u201d (\u201cCastle Rock,\u201d but for the Coen Brothers), or \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a series essentially built of memories that nonetheless puts its original characters\u2019 voices first.\u201cCastle Rock,\u201d on the other hand, falls to a distinctively Castle Rockian fate.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Is Right About the E.U.\u2019s Penalty Against Google", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseLet\u2019s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union\u2019s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of Google.But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point.It\u2019s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission.The commission, which is the union\u2019s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects.But the heart of the decision involved Google\u2019s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company\u2019s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs.The commission called this a classic \u201ctying\u201d arrangement, in which a company extends the market dominance it enjoys in one area (in this instance, the app store) to others, specifically the browser and search engine. (For some reason, the commission\u2019s logic did not extend to any other Google apps.)\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, said in announcing the ruling.The focus on tying arrangements is reminiscent of two famous Microsoft cases: one in the United States, in which the government accused the company of illegally tying its Internet Explorer browser to its dominant Windows operating system, the other in Europe, where Microsoft was found to have abused its Windows dominance by embedding its media player.The outcomes in both cases are now widely viewed as irrelevant, since by the time they were decided, Explorer and Windows Media Player had been overwhelmed by technological change and competition \u2014 from Google, among others. Microsoft\u2019s share of the browser and media-player markets is insignificant today.But even if the European Union\u2019s Microsoft precedent is viewed as sound, Google\u2019s competitive situation is different. \u201cThere\u2019s only a superficial resemblance to Microsoft,\u201d said Pinar Akman, director of the Center for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds in England, who has received support from Google for some of her research.Unlike adding a rival media player to the Windows operating system, which at the time was a slow and cumbersome process, adding rival apps to an Android-based phone can be done \u201cin seconds,\u201d said Ms. Akman, an antitrust expert. \u201cThe commission put a lot of emphasis on the value of preinstallation. But just because an app is preinstalled doesn\u2019t mean consumers are going to use it. It\u2019s very easy to download a rival app.\u201dGoogle\u2019s photo app, for example, has struggled to compete against Instagram and Snap, even though it comes preinstalled on Android-based phones as part of the Google suite.Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, agreed that if installing a rival app is as easy as Google claims, \u201cit would make for a pretty solid argument that whatever dominance Google has retained in mobile search has nothing to do with anticompetitive conduct, and rather just reflects its superiority as a product.\u201dCuriously, the commission\u2019s statement announcing the ruling did not address that issue. (A full written decision is not expected for months.) So I opened the Google Play store on my Android phone and searched for Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine. I was able to download it in seconds. Google suggested I \u201cmight also like\u201d an array of other search options, including Firefox and DuckDuckGo, which were displayed on the same page and equally accessible with a touch of my finger.Even though Google requires phone makers to use the full suite of Google apps if they want to install the Play store, there is nothing to prevent those companies from also preinstalling rival apps. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Microsoft just pay manufacturers to preinstall Bing?\u201d Ms. Akman asked.Apple, for one, makes Google the default search engine on the iPhone\u2019s Safari browser, even though Apple does not use either the Android operating system or the Play store. Oddly, the commission excluded Apple as a Google competitor, saying that because the company produced premium-price products, it did not constrain Google\u2019s ability to dominate the broader market.\u201cCan you imagine a U.S. court finding that Android and iOS don\u2019t compete?\u201d said Professor Sagers, referring to Apple\u2019s operating system.Samsung, too, preinstalls a range of rival apps in addition to the suite of Google products.The commission\u2019s stated mission is to protect European consumers by assuring them the benefits of competition. But the commission does not seem to have considered the possibility that Google\u2019s search engine and browser have achieved such high market share because consumers prefer them, or that consumers might also like having the apps already installed on their phones.The commission argues that when a phone comes with a single search engine preinstalled, it confers an enormous competitive advantage on that product. To support the theory, the commission said that on phones using Windows operating systems, which come with Bing preinstalled, 75 percent of searches are conducted using that engine.But Windows-based phones accounted for only 0.15 percent of the global market at the end of last year. That renders the data irrelevant, Ms. Akman said.A closer analogy, though not one cited by the commission, can be found in Russia. Last April, Google reached a settlement with a rival search engine based there, Yandex, under which it agreed that phone makers could preinstall Yandex on Android devices and let consumers decide which app would be their default search engine.At the time, Google and Yandex each had about 48 percent of the Russian search market. Since then, Yandex has increased its share to 51 percent; Google\u2019s has dropped to 45 percent.Even if preinstallation offers Google an advantage over rival app producers, that does not mean it harms consumers or violates competition law. I, for one, like having the Google apps preinstalled on my phone, unlike most of the clutter imposed on me by my phone service provider, Verizon.Google has said it will appeal the commission\u2019s decision. Given the commission\u2019s track record \u2014 it has rarely been reversed \u2014 the company would seem to face long odds. Still, the European Union\u2019s highest court sent a 2009 antitrust judgment against Intel back to a lower court for further review last year. The higher court\u2019s opinion clarified that the purpose of European antitrust law was not to protect inefficient competitors at the expense of consumers. That could give Google an opening.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Google ruling is anti-American,\u201d Ms. Akman said. \u201cThere are plenty of rulings against European companies, too. It\u2019s just that the American tech companies have been so successful, and have achieved so much market power, that they\u2019re going to come under scrutiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Maybe you\u2019re stuck in meetings at work all day, or maybe your time zone just isn\u2019t compatible with Russia\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Could You Make It Through Dinner Without Checking Your Phone?", "Date": "2018-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Marc and Kara Lyons take their family out for a nice dinner, they typically hand their two sons cellphones to play games and watch YouTube videos. Sometimes, the parents grab the devices back to check their own email and text messages.But on a recent night at Hearth, an Italian-inspired restaurant in the East Village, the boys, 5 and 7, colored on blank white paper with crayons. Their parents discussed the highlights of their trip to New York from their home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to celebrate Mr. Lyons\u2019s 40th birthday.The reason for the tech-free dinner? The cellphones were stashed in a small decorative box on their table, an initiative that Marco Canora, Hearth\u2019s chef and owner, began in November to help customers disconnect from their devices for a little bit.Hearth is taking a softer approach \u2014 there are no rules, just the containers on each table. A note on top says, \u201cOpen me!\u201d Inside is an invitation to stash your phone during the meal.Mr. Canora started thinking two years ago about how to try to curb his customers\u2019 increasingly distracted behavior. At first, he considered asking guests if they wanted to check their phones at the host stand, as they would a coat, but he worried this could create arguments between couples at the front of the restaurant. And he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for lost or forgotten phones.His other idea was asking customers for their phones once they were seated, but he didn\u2019t want to add another task for his servers.Mr. Canora finally decided on the vintage boxes, which the restaurant\u2019s general manager and wine director, Christine Wright, bought from Etsy. No two boxes look the same \u2014 some are vintage candy boxes, others old cigar cases. They complement the restaurant\u2019s whimsical d\u00e9cor, including the mismatched glassware.Servers ignore the boxes, leaving guests to discover the option themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anybody who is coming in and feeling like we are condescending to them,\u201d said Erik Gullberg, a bartender and server who has worked at Hearth for four years.Few guests make it through their meal without checking their phone, Mr. Canora said. If a diner\u2019s companion leaves to go to the restroom, the phone comes out immediately.\u201cIt has really reinforced our belief that it is a true addiction,\u201d Mr. Canora said. \u201cYou see people succumb to their addiction all night long.\u201dEven if customers don\u2019t follow through completely, he said, he figures it\u2019s better than nothing. People at least often have a conversation about technology\u2019s impact on their lives.Some customers say they don\u2019t need the box to avoid technology during their meal. Janie Quinn and Elissa Epstein, friends who live in Manhattan, noticed the box but didn\u2019t put their phones inside.\u201cMy purse is like that. I don\u2019t need a box,\u201d Ms. Quinn said.She worried that she might forget about her phone and leave without it.\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Mr. Canora said. \u201cThey\u2019re counting the seconds before they can grab it.\u201dJoy Habian, who lives in TriBeCa, said she wished she could forget her phone in the box, noting the oversize role of technology in her life. Although she tries not to check her phone while eating at restaurants, she said she was only successful about 75 percent of the time.\u201cIt\u2019s just an unconscious habit,\u201d Ms. Habian said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rational or meaningful.\u201dAt Hearth, she placed her phone in the decorative container and tried to focus more on enjoying her meal.One way diners frequently use their phones during meals is to post photos of their food on Facebook or Instagram, often tagging the restaurant and providing a source of free publicity. Hearth\u2019s boxes have led fewer people to do that.Some of Hearth\u2019s staff members had initially worried that this would hurt the business. Ultimately, Mr. Canora decided the loyal following that Hearth has built in its 14 years meant that it didn\u2019t need to depend on Instagram.That doesn\u2019t mean the social media platform is devoid of content about Hearth.\u201cWe do see people Instagramming about the boxes, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a win or a lose there, but I guess it\u2019s still good for us,\u201d Ms. Wright joked.Still, she said most customers hadn\u2019t heard about the boxes. The restaurant has yet to receive negative reactions from diners, with most offering enthusiastic feedback.Mr. Lyons was certainly a fan of Hearth\u2019s strategy, noting that he and his wife enjoyed their conversation more without the distraction. Their sons asked for the phones only once, and he quickly dismissed the request. Instead, the boys entertained themselves with tic-tac-toe, and Mr. Lyons taught them how to play hangman.He\u2019s even planning to copy Mr. Canora\u2019s idea.\u201cWe said we should get a box at home,\u201d Mr. Lyons said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have the Tech Giants Grown Too Powerful? That\u2019s an Easy One", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe easy question is a common start-up origin story: One day, the founder asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d before going on to figure out, though hard work, that he or she actually can. According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results? Facebook: Why aren\u2019t social networks connecting people with real names? Uber: Why can\u2019t I use an app to summon a taxi? Twitter: Why isn\u2019t there a dead-simple way to just publish whatever you want for a gathered audience? In real life, each of these companies had more sinuous origins, with dead ends and discarded ideas. But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.In 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways. Most recently, however, the case for \u201cjust asking questions\u201d \u2014 for finding a problem intolerable and believing there must be some way to fix it \u2014 has proved remarkably well suited for a fresh purpose: challenging the tech companies themselves.There are companies that are mostly immune to the easy-question-hard-answer dynamic. Easy questions about Netflix, for one, tend to have easy answers: You pay; they stream. Most obvious questions about Apple can be answered by pointing out that it would like to sell you expensive items on a fairly regular basis. What these more straightforward companies have in common is that their founding questions doubled as consumer rallying cries \u2014 they asked, and continued to ask, about things that their customers need, or at least want, and tend to understand.But for the rest of the tech giants, the easy questions have much harder answers. As these companies grew, they did more than just vanquish their competition. Their growth and free-service benevolence succeeded at making the very idea of competitors\u2019 challenging their efforts \u2014 the industry\u2019s traditional way to solve the problems they\u2019ve created \u2014 seem unnecessary or even counterproductive. They\u2019ve ducked the easy questions for so long that it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that they doubt we will like the answers.Advertisement"}

The Europeans also agreed to buy more American soybeans and natural gas.Twice, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have negotiated potential deals with China, only to have him reject them and impose further tariffs. Cutting these trade barriers to zero would be an extraordinarily complex political challenge on both sides of the Atlantic.The trade war\u2019s impact on some companies is causing their stocks to crater. So far, the hit is largely coming from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have pushed up the prices many firms pay for the metals.The current spending bill that Mr. Trump signed earlier this year expires at the end of September, the end of the current fiscal year. Congress is unlikely to pass another comprehensive spending bill before then.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Used Clothing", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationIn October 2011, at a thrift store in Washington, I bought a vintage black suit jacket, finely crosshatched with gray-and-crimson plaid. It didn\u2019t cost much, and I intended to wear it on Halloween \u2014 a signifier, I hoped, of Bob Dylan circa \u201cBlonde on Blonde.\u201d Having served its purpose, it would presumably hang in my closet until I threw it away.But it looked uncannily new. Though its exterior felt coarse, its lining was a silky burnt sienna. A tag revealed that it was handmade by Hickey Freeman, which now makes jackets that cost a thousand dollars or more. Even its buttons, with their woven reliefs and double-beveled edges, were beautiful. And it fit remarkably well. I ended up wearing it often \u2014 and then, months later, discovered a note in one of its pockets. It was just two sentences written in cursive on a yellowed postcard: \u201cThis suit was in the plane with Homer on December 6, 1974. It fell clear (was in a plastic suit bag) and was returned to us by funeral home.\u201dIt became impossible not to dwell on the implications, in all their potent incompleteness. The jacket belonged to a man named Homer, and it fell to earth during the plane crash that killed him. Clothing had always seemed fragile, defeated by ink, by moths, by an elbow bursting through a sleeve. This jacket survived a disaster that took a life. I began wearing it to graduations and business meetings, weddings and first dates. When I moved to New York to work at a magazine, the jacket came with me, and when I was wearing it at lunch one day, I told some co-workers about the note. They wondered if I might be able to learn more.I returned to my desk and typed the words \u201cHomer\u201d and \u201ccrash,\u201d and the date from the postcard, into Google. Among the first results was a lengthy document: the ruling in a wrongful-death lawsuit detailing the crash of a twin-engine Cessna near Pine Bluff, Ark. It also described a man in one of the rear seats. His name was Homer Hendrickson, and the crash took place a few weeks before his 52nd birthday. I believe he would not mind my sharing all this because he had worked as a reporter for The Arkansas Democrat and as maritime editor for The Cleveland Plain Dealer. He was, like me, a journalist.This is how Homer died, according to the court document. On Dec. 6, 1974, at approximately 5:24 p.m., an associate of Homer\u2019s from the shipping industry \u2014 a skilled pilot who hoped to buy the Cessna \u2014 took off from New Orleans on a test flight, accompanied by a colleague, a representative of the aircraft\u2019s owner and Homer. As they descended after dark amid drizzle and fog, visibility was perilously low. The Pine Bluff airport had no radar at the time, and its control tower was staffed by an F.A.A. trainee.\u201cCleared to land,\u201d the trainee announced over the radio. \u201cThe runway lights are at the highest intensity.\u201d\u201cRoger,\u201d the pilot replied. \u201cLeave them on bright for me.\u201d Soon after, he announced that they had missed the landing and would try again.The trainee saw the visibility begin to fall to zero and alerted an air-traffic controller in Little Rock \u2014 but not the Cessna. In the flight\u2019s final moments, the plane struck a tree\u2019s small top branches. Then its left wing hit a 50-foot oak. It eventually came to rest, upside down, not far from an open field. \u201cAll aboard were killed,\u201d the court stated. \u201cAs it so often happens in the case of an airplane crash, there were no eyewitnesses.\u201dI learned that Homer had been married for 25 years, and that he and his wife had three children, all of them in college. He was described as \u201can ideal husband\u201d and an excellent newspaperman. Particularly devastating was an account of his wife\u2019s anguish over his unanticipated death: She left work, lost weight, was overcome by crying spells. The court awarded her more than $800,000 in damages.I\u2019ve often wondered what it all means \u2014 the small miracle of the jacket\u2019s survival, of its story\u2019s slow unfurling. To me, it means that used clothing isn\u2019t just used, but rather soaked in the lives of the living and the dead. It means that clothes, for all their seeming functionality, fragility and disposability, can be more like medieval tapestries: mysterious, legible and enduring. Maybe \u201cused\u201d isn\u2019t even the right word for garments like these. Nowadays I think of them as \u201cother people\u2019s clothing.\u201d I respect them more, not because of what they do \u2014 how they look or fit or feel \u2014 but because the object was here before me and may very well be here after. It has, quite literally, a life of its own.Thinking like this is an exercise in empathy. For years, I have possessed a suede jacket that my father bought with a bonus from one of his first jobs, and a bracelet, my mother\u2019s, from a girlhood trip to the Dakotas. Only recently have I been moved to tears picturing those moments, before so many of life\u2019s complexities set in \u2014 his giving himself a gift, her first encounter with the plains. In high school, I bought several shirts from a thrift store, each one\u2019s collar marked with the same name. Now I wonder who he was and whether he had died.I still look up Homer sometimes. I\u2019ve seen a digital photo of his tombstone and read a descendant\u2019s postings on Ancestry.com. In all likelihood, I have worn his jacket much more than he ever did, so much that it\u2019s missing a button and the lining has split around the shoulders. But I don\u2019t feel like its true owner; I\u2019m more of a witness. Another person\u2019s clothing never really belongs to you.Daniel Fromson is a copy editor for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Memories Hiding in My Data Dump", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking through information stored by Facebook and Google was like reading a diary I hadn\u2019t intended to keep. The first message I saw when I downloaded my Facebook data referenced a long-forgotten encounter. Eleven years ago, two weeks before my senior year of high school, I had \u2014 apparently \u2014 written an angry note to a guy on a clunky Dell desktop (no iPhones yet) from the bedroom I shared with my sister at our parents\u2019 home in Brooklyn. I laughed out loud as I reread the more-than-a-decade-old conversation from my desk at The New York Times, where I work as a visuals producer. I found myself to be the instigator of a confrontational exchange, an uncharacteristic position for me. The safe distance of being behind a computer screen had emboldened me at the time, but now it made me cringe. As I read our correspondence, I was unnerved to realize that I had no memory of this stranger. I looked up his profile, expecting to understand our connection, but I still couldn\u2019t place him. Yet the record of him in my life was clear; it was right here in my downloads folder. I found myself digging through his Facebook page, only to learn that he had passed away. I immediately closed my computer, feeling I had somehow overstepped my inquiry.But it was much more interesting to be a voyeur of myself.At the dawn of social media, I never would have imagined that my youth was being recorded. Looking at the data now is like accessing pages from a diary I didn\u2019t intend to keep \u2014 an honest snapshot of my speaking habits, my treatment of other people and their treatment of me, over the course of more than a decade. It was highly telling in the way anything captured by an insentient machine can be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Google $5.1 Billion in Android Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities fined Google a record $5.1 billion on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices, in one of the most aggressive regulatory actions against American technology giants and one that may force lasting changes to smartphones.The fine was coupled with remedies that would effectively loosen Google\u2019s grip over its Android software, which is used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones and is a key part of the Silicon Valley company\u2019s business. Those changes, which European regulators ordered to take effect in 90 days, undercut Google\u2019s ability to automatically include its own search and other apps in mobile devices, opening it to more competition in a market that it has dominated.\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. \u201cThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\u201dThe size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects the seriousness and the sustained nature\u201d of Google\u2019s actions.Regardless of an appeal, if Google does not start altering its mobile phone practices in 90 days, it faces penalties of up to 5 percent of the worldwide average daily revenue of its parent company, Alphabet.\u201cAndroid has enabled this and created more choice for everyone, not less,\u201d he added.Yet the ultimate effect of Wednesday\u2019s ruling may be muted given that Europe has largely acted alone in its regulatory actions against Silicon Valley titans, though there have been signs recently of shifting attitudes and a tougher stance by officials in the United States.At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said that the mobile-software market was concentrated and that he spoke with Ms. Vestager on Tuesday.\u201cLet me just say we\u2019re going to read what the E.U. put out very closely,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe European Commission left Google to come up with its own ways to comply with the decision, an approach that critics said gave the company room to soften the blow. Competitors said that after Google was fined \u20ac2.4 billion, or $2.7 billion, in an antitrust case last year for favoring its comparison-shopping service in search results, the company sidestepped the rules. Google has appealed that decision.\u201cGetting a good headline and a big fine is one thing. Fixing the market is quite another,\u201d said Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo, a comparison-shopping site that has filed complaints against Google to regulators.Google\u2019s services remain immensely popular, and its stock price, profits and revenue continue to soar. Since the European Commission began investigating Android three years ago, annual revenue for Alphabet has grown to $111 billion from $75 billion. Google has also strengthened its dominance in the mobile phone market, with more than 1.25 billion Android handsets sold globally last year, according to the research firm IDC.The case underscores the broader challenge regulators face in overseeing the digital economy. By the time the authorities home in on an area deserving of scrutiny, the market may have moved on.\u201cFast-moving markets are where competition law is most important,\u201d said Jonathan Kanter, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss and a former antitrust investigator for the Federal Trade Commission, who has worked for Google competitors including Yelp. But \u201cwhen you have cases that are many years old, you\u2019re fighting old battles instead of the next one.\u201dAt the heart of the European Commission\u2019s case was the question of whether Google had abused its power by forcing handset makers like Samsung, Huawei and HTC to make its Google Search and Chrome browser the default services on Android-based devices in order to gain access to other Google apps.While Google gives Android away to handset makers, those companies must effectively pre-install 11 Google apps on their devices, giving Google\u2019s products far greater reach and more users to click on its ads. The strategy has enabled Google to reach more than a billion monthly users for six products: search, maps, Gmail, YouTube, the Chrome internet browser, and the Google Play app and media store.Now the European authorities are ordering Google to stop tying Google Search and Chrome to the Google Play store. In addition, antitrust officials said Google must stop providing financial incentives to handset makers and wireless carriers to favor its services, a practice the company stopped in 2014.In another remedy, European officials ordered that Google must allow handset manufacturers to create their own versions of Android software, otherwise known as \u201cforks.\u201d Google had previously discouraged the rise of competing smartphone software based on Android by blocking manufacturers\u2019 access to Google apps if they built devices using any alternative versions.The case has parallels to a similarly significant action against Microsoft in the 2000s, when it was heavily penalized in Europe and the United States for using its power in the personal computer market to bundle in its own internet browser, boxing out its rivals. At the time, Google, a young upstart, was among those to complain about Microsoft\u2019s practices.Some Google rivals cheered Wednesday\u2019s decision. Locking handset makers into deals with Google made it \u201cvery challenging to compete,\u201d Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine, said in an interview. \u201cWe would hope the U.S. would ultimately follow suit and take another look at this.\u201dBut handset makers may continue to pre-install Google\u2019s Chrome and Search because consumers like them \u2014 or because Google pays them to do it.\u201cThe reality is there are not that many other players that can compete, so in some ways, I think the E.U. is fighting a battle that\u2019s already over,\u201d said Ben Schachter, a technology analyst at Macquarie Securities.Google could ultimately decide to charge handset makers for using Android in Europe, a policy shift that could drive up the prices of some handsets.Google argued that the European decision was an attack on its ad-based business model. The company said it required handset makers to use its suite of apps as a way of recouping the billions of dollars it spends to make Android. The arrangement, the company said, lets manufacturers compete with Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, by making phones and tablets of various designs and prices, while Google makes money through its services.Mr. Kanter, the lawyer, said that although Google had largely won the battle to embed Android into smartphones, Wednesday\u2019s ruling could limit how the company approached new areas where the software was being used, including automobiles and internet-connected home electronics.The regulatory push in Europe might also influence others around the world to take a tougher look at Silicon Valley, he added.\u201cTo say that any single action by the European Commission is going to stop them is probably na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Kanter said. \u201cBut movements have to start somewhere, and good, strong, persistent, decisive action can over time have an effect.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from Brussels, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.
