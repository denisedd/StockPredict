{"Headline": "Zero Tolerance for Zero Tolerance", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe children at the border are just the latest casualty of this deeply misguided approach to public policy.Ms. Yoffe is a contributing editor at The Atlantic and a contributing writer at HuffPost\u2019s Highline. This Thursday the Trump administration faces a deadline handed down earlier this summer by a United States District Court judge: reunite the children separated from their parents at the border by federal law enforcement. There\u2019s no way the White House will pull it off. Reports indicate that hundreds of parents will not be seeing their children because the government can\u2019t locate the parents or has already deported them.This entire catastrophe isn\u2019t just the result of a deliberately cruel and incompetently implemented policy, though it is certainly that. These sundered families are the latest casualty of \u201czero tolerance\u201d \u2014 a misguided mind-set that bludgeons the people it targets, no matter how vulnerable.For a generation, American policymakers have been addicted to zero tolerance as a response to all social ills: crime, drugs, sexual violations \u2014 even misbehaving schoolchildren.Start with crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal and state governments went on a criminal justice binge, vastly expanding our criminal codes, especially in the \u201cwars\u201d against crime and drugs and deploying zero-tolerance policing. The result is that some 70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2014 a number equal to Americans with a college degree, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. We remain the nation that \u201cincarcerates a larger share of its population than any other,\u201d according to a recent Pew Research Center report. This despite the fact that crime in the United States is at a modern low.She was black, and the family brought a suit claiming racial discrimination. They ultimately won, but those who have tracked the implementation and consequences of zero-tolerance policies have documented how black and brown people are disproportionately punished by them.In the years since, similarly absurd incidents have become a feature of school life. Take the 2015 case of the sixth-grade Virginia boy referred to juvenile court and suspended for almost the entire year because he had a leaf in his backpack that administrators thought was marijuana. Even after tests confirmed the 11-year-old was in possession of a leaf from a maple tree, the suspension stood because the leaf resembled cannabis, and the state policy required that administrators notify police and possibly expel students for possessing \u201cimitation\u201d drugs. Widespread outrage over these kinds of cases has led some state legislatures, like Texas\u2019, to pass zero-tolerance reforms. But once zero tolerance has been adopted, it\u2019s not easy to undo the bureaucratic incentive to punish indiscriminately. This year, according to a report by Texas Appleseed and other public interest groups, more than 1,200 Texas schoolchildren were referred to law enforcement for making \u201cterroristic threats,\u201d a potential felony. One such \u201cthreat\u201d: a 12-year-old with a disability who made a gun with his fingers and pretended to shoot at make-believe creatures in a hallway. He was arrested.Usually at the beginning of a zero-tolerance campaign, those leading the charge promise it will vanquish the worst of the worst: the drug kingpins, the gang leaders, the serial sexual predators, the murderers. But it inevitably turns out there aren\u2019t very many of them. So the definition of what will not be tolerated starts expanding, allowing politicians and other moral arbiters to say they are cleansing society of those who commit any kind of lapse. People who urge a more proportionate, incremental and individualized response to complex problems are tarred as being some percentage \u2014 usually 100 \u2014 tolerant of the menaces that trouble us.A central example of this kind of category expansion is the sex-offender registry. It began more than 20 years ago after several horrific murders of children by serial predators. Today, around 900,000 people are on the registry. Exceedingly few of them are the kinds of criminals who prompted the list in the first place. One is an 18-year-old in New Hampshire who asked a 15-year-old of his acquaintance for sex. Nothing happened. But adults found out about the proposition, and because the 18-year-old made the request via computer, he is on the registry for life. Then there is the severely intellectually disabled Missouri man who was being molested by a younger male neighbor. The neighbor then convinced the man, who was then 26 years old and living with his parents, to expose himself to an underage female. Both the men were arrested, and the disabled man has been on the registry ever since. Because of his conviction, he can no longer participate in the Special Olympics or clear tables at a local restaurant where he used to work. The legal bills exhausted his parents\u2019 retirement funds. Despite the overwhelming evidence that zero-tolerance policies sweep up the harmless and the innocent, we are so habituated to thinking in zero-tolerance terms that when a new issue appears, it is often our default response. Some feminists, myself included, have raised this concern about this aspect of the #MeToo movement. We worry that a zero-tolerance approach could undermine the movement\u2019s moral authority by destroying the careers of men without first fairly assessing the allegations against them and by failing to make distinctions about a wide range of misconduct.Zero tolerance is also washing over corporations in the form of firings for speech that is deemed offensive. You can agree that Roseanne Barr deserved to be fired for her overtly racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett and also be concerned that people are losing their jobs for far less. Last December, a Netflix executive named Andy Yeatman was approached while coaching his daughter\u2019s soccer game and asked why an actor on a Netflix series who had been accused of rape had not been fired. Mr. Yeatman was not connected to that series, and to end the conversation he said such things were taken very seriously at Netflix, but maybe in this case the accusations weren\u2019t believed. He immediately regretted his remark \u2014 but it was too late. The woman who had approached him said she was a victim of the actor, and while still on the field, Mr. Yeatman got a call from a reporter. He was fired a few days later.There is nothing like audio of terrified children, accounts of their deplorable detention conditions and the realization some families may never be reunited to cause national revulsion at this iteration of the Trump administration\u2019s touted zero-tolerance stance. What happened is not only a moral outrage, but, in following the zero-tolerance playbook, has been a huge diversion of resources. The Department of Health and Human Services has \u201cburned through at least $40 million in the past two months for the care and reunification of migrant children,\u201d according to Politico.To prevent such future injustices, and to address the many continuing ones, we should adopt a new approach: zero tolerance for zero tolerance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HBO Must Get Bigger and Broader, Says Its New Overseer", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChange is coming to HBO, now that it is part of the AT&T corporate family. That much was clear to the 150 employees who attended a recent town hall meeting at the network\u2019s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The main speaker was John Stankey, a longtime AT&T executive who now oversees HBO in his new role as chief executive of Warner Media. During a straight-shooting, hourlong talk, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, he laid out his rough vision for the network, and warned his audience that the months ahead would not be easy.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough year,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work to alter and change direction a little bit.\u201dBut the town hall meeting suggested that AT&T would not be a passive corporate parent.Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s gregarious and urbane chief executive, hosted the talk at the cozy HBO Theater on the building\u2019s 15th floor. Mr. Stankey\u2019s appearance came as part of a tour that included stops at Warner Bros. and Turner, the media properties that were once part of Time Warner and now belong to AT&T\u2019s Warner Media division.Mr. Plepler, 58, and Mr. Stankey, 55, sat angled slightly toward each other on the modest stage. During the conversation, which began at noon on June 19, Mr. Stankey never uttered the word \u201cNetflix,\u201d but he did suggest that HBO would have to become more like a streaming giant to thrive in the new media landscape.Mr. Stankey described a future in which HBO would substantially increase its subscriber base and the number of hours that viewers spend watching its shows. To pull it off, the network will have to come up with more content, transforming itself from a boutique operation, with a focus on its signature Sunday night lineup, into something bigger and broader.\u201cWe need hours a day,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. \u201cIt\u2019s not hours a week, and it\u2019s not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people\u2019s hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.\u201dContinuing the theme, he added: \u201cI want more hours of engagement. Why are more hours of engagement important? Because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrow\u2019s world.\u201dKnown for \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d HBO has long favored quality over quantity. Its high-gloss productions often take years to develop and can cost millions per episode. That approach has won the network more Primetime Emmy Awards than any of its competitors over the last 16 years, with Mr. Plepler the master curator.In recent years, Mr. Plepler has emphasized HBO\u2019s \u201cbespoke culture\u201d and its enduring appeal to A-list producers and stars at a time when Netflix, Amazon and Apple have bottomless budgets. On his watch, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d has brought the Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep to the network, and shows like \u201cBarry\u201d and \u201cInsecure\u201d have charmed critics. But during the town hall meeting, Mr. Stankey said HBO should consider trying something new.\u201cAs I step back and think about what\u2019s unique about the brand and where it needs to go, there\u2019s got to be a little more depth to it, there\u2019s got to be more frequent engagement,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. Bringing the point home, he added that HBO must \u201cbuild that brand so that it\u2019s broad enough to make that happen.\u201dMr. Plepler tried to pin down Mr. Stankey on the question of how much AT&T planned to invest. Without specifying any certain amount, Mr. Stankey said, \u201cI do believe there needs to be stepped-up investment.\u201dMr. Plepler interjected: \u201cLet\u2019s give him a hand for that simple sentence! That simple sentence deserves a hand!\u201d\u201cAlso,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?\u201d\u201cWe do that,\u201d Mr. Plepler responded, to scattered applause.\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cJust not enough.\u201d\u201cOh, now, now, be careful,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.HBO has, in fact, been a consistent moneymaker. Over the last three years, while allocating more than $2 billion a year to its programming, the network has made nearly $6 billion in profit. But if it is to compete with upstart rivals like Netflix, which plans to lay out some $8 billion this year, its level of spending must increase considerably.\u201cWe well understand that we played the best hand we could with the hand we had,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cAnd we well understand that that is not going to be sustainable going forward.\u201dMr. Stankey also said that the network\u2019s number of subscribers \u2014 40 million in the United States, out of 142 million worldwide \u2014 was not going to cut it. HBO will have to find a way \u201cto move beyond 35 to 40 percent penetration to have this become a much more common product,\u201d he said, referring to its current market size.At the same time, he acknowledged that HBO has commanded deep loyalty: \u201cYou\u2019ve earned the dynamic amongst your customer base that when you put a new piece of content out there, people will try it, just because they trust you\u2019re going to be putting something in front of them that they might like. We now need to figure out how to expand the aperture of it without losing the quality.\u201dRepresentatives for the network and Warner Media declined to comment for this article.To make a bigger, broader HBO, while also guarding its distinctive identity, the two executives will have to find a way to work together despite their differences.The California-born Mr. Stankey, who lives in Texas and has donated to a number of Republican campaigns, cuts a lower profile. He started his telecommunications career at Pacific Bell in 1985 and has served in various roles at AT&T, including chief technology officer and head of the company\u2019s DirecTV unit. On the stage of the HBO Theater, he described himself as a \u201cBell-head,\u201d a term that was probably lost on the people in the seats.During the talk, Mr. Plepler seemed willing to make changes. \u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018More is not better, only better is better,\u2019 because that was the hand we had,\u201d he said, as Mr. Stankey looked on. \u201cI\u2019ve switched that, now that you\u2019re here, to: \u2018More isn\u2019t better, only better is better \u2014 but we need a lot more to be even better.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey\u2019s experience at AT&T \u2014 which offers two streaming services, DirectTV Now and WatchTV \u2014 has given him a deep familiarity with the recent shift in how media is distributed. He warned that there would be only so many streaming companies in the future. If HBO would like to end up as a heavyweight in the industry, he said, it would be wise to add \u201cother types of content\u201d to what is available on its stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now.He also made the case that HBO\u2019s employees should consider themselves fortunate to have AT&T as their new corporate parent, rather than a company in the same business.\u201cThe good news for many of you in this organization is that it\u2019s not Fox or Disney sitting up on this stage now,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no duplication with AT&T in what we do.\u201dIn other words, your jobs are safe.But he cautioned that HBO\u2019s employees would notice a change in tempo and metabolism in the days ahead. \u201cI suspect if we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re going to be investing heavier, that means that there\u2019s going to be more work for all of you to do \u2014 and you\u2019re going to be working a little bit harder,\u201d Mr. Stankey said.After comparing the next 12 months to a \u201cdog year,\u201d he invoked another metaphor.\u201cYou will work very hard, and this next year will \u2014 my wife hates it when I say this \u2014 feel like childbirth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll look back on it and be very fond of it, but it\u2019s not going to feel great while you\u2019re in the middle of it. She says, \u2018What do you know about this?\u2019 I just observe, \u2018Honey. We love our kids.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey also said he was starting to get used to the media glare that has gone along with his new, high-profile job. When he mentioned that the newspapers have lately shown an interest in his personal life, Mr. Plepler cut him off.\u201cYou\u2019re now in the entertainment business, John,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no secrets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Membership will be $8 a month, roughly in line with other stand-alone streaming services, and also includes access to digital comic books and exclusive merchandise.Faced with sluggish sales, comic book publishers can use the direct-to-consumer efforts to create a stronger relationship with their readers, Mr. Griepp said.\u201cThey present their brands and their content directly to these fans and expand their brand footprint,\u201d he said.Fans, in turn, can find a space to interact with each other and with the writers and artists of the comic books, said Mr. Lee of DC. \u201cWe want to build a gold standard,\u201d he said.Mr. Griepp said DC had tested the waters with DC Super Hero Girls, a franchise that included streaming animated shorts and an array of licensed merchandise like books, clothing and toys. He sees a similar move from Marvel Entertainment with Marvel Rising, a new property about the next generation of Marvel heroes including animated shorts, a TV movie and comic books.Mr. Griepp said that could mean Marvel ends up with a platform of streaming content of smaller properties. Marvel declined to comment on its plans.Smaller comic book publishers are testing their own direct-to-consumer platforms. Image Comics, the publisher of popular titles like The Walking Dead and Saga, started a direct-to-consumer platform in 2015 to sell comic book subscriptions and apparel.\u201cWhile there are many incredible brick-and-mortar stores, unfortunately not everyone is lucky enough to have one in their area,\u201d Corey Hart, director of sales at Image Comics, said in a statement. \u201cImage Direct was built in order to reach those exact readers.\u201dThis month, Dark Horse Comics announced its service, Dark Horse Direct, which will focus on high-end products like statues.\u201cThe goal is getting our products into as many hands a possible,\u201d said Melissa Lomax, the director of e-commerce for Dark Horse, which promoted the service at Comic-Con. \u201cWe want to try to reach fans that may not necessarily have seen our product elsewhere.\u201dThat access is important, Mr. Griepp said, because some comic book shops will not carry expensive merchandise.\u201cThe strategy is just to make sure there is no unfilled demand in a rural area or small town,\u201d he said.Comic book publishers are quick to point out that their initiatives are intended to augment retail sales, not cannibalize them. In fact, DC recently announced a deal to reprint comic books and sell them in more than 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.Dan DiDio, the other co-publisher of DC Entertainment, said that if the program is successful, he hoped to broaden it to include other retailers.\u201cWe want to find a way to put these in the hands of folks who don\u2019t have a chance to read them other ways,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of one of the partner companies in the DC Universe platform. The company is Warner Bros. Digital Networks, not Warner Bros. Digital Studios.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Know More About \u2018GLOW\u2019 Season 2? Here\u2019s What to Read", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe beauty of \u201cGLOW\u201d is its clever approach to way-dumbness,\u201d writes the critic Troy Patterson. \u201cEmbracing silliness without apology and clich\u00e9 without self-consciousness, the series invites viewers to disable their senses of irony. It is best apprehended as a decadent descendant of vaudeville spectacle, which helps to account for its mood swings, to excuse the scattered quality of its action and to explain the high spirits of its low-culture bricolage.\u201dSophie Gilbert has a different take on the show\u2019s appeal. \u201cRuth, as Season 1 documented, might be a serious actress stepping into the strange new world of spandex and somersault leg drops, but she\u2019s indubitably gratified by her new gig, and by the feeling of empowerment it gives her,\u201d Gilbert writes. \u201cThe thrill of the first season of Carly Mensch and Liz Flahive\u2019s series wasn\u2019t in its bedazzled \u201980s aesthetics. It was in the rare opportunity to see a television show about a group of women finding fulfillment at work.\u201dUnlike, her co-stars \u2014 who are actors playing wrestlers \u2014 Kia Stevens competed in the ring for more than a decade before landing a role in \u201cGLOW.\u201d In fact, her trajectory has a lot in common with her character Tamm\u00e9\u2019s, which Stevens discussed with Alison Herman in an interview about the scene in which her character is humiliated in front of her high-achieving son, Earnest (Eli Goree). \u201cWhen I first went to Japan [to wrestle], I didn\u2019t get to choose my name, Amazing Kong,\u201d Stevens says. After spending some time weighing the racial connotations of the name, she made a decision: \u201cI would make this name my own, and make anyone who sees it, hears it, and relates it to me understand that it\u2019s about respect,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that I did.\u201dIn her recap, LaToya Ferguson highlights the bittersweet nature of the episode\u2019s conclusion. \u201cWhile Earnest accepts his mother\u2019s work by the end of the episode \u2014 admitting that she was right about it all being offensive \u2014 and decides to treat her to dinner for a job well done, it doesn\u2019t mean he suddenly loves pro wrestling or that he fully understands why she needs to do this,\u201d Ferguson writes. \u201cThe tears that were in both of their eyes during the \u201cGET A JOB\u201d moment still happened.\u201dIn a round-table interview about the episode, Gilpin explains that the most important scene happens when Debbie chastises Ruth for leaving the hotel room. \u201cRuth\u2019s breakdown was with Debbie,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where you can tell it\u2019s 1985. I feel like a very modern thing, sadly, is something I felt very strongly at the Women\u2019s March: Women coming forward and saying, \u2018I\u2019ve been so lonely in my shame. This is something that I thought only I experienced, and only I felt.\u2019\u201d\u201cShooting those scenes did bring up some personal feelings for me \u2014 which I sort of didn\u2019t expect,\u201d Brie reflects, in a conversation with Jess Joho. \u201cHonestly, when I first read it I was like, \u2018Is this scene bad enough? Is he really doing anything bad?\u2019 And then I had to stop and realize, \u2018Oh, wow, I\u2019ve been in a lot of bad situations. And I\u2019ve really normalized that kind behavior, even for myself.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to look like fakey VHS that would make you laugh,\u201d the series\u2019s co-creator Carly Mensch explains to Danielle Turchiano. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be a comment on anything, we didn\u2019t want the point to be, \u2018Oh look how old this footage is.\u2019 We wanted you to feel like you were inside the show, inside the camera with us.\u201dVulture\u2019s recapper for the series, Kenny Herzog, enumerates the ways in which this bizarre episode pushes the show\u2019s plot forward, including: \u201cRosalie\u2019s aforementioned enter-stage-right and its attendant, ensuing repercussions; a chance for Arthie to finally layer Beirut with more than just terroristic howls (sharing your hospital candy with Sam apparently goes a long way); a vivid illustration of what Sam meant when he complimented Ruth as \u2018an idea machine\u2019; and some clarity on how they were going to compensate for Ruth\u2019s (and hence, Zoya\u2019s) prolonged in-ring absence (i.e. beef up Liberty Belle\u2019s fan favoritism by having her overcome multiple ethnic heels).\u201dIf the (surely temporary) end of Ruth and Sam\u2019s flirtation left you wanting more, Ben Travers\u2019s interview with Brie and Maron might soothe your sadness. \u201cSam is shut down, but I think he\u2019s probably more protective than he is emotionally incapable,\u201d Maron says. \u201cCertainly in this season, I think once [the scene in the movie theater] happens, it really becomes clear that Sam is not as un-self-aware as you assume. He\u2019s sort of conscious of taking care of her to a certain degree, or looking out for her, but he knows who he is.\u201d\u201cThe friendships both Ruth and Debbie engage with the rest of the cast are markedly uneven,\u201d writes Rachel Vorona Cote. \u201cThey tend to list against the women of color \u2014 particularly Carmen Wade (Britney Young), Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel) and Tamm\u00e9, whose work in the ring is \u2018GLOW\u2019\u2019s lifeblood. \u2018GLOW\u2019 is a spectacle of women\u2019s empowerment, but the show makes clear, in this business not all women are empowered equally.\u201dFinally, an answer to the question fans have been dying to ask since Season 1: What\u2019s the story behind Sheila the She-Wolf\u2019s get-up? According to the show\u2019s costume designer, Beth Morgan: \u201cThis is a homemade version of a homemade look. We built this fur shirt from a wife-beater; old fur coats and old fur pillows. Things you would find around the house. Sheila\u2019s look is really curated for her. It is not quite finished, she is always a work in progress. We spent the most time on her in prep, as collaborators, figuring out what that look would be.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best and Worst Movie Trailers From Comic-Con", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor fans of movie trailers, Comic-Con International is one of the most exciting events of the year, right alongside Super Bowl Sunday. Although the Marvel Cinematic Universe (which traditionally releases many of the most highly anticipated trailers) skipped this summer\u2019s just-concluded convention, plenty of other buzzworthy promotional clips were released. Here are the 10 best and worst, ranked from most promising to least.If there\u2019s been one element missing from movies based on DC Comics, it\u2019s wit. That situation may be rectified, if the zany trailer for \u201cShazam!\u201d is any indication. It\u2019s the origin story of how a foster child, Billy Batson (Asher Angel), uses the titular incantation to transform into the namesake superhero (Zachary Levi). The story seems to play less like a cartoonish action movie and more like a giddy riff on \u201cBig,\u201d as Billy grows up in a huge way and revels in his newfound powers. (April 5)The provocative, visceral trailer for this satirical teen thriller suggests it\u2019s the demon spawn of \u201cHeathers\u201d and \u201cThe Purge\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s not a bad thing. Violence and chaos break loose in the not coincidentally named town of Salem after a data hack exposes the seamy texts, photos and secrets of the residents. A group of high school girls takes up arms to resist the deadly misogyny unleashed by the breach. This Sundance Film Festival favorite was written and directed by Sam Levinson, a son of the writer-director Barry Levinson, best known for kinder, gentler films like \u201cRain Man\u201d and \u201cDiner.\u201d It looks like the apple has fallen extremely far from the tree. (Sept. 21)In this adaptation of a popular Japanese manga, Alita (Rosa Salazar) is an amnesiac cyborg who\u2019s saved from a scrap heap by a doctor in a dystopian future. All she remembers are her lethal fighting skills, which she uses to face off against enemies and seek the truth about her past. The cast includes the Oscar winners Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly. The powerhouse team behind the cameras are the producers James Cameron and Jon Landau (\u201cTitanic,\u201d \u201cAvatar\u201d) and director Robert Rodriguez (\u201cSin City\u201d). Going by the familiar-looking trailer, it\u2019s too soon to say whether the film will win over fans. (Dec. 21)The latest effort to reboot the Japanese horror series (the last two tries didn\u2019t really take) isn\u2019t due for nearly a year, so it\u2019s not a surprise that we see precious little footage of the title creature himself, nor of his nemeses Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. Instead the trailer focuses on the film\u2019s impressive cast: Millie Bobby Brown (\u201cStranger Things\u201d), Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. and Zhang Ziyi. Now that\u2019s a monster lineup. (May 31)After his underwhelming appearances in \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d and \u201cJustice League,\u201d Jason Momoa\u2019s sea-dwelling superhero finally gets his own movie. The trailer, which features spectacular visuals, trumpets the name of director James Wan, a big draw in horror (\u201cSaw,\u201d \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d) who moved into action movies with the 2015 car-crash smash \u201cFurious 7.\u201d Yet the plot \u2014 Aquaman battles his half brother (Patrick Wilson) to be the king of the undersea world \u2014 makes the film seem like DC\u2019s blatant attempt to clone Marvel\u2019s \u201cThor\u201d franchise, only with a trident instead of a hammer. (Dec. 21)The umpteenth incarnation of this tale raises several questions, all of which begin with \u201cwhy.\u201d Why make another version of the rob-from-the-rich bandit\u2019s tale when no less than Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe tried and failed to breathe new life into the character less than a decade ago? Why cast Taron Egerton in the title role when, despite his agreeable performances in the \u201cKingsman\u201d movies, no one has ever said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go see that new Taron Egerton movie tonight?\u201d Why give Ben Mendelsohn another stock-villain part as the Sheriff of Nottingham, after he\u2019s done bad guys to death in \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d \u201cReady Player One,\u201d the Netflix drama \u201cBloodline\u201d and the Australian film \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d? Why shoot some scenes in a slo-mo style that hasn\u2019t felt innovative since \u201cThe Matrix\u201d and \u201c300\u201d? (Nov. 21)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shonda Rhimes Describes Her Grand Netflix Ambitions", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "The star producer reveals the eight shows she plans to make for the streaming service, which wooed her away from ABC with a nine-figure deal.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Shonda Rhimes achieved almost everything a television producer could hope for during her long run at ABC. She made herself into not only one of the most prolific writer-producers in the business, but also a mogul, as the founder and head of the Shondaland production company. ABC filled its entire Thursday night lineup with shows created or produced by her \u2014 a body of work that includes \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d \u2014 but Ms. Rhimes was restless.Now, after signing a multiyear, nine-figure deal with Netflix, Ms. Rhimes will try to match or top her network success in the wide-open expanse of streaming, free of time slots, commercial interruptions, and restrictions on language and content.In an interview at a NeueHouse work space here \u2014 during which she laid out her Netflix plans for the first time \u2014 Ms. Rhimes sounded confident that she will deliver something unexpected.\u201cEverybody thinks that there\u2019s a \u2018Shondaland show,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s a Shondaland show that we made for ABC. Now I can\u2019t wait to show everybody what a Shondaland show is that we make for the world.\u201dNetflix\u2019s courtship of Ms. Rhimes began, in earnest, in the late fall of 2016. At the time, she had more than a year to go on her ABC contract, so she didn\u2019t tell anyone at the network about the breakfast she had planned with Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix.With her agent, Chris Silbermann of ICM Partners, in tow, Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Sarandos took a table in the back of Republique, a casual restaurant on South La Brea Avenue. During the sit-down, Ms. Rhimes was frank with Mr. Sarandos about how she viewed her next act.\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to make you a second \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cThat was one of the first things I said. And he said, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in you making a second \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u2019\u201dWord of the breakfast made its way to The Hollywood Reporter \u2014 but the brief item that ran soon afterward in the trade publication\u2019s Power Dining column failed to identify Ms. Rhimes correctly: \u201cNetflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos and wife Nicole Avant ate breakfast with ICM Partners\u2019 Chris Silbermann at Republique,\u201d the item read.\u201cI was like, \u2018For once, bias is working in my favor!\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cNicole and I are both black women. We couldn\u2019t look more not alike. But somebody decided that\u2019s who that must be. And it saved me a whole lot of trouble.\u201dLast August, Netflix and Ms. Rhimes had an agreement for a contract with a base salary of around $150 million, with incentives that could kick the producer\u2019s earnings much higher, according to two people with knowledge of the deal.The news of a streaming company\u2019s successful wooing of a major network producer hit Hollywood like an earthquake. As Dana Walden, co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, described it this year, \u201cThat sent a message to the entire talent community: There\u2019s a new template in town. For any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.\u201dMs. Rhimes, 48, is among the select few television producers whose work has helped define a cultural moment. In the \u201980s, there was Steven Bochco, with \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d and \u201cL.A. Law.\u201d Next came David E. Kelley, of \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d and \u201cThe Practice\u201d fame. And then there was Ms. Rhimes, who made her mark during what would turn out to be the last years of appointment television viewing.The producer and director J. J. Abrams, who has known Ms. Rhimes for several years, said she brought something distinctive to network programming.\u201cThe thing that you can\u2019t deny is her characters are surprising, her characters are vulnerable, her characters are ambitious, her characters are broken, and her characters are involved in situations that are shocking and stressful,\u201d Mr. Abrams said. \u201cShe is able to tell real stories in ways that feel relatable.\u201dMs. Rhimes said she had two principal goals for her time at Netflix. One is to come up with shows that are more expansive than her ABC fare. The other is to turn Shondaland into an enduring company that will live within Netflix in the same way that Marvel exists inside the Walt Disney Company.\u201cIt would be really amazing to me at some point down the line \u2014 not now \u2014 if somebody said, \u2018There was a Shonda for Shondaland?\u2019\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cIt needs to be bigger than me.\u201dIn the days after signing the deal, she was enthusiastic about the creative freedom Netflix had promised her, but found herself with an immediate problem: She had no idea what she was going to write.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I had a treasure trove of ideas in the back of my head that I\u2019d been hiding and saving,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the panic overtook me for a while.\u201dMr. Abrams had sympathy for his friend\u2019s plight. \u201cYou can have all the success in the world, but none of it matters when you\u2019re there alone with the blank computer screen,\u201d he said.Over the next few months, Ms. Rhimes tended her continuing ABC work and scouted material that could be a fit for Netflix. But she still had no clue about what, exactly, she would throw herself into as a writer-producer.\u201cIn October,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause of who I am, I was like: \u2018Why don\u2019t I have a show yet? I should have a show all written and ready to go. I should have eight episodes all written.\u2019\u201dMr. Sarandos reassured her: You just started, take a breath. Colleagues said there was no way Ms. Rhimes could go deep into something new when she still had to wrap up the seventh and final season of \u201cScandal.\u201dShe flirted with a sci-fi project \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with that, but it hasn\u2019t cracked yet\u201d \u2014 while warding off the well-meaning but irksome questions from people curious about her Netflix plans. After Memorial Day, she escaped the noise of Los Angeles for the quiet of Arizona.\u201cI was trying to meditate, which I can\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said.\u201cI knew exactly what the show was,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said, \u201cwhich is a very clear indicator.\u201dShe bought the rights to the story, by a New York magazine staff writer, Jessica Pressler, and started writing almost immediately.\u201cI felt comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cI slept differently.\u201dBetsy Beers, Ms. Rhimes\u2019s producing partner since 2002, said she could tell Ms. Rhimes was onto something.\u201cWhat I heard was the excitement,\u201d Ms. Beers said. \u201cWhat I wait for is a tone in her voice \u2014 you hear this level of excitement in her voice, where she can\u2019t stop talking about it.\u201dIn addition to the show about the grifter, Ms. Rhimes has seven other series in the works at Netflix, ranging from period dramas to a documentary.\u25a0 \u201cPico & Sepulveda,\u201d a series set in Mexican California during the 1840s.\u25a0 An upstairs-downstairs series called \u201cThe Residence,\u201d based on the 2015 nonfiction book of the same title, by Kate Andersen Brower, about the private lives of United States presidents, their families and White House staff.\u25a0 \u201cSunshine Scouts,\u201d a series that Ms. Rhimes described as a \u201cdarkly comic, ironic, twisty show about some foul-mouthed teenage girls who are trapped at the end of the world.\u201d The writer and director Jill Alexander will be in charge of this one.\u25a0 \u201cHot Chocolate Nutcracker,\u201d a documentary centered on the dancer and choreographer Debbie Allen and her reimagining of the holiday ballet.Ms. Rhimes said the idea of building out Shondaland had been with her for some time. She stressed that she had not grown bored with the work she had been doing for ABC \u2014 far from it \u2014 but she found that she was able to solve crises that once occupied a week of her time in 30 minutes flat. She added that she remained proud of her ABC shows and the spotlight they threw on characters who had gone underrepresented in Hollywood.\u201cWe created a brand and an audience for ABC that they did not necessarily have before, which was a certain kind of woman,\u201d Ms. Rhimes said. \u201cI literally remember when we started, them saying that no woman is going to watch a woman who is this \u2018not nice\u2019 and this sexually active and this competitive.\u201cI really hate the phrase \u2018smart, strong women,\u2019 but the \u2018smart, strong women\u2019 thing really exploded with the shows we made,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd people followed along in a way that felt really good for network television.\u201dIn contrast with her fellow super producer Ryan Murphy, who had talks with Amazon and Fox, his studio at the time, before he decamped to Netflix, Ms. Rhimes knew exactly where she wanted to achieve her Shondaland dream: Netflix.Mr. Sarandos was eager to sign her not only because he was a fan of her work but because of something he noticed in Netflix\u2019s closely guarded data. \u201cMore than half\u201d of Netflix\u2019s 124 million paying subscribers have sampled one of the Shondaland shows available on the streaming service, he said in an interview.As Ms. Rhimes works to develop her lineup, her production company is on its way to a new location: Raleigh Studios, in Hollywood, about a mile from the Netflix headquarters. While checking out the property, Ms. Rhimes and a group of her Shondaland colleagues spent a while staring at a framed photograph on the wall of the United Artists founders Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith. Given Ms. Rhimes\u2019s ambitions for the company, which she sees as a 21st-century incarnation of that artist-driven studio, she considered it a good portent.\u201cWe have this whole dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a row of offices, and we\u2019re all going to be working on our scripts at the same time. And everyone is going to come out of their offices and scream about how bad their script is: \u2018Does anyone know what I\u2019m supposed to do for Act 5?\u2019 And everyone is going to drink Scotch and then run back to work.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s actually going to happen,\u201d Ms. Rhimes continued. \u201cBut it does feel really good to know that it does feel like a very United Artists, creative kind of place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Throws is another name for AREA RUGS.59D: I laughed out loud at this one. Yes, much like the cake in the video game Portal, the clue is a LIE. Three phrases are offered, and they all have consecutive letters in sets of three and two. Boy, that sounds familiar. Where else do we collect sets of three and two?This hand of three of a certain rank and two of a certain rank are known as a FULL HOUSE in poker, and that\u2019s our revealer today, at 57A.As I said, its tough to come up with a good set of these, especially with the letter count restraints. As lively as WELL, LOOKY THERE is, the phrase would have sounded more familiar to me had it been WELL, LOOKY HERE. That would have knocked it out of the running, though, for lack of one letter, so the sacrifice here was familiarity for usefulness. I also felt that the \u201ctwinnish\u201d clue at 63A, \u201cGroundskeepers\u2019 supplies\u201d for SODS, felt a bit duplicative with the theme clue.

The clue for 49D\u2019s SASS (\u201cLip or cheek\u201d) is great, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s so great that it\u2019s worth stepping on a theme clue\u2019s toes. It could have been SASH/HODS, but different strokes for different folks.One thing that would have been cute is a bit of material about the television show \u201cFULL HOUSE,\u201d since the revealer is clued that way. Or maybe some bonus poker fill. But it\u2019s only Tuesday, so maybe this puzzle was kept easy for a reason. Maybe the constructors and puzzle editors are holding their cards close to their chest and will reveal more surprises later in the week.Along the way, I also changed the revealer from FULL HOUSES to the more natural-sounding FULL HOUSE, which opened up better cluing options, and aligned the three circled areas vertically to create a more ordered feeling for the grid.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why You Should Never Skip the Opening Credits", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "\nA title sequence is not a disposable wrapper. It is part of the program. It is, at best, the show\u2019s homunculus, the creation in miniature. It sets a mood. It establishes themes. It brings you into the world of the series, atmospherically, like the ethereal trance of \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201dor geographically, like the god\u2019s-eye flyover of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dOne of my favorite shows of 2018 was \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d and it also has one of TV\u2019s best title sequences, produced by Barnstorm VFX. It looks like this:\u201cThe Good Fight\u201d airs (or \u201cairs\u201d) on CBS All Access, a streaming service you probably do not subscribe to. So you may have never seen \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d This is fine. Watching the credits is a good, quick way to get to know it.Quick nutshell: \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d is a spinoff of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a legal drama that aired for seven seasons on CBS. Its protagonist is Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), an elite white Chicago lawyer who has become a partner in a largely African-American firm, whose clients have ranged from police-brutality victims to billionaires.So it\u2019s a lawyer show. Here are some lawyer things:A tasteful vase.A desktop Newton\u2019s Cradle.A set of bound volumes.No! Not the wine!\u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d like \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d before it, is a show about power and privilege. But it\u2019s also a show about disruption, collapse and chaos. In the premiere, Diane is getting ready to retire (to a vineyard, of course) when she discovers she\u2019s lost her life savings to an investment scam. She has to find a new job.Everything \u2026is \u2026coming apart.I worry that I\u2019m making the show sound melodramatic. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a comeback story, about power, ethics and life\u2019s absurd twists.\u201cAbsurd\u201d is key here. \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d is also dryly, surreally funny, which is another thing the credits tell you.It starts in stately mode. A little baroque harpsichord. Something you might listen to in a fancy waiting room or while nursing a fine Burgundy.As things start exploding, so does the music, with percussion and operatic vocals.Because it is all a little ridiculous! The cases on \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d are serious, even of national interest (more on that in a second). But while the firm\u2019s clients may be vulnerable, the firm that Diane joins is prosperous. The lawyers will be fine. (Well, except those taken out by a serial killer, but you\u2019ll learn about that if you watch Season 2.)There\u2019s an irony to this, which the show is deftly aware of. And so are the credits, which become a kind of mesmerizing, over-the-top video art of luxury destruction. A decanter of Scotch gets it \u2026the vase gets it \u2026even a row of designer handbags, detonating like a synchronized fireworks display.It\u2019s kind of beautiful, really. The sequence announces the show as playful, willing to surprise you.(It does this, for instance, with the placement of the credits, which sometimes run at the beginning of an episode, sometimes 15 minutes or more in.)\u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d it says, is a show that will change things up.Which brings us to this:The first season of \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d went into production before the 2016 election and began just after President Trump\u2019s inauguration. Diane, a liberal active in Democratic politics, became an inadvertent stand-in for a class of people arriving in a very different 2017 than they expected, and starting over.The second season addressed the Trump era directly. The episode titles counted the days of the administration (\u201cDay 408,\u201d \u201cDay 415,\u201d and so on).The characters took immigration cases, argued before a wet-behind-the-ears judge appointed by Trump and worked with the Democratic National Committee on a potential impeachment case.The credits changed with the themes, adding a TV image of Charlottesville to represent the serious, ugly, violent passions set loose:But here, too, there\u2019s the ridiculous, the idea that history has arrived in the form of a late-night comedy sketch. All season, Diane\u2019s high-rise window faced the apartment of a couple who liked to get it on wearing Trump masks.One storyline found the firm consulting with the D.N.C. about a certain much-rumored samizdat presidential video, which the show represented by having it play, unseen, on a laptop that cast a golden glow, like the briefcase in \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d:It was a season about national crisis in the form of a killer joke, about living through a drama whose supervillains include a Russian leader who likes to be photographed fishing shirtless:The title sequence ends with everything going up operatically in smoke: furniture, finery, law books and the norms they represent:This is why you don\u2019t skip the credits. A good sequence like the one in \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d is a poem, a map, an invitation to join its storytellers as they blow up their world, real good.James Poniewozik is the chief television critic for The New York Times.Clips from \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d courtesy CBS Television Studios.Clips from \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d courtesy CBS Television Studios.Produced by Alicia DeSantis, Josephine Sedgwick, Rumsey Taylor, Susanna Timmons and Josh WilliamsAdvertisement"}

And with her busy schedule on the campaign trail, advertising online is an afterthought.\u201cMy budget is zero for it right now,\u201d Ms. Eskamani said. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been necessary.\u201dDozens of progressive groups are organizing for Democrats in this year\u2019s midterms. But Tech for Campaigns has focused on a particularly challenging assignment: dragging Democratic campaigns into the digital age, before it is too late.In a year and a half of existence, Tech for Campaigns has become a kind of Democratic Geek Squad \u2014 a national volunteer network consisting of more than 4,500 tech workers with day jobs at companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Airbnb. These volunteers, who include engineers, marketers and data scientists, are matched with Democratic campaigns across the country to provide training on digital skills, such as how to promote themselves on social media, build their email lists and use data analytics to identify potential donors.\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake if we don\u2019t build a true centralized digital arm is falling further behind the Republicans and continuing to lose ground, the battles on key issues and elections at every level,\u201d said Jessica Alter, a co-founder of the group and a longtime tech executive. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start now, it will be too late in 2020.\u201dOne of the group\u2019s biggest tasks, Ms. Alter said, is persuading candidates to campaign heavily on social media, rather than relying solely on TV ads and printed mailers. Many Democrats running in 2018 are spending a much smaller percentage of their ad budgets on digital ads than their rivals, sometimes as little as 10 percent versus more than 40 percent for Republicans, according to two political consultants with ties to multiple campaigns.Tech for Campaigns has advised Democrats in about 60 races since it started, including Justin Nelson, who is running for attorney general in Texas, and Rob Quist, who was narrowly defeated in a special congressional election in Montana last year. The group plans to work with 200 campaigns by the end of the year, with a special focus on helping state-level candidates like Ms. Eskamani, who typically do not have the budgets to hire dedicated digital teams.\u201cWe do a lot of things that digital consultants don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cThe most common question we get asked is, \u2018What\u2019s the catch?\u2019\u201dWhen Ms. Alter started contacting campaigns last year, she was shocked at how prosaic their technology was. Some campaign workers spent hours manually copying and pasting voter information into email lists. Others were not using basic social media capabilities, such as call-to-action buttons that can be used to ask followers to sign a petition, attend an event or make a donation.\u201cThey have all these really ingrained habits from pre-2016 that are very, very hard to unlearn,\u201d Ms. Alter said.Democrats are often thought to be tech-savvy, because the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were celebrated for their online touch and because much of Silicon Valley backs the party\u2019s candidates. In fact, Ms. Alter said, Democrats in congressional and state-level races have been outmatched by their Republican rivals, who benefited from the party\u2019s heavy tech investments during the Obama years and their enthusiastic embrace of targeted ads on platforms like Facebook and Google.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how not far along we are as a party,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cObama was really good at tech, but it never trickled down to a Senate race, let alone the state-level stuff.\u201dMs. Alter, 38, who sold her start-up last year and now works as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the venture capital firm Social Capital, came up with the idea for a tech volunteer network in early 2017, just after President Trump issued his travel ban targeting residents of several Muslim-majority countries.Outraged about the policy, and looking for a way to help, she enlisted Peter Kazanjy and Ian Ferguson, two friends in tech who shared her liberal politics. They agreed that Silicon Valley tech workers would jump at the opportunity to apply their technical skills to campaigns. How different is selling a candidate online, after all, from selling shoes or shaving kits?\u201cThis is not rocket science,\u201d Mr. Kazanjy said. \u201cCampaigns are online/offline e-commerce plays, where the transaction is a vote.\u201dThey sent a Google form to their friends in the tech industry to gauge interest. Within three days, more than 700 people had signed up. The group has since grown to more than 4,500 volunteers, raised more than $100,000 in a crowdfunding campaign, and moved into an office in downtown San Francisco that it shares with a venture capital firm.Nick Hobbs, 29, first heard about Tech for Campaigns while working at Google. Mr. Hobbs, who left the company last year, had always been politically active, but Tech for Campaigns gave him a way to channel his efforts into something productive.\u201cInstead of coming home and watching Netflix, we come home and go to work,\u201d said Mr. Hobbs, who is helping redesign the campaign website of Elizabeth Thomson, a Democrat running in New Mexico\u2019s 24th District.Other left-wing advocacy groups, such as Swing Left and Indivisible, are helping to recruit volunteers and generate grass-roots support in competitive districts. Tech for Campaigns sees its role as behind-the-scenes amplification. Its work is mostly remote, and volunteers use a Slack channel to coordinate as well as regular calls with campaign officials.The group has not been universally welcomed by the party. It has irked some officials and media consultants, whose turf it is edging in on. And the group\u2019s volunteers have learned to give advice to candidates gently, to avoid coming off as arrogant know-it-alls.\u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of Silicon Valley having a savior complex,\u201d Ms. Alter said. \u201cWe don\u2019t walk in saying, \u2018We\u2019re the experts. Let us run your campaign.\u2019\u201dIn the end, Mr. Hurst defeated his Republican opponent by eight points.\u201cI know, 100 percent, that they made a difference in our campaign,\u201d said Andrew Whitley, Mr. Hurst\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cI was very surprised these Silicon Valley folks were willing to donate their time like that.\u201dBy the end of the recent conference call, Tech for Campaigns had persuaded Ms. Eskamani, the Florida House candidate, to start running ads on her social media accounts. In the coming days, the group said, it would audit her other social media accounts to see which types of posts generated the best engagement and give her tips for increasing their impact.Ms. Eskamani gushed with excitement.\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, my gosh, so much structure. It\u2019s great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israel Aids Evacuation From Syria of Hundreds of \u2018White Helmets\u2019 and Families", "Date": "2018-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Israel has facilitated the evacuation of hundreds of rescue workers, known as the White Helmets, and their families from an embattled pocket of southern Syria, helping them to travel through Israeli-held territory to reach Jordan, Israeli and Jordanian officials said on Sunday.The Israeli Army said in a statement on Sunday that the United States and European countries had asked for help with the evacuation of the civilians \u201cdue to an immediate threat to their lives.\u201dA Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jordan, Mohammad al-Kayed, said that his country had authorized the United Nations to facilitate the entry of hundreds of Syrians to Jordan after Britain, Germany and Canada had made a \u201clegally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to a risk to their lives.\u201dAyman Safadi, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, said on Twitter on Sunday that the original request had been for 800 Syrians, but that the final number who made the trip was 422.The evacuation came as Syrian government forces, which are supported by Russia and Iran, have been sweeping through a swath of territory along Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan, seizing areas that have long been held by Western-backed rebels seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.Seven years into the war, Mr. Assad has taken back the country\u2019s center and is reasserting his control of its largest population centers. But large parts of the country remain out of his hands, held by rebels, Turkey or Kurdish forces backed by the United States.As the lines dividing those zones have solidified, large numbers of people living in them have been moved, further exacerbating the crisis that has displaced more than half of Syria\u2019s population.In addition to the evacuation of the White Helmets, hundreds of rebels and their families were bused from southern Syria to the rebel-held north because they did not want to live under Syrian government control. And last week, thousands of members of Syria\u2019s Shiite minority were removed from two besieged villages in the country\u2019s north, emptying them out.The evacuation of the White Helmets came near the end of the Syrian government\u2019s sweep through southern Syria. As towns have fallen, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, and many, including members of the White Helmets, ended up in the shrinking pocket of rebel-held territory along the Israeli-held Golan Heights.A second film about the group, \u201cLast Men in Aleppo,\u201d was nominated for an Oscar this year.The Syrian government accuses the group of cavorting with terrorists and of staging footage of their operations to garner sympathy and demonize the government.The Israeli Army called the move \u201can exceptional humanitarian gesture,\u201d apparently to make it clear that further evacuations were not to be expected.Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel\u2019s minister of regional cooperation, said in a radio interview on Sunday that foreign powers worried that Mr. Assad\u2019s government would target the White Helmets if they were in territory his forces seized.\u201cNow that it appears that the Assad regime is going to regain its hold over all of Syria, the international community wanted to extricate them so that they wouldn\u2019t have to pay the price of the enormous hatred that the Syrian regime has for them,\u201d he said.The Syrians will remain in a restricted area in Jordan until their resettlement within three months, the spokesman or the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said.This was the second major evacuation in Syria this past week.On Thursday, buses removed more than 6,000 people from two Shiite villages in Idlib Province in the north who had been besieged by Sunni rebels for years.Idlib now holds the largest patch of rebel-held territory in Syria, and officials in the region assume that once Mr. Assad has retaken the south, he will turn his guns to Idlib.More than two million people are there, many displaced from elsewhere in Syria, and aid organizations worry that any military operation would be catastrophic because civilians will have nowhere to flee. The province borders Turkey, which has kept its border closed.The two Shiite villages, which contained civilians and fighters loyal to the Syrian government, had been under siege by rebel forces for years. Last week, a deal was reached for them to be emptied out and their residents bused to government-held areas farther south in exchange for the release of about 1,500 detainees held by the government.The departure was bitter for those who left, not knowing if they would ever return.\u201cWe were hoping for a military campaign to reach us here, but unfortunately nothing happened and we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Hussein Halaq, a Shiite villager, said via a messaging app as he prepared to leave. \u201cMany lost their houses and their future.\u201dBut some who remained in Idlib worried that the departure of the Shiites was the government\u2019s way of paving the way for a harsh military attack, since it no longer had to worry about collateral damage to its loyalists.\u201cThey were like a card for us, pressing the regime warplanes not to bomb civilians,\u201d said Mohammed Saeed, an antigovernment activist in Idlib.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter at @NYTBen.David M.

I somehow missed him.\u201d He turned a corner and gazed up in amazement as costumed Bowie mannequins peered down from a towering platform, like glamorous gargoyles. \u201cOh my God, this man was everything,\u201d Mr. Burgess said, mouth agape. \u201cHe was much more than just a recording artist, really. Now I just want to go home and Spotify him.\u201d \u201cYou work for six months and then people can consume it in, like, three hours,\u201d said Mr. Burgess, who wore a white button-up shirt and brocade pants. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange.\u201dDespite sharing a name with his character, it would be difficult to confuse Mr. Burgess with his histrionic and garrulous onscreen persona. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d he said about his high-strung character. \u201cI don\u2019t live where Titus Andromedon lives.

But it also came with a certain amount of attention I had never had before and that even to this day is a little difficult to integrate.\u201dAs if on cue, a young bright-faced woman in a printed dress emerged from the crowd in the dimly lit gallery and gasped, \u201cTituss!\u201d Mr. Burgess parted his lips and revealed a toothy grin, before he leaned his head back and gave a little wave.

He is also the show\u2019s zany scene stealer (and was just nominated for his fourth Emmy). His manic, scenery-chewing soliloquies are executed with a breezy aplomb, though he stresses that they are not as carefree as they appear.His loosey-goosey ease is helped by his years of stage work. Raised as an only child in Athens, Ga., he studied music in college before moving to New York and auditioning for Broadway shows. Back at the Brooklyn Museum, he turned a corner into a smaller room filled with framed Bowie letters and lyrics scribbled on paper. The gallery was packed. \u201cOh no, I can\u2019t go in there,\u201d he said, backing out. He says he is slightly claustrophobic, and after 45 minutes at the bustling exhibit, he needed out. He blames this sensitivity on being a Pisces. \u201cOh yeah, we feel everything to the nth degree,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m an actor, how I can easily access the soul of another character, but it\u2019s something I wish I could turn off.\u201d As he headed for the exit, he paused in a gallery where concert footage of Bowie played on one wall, and the costumes Bowie wore were displayed up on the opposite wall. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a copycat,\u201d Mr. Burgess said, savoring the display. \u201cYou can feel that this is from the innermost part of this man.\u201d \u201cI feel like artists today have gotten lazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe absence of social media and the internet mandated, demanded, that we think, we visualize more, we dream.

I\u2019m not as chichi as I appear. I wash my face with baby shampoo. It\u2019s really weird, but if it\u2019s gentle enough for a baby, then it\u2019s good enough for me. When I started wearing makeup in high school, it was about being more myself. It was me communicating to the world and being as integrated as possible \u2014 who I am on the inside being reflected outwardly. That\u2019s what most people are trying to do whether you\u2019re trans or not. But makeup for me, for many years, was also my armor. The world was not safe for me without it. As I\u2019ve developed into my womanhood, this beauty thing is now tied to my work. It\u2019s important to distinguish between my work life and home life, so I don\u2019t always wear a lot of it now.But if I\u2019m going out to an event, it\u2019s different. For me, it\u2019s not about just buying more products and drinking the Kool-Aid. Instead, I use makeup to enhance myself, and it\u2019s a spiritual process. It\u2019s kind of meditative.People ask me all the time about my skin, but it\u2019s really about what you put in it. Meat, sugar and dairy are all really bad for my skin. I avoid gluten. I was vegan for four months last year, but then I did a food sensitivity blood work panel and found out I\u2019m sensitive to soy. If you\u2019re vegan and can\u2019t eat soy, it gets real tricky. So I started eating fish again. I\u2019m basically a gluten-free pescatarian, and then I go in and out of sugar and carbs. I just moved into a condo, and we have a pool. It\u2019s one of my main reasons for moving here, so I can swim. I try to dance when I can but not as consistently as I\u2019d like. I just started lifting weights. For years I was terrified of lifting because I was afraid of getting bulky. I\u2019m pretty weak right now. I\u2019m doing lots of repetitions. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How 2 Media Moguls\u2019 Once-Warm Friendship Turned Frigid", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen CBS filed suit to strip Shari E. Redstone of her voting control of the company in May, no one purported to be more surprised \u2014 and hurt \u2014 than Ms. Redstone herself.Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have been.Ms. Redstone gained control of National Amusements, the Redstone family enterprise, from her 95-year-old father, Sumner M. Redstone. He had turned a small chain of movie theaters into a multibillion-dollar media empire spanning broadcast networks, cable television and films.It was Mr. Redstone\u2019s idea back in 2005 to split CBS and Viacom, on the then-reasonable theory that Viacom, with its Paramount film studio and cable channels Nickelodeon and MTV, would command a higher stock price on its own than coupled with the slower-growth CBS, with its broadcast network and book publisher, Simon and Schuster.But CBS, under Mr. Moonves\u2019s leadership, proved far more adept than Viacom at navigating a fast-changing media landscape.Once Ms. Redstone gained control of Viacom two years ago, the company\u2019s board fired its chief executive and replaced him with Robert A. Bakish, who had worked at Viacom for over 20 years. That decision has loomed over the CBS drama.On Jan. 16, the two met alone at Mr. Moonves\u2019s CBS office in Los Angeles, and Ms. Redstone told him that she would be willing to give up voting control of a reunited company. She, too, was eager to focus more on her family and philanthropic interests, she said.Ms. Redstone also proposed adding Richard Parsons, the former chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, to CBS\u2019s board. Mr. Moonves didn\u2019t object; Mr. Parsons is much admired in the media and entertainment industries.Still, to CBS it was a sign that Ms. Redstone was injecting herself into the choice of board members. That raised the specter of a repeat of what had happened at Viacom \u2014 when Ms. Redstone had purged the board allied with the previous chief executive \u2014 especially since Ms. Redstone also wanted to remove another CBS director and Moonves ally, Charles Gifford.According to the National Amusements complaint, Ms. Redstone wasn\u2019t trying to wrest control of CBS\u2019s board. Rather, Mr. Gifford, a former top banking executive, had offended Ms. Redstone at the 2017 Super Bowl in Houston when he acted in an \u201cintimidating and bullying\u201d manner, \u201cgrabbing her face and directing her to listen to him.\u201dMr. Gifford, who was using a cane as he walked on the field before the game, has said he was simply trying to hug Ms. Redstone as a greeting.Adding to Mr. Moonves\u2019s anxieties about Ms. Redstone\u2019s intentions, she told him at the January meeting that it was important for Viacom\u2019s Mr. Bakish to have a \u201csignificant\u201d role in a merged CBS-Viacom. According to National Amusements, Mr. Moonves asked if that meant Mr. Bakish had to be his \u201cNo. 2,\u201d and Ms. Redstone stressed that it only meant he had to have a \u201cmeaningful role.\u201d (CBS acknowledges that Mr. Bakish\u2019s role was discussed, but otherwise denies this account.) For his part, Mr. Moonves felt the merger could succeed only if he had the unfettered ability to select his own management team.Despite the tension, in the next few months special committees of each company\u2019s board began discussing a potential merger. On April 3, CNBC\u2019s David Faber reported CBS\u2019s proposed merger terms \u2014 which is how Ms. Redstone first learned them, according to National Amusements. As the controlling shareholder, she felt she at least deserved a phone call.A month later, on May 1, Mr. Moonves and Ms. Redstone met at Mr. Moonves\u2019s Park Avenue apartment to discuss the Gifford and Bakish issues. This time, each brought along a witness: Mr. Parsons for Ms. Redstone, and the CBS director Bruce S. Gordon, a former chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., for Mr. Moonves. It was hardly a sign of mutual trust.From Ms. Redstone\u2019s standpoint, Mr. Moonves seemed jealous of Mr. Bakish, who she felt was doing a good job reviving a demoralized Viacom. Mr. Moonves complained that she \u201cliked Mr. Bakish more than him,\u201d according to National Amusements. Ms. Redstone tried to assuage Mr. Moonves\u2019s concerns, telling him that she \u201chad a closer personal relationship with Mr. Moonves than with Mr. Bakish\u201d and that she wanted Mr. Moonves to run the combined company. Still, she wouldn\u2019t insist that Mr. Bakish be part of the management team, she at least wanted him on the board of the combined company. Mr. Moonves was noncommittal. (CBS denies that any of this was said.)The conversation turned to Joseph Ianniello, CBS\u2019s chief operating officer and Mr. Moonves\u2019s No. 2. Mr. Moonves complained that Ms. Redstone didn\u2019t like Mr. Ianniello. She responded that she \u201cbarely knew him\u201d but that he shouldn\u2019t be a candidate to run the merged company or be Mr. Moonves\u2019s heir because he\u2019d never been a chief executive. (CBS acknowledges that Mr. Moonves raised the issue of \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d Ms. Redstone had made about Mr. Ianniello, but otherwise denies she made those comments.)And Ms. Redstone again insisted that Mr. Gifford leave the board.When the meeting ended, the two sides were at loggerheads over who would run the merged company and whether Mr. Gifford would serve on the board.In what is likely the most startling revelation in the lawsuit, National Amusements maintains that Ms. Redstone was cooling on the idea of the merger, not because she felt it no longer made strategic sense, but because she doubted that Mr. Moonves would accept Mr. Bakish in any capacity, and without him, she didn\u2019t believe that a merger would work. She began expressing this view to Viacom directors and to Mr. Bakish, though not to anyone at CBS.Mr. Moonves and CBS had also turned against the merger, though they still believed Ms. Redstone was likely to force it through, even if the CBS board recommended against it. From CBS\u2019s perspective, that was why Ms. Redstone wanted to get rid of Mr. Gifford \u2014 it was a first step toward handpicking a board that would execute the merger.Mr. Moonves never got back to Ms. Redstone about Mr. Bakish and Mr. Gifford. Instead, on May 14, CBS filed the lawsuit to strip Ms. Redstone of voting control, dropping any pretense of friendliness or cooperation.The irony is that, although both sides deeply distrust each other, the broad contours of the narrative aren\u2019t in dispute. That suggests the two sides aren\u2019t really that far apart.Most important, neither wants a merger. If CBS and Viacom remain separate companies, with separate boards and management, there\u2019s no need to pick between Mr. Moonves, who could remain CBS\u2019s chief executive, and Mr. Bakish, who could continue his turnaround effort at Viacom. The CBS board could develop its own succession plan.Alone or together, CBS and Viacom are potential takeover candidates, as shown by the recent bidding war for most assets of 21st Century Fox. The companies would be even more attractive \u2014 and would very likely fetch more money \u2014 if Ms. Redstone gave up her voting control. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to go that far, she could signal her openness to acquisition offers.In short, if Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves really care about shareholders as much as they claim, they should bury the hatchet and drop the lawsuits.That is probably too much to hope for. Feelings are so intense that Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves can hardly be in the same room together. This month, they both attended the media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, and pointedly avoided each other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Les Moonves, CBS Chief, Faces Inquiry Over Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Corporation and one of the most powerful people in the media business, is facing an investigation after a report published on Friday revealed allegations of sexual harassment made against him by six women.\u201cUpon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action,\u201d the statement said. The board plans to hire a law firm to conduct the review before it takes any action, the company said.CBS shares fell by more than 6 percent Friday when news of the impending New Yorker article was reported.The article, written by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, describes sexual harassment alleged by six women in the entertainment business against Mr. Moonves. It links the accusations to a broader culture of sexual harassment at CBS, with a special focus on CBS News.Four women spoke to Mr. Farrow on the record, including the film and television actress Illeana Douglas. Ms. Douglas described a meeting with Mr. Moonves in 1997 during which, she said, he was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her while holding her down. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous,\u201d she told The New Yorker.Mr. Moonves, 68, began his career as an actor before recasting himself as a Hollywood producer and, later, as a network executive. Under his watch, CBS went from last place in the ratings to the most-watched television network, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cYoung Sheldon.\u201dMr. Moonves, who became the president of CBS Entertainment in 1995 and the chief executive of the company in 2006, draws an annual pay package of $69.3 million. But his role as company head has been in jeopardy because of his part in a continuing legal battle against CBS\u2019s parent company, National Amusements.In addition to Ms. Douglas, the women who made on-the-record accusations were the writer Janet Jones and the producers Christine Peters and Dinah Kirgo. All of the women said Mr. Moonves had insisted on sexual favors and retaliated against them when they turned him down. The earliest allegations in the article date to the mid-1980s, and the most recent to 2006.In a statement that CBS had earlier shared with The New Yorker, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dCBS, in a separate statement, said it \u201cis very mindful of all workplace issues and takes each report of misconduct very seriously.\u201dIt added, \u201cWe do not believe, however, that the picture of our company created in The New Yorker represents a larger organization that does its best to treat its tens of thousands of employees with dignity and respect.\u201dAfter the CBS board noted the timing of the New Yorker article relative to the legal dispute as part of its statement, Ms. Redstone denied that she had anything to do with Mr. Farrow\u2019s work.\u201cThe malicious insinuation that Ms. Redstone is somehow behind the allegations of inappropriate personal behavior by Mr. Moonves or today\u2019s reports is false and self-serving,\u201d a statement from her representative said. \u201cMs. Redstone hopes that the investigation of these allegations is thorough, open and transparent.\u201dCBS, for years the No. 1 broadcast network, has been one of the best-performing businesses in the media industry. Its success has largely been attributed to Mr. Moonves, who has been praised for his ability to select hit shows. He moves comfortably among Wall Street investors and Hollywood producers, speaking as easily about negotiating carriage fees as he does programming for prime-time audiences.Two months ago, during the network\u2019s rollout of its fall lineup before an audience of advertisers, Mr. Moonves stood on the stage of Carnegie Hall, basking in applause. Those in the crowd were under the impression that they might have been seeing the network\u2019s leader for the last time, because of his battle against Ms. Redstone.As technology giants like Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have pushed into entertainment, media businesses have responded by bulking up through acquisitions. This year, Ms. Redstone asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded that a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenues at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, have been shrinking over the last few years.In May, CBS and Mr. Moonves lost one of the early rounds of the dispute when a judge ruled against CBS\u2019s effort to reduce Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the network. She, through her family company, controls nearly 80 percent of the company\u2019s voting rights.Issues over those rights and the leadership of CBS will be decided in the court case this year. That lawsuit had already put Mr. Moonves\u2019s storied career at stake; if he loses, he may end up leaving the company.The New Yorker piece also outlines allegations of sexual harassment by several women against a number of CBS News executives, including Jeffrey Fager, the former head of the news division and the current producer of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The story said CBS News executives were still promoted even after allegations of misconduct. The division had paid settlements to some of these women, the article said.At the time, Mr. Rose expressed \u201cembarrassment\u201d for pursuing what he believed to be \u201cshared feelings\u201d with women who had accused him.CBS News has retained law firm Proskauer Rose to conduct a separate investigation into claims of misconduct and said in a statement that \u201canyone raising a complaint is assured that he or she will be protected from retaliation.\u201dCBS News said that its investigation was continuing and that it was examining allegations made in the New Yorker article.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the women who made on-the-record accusations against Leslie Moonves in a New Yorker article. She is Dinah Kirgo, not her sister, Julie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast and Fox Engage in Bidding War for Control of Sky", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Comcast\u2019s bid to acquire the bulk of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets appears to be over. Instead, the cable giant will focus on fighting Fox for control of Sky, one of Europe\u2019s most prized media companies.The Philadelphia-based Comcast increased its offer for Sky on Wednesday, valuing the satellite broadcaster at $34 billion, or 26 billion pounds. That topped a bid from 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, that came earlier in the day. Fox\u2019s offer valued Sky at about $32.5 billion. Sky\u2019s independent board had already recommended Comcast\u2019s new terms.But Sky is just one element in a larger, complex corporate showdown. The latest move escalates a war between rival media companies being waged across two continents and involving two different transactions exceeding $100 billion in value in total.Both the Walt Disney Company and Comcast have bid to buy most of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets, including Sky and another growing international business, Star India, which would help increase their global reach. Now, Comcast is unlikely to continue pursuing Fox and will instead concentrate its efforts on acquiring Sky, the people familiar with the process said.Fox has endured a stringent 18-month review of its pursuit of the broadcaster by the British government, which has worried about the potential of Mr. Murdoch acquiring an outsize role in the country\u2019s news industry.The bidding war for Sky comes amid a complex set of requirements under British takeover rules. Disney\u2019s increased bid for Fox also raised the value of the 39 percent of Sky that Fox owns, putting those shares out of sync with the remaining 61 percent. Fox\u2019s original bid for Sky valued it at 23 billion pounds.Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel, the government agency reviewing Sky\u2019s deal, said it had not yet determined if the requirement, known as the \u201cchain principle,\u201d would apply in this case. Normally, the agency mandates a higher price for the full company when one portion of shares are bought through another company. That possibility could tamp down interest in higher bids for Fox, because an increase in Fox\u2019s value could set off rules that would require the buyer to also offer more for the rest of Sky.The panel also has the authority to institute an auction process at any point to determine the best price for Sky.Under the terms of its revised offer, Comcast said it would pay 14.75 pounds per Sky share, about 5 percent higher than Fox\u2019s bid of 14 pounds per Sky share.Both Disney and Comcast consider Sky, which Mr. Murdoch founded three decades ago, to be among Fox\u2019s most desirable assets because its international presence would bolster either company\u2019s global reach. And Sky\u2019s ownership of sports broadcasting rights, notably those for the English Premier League, is especially attractive.Sky has the ability to create content and distribute it through satellite and online video services, a model that American media and telecommunications companies hope to to copy. This would help either Disney or Comcast compete against the streaming services of technology giants like Netflix and Amazon that have upended the media landscape.Keeping up with Silicon Valley\u2019s video ambitions has been a priority for traditional media companies, which have largely decided to compete by opening their wallets to make acquisitions.Comcast said in a statement that it \u201chas long admired Sky and believes it is an outstanding company and a great fit.\u201dEarlier in the day, Fox said in its statement, \u201cThis transformative transaction will position Sky so that it can continue to compete within an environment that now includes some of the largest companies in the world, but none of whom have demonstrated the same local depth of investment and commitment to the U.K. and to Europe.\u201dHe mounted his latest push in 2016. The effort has been weighed down by British regulators\u2019 concerns that the Murdoch family already exerts too much control over the country\u2019s media. Gaining full control of Sky, including its 24-hour news operation, could go too far, government officials have said.Comcast said it expected to close the Sky acquisition by October.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Edmund Lee from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking the Binary", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt took anarchy and ayahuasca for a person with retail expertise to see that \u201cthe world\u2019s first gender-free store\u201d was a worthy idea. Rob Smith, the founder of the Phluid Project, went to Burning Man and then a two-week psychedelic-consuming retreat in the Amazon last year and came back committed to leaving his 30-year corporate retail career. Mr. Smith pursued his new dream and opened the Phluid Project in the NoHo section of Manhattan. Though the concept of gender-free may feel familiar in fashion, to invest in actual space for it still requires a revelation in the desert. Then one in the jungle.Retail is an incredibly gender-delineated space. For proof, look no further than this column: It\u2019s traditionally written by a cisgender man and a cisgender woman so that the two distinct categories in the industry can be reviewed. Though New York Fashion Week now has a nonbinary category, and many brands advertise that they embrace any customer (and why wouldn\u2019t they?), brick-and-mortar stores are still mostly organized by gender. To be a gender-nonconforming or nonbinary individual in a retail space can be tense.\u201cI\u2019ve been learning the art of tension diffusion since I was a child,\u201d the comedian Hannah Gadsby said of presenting as \u201cgender not normal\u201d in her Netflix special, \u201cNanette.\u201d \u201cBack then, I didn\u2019t have to invent the tension. I was the tension. And I\u2019m tired of tension. Tension is making me sick.\u201dInside the Phluid Project, tension melted away when I smelled Glisten, a candle with fig, white tea and ginger root. The store\u2019s candles ($40) will be my go-to housewarming gift as long as there are friends in new apartments to sort-of willingly receive them. All of the proceeds from the candle line go to organizations that support L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ communities and youth, like the Trans Women of Color Collective and the Hetrick-Martin Institute. The Phluid Project is a new kind of queer space. At first I wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a store, it\u2019s a community center,\u201d but I realized the truth that honors my understanding of queer history is: It\u2019s not just a community center, it\u2019s a store. \u201cThe world\u2019s first gender-free store\u201d is trademarked. There are rainbow-embroidered shorts ($69.50) and jackets ($98) from Levi\u2019s pride collection, and Superga sneakers with rainbow soles ($85). But there are also capitalist quips on tees, like \u201cGender-Phluid\u201d in the style of the Chick-fil-A logo, and \u201cOptimist\u201d in the style of the Supreme logo.Events at the store include a talk about life hacks (for cutting crop tops and starting a business) with Rio Uribe, the founder of Gypsy Sport, whose long-sleeve tie-dye tees ($128) and velvet skirts ($198) are for sale; Queer Comedy Night; and a Design Challenge, with the prize of having your line manufactured and sold in the store. I love seeing pieces from labels like Gypsy Sport and Chromat, but I think there could be much more.Prices at the Phluid Project go up to $300 so that more people can afford what they see in the store. But shopping is not only for buying. It\u2019s for learning, inspiration and discovery, especially for those who want to be designers or who are finding their personal style. Having a place for everyone to touch and try on well-made clothes without a double take (real or imagined in fear) would be a gift. A credit card can get you helped at most any store. A safe space will let you be.An in-house tailor would be an asset here, too. The Phluid Project has a section dedicated to boxy Champion sweatshirts, basketball shorts ($58) and WeSC bomber jackets. These pieces are extremely cool and do not have gendered labels, which is great. But as I was leaving the store, my impression was that gender-free clothing is shapeless clothing. Still, I know there are to be new designer pop-ups regularly (a \u201cnonbinary beachwear concept collection\u201d by Official Rebrand this week), and the store is evolving. Fluid.As I paid, I noticed a child sitting on a stool peacefully reading \u201cSideways Stories From Wayside School,\u201d guardian shopping nearby. I wished this store had been here when I was this kid's age, even when I was three times as old.Advertisement"}

Why Can\u2019t We Catch Up?", "Date": "2018-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyMr. Goldthwait, who wrote and directed the series, imagined the episode as \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d meets \u201cCape Fear,\u201d but once it was finished, his daughter, Tasha Goldthwait, the show\u2019s costume designer, helped him understand its real subtext when she pointed out that he has a Bubba haunting him.\u201cI\u2019ve always been battling this perception people have of me, this character,\u201d he said over coffee in downtown New York during a recent trip from Southern California to finish editing. \u201cIt follows me around. Bubba the Bear shows up when I\u2019m checking into a hotel, when I\u2019m on a plane. I can\u2019t get upset with people if they\u2019re only aware of a small part of my body of work. But inside I do.\u201dMr. Goldthwait, 55, projects a cerebral and cheerful presence offstage, but it\u2019s not quite the polar opposite of his former persona. His eyes still sometimes dart around, often downward, and he\u2019s jarringly comfortable displaying vulnerability and sharing his insecurities. Talking to him makes you think there\u2019s more connective tissue between him and his alter ego than you might assume.It all began with that voice, whose origins can be traced to a sketch group called the Generic Comic in 1970s Syracuse, N.Y., run by Mr. Goldthwait, born Robert, and his childhood friend Tom Kenny, known now as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants. As teenage oddballs with a love of punk rock, Andy Kaufman and classic comedy, they pushed each other to perform.It helped that Mr. Goldthwait\u2019s father was a sheet metal worker who specialized in \u201cBudweiser-inspired performance art\u201d like putting on a cape and telling neighbors he would jump off the refrigerator into a mayonnaise jar. (\u201cHe would stop, then say, \u2018No, it\u2019s Hellmann\u2019s, that\u2019s the wrong brand.\u2019 \u201d)Mr. Goldthwait developed a gullible, gibberish-spouting character who tells the local news about seeing aliens or Bigfoot. After some success, he started to go onstage at comedy clubs in Syracuse and later Boston as this wild-eyed fool, Mr. Kenny recalled. \u201cIt was a mind-blower,\u201d he said, adding that it seemed like a maniac had accidentally stumbled onstage until he started telling jokes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know if he was for real, and then there was this big relief laugh.\u201dAs the character developed, Mr. Goldthwait adopted an adversarial stance to standup itself. \u201cMy wife is so fat,\u201d he yelled, and when the crowd responded: \u201cHow fat is she?,\u201d he retorted with a mixture of anger and hurt. \u201cShe\u2019s real fat. I don\u2019t have a joke for everything you know.\u201dHis formally experimental early stand-up arrived a decade before alt comedy, which made it seem all the more out of place amid comics in sweaters making fun of commercials and airline food. But his work holds up remarkably well, and his inspired album \u201cMeat Bob\u201d is one of the absolute funniest of the 1980s.But the freshness of his act eventually was lost as he crossed over into rock star-level fame. He played 4,000-seat arenas, embraced a rock aesthetic, wearing eyeliner and mascara, and became friends with David Bowie, who invited him to do a double act. (Mr. Goldthwait said no.) At the height of his fame, Mr. Goldthwait even attended a costume party at Prince\u2019s house. Dressed as Peter Pan, Prince greeted him warmly, asking if he wanted a drink. \u201cWhen I said no, Prince said, \u2018It\u2019s good not to drink because there\u2019s lot of weird people here.\u2019 And I go, \u2018Yeah, you and me, we\u2019re the regular Joes.\u2019 \u201d Then Mr. Goldthwait laughed recalling the episode. Prince\u2019s voice, he added, \u201cdropped 10 octaves and said, \u2018That\u2019s funny.\u2019 \u201dBut as he starred in forgettable movies like the talking-horse comedy \u201cHot to Trot,\u201d his act hardened into gimmickry. \u201cI started out making fun of comedy,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I became the thing I was making fun of.\u201d\u201cI felt like I was turning into Richard Simmons, a novelty, and I had anger about that,\u201d Mr. Goldthwait said. Mr. Kenny had another theory: \u201cHe was trying to burn himself down, consciously or not.\u201dIf so, it worked. Mr. Goldthwait had increasing trouble selling tickets, once playing a show at a casino for only two people. When he tried to pivot to directing, he couldn\u2019t get any work \u2014 until Jimmy Kimmel, who knew him from radio, asked him to make taped segments for \u201cThe Man Show\u201d and then his talk show. \u201cKimmel hired me to direct his show when most people were using my name as a punch line,\u201d he said.After leaving talk shows, Mr. Goldthwait dedicated himself to independent movies, making as few artistic compromises as possible. To pull this off, he radically scaled back his expenses, even moving in with three roommates to save money. \u201cA lot of people would never do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was super freeing. I could say no to things I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201dHe\u2019s still doing stand-up, recently going onstage in Los Angeles to talk about the death of his friend Robin Williams (\u201cWe were comedians. We talked about suicide for 31 years. Sometimes we talked about other stuff.\u201d) He says he may want to do a Netflix special, but right now, he just wants to connect with audiences.\u201cThere\u2019s such an emphasis in our society on making it as opposed to the quality of your life,\u201d he said, flashing a smile: \u201cSuccess is for creeps.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Let\u2019s not forget a non-superhero movie, albeit one that is still a sequel, \u201cSicario: Day of the Soldado,\u201d in which Mr. Brolin stars with Benicio Del Toro, doing very manly anti-drug-cartel stuff.The movie is directed by Jody Hill from a script he wrote with John Carcieri and Danny McBride, who is also one of the movie\u2019s co-stars. The three are best known for their work on the cable series \u201cEastbound and Down\u201d and \u201cVice Principals,\u201d comedies about comically hideous men doing dumb awful things.\u201cWhitetail Deer Hunter\u201d has a softer touch.

In \u201cWhitetail Deer Hunter\u201d he is all about that, and as such, he\u2019s the most consistently engaging feature of the movie.The plot points, from the estranged wife (Carrie Coon, whom you\u2019ll miss if you blink) and her potential new husband doting on her son, Jaden (Montana Jordan), in their McMansion to a final-third woodlands crisis, are beyond stale. Mr. McBride, as Buck\u2019s casually vulgar sidekick, Don, plays crass cluelessness as is his custom.\u201cThe only woman coming on this trip is Rosie Palm and her five sisters,\u201d he gleefully exclaims to father and son, and later shows the kid some pornographic Polaroids. For all that, Don is a far more benign character than those Mr. McBride plays on the television shows he makes with Mr. Hill. One wonders why \u201cWhitetail Deer Hunter\u201d chose such a relatively toothless route, but one doesn\u2019t wonder too long, as it\u2019s the kind of movie you forget about 20 minutes after seeing it.\u201cKing of Peking,\u201d a new film from the Australian-born filmmaker Sam Voutas, who was raised in Beijing, debuted on Netflix on July 2. It\u2019s a charming, breezy father-son story but also a diverting account of Chinese film and video culture in the 1990s. The movie opens with the image of a closed red curtain, as, the narrator recounts, used to be de rigueur for movie palace screenings. But the main characters, known as Big Wong and Little Wong, have only a portable screen and a 16-millimeter projector when we first meet them.Big Wong (Jun Zhao) and Little Wong (Wang Naixun) motor into a rural town on a Sunday; Big Wong tells a local resident that he and his son are a regular Riggs and Murtaugh, as in the classic buddy cop film \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d Little Wong collects dollars from the townspeople and tweaks the boombox sound system. After sundown, they screen a \u201970s biker picture, which goes over pretty well until the projector catches fire.The father-son team has other problems: Big Wong and his wife are divorcing, and she\u2019s not happy with her husband using their son for what she calls child labor. The movie follows the pair from scheme to scheme. While a janitor at a cut-rate movie house, Big Wong buys a DVD duplicating machine and starts to thrive as a bootlegger, touting his \u201cKing of Peking Presents\u201d discs. Father and son fight, make up, and fight again. It all goes down easily, and is most impressive in its depiction of the time and place. The bustle of the urban alleyways and the restiveness of the small towns come across credibly throughout.As far as film goes, Netflix has snagged a significant one of Ms. Streisand\u2019s: the 1976 romantic drama \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d in which she starred with Kris Kristofferson. This is of interest not only because this version of the oft-iterated story is the model for the coming movie of the same name starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (also the new film\u2019s director). It\u2019s also a new cut of the film, overseen by Ms. Streisand, not a director\u2019s cut. Frank Pierson, who directed the tumultuous 1976 production, died in 2012.Ms. Streisand, not just the movie\u2019s star but one of its producers, has added footage that gives the film \u2026 more Barbra Streisand. Most notably, in one scene, her character, Esther, plays the song \u201cEvergreen\u201d on the guitar (composed by Ms. Streisand with lyrics by Paul Williams) for Mr. Kristofferson, who plays the drunkard rock star. It\u2019s an early version, without lyrics, and as Ms. Streisand intended, it emphasizes the songwriting talent of her character. (In the version shown at theaters, the scene between Esther and John Norman, Mr. Kristofferson\u2019s character, ends before Esther can start playing for him; he invites her to his concert and the scene cuts to the arena where the show is soon to start.) There\u2019s also an extension of the movie\u2019s final song.These additions don\u2019t change the general tenor of the movie, which now has a time-capsule appeal all its own. The picture was written, in collaboration with Mr. Pierson, by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne (drawing on the outlines of the 1937 and 1954 versions before it), and it places Ms. Streisand in a rock music world she had not heretofore visited in her own career, despite her being in the same generation as the Beatles.An earlier version of this column described incorrectly a scene from the 1976 theater version of \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d It ended with Kris Kristofferson\u2019s character inviting Barbra Streisand\u2019s Esther to a concert, not with him falling asleep.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t blame my past self for this, but I like myself more and feel like a more full human being and creator today. Love you to you all.\u201dBut the consequences for offensive comments now come quickly in Hollywood, which has become hypersensitive to offensive behavior. And slaps on the wrist and apologies no longer suffice.Disney fired Mr. Gunn midday on Friday. \u201cThe offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James\u2019 Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio\u2019s values, and we have severed our business relationship with him,\u201d Alan F. Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said in a statement.Paramount Pictures used similar language on Thursday to describe its reasoning for firing Amy Powell, the president of Paramount Television, a fledgling division mostly known for supplying \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d to Netflix.After a swift investigation by Paramount lawyers and human resources executives, Ms. Powell was fired. Ms. Powell made insensitive racial remarks while on a conference call to discuss a coming series that will have a predominantly black cast, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.Although people on the call participated in the investigation, Ms. Powell denied that her language was inappropriate. \u201cThere is no truth to the allegation that I made insensitive comments in a professional setting \u2014 or in any setting,\u201d she said in a statement on Thursday night. \u201cThe facts will come out, and I will be vindicated.\u201dThe two \u201cGuardians\u201d movies collected a combined $1.6 billion worldwide.

As the horrors unfold, the mentally ill Suzanne \u2014 off her meds and in isolation \u2014 clicks across the channels on an imaginary TV where her cohorts star in demented children\u2019s shows, a boxing match and even a \u201cJeopardy!\u201d episode. Then Suzanne herself transforms into Dorothy, complete with ruby sneakers, in a \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d scene, and we\u2019re off to meet the men and women behind the curtain of the prison-industrial complex.In an interview at The New York Times, Ms. Aduba, 37 \u2014 nearly unrecognizable out of her \u201cOrange\u201d costume, save for the gap in her smile that she told of learning to love \u2014 talked about finding Suzanne, the show\u2019s overarching message and bringing hidden figures to life.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Just when we\u2019d grown accustomed to the small hell that was Litchfield Penitentiary, things suddenly got much worse.Jenji has always known the story she wants to tell and just as you get comfortable, she wants to disrupt that. Just as you think you understand what prison is, she introduces privatization and the systematic constructs that keep people mentally, emotionally, socioeconomically and racially imprisoned. She woos you into this delightful thing, and then it\u2019s like: \u201cNo no no no no, we\u2019re having a larger, greater conversation, and it\u2019s not a conversation for the characters. It\u2019s a conversation for you, the audience. These are the facts and what are you going to do about it?\u201dHow did you divine Suzanne\u2019s essence?I found her voice Season 1 in one of the stage directions. They had described her as being innocent like a child, except children aren\u2019t scary. And I had a flash in my mind of a woman holding a sledgehammer in one hand and sucking on a pacifier. And as I continued to grow to know her, it was an innocence, and the purity of that actual word. It\u2019s not just that she hasn\u2019t experienced things. It means that even when she makes choices that we view to be poor, there is no malice, there is no calculation, there is no intention ever of harming anyone. It is strictly to protect that which she loves.Jenji has written some deeply moving scenes for Suzanne \u2014 for instance, last season when the meth-heads painted her in whiteface, and she gave a soliloquy about the beauty of her skin. I grew up in a small, New England town where I was one of a handful of black kids. And as proud of a home as I grew up in, when you\u2019re a teenager and you don\u2019t want anything but to have crushes, and clothing things are a priority, if the desired option is blonde-haired blue-eyed, or brown-haired green-eyed, somewhere along the way you might think that the antithesis must be ugly. That\u2019s an impression that\u2019s left on millions of young women of color. So that feeling that my creator could hear that, and wanted to give that space to be said, was just incredibly satisfying. For myself, Uzo, I was feeling that I was saying it to not only Suzanne but to all the Uzos that were, are or will be: \u201cYour skin is beautiful.\u201dWhat is Suzanne\u2019s diagnosis?It\u2019s never been given, and I like it because it umbrellas so many people who are battling mental illness. And I also like it because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve cracked ground solidly on the subject of mental illness, and keeping it in that space allows for a larger conversation about civil rights and how we treat people.As I became more and more clear in my art-making, I realized that the stories I wanted to tell were the stories of the missing, the people we never get to hear about and should. So many women have been written out of history, and there are more corners and moments than Florence Nightingale and Sojourner Truth. How could I have never heard of these women? So [to play Toni Stone] was exciting for me. I thought, this is amazing. And I\u2019m glad that she gets to live again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Record $2.5 Trillion in Mergers Were Announced in the First Half of 2018", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than $2.5 trillion in mergers were announced during the first half of the year, as fears of Silicon Valley\u2019s growing ambitions helped drive a record run of deal-making.Four of the 10 biggest deals were struck in part to fend off competition from the largest technology companies as the value of acquisitions announced during the first six months of the year increased 61 percent from the same period in 2017, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. That has put mergers in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion, which would top 2015 as the largest yearly total on record.Even rising global trade tensions did not manage to stifle acquisitions: Deals involving companies based in different countries nearly doubled compared with the first half of last year, and accounted for more than 40 percent of all announced transactions.Big deals, a number of them in media and health care, have driven much of the activity. So far this year, companies have announced 36 transactions valued at $10 billion or more, according to Thomson Reuters. They combined for $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38 percent of all activity.Competition from the tech sector has pushed the largest media firms to own both the content and the platforms on which it appears. So far this year, the value of the announced media deals has jumped to $323 billion, up nearly 440 percent from a year ago.Even so, the value of so-called cross-border deals jumped to more than $1 trillion in the first half of the year, its second-highest level on record. Acquisitions of American companies by foreign buyers jumped 48 percent to $206 billion.A pickup in deal-making since 2015, if history is any indicator, is not necessarily a positive sign for the economy. Other recent peaks in merger and acquisition activity have been followed in short order by a recession.In 1989, deal-making topped out at $558 billion. By July of 1990, though, a recession had set in. Companies announced acquisitions worth a then-record $3.4 trillion in 2000, and within three months the dot-com bubble had burst and the United States economy had fallen into recession. Seven years later, merger activity hit another record, topping $4.1 trillion, but the economy had already slipped into recession as the year came to a close.Stephen F. Arcano, a partner specializing in mergers at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said that while the market for mergers is strong now, there could be reasons to be concerned about a slowdown.\u201cThe fundamentals for a strong M. & A. market are still in place, but there are risks that could become headwinds, such as the concerns regarding potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and, in the longer term, rising interest rates,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the National \u2018Mood\u2019 the One in Polls or the One Online?", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsIn psychological terms, \u201cmood\u201d is a weather report for your personal emotions, a measure of balmy good cheer or dreary storms. But our emotions, naturally, are influenced by the same winds of change that blow on every other person\u2019s. Certain clouds gather over all our heads \u2014 the hardships of a war, or a sudden economic downturn \u2014 and dump the same cold rain on everyone. Other days we bear witness to an unexpected act of heroism or a rousing international sports triumph and bask in the same sun. Psychologists have suggested for years that moods are actually contagious, meaning yours are just one part of a vast, dynamic system: We take in what those around us say, absorb the sentiments behind those words and slowly begin mirroring those feelings with our own.The idea of scientifically measuring such moods traces back at least as far as the 1930s, when George Gallup, the man who would one day be described by Time magazine as the \u201cBabe Ruth of the polling profession,\u201d founded the American Institute of Public Opinion and committed himself to collecting accurate data on the whole nation\u2019s sensibilities, unskewed by the ulterior motives of political parties or interest groups. The institute correctly predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would defeat the Republican challenger Alfred Landon in the 1936 presidential election; just two years after that, it had already begun conducting market research for studios in Hollywood. A new industry \u2014 public-opinion data as a valuable commodity, an advance warning of which way the country\u2019s emotional winds were blowing \u2014 was off and running.It\u2019s the job of politicians and the media\u2019s pundit class to utilize such numbers in the service of advocating and implementing public policy. A Quinnipiac poll in June showed that the family separations stemming from President Trump\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d border policy were so resoundingly opposed that, according to NBC News, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take a political scientist to read the current public mood on the topic.\u201d Sometimes hard numbers aren\u2019t even necessary; sheer political instinct will do. John Podhoretz of Commentary, assessing whether Republicans have a chance of holding their congressional advantages in the coming midterms, concluded, without citing any polling data, that voters \u201cwill probably be in a much better mood than previous midterm electorates\u201d because of the improving economy.Whether based on data or on intuition, all these divinations of the national mood are rooted in the idea that the most important parts of our emotional weather are happening outside us as individuals, over our collective heads. We\u2019ll act and think as a kind of hive mind, driving markets and electing officials and erupting in anger en masse, always gathering up into some kind of aggregate emotional register.In January, Ryan Cummings, then an eighth grader in North Carolina, participated in a cheerleading competition with a group called Cheer Extreme Allstars. At the beginning of her group\u2019s routine, she struck a defiant pose: Her head was cocked, her steely eyes stared unblinkingly forward and her lips were tightly pursed, forming an expression set somewhere between a smirk and a sneer \u2014 the sort of withering glare that adults secretly fear whenever walking past a pack of contemptuous teenagers on the street. (\u201cWhen I made that face,\u201d Cummings would later tell BuzzFeed, \u201cI was just thinking, I really want my team to kill it.\u201d) It\u2019s very unlikely that anyone outside Cheer Extreme Allstars\u2019 immediate sphere would be aware of that face were it not for a single Twitter account, which plucked, from a nearly six-minute YouTube video of the routine, a five-second clip of Cummings and captioned it with two simple words: \u201cbig mood.\u201d The resulting tweet has since been liked more than 164,000 times.It\u2019s that viral tweet about the young cheerleader, though, that has been credited by internet-culture sites like The Daily Dot with finally bringing \u201cbig mood\u201d to its mainstream saturation point, making the phrase fair game for use by established media, moderately hip parents and corporate brands. Cummings is a big reason you may have noticed a lot more things being categorized as big moods lately: Blake Lively\u2019s testy encounter with photographers at the Met Gala (as described by E! News), or a Japanese animated series on Netflix (as described by Elle), or a video of two lynxes yelling at each other (as described by Vice), or an important win by the Boston Red Sox (as described by the Boston Red Sox). Nothing is so small or inconsequential that it can\u2019t inspire the internet\u2019s outsize passions.We would rather our moods be big in this figurative sense (rich, vibrant, specific, intensely personal) than the literal one (collective, shared, part of a system that acts upon us). Social media emboldens this feeling of specialness. Who else but you would think to sum up a personal mood with, say, a photo of an exhausted squirrel, splayed out on a railing outside an office window? But of course hundreds of people recently favorited a tweet doing exactly that, offering replies like \u201csame\u201d and \u201cshe is me and I is her.\u201dThere\u2019s no avoiding these emotional contagions. Being inundated with so many moods can affect how we see everything around us, unleashing complex waves of uplift or tumult. If you scan social media these days, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the overriding sentiments \u2014 the inescapable moods that hang over all our heads like stagnant humidity \u2014 are those of annoyance, consternation and abstract misery. Not just about the day\u2019s news or the latest grand controversy, but about everything, in general. These feelings can feed into one another, influencing the collective mood as profoundly, and maybe as adversely, as world-historic news events and natural disasters and national humiliations. Take a step back, and you see something like a rat-king of feeling, the biggest mood of all.Advertisement"}

Rather than discuss an obscure plot point, a young woman wanted to share how the show, which has a number of L.G.B.T. characters, had helped her come out to her father, who brought her to the convention.\u201cIt was awesome and overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Rozon said. \u201cI was thinking, this is about way more than my character running from a tentacle.\u201dThe relationships among the cast and showrunner and \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d fans \u2014 known as \u201cEarpers\u201d \u2014 are so intense, the next year will bring conventions devoted solely to the show in Toronto, Minneapolis, New Orleans and London (again).It\u2019s a striking level of commitment for a program that only debuted two years ago and has aired a total of 25 episodes. But it\u2019s a bond that has helped the Syfy series, which returns July 20 for its third season, not just survive but thrive within the ever-changing pressure cooker of peak TV.With its modest Nielsen ratings, which average less than 900,000 viewers a week, \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d may not have made it past its first season. But as social media and a growing array of viewing platforms give networks more ways to gauge the value of niche audiences \u2014 and executives become more creative about monetizing them \u2014 \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d demonstrates how a distinctive premise, a passionate fan base and a creative team that respects and nurtures that enthusiasm can help an under-the-radar program flourish in a TV landscape that is tough even on acclaimed shows.By contrast, Syfy\u2019s deal with IDW Entertainment, the studio behind \u201cWynonna\u201d \u2014 struck a couple of years after it signed contracts for \u201cThe Expanse\u201d \u2014 gives the network more ways to make money. Commercials in on-air broadcasts, ads within online and app views and a Netflix streaming deal all bring Syfy revenue. It also helps that \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d costs less than \u201cThe Expanse.\u201dBut \u201cWynonna Earp,\u201d the tale of a woman and her allies battling monsters, has a value for Syfy beyond balance sheets, according to Chris McCumber, president of Syfy. Viewership among women aged 18-34 was up 44 percent in the show\u2019s second year, and more than half of the audience is women \u2014 the highest ratio within the otherwise male-skewing Syfy viewership.According to the lore of the show, Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano) is a descendant of Wyatt Earp, who got the clan put under a curse. As the Earp heir, Wynonna is fated to protect the hamlet of Purgatory \u2014 and the world \u2014 from the demons that bedevil the town. She has the special ability to wield Peacemaker, Wyatt\u2019s gun, which she uses to send Purgatory\u2019s \u201cRevenants\u201d back to hell, usually with a quip \u2014 and whiskey \u2014 at the ready.It\u2019s not for every taste \u2014 nor was it meant to be.The show has \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d on the social-media front, Mr. McCumber said. Last year, \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d had an average of 224,000 day-of-air Twitter engagements \u2014 seven times the next highest Syfy series. Overall Twitter activity was up 874 percent in Season 2, according to the firm ListenFirst. \u201cI\u2019m a real believer in social media and people using word of mouth \u2014 that matters more than ever,\u201d Mr. McCumber said.A year ago, Syfy made the slogan \u201cIt\u2019s a Fan Thing\u201d key to its marketing campaigns, thus \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d and its energetic supporters \u201cfit in perfectly with where we were going with the rebrand,\u201d Mr. McCumber said.The core elements of the premise \u2014 rogue tentacles, prickly villains, a found family and swoon-worthy romances \u2014 are familiar to aficionados of genre entertainment. But the twist it put on those basics helped \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d stand out and win fans.Ms. Andras\u2019s feminist outlook is much in evidence. Last season, Wynonna was pregnant (as was Ms. Scrofano), but she didn\u2019t let that slow her down. Both Doc and the former federal agent Xavier Dolls (Shamier Anderson) are attracted to Wynonna, but the romantic possibilities are just a part of the story, not the main point.\u201cShe\u2019s a female protagonist who is likable, but I think she\u2019s likable because of the freedom we had \u2014 she didn\u2019t have to live up to this weird archetype of the \u2018strong female character,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d Ms. Scrofano said.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re moving into a new neighborhood and everyone\u2019s there with cookies. It\u2019s an openhearted fandom,\u201d said David Ozer, the president of IDW Entertainment.They and other fandom leaders, like Bridget Liszewski, the editor of the site The TV Junkies, actively promote and encourage a friendly, tolerant Earper culture that emphasizes consideration and community-building over factional flame wars or personal attacks. Respectful differences are accommodated; toxic meltdowns, like the ones glimpsed in certain sectors of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d fandom, are not. They don\u2019t even record the video hangouts, a decision that aims to make guests, famous and not, \u201cfeel comfortable popping in to have fun,\u201d Mr. Bachelder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to live forever on the internet \u2014 everybody can just be themselves.\u201dAt that point, the most high-profile \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d couple was Waverly (Dominique Provost-Chalkley) and Purgatory cop Nicole Haught (Katherine Barrell) \u2014 a pairing known as \u201cWayHaught.\u201d\u201cI remember someone tweeting to me \u2018I\u2019m scared to fall in love with WayHaught,\u2019 and it broke my heart,\u201d Ms. Ferrar said.Aware of the worry, Ms. Andras made a bold and unusual move, in this era of spoiler-phobic showrunners. She told Ms. Liszewski and others in the media that Waverly and Nicole would survive the first season, and those TV writers spread the news weeks before the season finale.\u201cThe feeling was, \u2018We can enjoy the rest of this ride,\u2019\u201d Liszewski said.\u201cWynonna Earp\u2019s\u201d profile only grew once L.G.B.T. fans came on board in a big way. Twitter trending happened regularly during Season 2 and WayHaught fan art, fan fiction and T-shirts proliferated.\u201cFans love the exploration of L.G.B.T. romance on television. Contrary to the media\u2019s obsession with toxic male fandom, female fandom right now is pushing hard for more diverse and inclusive representation,\u201d said Henry Jenkins, a professor at the University of Southern California and a leading scholar of fan communities. \u201cThese changes can\u2019t happen fast enough, and this show is out front on those issues.\u201dBeing out front on the business side, in creative arenas and in the realms of inclusion and representation has led to a \u201cbright future,\u201d according to Mr. McCumber. And to a packed travel schedule for Ms. Andras and the cast, many of whom will be trekking to multiple conventions during the next year.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade the cult success of this show for billions of dollars,\u201d Ms. Andras said, and then paused. \u201cMaybe one more dollar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018GLOW\u2019 Brings #MeToo to the 1980s", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookSpoilers for Season 2 of \u201cGLOW\u201d follow.Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie) gets an exciting call: The head of the TV network, Tom Grant (Paul Fitzgerald), wants to have dinner with her to discuss her career. They make an appointment at a restaurant. A hotel restaurant. Where, when Ruth arrives, the host directs her to Tom\u2019s bungalow. \u201cMr. Grant always takes dinner meetings in his room,\u201d he says.Glen Klitnick (Andrew Friedman) \u2014 an executive at the local station that airs the wrestling show \u2014 meets Ruth and Tom in the room but quickly leaves to \u201cgrab a couple menus.\u201d Tom suggests that acting on a wrestling show must not be \u201cquite what you had in mind for yourself.\u201d Then he suggests that Ruth show him \u201ca move or two.\u201dIn the process, he\u2019s showing us his own moves \u2014 the signature playbook of serial predation, as refined and choreographed as any staged back flip.There are the quiet enablers, setting up a dinner that they must know isn\u2019t about dinner. There\u2019s the way Ruth alerts to the danger signs as soon as Glen leaves the room, but feels compelled to try to salvage the meeting. There\u2019s the way Tom simultaneously flatters Ruth and attacks her self-esteem, planting the idea that she\u2019s stuck, that she\u2019s a failure, that she needs something that he can give her.Ruth gingerly puts Tom in a headlock. He gropes her. She tries to make an excuse to leave, but he insists that she stay for \u201ca hot meal and a good bath.\u201d Finally, as he goes to run the Jacuzzi, she makes her escape.The scene would be effective enough as a sort of educational video: a step-by-step illustration of how predators operate and an answer to anyone who\u2019s asked, \u201cWhy would she let herself be put in that situation?\u201dBut the episode, written by Rachel Shukert, really distinguishes itself when Ruth tells the story to Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), her estranged best friend and co-star. (Debbie plays the patriotic hero Liberty Belle, Ruth her Soviet nemesis, Zoya.) They\u2019ve just gotten word that their show is being buried in a 2 a.m. time slot, and Ruth realizes she\u2019s probably the reason.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Debbie says. Ruth (and presumably the audience) assumes she\u2019s talking about the network dirtbag. She is not. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hotel room of the head of the network,\u201d she says, \u201che comes on to you and you run away?\u201dRuth, aghast, asks Debbie if she was supposed to have sex with him. \u201cNo! You\u2019re supposed to make him think that you might,\u201d Debbie says, \u201cif only you didn\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9 or your period or an extra set of teeth where your vagina should be.\u201dThis is not what Ruth expected. It\u2019s not what we, the audience watching in the #MeToo era, expect. Of course Ruth did nothing wrong. Of course it\u2019s not her job to make it easier for her boss to be a pig.The temptation is to write Debbie\u2019s response off to resentment (Debbie\u2019s ex-husband cheated on her with Ruth), selfishness, na\u00efvet\u00e9 or internalized sexism. But \u201cGLOW\u201d complicates the matter. Debbie, the show makes clear, is all too aware of her business\u2019s sexism.She came up in the business as a soap opera star, fought to become a producer of her low-budget wrestling show and applied her soap experience to the melodramatic story arcs of the ring. Yet she\u2019s dismissed, ignored and patronized by the men she works with.Earlier that same episode, she walked into a meeting where Glen greeted the director, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron), as an \u201cauteur\u201d; the show\u2019s money man, Bash Howard (Chris Lowell), as a \u201csuperproducer\u201d; and Debbie as \u201cthe beautiful Liberty Belle.\u201dThe scene between Ruth and Debbie is remarkable in part because of how well Ms. Gilpin simultaneously conveys Debbie\u2019s anger with her co-star and her exhaustion with her own situation. No, Ruth shouldn\u2019t have to pretend to enjoy Tom\u2019s lechery, she says. But, she adds, \u201cFeminism has principles. Life has compromises.\u201d\u201cGLOW\u201d is, at its core, about how women make art in an imperfect industry. In the wrestling ring, that means literally embodying the stereotypes they\u2019ve had imposed on them \u2014 pinups, bitches, vixens, hags. It can be empowering, and it can be objectifying, and sometimes the two are inseparable. (The episode\u2019s title, \u201cPerverts Are People, Too,\u201d refers to the cast members meeting some of the more attentive male fans who keep the show on the air.)But Tamm\u00e9 is also great in the role; her Welfare Queen is powerful and swaggering and unapologetic, and audiences \u2014 whatever subconscious prejudices the character is tweaking or appealing to \u2014 love to watch her. \u201cYou were right, it was offensive,\u201d he tells her. But also: \u201cYou threw a white girl across the ring? When did you get that strong?\u201dOut of the many ways in which the world has typecast them, the women of \u201cGLOW\u201d have made incendiary, punk entertainment. They\u2019re working with the world they\u2019ve been given. Just so, the showdown between Ruth and Debbie is about the strategies they\u2019ve each developed to apply their minds to an industry that wants to see them as bodies.The point of the scene is not so much who wins the argument, but why the argument happens in the first place. One of them has been harassed, one of them has been dismissed, yet here they are, pitted in the ring against each other. That\u2019s one of show business\u2019s oldest moves.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Future of MoviePass Is in Doubt After Service Outage, Experts Say", "Date": "2018-07-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoviePass, the subscription-based movie ticket service, was forced last week to borrow $5 million after it reported it could not pay its bills, raising new questions about the embattled company\u2019s viability.A movie ticket costs roughly $10, so if a subscriber saw more than one movie per month, the company would likely lose money, he said.Mr. Pachter predicted last week\u2019s outage will not be the last to affect MoviePass.\u201cThe $5 million was that last breath of oxygen,\u201d Mr. Pachter said on Sunday. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re deciding if we\u2019re going to cut off their oxygen.\u201dNeither MoviePass nor Helios and Matheson responded to requests for comment on Sunday.In previous interviews with The New York Times, Helios and MoviePass executives said they had access to financing that could keep the company afloat.Mr. Lowe thinks MoviePass\u2019s increased subscriber base can help buoy the company and that it will eventually make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters and charging studios fees to promote new films to members, among other strategies.The same optimism rippled through Mr. Lowe\u2019s message on Friday to MoviePass subscribers, though he declined to share the reasons behind the outage.He wrote that the company\u2019s mission was to make \u201cmoviegoing accessible to everyone and to enhance the power of discovery \u2014 but we need your support as we refine our model for the long-haul.\u201d\u201cI almost believe that they\u2019re going to have to do something rash or significant,\u201d Mr. Yoon said.Mr. Pachter, however, believed the outage signified the \u201cend of the end.\u201d He pointed to a troubling line in Mr. Lowe\u2019s message that said \u201ccertain movies may not always be available in every theater on our platform.\u201d\u201cWe are very sorry to users having issues checking-in this evening,\u201d the company said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emmy Nominations 2018: \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and Netflix Lead the Way", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards will be held on Monday, Sept. 17, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. The \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Weekend Update anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che will host the ceremony.It\u2019s a new era for the Emmys.The streaming service Netflix led the way with 112 nominations when they were announced on Thursday, snapping HBO\u2019s 17-year streak of being the most nominated network for TV\u2019s most coveted prize.HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d did lead all series with 22 nominations, followed by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC) and \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO), which each had 21, and Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which had 20.The awards will be handed out on Sept. 17.But Netflix\u2019s ascension is one that Hollywood has been anticipating. The streaming service pumps out new shows at a dizzying pace and spends plenty to make them \u2014 it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year, compared with HBO\u2019s $2.5 billion.Netflix\u2019s growth at the Emmys has been staggering. Three years ago it had just 34 nominations, an amount it more than tripled this year.\u201cWe are particularly enthused to see the breadth of our programming celebrated with nominations spread across 40 new and returning titles which showcase our varied and expansive slate \u2014 comedies, dramas, movies, limited series, documentary, variety, animation and reality,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in a statement.Still, Netflix\u2019s Emmy contenders are not expected to capture the top drama and comedy awards. And HBO, which nabbed 108 nominations, does have a 16-year streak of winning the most Emmys.Here are a few other story lines to keep an eye on as the awards show approaches.One of the key questions for Emmy voters: Will it be Westeros or Gilead?With \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d eligible at this year\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards for its not-so-recent seventh season, there will be a showdown between the dragon-fueled HBO juggernaut, twice recognized as best drama, and last year\u2019s top winner, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d from Hulu.Or perhaps things will go in another direction.Last year was a year of change at the Emmys with rookie shows like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d all nabbing best drama nominations. They were all among the seven nominees in the best drama category again, with FX\u2019s critical darling \u201cThe Americans\u201d also getting a nod for its final season. It is not unheard-of for Emmy voters to give shows a big trophy on their way out: Series like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d all claimed top prizes for their final seasons.The last time the Emmy for best actress in a comedy went to someone not named Julia Louis-Dreyfus, President Barack Obama was in his first term.The race is wide open. Rachel Brosnahan, who stars as a 1950s housewife-turned-comedian in Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d is an early favorite. (She won the Golden Globe in the same category in January.) Others in the running are the two-time nominee Tracee Ellis Ross from \u201cblack-ish,\u201d the seven-time Emmy winner Allison Janney for the CBS sitcom \u201cMom,\u201d Issa Rae from HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d Lily Tomlin from Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d and Pamela Adlon from FX\u2019s \u201cBetter Things.\u201dThe absence of \u201cVeep\u201d also means there will be a new winner in best comedy for the first time in four years. (Since 2007, there have been, remarkably, only three best comedy winners: \u201cVeep,\u201d \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201c30 Rock.\u201d) Donald Glover\u2019s boundary-pushing comedy, \u201cAtlanta,\u201d will be a favorite, along with \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d And for the first time since it has been on the air, the five-time best comedy winner \u201cModern Family\u201d was not nominated.John Oliver stands as the clear favorite in the best variety talk show category, with his weekly HBO series, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d winning the last two years.The show will have a prominent role: Its Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che are hosting this year\u2019s Emmys, and will likely bring several cast members along for the ride. And the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d impresario Lorne Michaels will executive produce the show, the first time he has done so since 1988.NBC\u2019s \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d could make some pop culture history. There are three people attached to NBC\u2019s live musical who are at the doorstep of joining the EGOT club \u2014 the exclusive and somewhat random assortment of people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.John Legend, who played Jesus Christ in the musical and was nominated for best actor in a limited series or movie, won an Oscar in 2015 for best original song for \u201cGlory\u201d from the movie \u201cSelma,\u201d and a Tony for serving as a producer for \u201cJitney,\u201d which won best revival of a play last year. He has also won several Grammys.The musical was nominated for best live variety special. Andrew Lloyd Webber and his longtime collaborator, Tim Rice, who are among the producers of the TV musical, are both an Emmy shy of an EGOT.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Judd Apatow on the Mystery Behind Garry Shandling", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJudd Apatow\u2019s passion project, the HBO documentary on his friend Garry Shandling titled \u201cThe Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling,\u201d was nominated for three Emmys on Thursday, including best documentary special and best director for a documentary.In a phone conversation, Mr. Apatow, who used to work for Mr. Shandling as a writer and a producer, discussed Shandling\u2019s impact on his own career and the process of making the four-and-a-half-hour film.I was reading your book \u201cSick In The Head\u201d recently and you seem genuinely fascinated by comedians and their thought process. Do you think about your own comedic process in the same way, for example, when you did your Netflix special?I\u2019m not that deep in my own comedic process because most of my process is borrowed from the approaches of other people. I don\u2019t feel any need to examine myself. I could be more simple about that: I don\u2019t think I bring anything new to how people approach comedy. I\u2019m more trying to refine the best of what a lot of different people have done and how they think about approaches to stories.What would your comedic sensibilities look like if you had never met Garry Shandling?I was so unfunny as a kid. I don\u2019t know how anybody tolerated me. I really didn\u2019t think much about the humanity of comedy until I met Garry. I was just trying to be funny. I didn\u2019t watch a lot of movies as a kid and try to figure out how they worked. I was only interested in standup. When I worked at \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show,\u201d that was the first time someone said the point of this show is to explore the human condition. No one had ever said that phrase \u201chuman condition\u201d to me in my entire life. That opened an entire new way of thinking to me, and that made me realize what the essence of comedy was.In the process of making the documentary, what was the most surprising thing you learned about Garry?The thing that was most surprising is that in his private moments, he was an even better person than I thought he was. I was just so moved by the fact that he\u2019s sitting in his room, alone with his journal, and he was working on himself. His number one focus was how he could be a better, kinder, more loving person. How could I drop my desires and attachments and treat myself and other people better? And that made me very happy to discover.Your Netflix special was very self deprecating. You\u2019ve talked about Garry Shandling wanting to find people\u2019s core in his writing. Were you thinking about that as you wrote material for this special?Garry came to see me do standup once and he said, \u201cThe only time you\u2019re doing it wrong is when you are trying to be a comedian.\u201d And that really was his way of looking at comedy. He thought it was trying to shed all of the artifice. I tried to think about that when I was writing standup for myself. I didn\u2019t attempt to invent a character. I just thought, \u201cHow do I get to the truth of what I am right now?\u201d My general point of view is that I\u2019m doing the best I can, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing anything correctly.This is an intensely personal project for you. Does the critical acclaim you\u2019ve received for it mean more to you than acclaim about work you\u2019ve done in the past?It was important to me that it was honest and my subjective view expressing who Garry was. The only thing that mattered was that at the end of the day, that I can watch it and feel like I got close to the truth \u2014 that Garry was a mystery to a lot of people. I only had one concern, which was to not screw it up. I felt a responsibility to my friend to not be inaccurate. I knew what he would value the most would be telling the truth. Because that\u2019s what \u201cLarry Sanders\u201d was: Here\u2019s what people look like, flaws and all.You are working on a million projects at any given time. What are you most excited about right now?That\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019m directing an episode of \u201cCrashing\u201d as we speak. We\u2019re pitching a third season. I\u2019m writing a few things and I\u2019m hoping to direct a feature film next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Yourself in Los Angeles", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "PursuitsThe novelist Reif Larsen seeks out sites of reverence in and around this sprawling city, places of quiet contemplation far from the gridlock and glamour.Supported byIt was 3:30 p.m. I was already running half an hour late. This was because I am not from Los Angeles and I had grossly underestimated the time it would take to get from Santa Monica to West Adams on Interstate 10, a mere 11 miles as the crow flies.That sound you hear right now is the sound of a thousand Angelenos scoffing: \u201cThe 10? Going east? At that hour? What are you some kind of masochist?\u201dWhat should\u2019ve taken me 12 minutes took over an hour in five-lane, bumper-to-bumper traffic. There\u2019s a kind of existential calm that settles over you when surrounded by such a sea of cars, when there is no chance of anyone getting anywhere anytime soon. Even the on-ramps seem to be in on the joke: like a bouncer at a very desirable club, a traffic light allows only a single car at a time the great privilege of merging into this gridlock. Sitting there you must embrace the ancient, contradictory notion of festina lente: to make haste slowly. You are not where you are supposed to be, but you are where you are.Pasadena210MOJAVEDESERTGriffithParkIntegratron(Landers)The HuntingtonDetail area1015LosAngelesJoshua TreeNational Park110Elysian ParkHollywoodCALIFORNIA50 mileSCaliforniaLos AngelesEchoParkBeverly Hills10405Pacific PalisadesUnion StationGrand Central MarketSelf Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine The Last BookstoreMid CityDowntownEames Foundation6010Peace Awareness Labyrinth and Gardens5Santa Monica11012 miles710IntegrationLandersMOJAVEDESERT5Detail areaThe HuntingtonJoshua TreeNational ParkLosAngeles10CALIFORNIA50 mileS4 miles5101CaliforniaLos Angeles405Union StationSelf Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine Grand Central MarketThe Last Bookstore10Eames FoundationPeace Awareness Labyrinth and GardensSanta MonicaBy The New York TimesThe Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens is tucked behind a Beaux-Arts Italian villa on one of those wide, anonymous Los Angeles boulevards. These boulevards offer both the best and worst of the city: there are never any pedestrians; every surface is too bright; every lawn too green, and yet every building, no matter how garish, has some fantastical story to tell if only you stop to listen.The Italian Renaissance Revival villa that houses the Peace Gardens is sandwiched between a Polish shrine to Pope St. John Paul II and a low-slung stucco apartment block that looks like the scene of a murder in a 1930s noir film. The lavish villa was built in 1914 for Secondo Guasti, a penniless Italian immigrant who became California\u2019s largest winemaker despite widespread skepticism at the time that such an industry could ever thrive in the state. In 1974 the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, a new-age church focused on \u201csoul transcendence,\u201d purchased the villa and in 2002 constructed the Peace Awareness Labyrinth & Gardens, optimistically, for a post-9/11 world. The gardens are open to the public by appointment. If possible, try not to miss your appointment because of existential traffic jams.Despite the late hour, I was greeted at the villa\u2019s entrance by a kind man named Juan Roberto.\u201cWe\u2019re very glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said. Memories of Interstate 10 bedlam began to evaporate as we promenaded through the compact, tiered garden, serenaded by the gentle babble of small fountains. The Japanese call such walks shinrin-yoku, or \u201cforest bathing.\u201d\u201cThere used to be many more plants, too many plants,\u201d said Juan Roberto. \u201cWe realized you needed open space to reflect.\u201dHe showed me how to walk the labyrinth, a circular pathway of travertine marble. Have you ever walked a labyrinth? Labyrinths, unlike mazes, are unicursal \u2014 they have only one way in and one way out. Each step becomes a purposeful movement. They are an ancient form of meditation; this one is based on the labyrinth at the Chartres Cathedral in France, built in the early 13th century. As you walk, the city becomes a distant dream, a movie half-remembered. In a way, it is bit like the festina lente of Interstate 10, but without the cars, the smog, the man in the neon-yellow Dodge Charger listening to Whitesnake\u2019s \u201cHere I go Again\u201d at peak volume. One way in, one way out.What is strange is that many Angelenos I talked to echoed this view of interstate gridlock as a kind of contemplative lacuna. I was told on multiple occasions that in order to be truly at home in this city, you had to make peace with your commute.\u201cMy car is my safe space,\u201d one person told me.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the podcast,\u201d said another.For many, the car, that private palace of glass and steel, is now the place where we perform the majority of our essential business; the place where we make up, break up, wake up.Maybe it is the East Coaster in me, but I find this slightly dispiriting. Have our automobiles replaced our churches? Can you practice shinrin-yoku in a Chevy? Cars and all their associated infrastructure do not help build communities in cities. For decades, interstates have cleaved open neighborhoods, lowered property values and compounded segregation. What will happen when fully autonomous vehicles arrive on a wide scale and we can finally take our hands off the wheel? Will we binge-watch Netflix shows during our commute? Will we ever get out of our cars again?Then again, places of refuge can take on all forms. Who am I to judge? A sanctuary for one can be a hell for another. In New York City, where space is at a premium, there are strict, unspoken codes of privacy and proximity: you can stand this close in a subway car and this close in an elevator and this close while waiting in line for an egg and cheese. An end seat on the subway becomes a private temple. A pair of earphones offers a vital cocoon of sound. A corner of a closet becomes a consecrated shrine to high-top shoes.In Los Angeles, there is more room to spread out. Aside from the strange liminal anomaly of downtown, Los Angeles is not a vertical city; it is a city of boulevards and interchanges, of 30-foot palm trees and drive-through liquor stores. The quality of life is better. You can have fresh avocados every morning; the weather is like free Xanax; you can take meetings in the morning and be chased by a bobcat in the afternoon. Given such a bounty of natural riches, do Angelenos even need spaces of retreat? Or was the entire city its own surreal sanctuary?Our family stayed at an Airbnb in Echo Park in a little 1920s bungalow nestled behind our hosts\u2019 home. Echo Park is a fairly unique locale in Los Angeles in that you can walk most places. I even saw other people walking on the sidewalk. We made the secret walker sign to one another. As I walked, I noticed the self-contained worlds of people\u2019s forecourts: a petite bench beneath a prolific grapefruit tree, a strange flock of robot sculptures, what looked like the world\u2019s tiniest vineyard. I walked up the hill to Elysian Park and discovered secret, unnamed streets not on any map. Our Airbnb hosts had placed a couple of chairs and a table in the middle of a little dead end to nowhere.Where is your retreat? What do you do to escape from it all?I emerged from the cavernous, Art Deco masterpiece of Union Station into a neighborhood where each shop seemed to be peddling only one thing: the shop selling Jesus statuettes was next to the shop selling giant stuffed bears was next to the shop selling soccer uniforms for babies was next to the shop selling pi\u00f1atas.In recent years there has been a big effort to rejuvenate Downtown Los Angeles. Amid this urban rejuvenation you will find the Last Bookstore, one of the world\u2019s best. In the past, Los Angeles had developed an unfair reputation for being anti-intellectual. In reality, the city is a vibrant, artistic, literary place; perhaps it is the sprawl that makes its various beacons of culture feel like stars in a distant constellation. The list of writers who have attempted to capture the city\u2019s many beguiling contradictions is long and varied: Raymond Chandler, Joan Didion, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathanael West, Charles Bukowski, Eve Babitz.Their ghosts haunt the Last Bookstore. When you enter, you are asked to hand over your backpack. This is ostensibly to prevent shoplifting but it felt more symbolic, as though you must leave any remnant of the outside world behind. As soon as you pass through the front door, it is as if you have entered a different era, before the death of our collective attention. The Last Bookstore is truly a refuge, books literally form walls and windows, archways, tumble off shelves. The place feels like a living, breathing being, with various catacombs and vaults and catwalks that disobey the laws of gravity. I spent all afternoon there, stumbling upon books that I never knew I was missing.Even if Los Angeles crumbled around it\u2014burned up in the wildfires, collapsed in an earthquake, dried up in a drought, was entombed in a mudslide\u2014 the Last Bookstore would still remain. When my backpack was finally returned to me upon my exit, it took a moment to adjust to the idea that I would need such a bag again, that there was still a place outside where backpacks were useful.Across town, far from the urban stage set of downtown, you will find two beautiful, divergent sites of reflection and retreat in the Pacific Palisades.The property was in turn sold to an oil executive who planned on turning the lake into a resort. Except then he began having this recurring dream in which he had transformed the site into a Church of All Religions. The oil executive looked up \u201cChurch of All Religions\u201d in the phone book (this was back when people looked in phone books) and found Yogananda, who somehow already knew he would be calling. Yogananda accepted the property and constructed a temple, a meditation garden and a peace memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.I visited the Lake Shrine on a cold, misty day, more reminiscent of San Francisco than Los Angeles. The houseboat is still there. The windmill has been transformed into a meditation chapel. Somehow they fit perfectly within this hodgepodge of serene spirituality. It is a collage of eclectic yet entangled visions and in this way it feels very \u201cL.A.\u201dI wandered the path of the lake, stumbling upon people in various states of contemplation. Two enlightened swans floated by. I wondered if they were paid actors.The house is actually two rectangular cubes of glass, quietly set into the hillside. The open, modular floor plans are filled with the delectable detritus of a lifetime of thinking and designing: African masks, bright Afghan textiles, little prototypes for toys never built. It is the urtext, what every midcentury modern space before and since aspires to be.Crucially, the attention of the house is not focused on itself but on its serene surrounds, a little wild meadow surrounded by a grove of eucalyptus trees, the ocean just visible beyond.This was their retreat, their \u201cshock absorber,\u201d as they termed it, from the outside world. But it was also a place of work. One of the cubes functioned as their studio, a space of collaboration and experimentation where their colleagues would come and get messy. And it is this duality that I am most drawn to: that a private space of contemplation can also be a place of intense activation. A retreat is not so much a retreat but a re-turn, a re-think, a re-view, in its literal sense. All my best ideas come when I have stepped away from my office, when I am in the shower or running or shinrin-yoku-ing and have a chance to view my work from a new angle. I have learned to keep little notebooks in strange places. Every car in Los Angeles should come equipped with a Dictaphone in the glovebox.The most profound retreat from the city remains actually retreating from the city. So when the weekend rolled round we made like the locals and fled the City of Angels for the temptations of the high desert. You have to drive a couple of hours to escape the metro area\u2019s prolific spread, which percolates into the surrounding valleys like an ever-growing amoeba, but when you finally do, the Mojave Desert swallows you whole.Van Tassel, who claimed he had once been abducted by Venusians, built the Integratron as a kind of time machine. He had plans to construct a multiple wave oscillator that would utilize a high voltage Tesla coil to rejuvenate biological tissue. Twenty-minute intervals inside the dome would allegedly add years to one\u2019s life. Unfortunately, Van Tassel was never able to test his machine as he died of a heart attack just before its opening in 1978. The machine\u2019s plans then mysteriously disappeared.Today the Integratron is owned by three sisters originally from Long Island. For the last 15 years they have been performing sound baths in the \u201cacoustically perfect\u201d dome using a series of quartz singing bowls that are precisely tuned to the body\u2019s seven chakras. Apparently Angelenos\u2019 chakras are way out of whack; these sound baths are booked months in advance.As you prepare for your sound bath, there is a little courtyard of hammocks and junkyard art where you can lounge, dream, pant. A statue of the Virgin Mary sits among a cactus grove.When it was finally my turn, I entered the Integratron alongside my fellow sound bathers \u2014 hipsters, Mormons, surfers, aliens, a pro basketball player \u2014 and lay down on my mat, ears turned heavenward.Gradually I relaxed, accepting this sonic intrusion. Then, welcoming it. The bath lasts about 25 minutes; only a dozen or so extended notes are played on the bowls during this time. After it was all done, when I finally managed to extricate myself from the dome\u2019s embrace, I had trouble walking a straight line. My chakras had not been bathed, they had been power washed.As I was leaving, I overheard a couple arguing whether they could make it back to the city in time to catch their favorite yoga class. The traffic would be \u201cfierce,\u201d said the man. I wanted to tell him about the labyrinth, about festina lente, about the Dictaphone in his glovebox. I couldn\u2019t find the words.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d a woman in a cowboy hat asked me, spotting my chakral wobble.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a movie,\u201d I said.\u201cAmen,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect location for the gardens of the Huntington.

{"Headline": "Beauty, Bad Temper and Scandal in a Riveting Look at Princess Margaret", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesThe past, Julian Barnes once wrote, has a way of behaving like a piglet, greased up and let loose in a room. It makes a lot of noise. People make fools of themselves trying to capture it. Invariably, it slips away.As a subject, the princess proves to be something she never was in life: obliging. Beautiful, bad-tempered, scandal-prone, she makes for unfailingly good copy, and heaps of it. \u201cEveryone seems to have met her at least once or twice, even those who did their best to avoid her,\u201d Brown writes. \u201cShe shows up without warning, popping her head around the door of every other memoir, biography and diary written in the second half of the 20th century\u201d \u2014 usually to insult her hostess or use someone\u2019s hand as an ashtray.But, for a time, her charms were considerable. \u201cLittle hot looking pretty girl,\u201d according to Ralph Ellison. Picasso desperately wanted to marry her. Peter Sellers would have settled for an affair. John Fowles publicly fantasized about abducting her and keeping her as a prisoner.The princess could, her father said, \u201ccharm the pearl out of an oyster.\u201d Her interests, however, ran more to sadistic parlor games (she makes an indelible appearance in Edward St. Aubyn\u2019s Patrick Melrose novels). She was aflame with snobbery and, as she grew older, addicted to bullying and one-upmanship. She would boast about her royal status to her children, and insist lovers address her as Your Royal Highness. When needing a rest, she was known to commandeer the Queen Mother\u2019s wheelchair.\u201cDisobedience is my joy,\u201d she supposedly told Jean Cocteau. But it was more than that; it was her identity. It was the opinion of Gore Vidal, one of her more loyal friends, that since the queen was the source of national honor and duty, it fell to the princess to be the evil sister, the source of \u201ccreative malice.\u201d (Of Vidal, the princess once said dryly: \u201cThe trouble with Gore is that he wants my sister\u2019s job.\u201d)But, as Brown reveals, those cutting remarks and outrageous scenes were a form of bizarre achievement and autonomy in a life that was otherwise barren. Margaret had no education, no occupation, no formal role. From time to time she\u2019d preside over, say, the opening of a pumping station. Her relationships were chilly. She communicated with her mother by letter even when they lived one floor apart. Her marriage was a disaster. After the scandal of her love affair with an older, divorced man (a key story strand in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown\u201d), she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who evinced a talent for cruelty all his own. He liked to leave little notes for her tucked into the book on her bedside table that said simply, \u201cI hate you.\u201d Other than her two children (oddly absent from the narrative), her most memorable accomplishment was gluing matchboxes to tumblers so she could light cigarettes without interrupting her drinking.Advertisement"}

Even though this was just a friendly pickup game between family and friends, he felt the anticipatory rush of joy at scoring. But the goalie dived and caught the ball. A little disappointed, James headed out to the middle of the field to take his position and try again. He\u2019d run just a few steps when suddenly he felt the soccer ball slam into the back of his head. He felt his neck snap forward from the force of this impact. Everything went black for a second and he experienced a sharp stab of nausea so strong that he thought he would vomit right there on the field. The game stopped, and the goalie ran up to him. \u201cJames, are you O.K.? I didn\u2019t mean to hit you,\u201d the goalie said. \u201cI\u2019m O.K.,\u201d he told his friend, \u201cReally.\u201d Then he headed to the sidelines to sit and recover. He did a quick mental survey and then, after a couple of minutes, rejoined the game.\u2193\u201cYou O.K.?\u201d his mother asked when he was back on the field. She was on the same team, running toward him when got hit. She was worried to see how his head had snapped forward from the force of the ball. \u201cTotally,\u201d he responded, a little embarrassed by all the attention he\u2019d gotten. And he was O.K., that day. But the next day at school, James started to feel a little strange. Though he was an excellent student as a sophomore at his public high school in Las Vegas, he felt unusually slow, as if there was a fog in his brain that kept him from thinking clearly. It wasn\u2019t painful, but it felt odd and unpleasant, as if there were molasses in his brain, slowing down or even short-circuiting the connections he was trying to make. The words he wanted to say seemed just a little harder to find. The sentences coming out of his mouth sounded a little more awkward.\u2193Then James suddenly started having trouble sleeping. He had no trouble going to sleep, but there were nights when he would wake feeling short of breath. He searched for reasons online and thought he may have sleep apnea. He went back to the pediatrician who was dubious, but ordered a sleep study. The study came back normal.He continued to experience the \u201csloshing\u201d sensation whenever he ran or otherwise moved his head abruptly. Although he stayed on the school swim team (and even made it to the state championships that year), running and soccer were out of the question. When tennis began in the fall, James found that the sudden starts, stops and turns required to play the game were too much for him. He had to quit the tennis team too. But what was most concerning was the way the fog machine in his brain made thinking, talking, reading and writing more difficult. James continued to do well in school, but he could tell he wasn\u2019t the same student he used to be.He finally admitted this to his mother. As the oldest of four siblings and with his mother studying to become a nurse, James was reluctant to complain. Still, he felt like there was something wrong. He just hadn\u2019t felt the same since getting struck with that ball nearly one year earlier.\u2193I first saw him in November 2017. He appeared to be a healthy guy \u2014 robust, articulate and thoughtful. He told me about his \u201cbrain sloshing\u201d and the fogginess it caused. What was really puzzling and frustrating to him was that the same activities didn\u2019t bring on the same response. Certainly, he was most likely to feel foggy after a nice long run or a game of tennis. But it didn\u2019t always happen that way. Sometimes he would feel fine after those activities. And sometimes a trivial event \u2014 say a drive down a rough road \u2014 would cause terrible brain fog. After examining him, I was inclined to agree with the doctors he\u2019d already seen. This probably was some kind of post-concussive syndrome. For that, as far as I had read, there was little evidence that any sort of treatment made a difference. This kind of minor traumatic brain injury is something medicine has only recently begun to focus on.But I didn\u2019t want to miss something that could be treated. James\u2019s sensitivity to movement suggested the possibility that his problem could involve his inner ear. The vestibular nerve, which has the job of helping our brain understand where we are in the world, can be injured when someone experiences head trauma. This could be the reason for his reaction to movement, and abnormalities of the vestibular nerve can be treated. I sent him for testing of his vestibular nerve.He also complained of numbness of his thumb and fingers on both hands. He certainly was on his computer often enough. Could he have carpel tunnel syndrome (C.T.S.), where numbness, usually in the thumb and first two fingers, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the bony structures of the wrist into the hand? The hand elevation test, which seeks to reproduce those symptoms when patients hold their hands above their heads for two minutes, suggested he might. I decided to send him for an electromyogram \u2014 a test that can identify the origin of nerve dysfunction by tracking how quickly a signal moves from the affected part to the spine. I would expect the EMG to show a slowing of the nerve signal at the wrist if he had C.T.S.I gave him some time to get the tests and he followed up with me after Christmas.\u2193James came back to see me in January. None of his tests revealed any abnormalities. The EMG didn\u2019t show any slowing of the nerve signal as it moved from his hand up his arm into his spine. I wasn\u2019t sure what was causing his hand numbness. And the neurologist who saw him for the vestibular evaluation (also completely normal) thought that his sensitivity to motion and foggy brain could be an atypical migraine, which have been known to follow even minor brain injury. He recommended the patient take Riboflavin \u2014 a B vitamin that has been shown to reduce migraine frequency.James told me that he had been taking the riboflavin but didn\u2019t think it helped much. He took it daily for a few weeks but then gave up on it. He did have a new symptom he wanted to show me. When he flexed his neck or back, his muscles would start jerking when he moved them back into place. His muscles were able to flex smoothly, but returning them back into their normal, neutral position, lifting his head or lowering his shoulders, would make the muscles tremble. It reminded me of the kind of shaking you see in a muscle that has been worked out to the point of fatigue. But his muscles weren\u2019t fatigued. I wasn\u2019t sure what that was. I brought in a couple of my colleagues to see this strange reaction. They weren\u2019t sure what it was either.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.I couldn\u2019t figure out how or even if this symptom was related to his injury from so many years ago. My first plan was to get a look at his old records, done at the time of the injury in 2014, as well as the M.R.I. imaging he\u2019d had done. Maybe there was something there. When that was unrevealing and the problem seemed to extend to his wrist and arms, I decided to send him to two neurologists who I thought would be able to help me figure out what was going on.James finished the school year and few flew home to Las Vegas. We\u2019ve been in touch. He feels better at home but will still get that molasses-in-the-brain fogginess that he finds so distressing. What could cause this healthy, active young man to be so sensitive to motion? Why would even normal jostling make him feel as if his brain is \u201csloshing\u201d around his skull?

{"Headline": "New York Today: Are Electric Scooters Legal?", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 10:38 a.m.Good morning on this sparkling Thursday.So what\u2019s the deal: Are they legal here?\u201cThey are illegal and I am not aware of anything in the works to change that,\u201d Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Transportation Department, said in an email.Violators may receive a $500 civil penalty if they are caught riding them, and their scooters may be impounded.But many New Yorkers are seemingly not concerned about getting a citation.The biggest obstacle here: There\u2019s no place for scooters, physically.\u201cThey\u2019re too fast for the sidewalk, they\u2019re too slow for traffic, and they\u2019re too slow for bike lanes, so there isn\u2019t a safe space for them,\u201d Ms. Kaufman said. (Most can go up to 15 miles per hour.) \u201cThe focus here is on dockless bikes and electric-assist bikes because those are the speeds of New York.\u201dEven so, exploring travel alternatives remains top-of-mind for some city residents. With the L train shutdown less than a year away, scooters could offer \u201ca great advantage\u201d to those affected, according to Ms. Kaufman, who led a Rudin Center report on ways to mitigate commutes during the closure of the subway line.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have hundreds of thousands of people needing to find new modes of transportation,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause there will be overcrowding on other subway lines, we might as well provide a variety of modes like rideshare and bus-bridges and, of course, bike share. However, not every person can or is willing to ride a bike.\u201dScooters have a lower barrier to entry, she added.\u201cYou\u2019re generally not scooting in traffic \u2014 you\u2019re generally on the sidewalk \u2014 and it\u2019s easier to learn to navigate a scooter, and you don\u2019t necessarily need a helmet like you do with a bike,\u201d she said, \u201cso people see it as an easier mode. A faster mode than walking, but not as labor intensive or stressful as biking.\u201dBut do keep in mind: Electric scooters still don\u2019t have the green light in New York City and you could be pulled over.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Perfection!If only.They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.So behold \u2026 these vibrant New York City potholes.Last week, he completed his \u201cVermin of New York\u201d series in Manhattan and Brooklyn, featuring pothole mosaics of a cockroach (on Bleecker Street near Mercer Street in Greenwich Village); a rat (on South Oxford Street in Fort Greene); a pigeon (on Pacific Street near Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights); and President Trump (on Second Street between First Avenue and Avenue A in the East Village).The message: Explore the great outdoors that is New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disney-Fox Deal", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:Contrary to your suggestion, the investigation was thorough: Disney and Fox produced millions of documents and large quantities of data and engaged in extensive discussions with the Justice Department. After resolving other issues, the department focused on the regional sports networks, something that many had anticipated. Indeed, Disney agreed last December to divest them, if necessary.On the timing? Instead of spending months seeking a lesser remedy, as some parties do, Disney agreed to divest all of the regional sports networks, providing the clean, structural relief the department favors.Your concern about the market share of the combined studios is misplaced, as it ignores the competition from Universal, Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony-Columbia, Lionsgate, Netflix, Amazon and others. And your selective focus on a five-month box-office period ignores the fact that the average combined share of Disney and Fox studios has been below levels traditionally challenged by the department in other cases.THOMAS O.

{"Headline": "How to Stop Your Smart TV From Tracking What You Watch", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMillions of smart TVs in American homes are tracking everything you watch for the sake of advertisers. If that doesn\u2019t sit right with you, here\u2019s how to turn it off.Your smart TV is probably tracking everything that appears on the screen. While ad tracking is par for the course on the internet in 2018, smart TVs are particularly interesting. They don\u2019t just track the shows you stream on their built-in apps: they can recognize any show you\u2019re watching, any game you\u2019re playing, or any ad that appears on the screen \u2014 from any device connected to the TV.First, if you don\u2019t use the smart features on your TV, you can block this tracking by simply disconnecting your TV from the internet. Either unplug the Ethernet cable or disconnect it from your Wi-Fi network in the TV\u2019s settings. Without internet access, the TV can\u2019t send information to anyone, meaning your data stays at home. However, it also means your TV\u2019s built-in apps won\u2019t be able to stream any movies or shows, so this solution works only if you get your streaming from a set-top box like the Apple TV (or don\u2019t stream at all).If that isn\u2019t an option, you can keep streaming from your TV and turn automatic content recognition off. The instructions are a little different depending on what model TV you have, but here\u2019s where to look on the most popular brands.If you have a Samsung smart TV, open the home menu and head to Settings > Support > Terms & Policies. Turn off the \u201cViewing Information Services\u201d and \u201cInterest-Based Advertising\u201d options. (Some older models may call this feature \u201cSyncPlus and Marketing\u201d instead.)For LG sets, press the Settings button on your remote and head to All Settings > General > LivePlus and turn it off. You may also want to turn off personalized advertising from All Settings > General > About This TV > User Agreements from the General page. Vizio users will find this option by opening the menu and looking under System > Reset & Admin. Highlight the \u201cViewing Data\u201d option and press the right arrow to turn it off. Some older sets may call this \u201cSmart Interactivity\u201d instead. TVs from TCL, Philips, Sharp and some other brands use Roku as their built-in smart software. On these TVs, you can disable Automatic Content Recognition by opening the home screen heading to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience and disabling \u201cUse Information for TV Inputs\u201d. You may also want to head to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and turn on \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d.Your TV isn\u2019t the only thing tracking your usage. Independent set-top boxes like the Roku and Apple TV don\u2019t use Automatic Content Recognition \u2014 the feature that scans everything from your screen \u2014 but they do still have certain tracking features built-in, usually logging which apps you use and when. If you\u2019re interested in increasing your privacy, you may want to disable these features as well. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find them:There\u2019s no way to escape all tracking, of course, especially if you\u2019re streaming. These settings may limit some data collection, but even they won\u2019t stop the streaming services themselves: apps like Netflix will always track what you watch to provide recommendations, and there\u2019s no getting around that. So if you want true privacy, you\u2019ll need to divorce yourself from streaming services entirely. You\u2019ll just need to decide how much you really care.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Want This Tattoo? Get in Line", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeith McCurdy, the owner of Bang Bang, has transformed the body-art industry with his diverse hiring and high prices. Of course there\u2019s a wait list.In a city where high-end hairdressers charge upward of $500 an appointment, it was only a matter of time before tattoos ceased to be a bargain.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d said Jack Powers, a 22-year-old operations manager at a logistics company, putting aside the stuff about death and body decomposition. \u201cYou got to go to the best of the best.\u201d Part of the price is attributable to a so-called celebrity tax: Professionals like personal trainers and cosmetic dermatologists can often double or triple prices after getting publicity from famous clients. It was Rihanna who put the \u201cbang\u201d in Bang Bang.She stumbled upon the shop\u2019s owner, Keith McCurdy, 11 years ago, when he was working at a tattoo and piercing shop on West Fourth Street, one of the few remaining blocks in Lower Manhattan that hasn\u2019t been transformed by luxury-goods boutiques. Rihanna came in for a nipple piercing and walked out with several lines of Sanskrit inked on her hip. Last month, Bang Bang opened a second shop, on Grand Street in SoHo, mere feet from an Alexander Wang store. Mr. McCurdy said the cost of the renovation there was north of $1 million. A look around provides little reason to doubt him. The floors are covered in freshly pressed concrete. A wall of screens displays promotional material about the store\u2019s artists, all shot by a full-time videographer. A large aquarium filled with koi runs across the back wall, by a black steel staircase leading to a downstairs lounge where Fiji water is served by the caseload.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Apple store in here,\u201d Miley Cyrus said Saturday night, when she showed up with a friend to have her mother\u2019s signature inked on her arm and then decided to get a second tattoo on her ankle: slang for part of the female genitalia. For four hours, I was at the next station over, getting a bird tattooed on my arm, at a price that exceeded my last paycheck. (The New York Times does not take freebies.)The fancy digs, celebrity adherents and notorious waits for appointments have earned Mr. McCurdy a fair amount of ire in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m public enemy No. 1,\u201d he said. Really?In a movie about his life, Mr. McCurdy, 32, might be played by Seth Rogen: also a bearish guy who is both delightful and aggressive, nerdy and cool, stoner-ish and Type A \u2014 an empath who loves a brawl.Although Mr. McCurdy has made millions of dollars with his craft, he has no interest in fancy watches, art or real estate. Instead, he sermonizes about simple pleasures like Popsicles and amusement parks, particularly Disney World, which he visits multiple times a year with his employees and sees as a metaphor for what America (and his business) should be: futuristic, easy, open to all races, ages and religions. \u201cThey\u2019re the best people in the world at tricking your eye,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said of Disney, sitting in the lounge on Grand Street, wearing Y3 sweat shorts and a black $10 Goonies T-shirt from Target. Mr. McCurdy\u2019s own story is a triumph of American possibility. He grew up in Claymont, Del. His father, Vincent Lacava, was 16 when Keith was born, and his mother, Susan McCurdy, was 17. Ms. McCurdy and Mr. Lacava broke up soon after. He went off to college, and she dropped out of high school and became a stripper. \u201cThere was no shame around it,\u201d said Mr. McCurdy, who dedicated his book to her. \u201cShe was a feminist, and she paid the bills.\u201d Eventually, she opened a cleaning business, relying heavily on her son. \u201cOne of his chores was to rake the leaves,\u201d Ms. McCurdy said. \u201cI remember one day, I walked onto the deck and he had the other kids raking them for him. But he got it done. He was always a delegator.\u201dAt 15, Mr. McCurdy pressured his mother to let him get a tattoo and they struck a deal. If he made the honor roll \u2014 he was not a good student \u2014 he could get one. Soon enough, they drove to a nearby parlor, where Mr. McCurdy got what he describes as \u201cthe cheesiest version of the Superman logo you have ever seen.\u201dUnlike Clark Kent, though, he dropped out of high school, bought a tattoo kit online for $268 and began practicing on a cousin, Edward Borew, now the manager of the store. In 2004, Mr. McCurdy got his first job as a tattooer, working at Rage of the Needle in New Castle, Del. \u201cIf I made $200 a day, it was awesome,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cThe most money I got was from doing tattoo parties in clients\u2019 houses. Then I could make five or six hundred dollars in a night.\u201dLess than a year later, Mr. McCurdy moved to New York, where he lived with his father, who was working as a video-game designer, in a tiny Midtown studio. Mr. McCurdy took a job tattooing the most inebriated among the Verrazano bridge set, at a West 4th street shop called Crazy Fantasy that also sold sex toys and did piercings, and shared a bathroom with the Papaya Dog next door.Mr. Borew had arrived in New York soon after Mr. McCurdy and had gone to work for Andre Balazs at the Mercer Hotel, where he earned a doctorate in tending to fancy people. Mr. McCurdy moved from Crazy Fantasy to what he called a \u201cslightly less disgusting\u201d shop, Whatever Tattoo.In the foreword for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s book, Rihanna writes that Mr. McCurdy did not even know who she was the night she rolled into Whatever, to her delight: \u201cI remember thinking this guy is gangsta.\u201d Impressed by the Freddy Krueger tattoo he had inked on the shop\u2019s manager and his input on where to place the Sanskrit message, she not only returned for more tattoos but also connected various people in her orbit to Mr. McCurdy.After tabloid coverage, demand for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services grew exponentially. He bounced between Last Rites and East Side Ink, two of New York\u2019s best known high-end tattoo shops, burnishing his star and alienating his bosses.\u201cPeople told me I stepped on people to get where I am,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stepped on people, but I sometimes pushed them out of my way. Wouldn\u2019t everybody?\u201dAt East Side Ink he determined that he was the shop\u2019s biggest earner and pressed for an ownership stake in the business. \u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d said Josh Lord, the owner. At the time, Mr. McCurdy and his wife, Etsuko Tsujimoto, had a young daughter and another one on the way. Soon, he started making arrangements to open his own shop and made offers to a number of people on the staff. Mr. Lord found out about this, and Mr. McCurdy was ultimately fired. Today, Mr. Lord calls Mr. McCurdy \u201cthe worst person\u201d who ever worked for him, which seems slightly out of sync with the offense committed. Unfazed, Mr. McCurdy professes a continued desire to steal Mr. Lord\u2019s best artist, Cheo Park. \u201cI\u2019d make him more money too,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said, adding that it has been a pleasure to \u201ckick their\u201d butts, referring to East Side.Paul Booth, the renowned owner of Last Rites, agreed to give Mr. McCurdy a chair while he was setting up his business. But when Mr. McCurdy was ready to go, he offered jobs to people on Mr. Booth\u2019s staff.In an interview last week, Mr. Booth accused Mr. McCurdy of being a sellout, a man who made \u201ctattooing dumb little things\u201d on celebrities a bigger priority than the art itself. \u201cYou can run for the money or you can run for the art,\u201d Mr. Booth said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could be much richer, but I lay down at night with my integrity intact.\u201d\u201cPlease,\u201d said Mr. Borew, sitting with his cousin. \u201cI was with Paul Booth when Nicolas Cage called him about doing a tattoo. Paul didn\u2019t even get to do it and he was so excited.\u201d The first Bang Bang, on Clinton Street, opened in 2013. Investment money came from Mr. Lacava. But according to Mr. McCurdy, the relationship between father and son deteriorated quickly. \u201cHe was supposed to be handling business matters \u2014 financial, insurance and everything entailing back of the house,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cIt was a disaster. For months, we didn\u2019t even have furniture.\u201d In a text message, Mr. Lacava said, \u201cAlthough Keith and I have different views about what happened with the shop, I wish him continued success.\u201d One day, employees strolled up to the store and found that someone had changed the locks and removed everything overnight. His shop gone and his marriage suffering, Mr. McCurdy moved onto an air mattress in Mr. Borew\u2019s apartment in Queens and spent several months tattooing clients including Selena Gomez at a small studio he rented in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He and his wife went into counseling with Karen Bridbord, a therapist and executive coach. Soon, Dr. Bridbord was advising Mr. McCurdy on how to restart his business. He found a new store (on Broome Street), borrowed money from friends and opened just as Instagram was taking off. Mr. McCurdy posted selfies with his famous clients and sent direct messages to talented artists around the globe, sponsoring some of their visas. He made hiring women a priority and was clear with his staff that tattoo-world misogyny would not be tolerated beneath his roof. \u201cMy daughter is 9,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a feminist button on her backpack and she doesn\u2019t really know what it means, but I want her to have the sense that she can do anything she wants with her life. Sixty-five percent of our customers are women. And we have employees and they have rights.\u201d Inevitably, there has been some #MeTattoo.The issue, JonBoy said in an interview, was \u201cthe perverted jokes I told, the way I behaved in the presence of females.\u201d After four months, Mr. McCurdy and Dr. Bridbord determined that JonBoy had to go. At least for a while. They provided him with the name of a therapist and told him to stay in touch. A year later, he was hired back, on the condition that he remain in treatment. \u201cI see someone every week, and it\u2019s been so helpful,\u201d he said. And the celebrities kept coming. One is Justin Bieber, who has spent more than $60,000 on Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services. He pays a premium to transport his tattooer between coasts and around the world. \u201cUsually it\u2019s a last-minute thing,\u201d Mr. Bieber said by phone last week, as Mr. McCurdy patched him into a call with me and chuckled in the background. \u201cThat makes it difficult on Bang, but he always goes out of his way to make me a priority and it\u2019s why I love him so much. I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in Panama. Can you come out?\u2019\u201d (For $10,000 he did. \u201cI\u2019ve got kids,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cTell me he\u2019s not awesome.\u201d) And sometimes discreet. Mr. McCurdy agreed to tattoo her current favorite food, bacon, only if she put it on the bottom of one of her feet. In retrospect, she thinks that was a fine decision. \u201cI might become a vegan,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are great people who can\u2019t afford to get tattooed by us,\u201d said Balazs Bercsenyi, the 29-year-old artist from Hungary who inked me.One night, a man delivering an Amazon package to the store asked if Kristi Walls worked there. \u201cShe used to be my tattooer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was when she cost less.\u201d But mostly, Mr. Bercsenyi and the other artists are enjoying the premium fees they command.With the SoHo store up and running, Mr. McCurdy is, inevitably, mulling other brand extensions. Later this year, he is introducing a line of tattoo aftercare products. He\u2019d also like to do a show for Netflix and open a Bang Bang in Los Angeles. \u201cWith a pool on the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York is so boring.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018A Different World\u2019 Survived the Downfall of Bill Cosby", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut \u201cA Different World,\u201d the popular \u201cCosby\u201d spinoff that ended its original run 25 years ago this week, doesn\u2019t seem to have inspired the same amount of hand-wringing as its predecessor.Some of the reasons for this continued affection are obvious. While Mr. Cosby\u2019s name appears in the credits for each episode, he only appeared on screen in three of them, all in Season 1. And after that season, which centered on Denise Huxtable\u2019s (Lisa Bonet) transition to university life at the fictional Hillman College, the series was completely revamped.The result of \u2014 and possibly a motivation for \u2014 this separating of art from artist allows the show to be a repository for the tender sentiments that have been displaced by the retroactive tarnishing of \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201d\u201cDo we have to cut off the contributions that the show itself made,\u201d she continued, \u201cand all the people that helped contribute to what that was? It\u2019s a tension that feels gross, but at the same time feels necessary.\u201dI agree. But such compartmentalization isn\u2019t always easy \u2014 even if the man himself is not the face of the show, its origins as a spinoff will always linger in plain sight. This becomes particularly noticeable when one considers how some of the subjects \u201cA Different World\u201d addressed, such as sexual assault, have dark resonance in its creator\u2019s private life.Perhaps the comfort of nostalgia cannot and should not ever be completely divorced from the realities of its roots, but the way some of us cope is by transferring all those warm memories onto one work and discarding the ugliest bits of the rest.It\u2019s a selfish compromise, to be sure, one that the women who have come forward with allegations against Mr. Cosby most likely can\u2019t even consider. But it is impossible to totally erase a history as influential as Mr. Cosby\u2019s, and as consumers we can choose how we engage with it ourselves. For me, at least, the choice is holding on tight to the one part that turned out to be the most progressive and ahead of its time \u2014 the part that least resembles its devious creator.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Sobering Documentaries on Netflix, Fandor and Field of Vision", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingMs. Sheldon\u2019s new film, \u201cRecovery Boys,\u201d which had its Netflix premiere in late June, steps away from the larger social impact of addiction and homes in on personal stories. It begins at a new rehab facility \u2014 Jacob\u2019s Ladder, in Aurora, W.Va. \u2014 in a house attached to a working farm where the men are undergoing treatment work. The film follows four patients over 18 months; the first we meet is Jeff, a young father of two who\u2019s just been released from prison, where he was serving a sentence for robbery. Jeff\u2019s a wiry fellow with a disarming smile, and of the four, he seems to throw himself into recovery with the most enthusiasm.We are then introduced to Rush, a ginger-bearded veteran of recovery programs who admits \u201cI\u2019ve never given it my all\u201d; Adam, who seems a babe in the woods; and Ryan, who comes in off the street, without even having detoxed. They are nurtured under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Blankenship, the founder of Jacob\u2019s Ladder. Hazards abound as the patients rack up day counts: A community barn dance that serves alcohol is approached with dread, and it\u2019s a nice comic note when the event turns out mostly populated by townspeople about three times the patients\u2019 age and not exactly hard-partying types.I\u2019ve been sober for almost a decade now, and I\u2019m obliged by tradition (and also by my own inclination) not to go into detail about my specific situation publicly; so I\u2019ll just say that I interact daily with addicts in recovery. As a result, I can\u2019t process a movie like \u201cRecovery Boys\u201d with the detachment that a person who can drink or use recreational drugs safely might be able to muster.The narrative Ms. Sheldon constructs invites the civilian viewer to speculate as to which of the four subjects has the best chance to \u201cmake it;\u201d I could not look at the story in that way. What the film powerfully demonstrates is that \u2014 and this is something that\u2019s hard to say without sounding glib, but it\u2019s just the way it is \u2014 you never can tell. The person seeking recovery who seems to come in with the best possible attitude versus the person who comes in looking beyond hopeless prods the viewer to make a distinction that is ultimately false.The beauty of the West Virginia landscapes captured by Ms. Sheldon\u2019s camera puts the struggles of the movie\u2019s subjects into melancholy relief. \u201cRecovery Boys\u201d depicts a tough battle, but one that is not necessarily Sisyphean.But the subjects in this picture, mainly the three women who documented their condition in self-made videos, are clearly suffering from something. Their stories, intercut in linear progression in this short feature, seem like descents into madness. One woman shaves her head on camera. Another, describing a solution that she thinks works, tells the camera \u201cYeah, drink your pee, it\u2019s awesome.\u201d One of them takes a thread that she says emerged from her lesions and puts it in extreme close-up under her camera, and narrates as the thread undulates, spelling out, according to her, a word. It\u2019s only at this point that the movie seems to overtly editorialize, with its electronic music score (by Brian McOmber) growing more low-key and menacing.Alternating with the data and archival footage are thumbnail sketches of a few National Rally supporters, including one resident of Fr\u00e9jus, a French port town whose National Rally leadership sued to block the opening of a mosque in 2015. (The suit failed.) In a surprise, one of these supporters is a person of color. The tidy film impresses a stark fact: This dance is just beginning.A previous version of this column incorrectly described a farm attached to Jacob\u2019s Ladder. It is a working farm, not a dairy farm. The column also misstated the given name of the founder of Jacob\u2019s Ladder. It is Kevin Blankenship, not Keith.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Easy. It\u2019s Impressive. It\u2019s Dinner.", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIntroducing our new biweekly column by Alison Roman, with effortless and delicious recipes you can make in less than an hour \u2014 like this bright, punchy sheet-pan trout.But it was her whole butterflied trout with garlicky bread crumbs that dazzled 12-year-old me the most. There she was, just casually whipping up whole fish on a Wednesday as if she were auditioning for \u201cIron Chef.\u201d To me, unfussy doesn\u2019t mean boring \u2014 it means approachable and accessible. It means getting dinner on the table with ingredients that are simultaneously inexpensive and interesting, treating them in a mix of new and familiar ways and doing it in less time than it takes to start a new series on Netflix. The recipes in this new column will follow suit, blurring the line between weeknight-friendly and weekend-worthy, because shouldn\u2019t a great dish be both?I think so, and this trout certainly is. There\u2019s the effortless, elegant presentation, combined with a dramatic proclamation: \u201cI cooked an entire fish for you! On a school night!\u201d But at its core, it\u2019s a simple sheet-pan dinner made with nine ingredients in under 30 minutes. There are also a few practical benefits from cooking trout in its butterflied form, rather than individual fillets. First, using the larger piece greatly reduces the risk of overcooking. Second, that larger piece buys you some time in the oven, which means you can throw something else on that sheet pan to cook alongside that trout. Thin, wispy stalks of broccolini are my personal favorite for the way their frilly ends get impossibly crisp, but other vegetables like boiled and crushed potatoes, stripped leaves of kale or halved cherry tomatoes, which will burst and get slightly saucy, are all excellent. Third, while there are the inevitable tiny bones, which you can easily maneuver around, there is no \u201ctableside filleting,\u201d a phrase that should never be said in one\u2019s own kitchen. (Remember: I am unfussy and want you to be, too.)

{"Headline": "Review: The Criminal Life in Mumbai in \u2018Sacred Games\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSacred Games\u201d doesn\u2019t feel generic, though. Energetic and entertaining, if not entirely satisfying (four of eight episodes were available for review), it toggles between stylized melodrama and loose-limbed satire \u2014 hewing, perhaps a little too closely, to the structure of Mr. Chandra\u2019s sprawling novel.The series begins with a bang, as Singh (Saif Ali Khan) is contacted by an anonymous caller who sits, Wizard-of-Oz-like, before a bank of computer monitors, distorting his voice and masking his location. The caller turns out to be Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a notorious Mumbai criminal who\u2019s been missing for years and thought dead.He teases Singh with the information that he knew his father, another honest cop (or so the son thinks), and warns him of a dire but unspecified event that will strike Mumbai in 25 days. That sets the clock ticking on the story\u2019s mystery plot, but it\u2019s really a hook to get Singh \u2014 and us \u2014 to listen to Gaitonde\u2019s story, an epic that combines his own rise as a gangster with a social and political history of India, and a critique of the country\u2019s religious, caste and economic divides.The contemporary scenes, meanwhile, go for low comedy and topical satire, as Singh (the rare Sikh cop on the Mumbai force) dodges his uniformly corrupt superiors. He has the help of an ambitious agent from the intelligence services (Radhika Apte, like Mr. Khan and Mr. Siddiqui an established Indian film star) and his own, much less ambitious sergeant Jitendra Joshi, whose abilities are far outpaced by his appetites. A subplot involving a theatrical agent who doubles as a pimp for victimized Bollywood actresses echoes several real-life Indian prostitution scandals.Originally developed for television with a pilot by the Hollywood-based Northern Irish writer Kerry Williamson (who\u2019s credited as a co-executive producer), \u201cSacred Games\u201d comes to the screen as an Indian production, directed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane and written by Varun Grover, Vasant Nath and Smita Singh. (It can be watched in its original Hindi, with or without subtitles, or with English, Spanish or Portuguese dubbing.)Replicating the constant juggle of styles and voices in \u201cSacred Games,\u201d a feat stretched out over more than 900 pages in Mr. Chandra\u2019s novel, is a major challenge on screen \u2014 despite its verve and visual inventiveness, the series feels muddled and a little wearying at times. (And a lot of cultural and historical references will go over the head of non-Indian viewers.) But as Gaitonde says, his story is like a scorpion \u2014 once it stings you, you\u2019re done for.Advertisement"}

Netflix released the teen rom-com on its streaming service with little fanfare in May, and it quickly swelled into a stealth sensation.\u201cFans found it, liked it, and decided to pass it on to other people,\u201d said Vince Marcello, the film\u2019s writer and director. \u201cYou can run commercials, you can do all the conventional stuff, but none of it is as powerful as people on their Twitter feeds saying, \u2018Oh my God, check this out, it gave me all the feels.\u2019\u201dNetflix specializes in the soft sell, expecting viewers to stumble across its original films while scrolling through menus of suggestions. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aggressively marketing the film,\u201d said Ian Bricke, the service\u2019s director of independent film. \u201cBut when people find a movie like this on Netflix, they feel like they\u2019ve discovered it for themselves, and there\u2019s a degree of ownership and investment that translates into word of mouth.\u201d\u201cIt was easier to share it with total strangers online than people I knew,\u201d Ms. Reekles, now 23, said in an email. \u201cI was \u2014 and still am \u2014 quite self-conscious about my writing.\u201dReaders responded with surprising ardor to the simple story: An awkward Los Angeles high schooler, Elle, falls for her lifelong best friend Lee\u2019s bad-boy older brother, Noah, after he\u2019s responsible for her first-ever kiss in the fairground attraction of the title. The twist: Elle and Lee adhere to a strict set of rules for their friendship, and one is that dating each other\u2019s relatives is verboten.\u201cWhen I first wrote the story, \u2018Twilight\u2019 had become popular and all of the young-adult stories I could find were paranormal romances,\u201d Ms. Reekles said. \u201cI just really wanted to read a regular high school romance, and when I couldn\u2019t find that, I wrote my own.\u201dAfter Mr. Marcello (who directed four films inspired by American Girl dolls) adapted the novel into a screenplay, Netflix became involved. \u201cWe liked the idea that it landed somewhere between an R-rated teen film and younger-skewing fare like Disney Channel movies,\u201d Mr. Bricke said. \u201cThe trend in teen movies has been towards edgier, raunchier fare, and it felt like there was a pocket that wasn\u2019t being spoken to.\u201dThat audience swooned for \u201cThe Kissing Booth,\u201d with many watching it multiple times. Netflix never releases the equivalent of ratings but it does report that of the viewers who have watched, one in three have seen it more than once, which is 30 percent higher than the normal rate.Joey King (\u201cRamona and Beezus\u201d), who plays Elle, said there\u2019s something addictive about the movie. \u201cYoung people on Instagram made these fan accounts and started hanging out with each other because they love and relate to it so much.\u201dThe movie has resonated with an older audience as well, Mr. Marcello said: \u201cThey\u2019re making comments like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I should be admitting this online, but I\u2019ve watched this movie six times, and I\u2019m 42 years old \u2014 oh, God, help me.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe John Hughes films and movies like \u201810 Things I Hate About You\u2019 were formative for me,\u201d Mr. Marcello said. \u201cHollywood hasn\u2019t been making those kinds of films in recent years, and that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re so hungry for them.\u201dThe movie\u2019s star shrugs it off. \u201cThe problem with critics, not to bash on them, is that when they\u2019re watching a movie, they\u2019re looking for very specific things,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cThey are forgetting what it\u2019s like to watch a movie and not have to think about how happy you feel. \u2018The Kissing Booth\u2019 just makes you feel good.\u201dMs. King\u2019s real-life romance with Jacob Elordi, the Australian unknown who plays Noah, has fueled fans\u2019 frenzy for the movie. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for people to know what they saw on screen was real,\u201d Ms. King acknowledged. Added Mr. Marcello, \u201cYou never plan for that, you don\u2019t expect it to happen, but they\u2019re so great together, and it shows in every scene.\u201dIf that happens, the writer might finally make her first-ever trip to Hollywood.

What can you do?\u201d As Lisa glanced at a picture of Apu, Marge Simpson said, \u201cSome things will be dealt with at a later date.\u201d Lisa added, \u201cIf at all.\u201d)Mr. Groening, who will appear at Comic-Con this week to promote his new Netflix animated series, \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d spoke recently to The New York Times for a coming feature about that show. When the discussion turned to Apu, he shared his feelings about the character and explained why the criticism caught him off guard. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.The attempt by \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to at least acknowledge the controversy around Apu seems to have only made viewers more upset. How did you feel about that?Well, I love Apu. I love the character, and it makes me feel bad that it makes other people feel bad. But on the other hand, it\u2019s tainted now \u2014 the conversation, there\u2019s no nuance to the conversation now. It seems very, very clunky. I love the character. I love the show.How will you handle the character going forward?Does that mean a moratorium on further appearances by Apu for the time being?What did you mean when you said \u201cpeople love to pretend they\u2019re offended\u201d? That wasn\u2019t specifically about Apu. That was about our culture in general. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed for the last 25 years. There is the outrage of the week and it comes and goes. For a while, it was, believe it or not, kids were stealing quarters out of their mothers\u2019 purses in order to go to the video arcade, and that was going to bring down civilization. No one even remembers that, because that lasted a week. I think particularly right now, people feel so aggrieved and crazed and powerless that they\u2019re picking the wrong battles.Do you believe the people who have raised questions about the depiction of Apu are sincere in their beliefs?Sure, and my guess is I agree, politically, with 99 percent of the things that Hari Kondabolu believes. We just disagree on Apu. I love the character and I would hate for him to go away. I am sorry that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d would be criticized for having an Indian character that, because of our extraordinary popularity \u2014 I expected other people to do it. I go, maybe he\u2019s a problem, but who\u2019s better? Who\u2019s a better Indian animated character in the last 30 years? I\u2019ve been to India twice and talked about \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in front of audiences. That\u2019s why this took me by surprise. I know Indians are not the same as Indian-Americans.Is this a problem that is unique to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and its longevity, that it has lasted long enough to span multiple eras of cultural thought and taste?But there is a thoughtfulness at the core of the show. The fact that the Simpsons are yellow and not the color that passes for Caucasian in cartoons, that Mickey Mouse pink, that\u2019s intentional. It\u2019s taking that pink away, and making it yellow. And then taking yellow away from whatever racist connotation that that has had. And that was intentional. As many people have pointed out, it\u2019s all stereotypes on our show. That\u2019s the nature of cartooning. And you try not to do reprehensible stereotypes. Anyway. I probably said too much.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Comedy-Destroying, Soul-Affirming Art of Hannah Gadsby", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "Creating the furious stand-up special \u201cNanette\u201d was an act of self-preservation for the Australian star. The result has been a sensation \u201cbeyond my comprehension.\u201dSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Perhaps you\u2019ve heard: Hannah Gadsby is angry, and she is amazing.Ms. Gadsby, an Australian comedian, is the creator of \u201cNanette,\u201d a stage show turned Netflix special that is lacerating in its fury about how women and queer people like her, and anyone else who might behave or look \u201cother,\u201d get treated, dismissed and silenced. She is unflinching about the abuse that they \u2014 that she \u2014 endured, and the cultural norms that enabled it. She calls out men, powerful and otherwise.\u201cI have built a career out of self-deprecating humor, and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore,\u201d she says in the special. \u201cBecause do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility. It\u2019s humiliation.\u201d\u201cOver 250 times I did that show, and it took a toll,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to spend the next year mostly napping.\u201d (She will perform it one last time, at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal on July 27.)Ms. Gadsby came by her insecurities honestly. Growing up in small-town Tasmania, she was a blue-ribbon golfer, state champion twice over, she said. She started playing as a kid at the little country club where her mother worked as a cleaner, and where women then were not permitted to be full-fledged members, Ms. Gadsby said. They could tee off only at times that wouldn\u2019t interfere with the men\u2019s games. Sometimes they had to stop and serve the male members tea.Even in competition, she was made to understand a woman\u2019s place. When her brother won a tournament, she noticed, he was awarded golf equipment, things that encouraged him to keep at the game. \u201cI would win casserole dishes and vases,\u201d she said. \u201cI was basically winning stuff for my dowry.\u201dMs. Gadsby long ago stopped playing golf, but those experiences shaped her worldview, especially as she watched how her feisty mother was denigrated at work, \u201calways told she\u2019s being a mouthy, stupid woman.\u201dConfrontation seemed exhausting. Instead, \u201cI learned how to disappear,\u201d Ms. Gadsby said. \u201cI was invisible. I learned very early on. Well into my adult life, I was easily forgotten in a room, which meant I heard \u2014 I hear a lot.\u201dShe is still soft-spoken, not the kind to immediately own the space. (A brief stint leading museum tours ended because her charges just wandered off. \u201cI\u2019m not a natural leader,\u201d she said.) Sitting at the table, when she waded into a topic she didn\u2019t expect to cover, she seemed a little bashful. But when she knew she had a good joke coming, she prefaced it with a small, sideways smile: Her mind was a half-step ahead of yours. She didn\u2019t want to mention autism in \u201cNanette,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I want to do is sort of go, do you know what? There\u2019s value in the differently thinking.\u201dMs. Gadsby studied art history and curatorship at Australian National University in Canberra. She worked at a bookshop and at an outdoor cinema as a projectionist, then became an itinerant farmhand. She was adrift.In her late 20s, on a whim, she entered an open mic competition sponsored by the Melbourne Comedy Festival. It was a weird decision, but she was making a lot of those back then. She was also technically homeless at the time, she said.She knew she was funny. \u201cIt\u2019s how I participated in life without participating,\u201d she said. Her first time at the mic, she did a surreal bit about freezing her dead dog. (\u201cI\u2019ve always been very uplifting.\u201d)She made it to the state finals, and felt preternaturally comfortable onstage. \u201cI\u2019m frightened of smaller interactions, but I could talk to a large room almost immediately, which is, you know, a backward wiring,\u201d she said.Ms. Gadsby\u2019s family knew some of the trauma she had been through, but when they came to see \u201cNanette\u201d early on, she modified it because, she said, it was \u201cunfair to subject them to that kind of sucker punch in a roomful of strangers.\u201d(Spoilers ahead.) The show is built around her story of one assault at a bus stop, which she tells in detail \u2014 first for laughs, and then, near the end of the set, with galvanizing horror and rage. Ms. Gadsby also mentions other serious, predatory violations in her childhood and young adulthood, without spelling much out; she did not feel ready, she said, \u201cbecause I knew those people.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want people playing detectives in my world,\u201d she added, trying to find the perpetrators. \u201cThat\u2019s like trauma porn \u2014 like, let\u2019s go back and solve the crime! And I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s helpful at all, because that still keeps things centered on the trauma.\u201d Better to move forward, and try to change toxic and predatory male culture.As she relived these atrocious experiences onstage, over and over again, Ms. Gadsby built up a kind of callus. Then her mother, Kay Gadsby, happened to be in the audience, at the Sydney Opera House, when the show was taped for Netflix. Ms. Gadsby couldn\u2019t change the material to protect her that night.Her sister and a brother were also in the crowd, but it was her mother\u2019s shock of white hair she could see from the stage. The performance was raw before, but \u201chaving Mum in the audience, it was no skin,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see that in the film.\u201d She nearly broke down before the cameras.\u201cBut then,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cI see storytelling like Hannah\u2019s, where she rages about the homophobia in the world, and I cry and I realize that I grew up with so much shame.\u201d\u201cNanette,\u201d he added, \u201cmade me question if I could have made more space for people that are different, as well as empowering me to stop people from taking space away from me because I\u2019m different. I feel like it\u2019s permanently changed my point of view.\u201dOne of the most ingenious aspects is how, as Ms. Gadsby works toward the most painful and shocking material, she lobs occasional straightforward jokes at viewers \u2014 her grandmother told her that Mr. Right could be just around the corner; \u201cI have been approaching every corner with caution since then,\u201d she quips \u2014 making them into her unlikely partner in dismantling the allure of comedy altogether.In \u201cNanette,\u201d Ms. Gadsby explains that while a story has three parts \u2014 beginning, middle and end \u2014 a joke only has two, setup and punch line. There is, therefore, no satisfying conclusion to a joke, she says, the audience\u2019s laughter notwithstanding.But some comedy purists have taken issue with the idea that \u201cNanette\u201d is stand-up at all, though it\u2019s billed that way online. Not enough jokes, they say. Mr. Birbiglia, who also made his name with solo stage shows that delved into personal issues, said the show was part of a larger movement in comedy \u2014 reflected in the work of Ms. Notaro and others \u2014 to reach higher. \u201cIt just makes you think, let\u2019s go one step deeper. That\u2019s what it did for me and a lot of comedians,\u201d he said.Ms. Gadsby vociferously pushed back at her critics. \u201cI\u2019LL SETTLE THIS,\u201d she shouted on Twitter. \u201cMy show is NOT stand up comedy\u201d because that\u2019s an art form designed by men for men.As a student of art history, she looked to multidisciplinary figures like Louise Bourgeois for inspiration. A few years ago, Ms. Gadsby made a comedic video series doing close reads of artworks.In the show, she excoriates Bill Cosby, convicted of sexual assault, and Harvey Weinstein, who is accused of it. Sitting at the dining table, we talked about Louis C.K., whose comedy she didn\u2019t particularly care for even before he admitted to masturbating in front of colleagues. The success of \u201cNanette,\u201d she said, proved to her there was \u201ca huge thirst for other voices.\u201dMs. Gadsby began writing \u201cNanette\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s named for a barista she had been observing \u2014 in mid-2016. The debate over a same-sex marriage bill, which Australian lawmakers passed in 2017, unearthed her own internalized homophobia, she said. As she unraveled that in herself, she wondered if she could forge a new connection with an audience by making a show about it. She worried that it would need a trigger warning, but decided that\u2019s what the show was partly about: the inability to have these kind of cultural conversations.Was there also ambition, I asked her, and confidence in the comedy skills she\u2019d honed over a decade that made her take the leap to such a difficult message? \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to admit that it came from somewhere a little bit more bitter,\u201d she said. Her career had plateaued, she felt, and as she watched mediocre men climb the entertainment ladder, she got angry: \u201cI do what they do, and probably better, and from a harder point.\u201dShe resolved to tear comedy down \u2014 she used a different, bodily term \u2014 \u201cand leave.\u201dBesides writing a book based on \u201cNanette,\u201d Ms. Gadsby doesn\u2019t know what she will do next. She\u2019s not eager to get back onstage again. I asked if she was still angry. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cMy life shouldn\u2019t have been as hard as it was.\u201d But the low self-esteem that plagued her, that she broke down nightly, has been boosted a bit by the glow of \u201cNanette.\u201d That\u2019s not to say she thinks anyone who\u2019s suffered, survived in silence, should go perform what happened to them.\u201cPart of what undoes shame is to be heard, to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cI did that on a grand scale. I don\u2019t want people to look at me and go, see, queer people, this is how it\u2019s done. It\u2019s like, no, this is how it shouldn\u2019t have to be done.\u201cBut it\u2019s important that we start to think about ways that we can hold these stories, or provide a framework for people to not hold all this burden.\u201dShe mentioned Louis C.K. again, and the possibility that he might mount a comeback. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth just to see, if he does have an audience.\u201dThere were 18 seconds left on my interview tape: I didn\u2019t expect it to take a turn. Ms. Gadsby, of course, had other ideas. \u201cIf he does have an audience, then I won\u2019t be quitting stand-up,\u201d Ms. Gadsby said, and laughed. \u201cQuote me on that: If Louis C.K. finds his audience, I will definitely not quit stand-up. Because my work here is not done.\u201d\u201cSay that I said it with a cheeky smile,\u201d she added, and left the table.An earlier version of this article misstated whom Hannah Gadsby\u2019s show, \u201cNanette,\u201d is named after. The title refers to a barista the comedian had been observing; it is not a reference to an ex-girlfriend.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stream These 10 Emmy Nominees You May Not Have Seen", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere has always been a disparity between critical acclaim and viewership numbers for this consistently excellent series from Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg about Soviet spies in suburbia, but latecomers can be assured that the ending will pay off their investment. The sixth and final season unspools as a nuclear deal between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan brings an end to the Cold War that the central couple, Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, have been fighting so faithfully and catastrophically. The growing divisions within the K.G.B. are manifested in their marriage, which faces its stiffest test as forces gather to upend their cover as a normal American family.Scratch the surface of any do-it-yourself TV cooking and craft show and there\u2019s a whiff of existential despair, a natural byproduct of the relentlessly cheery attitude of hosts who create dishes and tchotchkes for guests that never arrive. \u201cAt Home With Amy Sedaris\u201d evokes that feeling through spectacularly deranged comedy: Although Sedaris\u2019s down-the-dial Martha Stewart labors under a sign that reads \u201cBeing Alone Is A-OK,\u201d she craves company so much, she lets a murderer (Michael Shannon) into the house in the Agatha Christie-themed season finale. Paul Giamatti, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Dratch, Chris Elliott and Michael Stipe are among the many friends who pop in for cameos, but it\u2019s Sedaris, in multiple roles, whose manic brilliance sets the tone.The premise for this black comedy from Bill Hader and Alec Berg makes it sound frivolous and disposable, like a TV version of \u201cGrosse Pointe Blank,\u201d following a contract killer who mingles with ordinary people during off hours. But while \u201cBarry\u201d gets plenty of laughs from Hader\u2019s former-Marine-turned-hit man wandering into the Los Angeles theater scene \u2014 particularly Henry Winkler\u2019s standout performance as a vain yet lovable acting teacher \u2014 the series\u2019 inaugural season grew darker and more emotionally rich as it progressed. Suddenly, a show about a killer\u2019s whimsical side project morphed into a tragicomedy about the torments of a man who can\u2019t transcend or escape the life he\u2019s chosen.The second season of this frank comedy by Pamela Adlon was wrapping up just as news broke that her co-creator and frequent writer, Louis C.K., had been involved in sexual misconduct. Yet the show makes it easy to imagine Adlon\u2019s character, a divorced actress struggling to raise three daughters on her own, persevering through such a terrible setback and continuing to do the best she can. Season 2 of \u201cBetter Things\u201d opens with Adlon\u2019s Sam Fox deftly peeling her 16-year-old away from a suitor 20 years her senior and reaches a touching apotheosis with \u201cEulogy,\u201d in which Sam asks her loved ones to eulogize her while she\u2019s still alive. As ever, she\u2019s bruised but unbowed.Back when he was one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after genre specialists, the creator of \u201cGodless,\u201d Scott Frank (\u201cDead Again,\u201d \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and \u201cMinority Report\u201d), conceived the show as a feature film. But he could never raise the money from a studio system in which the Western had fallen out of favor. By expanding it for a seven-episode Netflix series, Frank takes \u201cGodless\u201d in several directions at once, lifting from sources as diverse as Howard Hawks\u2019s classic jailhouse shoot \u2019em up, \u201cRio Bravo,\u201d and the pitiless Judge Holden character from Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d The compelling hook at its core, however, is a besieged town run by the widows of men who lost their lives in a mining accident. Do they even need men? Or rather, will they have a choice?What happens to a show after it essentially blows up its entire premise? That was the question that lingered between the first and second seasons of this much-loved, ratings-deficient afterlife comedy from NBC, which had to pivot from a twist that made its title ironic. Creator Michael Schur (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d) surely has a grand plan in mind, but the second season felt improvised in the best possible sense, shuttling Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) and her fellow Good Place residents through multiple fake utopias and celestial bureaucracies, all under the eye of Ted Danson\u2019s cackling architect. But for as much as \u201cThe Good Place\u201d had to change, the show still clung to its optimistic theme about the capacity for self-improvement and how it might be rewarded down the line.After writing and starring in the caustic black comedy \u201cFleabag,\u201d creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge turned to Luke Jennings\u2019s novella series \u201cCodename Villanelle\u201d for her follow-up, a cat-and-mouse thriller that has the same tart, irreverent edge of her previous work. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is a psychopathic assassin, barely contained by the shadowy organization that employs her, and Eve (Sandra Oh) is an MI5 analyst who leaves her post and risks losing everything in an obsessive quest to track her down. As the first season unfolds, Villanelle and Eve start to develop an odd intimacy, as if the efforts to monitor the other inadvertently resulted in a dangerous and unsavory tango. Their relationship nudges \u201cKilling Eve\u201d far-off its expected course and lands the show in fascinating new terrain.The creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) is one of a small handful of television writers whose voice is instantly recognizable \u2014 fast and quippy, with a gift for stylized dialogue that recalls Old Hollywood screwball comedies. With \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d Sherman-Palladino has finally found a period that fully accommodates her sensibility, giving her the opportunity to tell a personal story about a Jewish comedian asserting herself in a male-dominated field. In the impeccably realized world of 1958 New York City, \u201cMidge\u201d Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) plays the role of dutiful housewife until her husband leaves her and she reinvents herself as a stand-up comedian at a Greenwich Village comedy club. Sherman-Palladino spins Midge\u2019s domestic crises into uproarious stage material and keeps the laughs coming as Midge\u2019s life is turned upside down.Based on a series of novels by Edward St Aubyn, \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d sounds like an insufferable dirge, following an upper-class addict as he reels from the death of his abusive father in the 1980s. But although the show does marinate in grief, privilege, self-pity and escalating drug and alcohol consumption, it is also mordantly funny and unexpectedly heartbreaking, grounded by a tour de force performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role. The voiceover narration grants direct access into Patrick\u2019s addled thought processes, but it\u2019s Cumberbatch\u2019s fits of arrogance and despair that hold the series aloft, making it possible to think well of a hero who treats others nearly as shabbily as he treats himself.Amid the current mini-boom of true-crime documentary series, \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d stands out for the complicated questions it raises about spiritual questing, immigration rights and the true beneficiaries of religious freedom in America. The directors Maclain and Chapman Way unearth the forgotten story of the provocative Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his efforts to relocate his followers to a barren ranch in Wasco County, Ore. The Rajneeshees seem like a dangerous cult, as evidenced by its leader\u2019s fleet of Rolls Royces and growing weapons cache, but \u201cWild Wild Country\u201d approaches this story with an even-handedness that doesn\u2019t make them so easy to dismiss. The doc also has an endlessly fascinating anchor in Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh\u2019s former secretary, who led the commune with intimidation and devotion behind the scenes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Castle Rock\u2019 Season 1, Episodes 1-3:", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCastle RockEarly in the second episode of Hulu\u2019s new horror series \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d a dead man tells us a little bit about his Maine hometown. \u201cPeople think we\u2019re just one of those dead towns,\u201d says Dale Lacy, the former warden at the nearby Shawshank State Penitentiary. But there\u2019s more to this town than meets the eye. For starters, there\u2019s Dale\u2019s own death \u2014 a particularly creative suicide that we\u2019ve already seen in Episode 1. Other stories may ring a bell: \u201cRemember the dog?\u201d Lacy continues in a whispery voice-over. \u201cThe strangler? That boy\u2019s body out by the train tracks?\u201dWhen Hulu announced last year that it was partnering with the author Stephen King, the producer J.J. Abrams and the TV writers Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason (those last two best-known for the excellent WGN drama \u201cManhattan\u201d), King\u2019s fans were led to expect that \u201cCastle Rock\u201d would be a lot like the town Lacy describes: populated with characters and nightmares drawn directly from King novels like \u201cCujo\u201d and \u201cThe Dead Zone\u201d and from novellas like \u201cThe Body\u201d and \u201cRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.\u201dBut the show is actually doing something different. \u201cCastle Rock\u201d does nod at King\u2019s past creations, but the story thus far is more about the deeper malaise affecting one messed-up town.Or at least that\u2019s the case three episodes in. Per Hulu\u2019s custom, the remaining episodes of this first 10-episode season will be released in weekly installments, so who knows? (The first three dropped on Wednesday morning.) The season could take some unexpected turns in the months ahead and become a beat-for-beat adaptation of \u201cNeedful Things.\u201d That seems unlikely judging by the first three episodes; it appears instead that the series is aiming to be more like an original Stephen King novel, not a mere pastiche.\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is also very much following the modern model of prestige television \u2026 sometimes to its detriment.The first episode, titled \u201cSeverance,\u201d introduces Warden Lacy (played by Terry O\u2019Quinn), who just minutes after his first appearance ties a rope to a tree, puts the other end around his neck and then drives his car over a cliff, snapping his head off. As the town tries to figure out why he killed himself (and where his head went, both literally and figuratively), an investigation at Shawshank uncovers an unused wing of the prison containing a feral human who has clearly been detained there against his will, off the books. When asked his name, the prisoner whom everyone calls the Kid (Bill Skarsgard) says, \u201cHenry Deaver.\u201dHenry Deaver, it turns out, is infamous in Castle Rock for a mysterious incident back in 1991, when he disappeared into the woods for 11 days, not long after his adoptive father sustained a serious accident. But the Kid can\u2019t be him, because the real Henry eventually came back, and grew up to be a defense lawyer, specializing in death penalty cases. Also, the Kid is white, and Henry Deaver is black.Andr\u00e9 Holland, so good in the TV series \u201cThe Knick\u201d and the movie \u201cMoonlight,\u201d plays the actual Henry Deaver. He\u2019s a champion of hopeless causes \u2014 we first meet him in a courtroom, desperately trying, and failing, to convince a jury not to execute and cremate his client. (\u201cHow much doubt are you comfortable with?\u201d he asks, in what could end up being this show\u2019s slogan.) After getting an anonymous tip from inside Shawshank about the mystery prisoner, he returns to Castle Rock, where his mentally decaying adoptive mother Ruth (Sissy Spacek) is living with a retired lawman named Alan Pangborn (Scott Glenn).Even casual Stephen King fans should get the significance of Spacek\u2019s casting. In 1976 she starred in \u201cCarrie,\u201d the movie version of his first novel. More devoted readers, meanwhile, will already know Sheriff Pangborn: He\u2019s a major character in two of King\u2019s Castle Rock-set novels, and he pops up in a few other stories. For the first three episodes, these two don\u2019t do much. They fill out the background of a story mostly about Henry and a few other important supporting players.One person Henry quickly gets to know is Dennis Zalewski (Noel Fisher), a conscientious Shawshank guard, who feeds the lawyer intelligence from inside the institution \u2014 and serves as the audience\u2019s eyes and ears at the prison as odd phenomena continue to accumulate, all revolving around the Kid. Henry also meets Jackie Torrance (Jane Levy), a cynical young woman fascinated by Castle Rock\u2019s unfortunate history, who tells Henry that when she was a girl, \u201cKids used to dress up like you for Halloween.\u201dThe most significant other character in \u201cCastle Rock\u201d \u2014 almost a second lead \u2014 is Molly Strand (Melanie Lynskey), a cash-poor real estate agent and emotionally tormented psychic, who takes drugs to manage the voices she hears in her head. Molly grew up across the street from the Deavers, and she is obsessed with Henry in ways that make her already chaotic life more unstable.How much are their pasts intertwined? During one of the flashbacks to Molly\u2019s teen years, we see what could either be a memory or a dream of her breaking into the Deavers\u2019 house after Henry\u2019s dad\u2019s accident and then unhooking his life support, possibly causing his death.The most memorable scenes in the second episode, \u201cHabeas Corpus,\u201d involve its occasional narrator, Dale Lacy. At the start, he tells a shocking story about the time his brother dressed in the high school mascot\u2019s costume and leapt from the school roof to his death. Throughout the hour, as people dig through what Dale left behind, they keep finding evidence that he imprisoned the Kid because he believed he had been instructed by God to protect Castle Rock from evil.What evil? The show\u2019s writers don\u2019t offer much of an answer \u2026 yet. In keeping with the kind of storytelling preferred by J.J. Abrams (one of the creators of \u201cLost\u201d), \u201cCastle Rock\u201d is big on teasing spooky mysteries and potential conspiracies, which its writers will likely keep in the shadows for as long as possible in order to keep viewers hooked. The first two episodes push this \u201cinsinuate, don\u2019t reveal\u201d approach too far, however, to the extent that little of consequence happens. As with some many other expensive TV dramas \u2014 Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d comes to mind \u2014 they trade less in action than in quiet conversations, with lots of pregnant pauses. Frankly, they\u2019re a little dry.The third episode, though, is incredibly entertaining. Titled \u201cLocal Color,\u201d it is bizarre and intense, with gasp-worthy twists, funny dialogue and strong performances. (At one point, one of Molly\u2019s regular drug dealers asks how many Minions she killed for her garish yellow jacket, and she peevishly yelps, \u201cSix!\u201d Lynskey\u2019s crack comic timing takes an already funny insult and makes the moment snappier.)Most of \u201cLocal Color\u201d follows Molly as she prepares for an appearance on a popular local television show, where she plans to promote Castle Rock as a town ripe for investors. But with her psychic powers suddenly surging now that Henry is back in town, Molly first needs to score some pills to calm herself. On the prowl for dope, she ends up stumbling into some strange tribunal, run by masked children who claim to have parents incarcerated at Shawshank.This cultish children\u2019s gathering is genuinely disturbing. Worse for Molly, the youngsters inadvertently keep her from getting high, which means she has a disastrous TV interview. Her segment is cut short when she begins psychically channeling the nearby Henry, spilling what he knows about the Kid and the cover-up at Shawshank.The weaker first two \u201cCastle Rock\u201d episodes are perfectly watchable, thanks in large part to Holland and Lynskey\u2019s superb acting. But \u201cLocal Color\u201d is where Shaw, Thomason and the rest of the creative team demonstrate how well they \u201cget\u201d King. Given the success of the movie \u201cIt\u201d and the King-inspired Netflix series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d it is easy to think of his books as a colorful parade of killer clowns and Lovecraftian beasties. But the inexplicable cabal that Molly wanders into, and the embarrassing experience she has in front of the camera are the kind of moments that fill out King\u2019s stories, providing eerie resonance and points of emotional connection.At one point, Dale casually mentions Castle Rock\u2019s infamous killer dog. But King fans know that the novel \u201cCujo\u201d isn\u2019t just about an infected animal tormenting a mother and her child. It\u2019s also about broken marriages, economic uncertainty, and subtle class conflicts in rural Maine. If \u201cCastle Rock\u201d can keep getting that part of King\u2019s work right, it\u2019ll offer plenty of horror, even if we never see another monster.The Castle Rock Call:\u2022 This is where each week I\u2019ll note some of the minor subplots, intriguing clues, cultural references, and Stephen King Easter eggs. One of those Easter eggs gives this section its name: The local newspaper, \u201cThe Castle Rock Call,\u201d seen briefly in these episodes, first appeared in the 1994 King short story \u201cThe Man in the Black Suit.\u201d\u2022 Speaking of King ephemera and \u201cCujo,\u201d was that the \u201cCereal Professor,\u201d seen in the TV commercial in the background during one of the flashbacks?\u2022 This particular motif could be a subtle King reference or pure happenstance: In two of these three episodes, different characters are listening to baseball on the radio. That\u2019s a recurring detail in King\u2019s stories, often indicative of both the lazy rhythms of a small-town summer and the everyday magic of voices floating through the airwaves.\u2022 It\u2019s surely no coincidence that Jackie Torrance shares a last name (and part of a first) with Jack Torrance, the writer who went mad in the Overlook Hotel in \u201cThe Shining.\u201d The Torrance family reappears in King\u2019s work, but there has never been a \u201cJackie\u201d before.\u2022 In flashbacks, we see that Molly had alt-rock posters all over her wall when she was a teenager in the early \u201990s. One way this show\u2019s creators are earning my trust? Her decorations are region- and era-appropriate. I spotted a flyer for the TAANG! Records stalwarts the Lyres, who were big in nearby Boston back then.Advertisement"}

My MacBook Pro and iPhone X are essentials, as are a Bluetooth keyboard (which I hook up to my phone to write articles when I don\u2019t have my computer), a 2TB hard drive, and a USB-C dongle with multiple USB ports and an SD card reader.You shoot lots of photo and videos to document your travels.

You forward emails to the app, and it organizes the information into legs of travel. The app even helps you check into your flights.As for planning, I work with a researcher at The Times, and we communicate over Google Docs. But I\u2019ve found there isn\u2019t a single tech substitute out there for reading articles or random blogs, or doing a web search on \u201cwhere to eat in X,\u201d or asking locals where they like to go.Before I get to a city, I like to take all the recommendations I have and enter them into Google Maps. That way I can strategize my must-sees, but also know where to eat once I finish with that museum.It\u2019s a tossup between Maps and Evernote for which app I use most. Paper clutter is my constant enemy.

Instead, I\u2019m having a lot of fun shopping locally.Podcasts, too, were a big part of my New York City life. But on the road, I\u2019m less willing to take the safety risk of putting in earbuds on public transit. And I don\u2019t want to.

{"Headline": "What if the Government Gave Everyone a Paycheck?", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionAdvancing technologies aren\u2019t the only cause of this predicament, but notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claim to the contrary, technology is a bigger culprit than trade. The economy keeps growing yet most economic gains are going to a few \u2014 largely financiers and, increasingly, inventors and owners of the digitized devices that are replacing good jobs. Our economic system isn\u2019t designed for this. If the trend continues, it\u2019s unclear who will even earn enough to buy all the future robots.Economic change on this scale doesn\u2019t happen without something cracking. The shift from farm to factory featured decades of bloody labor conflict; the move from factory to office and other sedentary jobs caused more upheaval. What will happen when robots push most people out of steady work and into lower-wage gig jobs? I doubt we\u2019ll see a revolution. A more likely scenario is a slow slouch toward authoritarianism and xenophobia. We may already be there.What\u2019s the answer? Here in the Bay Area where I live, where inventors and engineers are busily digitizing everything, many civic and business leaders are touting something called a universal basic income, or U.B.I. It\u2019s universal in the sense that everyone would receive it, basic in that it would be just enough to live on and cash income rather than voucher-based, like food stamps or Section 8 housing. To the rest of America, a U.B.I. may seem like a pipe dream, but from my vantage point some form of it seems inevitable.U.B.I.\u2019s critics understandably worry that it would spur millions to drop out of the labor force, induce laziness or at least rob people of the structure and meaning work provides. Both Yang and Lowrey muster substantial research to rebut these claims. I\u2019m not sure they need it. After all, $12,000 a year doesn\u2019t deliver a comfortable life even in the lowest-cost precincts of America, so there would still be plenty of incentive to work. Most of today\u2019s jobs provide very little by way of fulfillment or creativity anyway.A U.B.I. might give recipients a bit more time to pursue socially beneficial activities, like helping the elderly or attending to kids with special needs or perhaps even starting a new business. Yang suggests it would spur a system of \u201csocial credits\u201d in which people trade their spare time by performing various helpful tasks for one another. (I.R.S. be warned.) Surely a U.B.I. would help compensate many people \u2014 especially women \u2014 for the unpaid labor they already contribute. As Lowrey points out, some 40 million family caregivers in America provide half a trillion dollars of unpaid adult care annually. Child care has become so expensive that one of every three stay-at-home mothers today lives below the poverty line (compared with 14 percent in 1970).But how could America possibly afford a U.B.I.? A $1,000-a-month grant to every American would cost about $3.9 trillion a year. That\u2019s about $1.3 trillion on top of existing welfare programs \u2014 roughly the equivalent of the entire federal budget, or about a fifth of the entire United States economy. Both Yang and Lowrey come up with laundry lists of potential funding sources \u2014 from soaking the rich (raising the top tax bracket to 55 percent, enlarging the estate tax and implementing new taxes on wealth, financial transactions and perhaps even the owners of the robots and related devices that are displacing jobs), to instituting a carbon tax or a value-added tax.Whatever the source of funds, it seems a safe bet that increased automation will allow the economy to continue to grow, making a U.B.I. more affordable. A U.B.I. would itself generate more consumer spending, stimulating additional economic activity. And less poverty would mean less crime, incarceration and other social costs associated with deprivation. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really expensive?\u201d Yang asks. \u201cDysfunction. Revolution.\u201dIf these measures still aren\u2019t enough to foot the bill, Lowrey suggests making a U.B.I. less universal by taxing away U.B.I. payments to high-income earners and reducing other forms of social insurance (for example, eliminating food stamps and welfare programs). As a last resort, she writes, a U.B.I. could be implemented as a kind of negative income tax, by which government simply ensures that every person or household has a certain minimum yearly income. This is what Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman had in mind. Lowrey figures that the cost of such a guarantee would approximate the current total costs of the earned-income tax credit, supplemental security income, housing assistance, food stamps and school lunches. She notes that the simplest way to achieve this would be to transform existing antipoverty programs into unconditional cash transfers.But there\u2019s a logical flaw in her argument. Once a U.B.I. is no longer universal or even basic (what if the poor are worse off when other forms of assistance are stripped away?), it\u2019s hard to see the point of having it in the first place. More troubling is Lowrey\u2019s blurring of the distinction between a U.B.I. that redistributes resources from the superrich to the growing number of vulnerable lower-income Americans and one that merely turns programs for the poor into cash assistance. The latter may be warranted, but it wouldn\u2019t touch America\u2019s growing scourge of inequality and economic insecurity, which will be made worse as robots take over good jobs.A core challenge in the future will be how to redistribute money from the ever richer owners of the robots and related technologies to the rest of us, who are otherwise likely to become poorer and less secure. This is not just an economic challenge but also a political one. As we know from recent history, vast fortunes translate directly into political power, and such power effectively resists redistribution. Sadly, neither of these authors discusses how to deal with this paradox.A world inhabited only by robots, their billionaire owners and a large and increasingly restive population is the plotline for countless dystopian fantasies, but it\u2019s a reality that appears to be drawing closer. If we continue on the path we\u2019re on, we will need to make fundamental choices about how to support human livelihoods and ensure equal participation in our economy and society. Most basically, we will have to confront the realities of vastly unequal economic and political power. Even if we manage to enact a U.B.I., it will not be nearly enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney and Fox Shareholders Approve Deal, Ending Corporate Duel", "Date": "2018-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne empire grows. Another shrinks.In separate ballrooms at the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan on Friday morning, shareholders of the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox agreed to a $71.3 billion purchase plan that gives Disney the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, substantially altering the entertainment landscape.Regulators in more than a dozen countries must still give their approval. But the shareholder votes brought to a close a six-month corporate showdown, waged across two continents by Disney and Comcast, for supremacy in the rapidly changing media business. Mr. Murdoch\u2019s trove represented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gain the bulk needed as a counterattack against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into Hollywood.\u201cAvatar,\u201d the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies, \u201cTitanic\u201d and TV shows such as \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cThis Is Us\u201d will now be owned by Disney. That adds to an already enviable content stockpile from divisions that include Lucasfilm, Marvel Entertainment and Pixar Animation Studios. The deal also gives Disney the cable networks FX and National Geographic; a controlling stake in the streaming service Hulu, which has more than 20 million subscribers; and Star, one of India\u2019s fastest growing media companies.Some people in Hollywood see the acquisition as the sad ending of an era. Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online, and this move could set off a wave of mergers in the film business, which has not seen significant consolidation since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox.A smaller number of companies control of a greater portion of TV shows and films, potentially altering where \u2014 and how \u2014 we see our favorite series, movies or actors.\u201cOne of the most exciting aspects of our Fox acquisition is that it will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the deal in December. \u201cWe believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it\u2019s our highest priority.\u201d\u201cEveryone has decided that the future is owning both the content and the distribution,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a longtime media analyst.At the Disney meeting, shareholders voted on one item. Disney\u2019s final offer was made up of equal parts cash and stock \u2014 $35.7 billion in cash, 343 million shares \u2014 and Disney investors had to approve the issuing of those shares. The meeting lasted all of nine minutes. Disney said that voters controlling 68 percent of outstanding shares voted by proxy ahead of the meeting. Of those, 99 percent voted to approve. (There was a lone voice of dissent. When Alan N. Braverman, Disney\u2019s general counsel, opened the floor for shareholder comments, one man stood up and muttered, \u201cI think we are overpaying.\u201d)The Fox shareholder meeting took place in a much smaller ballroom on a subterranean level, with fewer than 60 people present. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. But near the end, a longtime shareholder, Philip Berman, stood up at the microphone and said, \u201cRupert\u2019s dream is complete.\u201dThe deal ends Mr. Murdoch\u2019s reign over an entertainment empire he spent six decades building. He will become a significant minority shareholder in Disney and will continue to run his remaining businesses, which include Fox News, the Fox broadcasting network, the cable network FS1 and newspapers like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and The Sun in Britain.\u201cI want to thank all of our executives and colleagues for their enormous contributions in building 21st Century Fox over the past decades,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said in a statement after the votes.Analysts expect that Disney will clear those hurdles by early 2019.American antitrust regulators approved the merger on the condition that Disney, which already owns ESPN, divest all of Fox\u2019s 22 regional sports networks, which include channels like the Yankees\u2019 YES network. Guggenheim Securities has estimated the value of the chain at $22 billion.\u201cWhile on paper the assets should be attractive, a lack of bidders could drive a relatively lower valuation,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a July 19 report.Mr. Iger said in a statement after the meetings that he was looking forward to \u201cwelcoming 21st Century Fox\u2019s stellar talent to Disney and ultimately integrating our businesses to provide consumers around the world with more appealing content and entertainment options.\u201dThere is no guarantee, however, that he will pull off the herculean task of integrating Fox, which has a drastically different corporate culture. And the clock is ticking: After delaying retirement multiple times, Mr. Iger is scheduled to depart in late 2021.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Set London\u2019s Stages Ablaze", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrantley in BritainYou may come to regard her as dangerous, ridiculous or simply pathetic. But there\u2019s no denying Miss Brodie\u2019s incendiary presence, in a play that implicitly poses the haunting question of what happens to such intensity when it\u2019s deprived of an outlet.Or, as is asked about another woman, who is effortlessly dominating the much bigger stage of the Aldwych Theater in the same neighborhood, \u201cHow do you hold fire?\u201d The subject in that instance is Anna Mae Bullock, who goes by the professional name of Tina Turner.Young Woman\u2019s feverish rallying cry, spoken only to herself: \u201cI\u2019ve submitted to enough \u2014 I won\u2019t submit to any more.\u201d The F-word \u2014 feminism, whose fourth-wave manifestation remains a subject of much discussion on opinion pages here \u2014 is never spoken. But it whispers between the lines of \u201cMachinal,\u201d \u201cTina\u201d and \u201cJean Brodie.\u201dAs it happens, these three strangely kindred productions are all directed by women: Polly Findlay (\u201cJean Brodie\u201d), Phyllida Lloyd (\u201cTina\u201d) and Natalie Abrahami (\u201cMachinal\u201d). And each show is infused with a radiant empathy for its beleaguered heroine that approaches religious dimensions.Seen in those terms, \u201cTina\u201d \u2014 which has a book by the American playwright Katori Hall, with Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins \u2014 is an act of canonization for its sorely tried but ultimately transcendent star. \u201cMachinal\u201d is a grim, modernist-medieval chronicle of an everywoman\u2019s martyrdom.\u201cJean Brodie\u201d \u2014 based on a work by a writer for whom mysticism always glimmered from the shadows \u2014 locates something almost divine, and equally diabolical, in its thwarted protagonist\u2019s frustrations. It is by far the most subtle and psychologically engaging of the three.Ms. Smith injected the role with the winning, withering archness that was fast becoming her stylized signature. (See: \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d nearly 50 years later.) Ms. Williams matches Ms. Smith in amusing affectations. But she also lets us see, with increasing clarity, the uneasily provincial behind the sophisticated artifice.Our growing awareness of Miss Brodie\u2019s unsatisfied hunger to live larger than she does parallels the gradual disenchantment of her once enraptured coterie of pet pupils. It\u2019s not just that she becomes older; more startling, it\u2019s as if we \u2014 like her former students \u2014 grow out of the infatuation with which we first perceived her.Miss Brodie is as dangerous a force as ever in the lives of the girls she calls \u201cthe cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.\u201d After all, she unforgivably tries to engineer a love affair between the prettiest of her disciples and a rou\u00e9 artist, and unwittingly sends an attention-starved pupil to her death in the Spanish Civil War.But for once, this character evokes something like the pity and terror of classical tragedy. There\u2019s a painful new awareness of Jean\u2019s avidly trying to live through others. Watch her ravenous eyes as she reads a map that traces someone else\u2019s travels, or her shifting profile as she mirrors the girl posing for the painter.At the end, a now cancer-riddled Miss Brodie accuses the canniest of her former girls (Rona Morrison, excellent) of killing her. It\u2019s an absurd and melodramatic declaration, but you know what she means. What fed and sustained Miss Brodie was the sunlight of the adoring gaze. Deprived of it, she shrinks and withers.There\u2019s no shrinking \u2014 and definitely no withering \u2014 by the title character of \u201cTina.\u201d The book by the gifted Ms. Hall (an Olivier award winner for \u201cThe Mountaintop\u201d) for this handsomely produced musical is disappointingly formulaic, the usual inspirational showcase for a series of chart-topping hits.Poverty, a sexist and racist recording industry and a terrifyingly abusive relationship \u2014 with her husband and mentor Ike Turner (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, a perceptive study in anger) \u2014 only make the show\u2019s titanic heroine bigger and stronger. What hoists the show several niches above the standard jukebox biography is Ms. Warren\u2019s performance, which finds the gritty sand in Ms. Turner\u2019s pearlescent presence.A Tony nominee for \u201cShuffle Along,\u201d the smashing Ms. Warren replicates the signature physical and vocal inflections. More important, she suggests that what we hear when Tina sings is shaped by a confluence of circumstance and character; every note vibrates as a wrestling match between a woman and her demons.Triumph of any kind is never in the cards for the heroine of \u201cMachinal.\u201d Her unhappy road from joyless servitude as a stenographer to a loveless marriage to death in the electric chair is paved by a steamroller society that flattens its female inhabitants. As designed by the great Miriam Buether, the set for \u201cMachinal\u201d gradually and surreally shifts from the early 1920s to the present, suggesting that even as times change, a woman\u2019s lot remains much the same.I didn\u2019t even think about the character\u2019s gender until near the end, when Hamlet returns to Denmark as, well, a new man \u2014 a calmer, more centered individual with a firm sense of purpose (and a ponytail) and a long view of life.After four acts of brooding vacillation, he is finally able to accomplish what he must. Sometimes, evidently, what a raging tragic hero really needs is to get in touch with his feminine side.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trying to Flip the House, ZIP Code by ZIP Code", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEthan Todras-Whitehill, executive director of the nascent political action group Swing Left, stood near the staircase inside the lobby of the St. James Theater in Manhattan, home of the musical \u201cFrozen.\u201d It was a Tuesday afternoon in mid-June, and the bearded Mr. Todras-Whitehill was dressed in jeans and a blue blazer, as well as a new shirt bought earlier that day at H & M after the one he\u2019d been wearing was deemed unacceptable for television. (There was a crew from MSNBC in attendance.)Mr. Todras-Whitehill seemed unbothered by the subtle change in attire. Since he and two close friends \u2014 none of whom then worked in politics \u2014 led the formal launch of Swing Left in January 2017 with the aim of flipping the House of Representatives to Democratic control in the 2018 midterms, Mr. Todras-Whitehill has quickly acclimated to his newfound prominence in the world of grass-roots politics.Swing Left\u2019s mission of identifying 78 swing districts, 23 of which would have to be flipped in order to return the Democrats to power in the House, has found a receptive audience. The group has more than 400,000 members and has raised more than $9 million in donations so far.\u201cI like the fact that they come from outside politics,\u201d said Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor in chief and Cond\u00e9 Nast creative director, an early supporter of the group. (At one point, another attendee at the St. James event, the actor Mandy Patinkin, whirled around to take a picture of Ms. Wintour on his smartphone.) \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who have very good hearts and are super smart, but they\u2019ve been doing it in the same way for a long time.\u201dIn some ways, Swing Left\u2019s strategy is strictly a numbers game. The group did not vet or support specific candidates based on a set of issues. Instead, it decided to raise money earmarked for whoever won the Democratic primaries in targeted districts, keeping the contributions in escrow \u2014 in so-called district funds \u2014 until general election campaigns began. Mr. Todras-Whitehill wondered whether it was even possible to raise money if the group did not know the identities of the candidates it would ultimately support. Swing Left\u2019s lawyers assured him it was.\u201cYou turn the music off and you have a lot of people who had been drinking,\u201d Ms. Lim said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, when the speeches started, \u201ceveryone just listened. I don\u2019t know if it was an \u2018A-Ha\u2019 moment, but people were engaged.\u201d\u201cI felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want to bother people,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sedgwick said. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not really bothering them. I\u2019m passing along something that\u2019s crucially important for the future of our country.\u2019\u201dIn many ways Swing Left is modeled less on a political organization than on a Silicon Valley start-up. Its founders saw a need for a product \u2014 one that allowed people to easily identify their nearest swing district by simply typing in their ZIP code and seeing what nearby races they might want to get involved in.In a glassy conference room inside a midtown WeWork space the day following the St. James gathering, Mr. Todras-Whitehill, 37, asked, \u201cWhat do tech start-ups focus on?\u201d and then answered his own question. \u201cThey focus on having a clean, appealing product that fills the need of the user,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd one of the big innovations is thinking about our user \u2014 our volunteers as we call them \u2014 almost as a customer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s built into our DNA from the very beginning.\u201d (Swing Left identifies districts to target through a variety of factors including 2016 results, polling, past presidential elections and demographic and geographic indicators.)What began as an all-volunteer organization now has 25 full-time staff members, including one who deals with human resources issues. Two of the original founders have since left the organization, and a professional political organizer has been brought on board: Matt Ewing, a former national field director for MoveOn.org, who is now the group\u2019s chief community officer.It goes without saying that it didn\u2019t take much for Mr. Todras-Whitehill and the others from Swing Left to win over the audience. After the event, sitting in the darkened theater, Mr. Roth joked the location and crowd wasn\u2019t just blue, but \u201cnavy blue\u201d bordering on \u201ccerulean.\u201dMr. Todras-Whitehill\u2019s involvement began on the morning of November 9, 2016, in a coffee shop in Amherst, Mass., close to where he now lives. As he thought about the election results the day before, he began to focus on the midterms two years later. He knew there would be little chance of retaking the Senate in 2018, given how few Republican seats would be at risk, and instead turned his attention toward the House.But the 2016 election results made getting involved feel more urgent, and Mr. Todras-Whitehill began looking for his nearest swing district. With some effort he found it. He then wondered why he had to do that much work. Where was the app?And that was the start. Mr. Todras-Whitehill reached out to a high school friend from his Upper West Side childhood, Joshua Krafchin, an entrepreneur, and his wife Miriam Stone, a branding strategist, both now living in the Bay Area. The couple quickly signed on.They thought about potential names, like \u201cAdopt-a-District\u201d and \u201cMake America Blue Again\u201d before settling on \u201cSwing Left.\u201d\u201cIt sounded like a movement,\u201d Mr. Todras-Whitehill said. \u201cAt that moment in time, we needed more than just a tool. We needed a movement.\u201dWith a cadre of a dozen friends from technology, marketing and media, they developed a website to fill a need they saw lacking: An easy apparatus to let people know which nearby congressional seats could possibly change from red to blue, and potential opportunities to make that happen.For instance, let\u2019s say you type in 80203, a ZIP code in the reliably blue enclave of Denver, Colo. What pops up is a map of the neighboring 6th District, anchored by Aurora, currently held by the Republican congressman Mike Coffman, along with the information that while Mr. Coffman \u201cwon this district by only 31,254 votes (8.3 percent)\u201d in 2016, it was also carried by Hillary Clinton that year and thus should be in play for 2018. (Says the site: \u201cDemocrat Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger and tireless advocate for veterans, can flip this critical seat!\u201d)Though some wanted their site, to go up as soon as possible, Ms. Finocchi preached patience. She had gone to college at Columbia University with Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone and saw Swing Left as an opportunity to act on her frustration over the 2016 vote. But, with most of the others, Ms. Finocchi had no experience in politics, having worked mostly in fashion and the arts.\u201cKnowing people were going to be thinking about it,\u201d Ms. Finocchi, said of the inauguration, \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s give people something to talk about the day before.\u2019\u201dThey had initially hoped to sign up 20,000 people by the end of March. Within a matter of days, however, that number had reached 200,000. This came about thanks to Twitter posts by celebrities like Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman, and hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook. Roughly 10,000 people offered up their professional skills and expertise as a way of assisting the group. (Swing Left is technically a \u201cHybrid PAC,\u201d an organization that the Center for Responsive Politics, defines as having \u201cthe ability to operate both as a traditional political action committee, contributing funds to a candidate\u2019s committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures.\u201d)The group was something very real now, something that needed shape and structure. Also it didn\u2019t help that two of Swing Left\u2019s founders \u2014 Mr. Krafchin and Ms. Stone \u2014 had their second child soon after the organization began, forcing them to retreat from full-time leadership roles.Over the next few months, Swing Left began to build upon that initial fervor. On February 12, 2017, the group held a conference call that drew registrations from 17,000 people. The group encouraged the formation of house parties in different districts \u2014 the first round of which generated 700 across the country.But as Swing Left grew, it also had challenges with staffing. The organization could no longer have people exist in a quasi-volunteer role when the demands on their time demanded real salaries. In late March 2017, Swing Left established a \u201cDonate\u201d button on its home page. To date, Swing Left has raised over $9 million, half of which has been designated to candidates via district funds, with the rest allocated for a massive get-out-the vote effort this fall. That includes the funding of full-time staff salaries that range from roughly $4,000 to $10,000 per month.\u201cIt was a relief to feel that we could put aside our other obligations and make this our full-time focus,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cWe\u2019d all been burning the midnight oil because we had other responsibilities. It was great to be able to go back to my family and say, \u2018That thing? Now it\u2019s my job.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Survival Guide for the Fourth Trimester", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "Practical suggestions for women dealing with the surprising things that happen to their bodies in the first months after childbirth.Supported byAfter 24 hours of labor, I thought the hard part was over.Then my nurse showed up with a small diaper filled with ice. And it wasn\u2019t for the baby.\u201cThis is one of our tricks to reduce the swelling,\u201d she said, while carefully positioning it under my hospital gown.My recovery, I suddenly realized, wasn\u2019t going to be as simple as I had envisioned.And neither was breast-feeding.It began with a nipple blister \u2014 yes, you read that right. It\u2019s a common complication that happens when milk gets trapped under the skin. The pain was second only to labor \u2014 and the difficulty I had in \u201cestablishing a proper latch,\u201d or getting the baby to get a good mouthful of my breast.I will spare you the details about popping a stitch during recovery. Or the time, a few weeks later, when my gynecologist discovered a polyp that required silver nitrate cauterization to chemically burn the tissue.(\u201cThis will sting a little\u201d turned out to be an understatement.)Some women endure far worse. But we don\u2019t tend to talk about it, except, perhaps, with our closest friends and family members.Certainly, it is healthful and helpful to raise awareness of the challenges of motherhood and the risk of postpartum depression.But even so, many women \u2014 myself included \u2014 have felt unprepared for the physical trials of the postpartum period. With that in mind, I spoke with doctors, doulas, pelvic floor specialists and researchers to compile a short list of practical suggestions for women entering the first three months after childbirth, a momentous phase of a woman\u2019s life that has often been eclipsed by the baby.Granted, it\u2019s much more fun to pick out onesies than adult diapers \u2014 but you\u2019ll be much more comfortable if you have items like a sitz bath, witch hazel pads and numbing spray, readily available at home.If you\u2019re wondering whether or not to visit a pelvic floor specialist, the answer is yes.\u201cAnyone who has had a baby should get some kind of rehab,\u201d said Ronit Sukenick, a physical therapist who established the Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation Program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University.It\u2019s especially important for women experiencing incontinence, back pain and feelings of instability \u2014 or if you are no longer able to do the things you used to do, she added.If you still look pregnant several months after delivery, even after you stop breast-feeding and hormone levels return to normal, it might be diastasis.A pelvic floor therapist can check the width of the separation and suggest exercises to strengthen the transverse abdominis muscle and the other muscles that help support your core.Mothers should speak with a lactation consultant if after two or three days they are in a lot of pain or if the baby isn\u2019t gaining weight, she added.Ms. Rosenfeld suggested finding someone who is certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners. When seeking referrals, look to other mothers or a care provider such as your child\u2019s pediatrician.Some mothers simply cannot produce sufficient breast milk, or have trouble breast-feeding for other reasons.Do what is best for your family, and don\u2019t put unnecessary pressure on yourself to exclusively breast-feed. Consider supplementing with formula or donated breast milk.\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell a woman who\u2019s struggling with milk production not to use formula,\u201d Ms. Rosenfeld said. \u201cA kid has to gain weight.\u201dI know, I know. Newborns and sleep do not go hand in hand.But finding ways to get a little extra sleep \u2014 even if only temporarily \u2014 can make a big difference, not only in helping you heal physically but also in your mental state.\u201cFor many people, one or two nights of good sleep totally changes their emotional assessment of their relationship with their child and their relationship to parenthood,\u201d Dr. Sacks said.\u201cIf you can trade off four hours at a time or better yet two nights at a time, you will sort of reset your focus and your capabilities and your sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of women don\u2019t see their partners as a resource, and that\u2019s a mistake.\u201dSome people hire night nurses for a brief time, others enlist the help of relatives or try to nap when the baby is sleeping, letting other tasks slide.\u201cIf you\u2019ve done all that, you\u2019ve won the game.\u201d Advertisement"}

Museum Hack\u2019s approach is to use humor, pop cultural references and games to make the trip more fun and less dutiful.\u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with attracting a whole new audience,\u201d said Nick Gray, who founded Museum Hack in 2013.  \u201cMuseums aren\u2019t competing with other museums,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re competing with Netflix, Facebook and iPhones.\u201dBut third-party tour companies, especially those working in fine art museums, bring more external filters, from the comedic to the academic. Their tours range from special themes, like feminism or gay culture, to museum highlights designed for time-pressed or attention-deficit travelers.Mr. Oddo and his co-founder, Jason Spiehler, met while working in Rome, where Mr. Spiehler was a guiding tours at the Vatican. Together they founded Walks in Italy in 2010; in other countries the company now goes by Take Walks. The company offers tours like the Louvre in Paris at closing time, when traffic around the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d dies down, and a full-day trip to three sites by the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, two of them museums, in Barcelona. \u201cIn the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a shift from larger-group, checklist-style, in-a-bus itineraries to smaller tours with guides that have a specific knowledge on a subject and can speak to that nuance,\u201d Mr. Oddo said of the Take Walks tours, which are designed for 12 to 15 people. (Most museum itineraries run two to four hours and range $42 to $107; register at takewalks.com.)The company\u2019s tours are not exclusively museum-based, but where they are, \u201cthemes range from connoisseurship, the currency of art, art theft (alleged or not), and generally the ostentatiously wealthy and conspicuous consumption,\u201d wrote Nick Stropko, a marketing associate at Context, in an email. \u201cWe are taught to look at art in an almost disorienting and intimidating way, that art is about distinct styles and theoretical concerns,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a great place to start. People like to know context, and, of course, this is a fun side of context.\u201dMuseum Hack, in contrast, was founded by Mr. Gray who had no background in art or history, but said he fell in love with the wonders of the Metropolitan Museum, where themed tours now range from the \u201cun-highlights\u201d to an \u201cunofficial and definitely unlicensed boy wizard tour.\u201d Now in five cities, Museum Hack tends to hire actors, comics and engaging teachers to guide its tours including feminist tours at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. A drag queen guides another itinerary at the Art Institute of Chicago. Most tours cost $49 to $69 a person; participants must sign up in advance at museumhack.com. \u201cWe hire first for storytelling ability and prioritize that above art history knowledge or expertise,\u201d said Mr. Gray, who calls the Met his \u201cthird space\u201d and aims to make infrequent museum visitors comfortable in places they might find intimidating. \u201cWe think that audiences have to be entertained before they can be educated,\u201d he added.

{"Headline": "The New Season of \u2018GLOW\u2019 Is Even Better Than the First. Except for One Thing.", "Date": "2018-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpoilers for Season 2 of \u201cGLOW\u201d follow.In the very first episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cGLOW,\u201d Ruth (Alison Brie), a struggling actress, auditions for an all-ladies wrestling show directed by Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron), a crotchety, crude and jaded filmmaker with a string of low-budget exploitation flicks to his name. Their first one-on-one encounter is humiliating for Ruth, as Sam instantly picks her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and head shot apart, wondering aloud if people think she is pretty.\u201cI\u2019m looking at you one second, I think \u2018[Expletive] yeah, she\u2019s hot,\u2019\u201d he snarks. \u201cAnd then the next second I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2014 is she, really?\u2019\u201dThus begins a prickly odd-couple relationship common to workplace comedies: His dismissive curmudgeon clashes with her overachieving go-getter, until eventually, the curmudgeon is softened ever so slightly by the other\u2019s earnestness. But despite its familiarity, the dynamic stood out in Season 1, in large part because Ruth and Sam avoided becoming one of the most tired TV tropes: the will-they-or-won\u2019t they? couple. Unfortunately in the second season, now on Netflix, the \u201cGLOW\u201d writers are suggesting that romance is the only natural course for this pair to take.Ruth and Sam\u2019s interactions were among the highlights of Season 1 \u2014 snappy, rhythmic exchanges that could delight even without dialogue. (When Ruth offers her impression of Audrey Hepburn winning the best actress Oscar, Sam\u2019s bewildered facial expression does most of the talking.) The relationship is also where one of the show\u2019s major themes \u2014 sexism in the workplace \u2014 plays out most explicitly. Ruth is the first to see the potential for \u201cGLOW\u201d to be more than just a silly wrestling show, and frequently chimes in with creative suggestions. She is a bit of a suck up, but Sam\u2019s ongoing piggish insults reveal his internalized misogyny. When he cuts her from an audition in an early scene he suggests his decision may be because \u201cI don\u2019t like your face, or your ass.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he continues. \u201cMaybe I like both of them too much. I don\u2019t have to explain myself \u2014 that\u2019s the beauty of being a director.\u201dBut in the otherwise excellent Season 2, the \u201cGLOW\u201d writers opt for the easy and clich\u00e9 route. In the seventh episode, \u201cNothing Shattered,\u201d the show begins to hammer home an unspoken romantic connection by pitting Sam against the new character Russell, the cameraman who has vied for Ruth\u2019s affections behind the scenes. After she\u2019s seriously injured in the ring, Sam becomes jealous when Russell carries her offstage; at the hospital, he haughtily steps in to wheel her to her room. \u201cMy show,\u201d Sam says. \u201cCapeesh, Hercules?\u201dSam\u2019s slow and imperfect evolution toward being less of a sexist pig would be more powerful if his redemption stood on its own, rather than attached to his attraction to one of the women who is most responsible for it. And while Russell may not turn out to be a good fit for Ruth \u2014 who acknowledges that she has often made poor dating choices \u2014 a pivot to Sam would suggest a step backward for her character, just when it seemed she was finally entering a new mode of self-awareness.It also doesn\u2019t help that in real life Mr. Maron is nearly 20 years older than Ms. Brie, yet another example of Hollywood casting romantic duos in which the woman is significantly younger.Thankfully, there are a few moments in Season 2 that stick with that spirit. In \u201cRosalie,\u201d Sam lets Ruth crash on his couch one night. Sam hands her a blanket and pillow, turns off the lights and heads into his room across the hall. It\u2019s a simple exchange, but it demonstrates how far they\u2019ve come as friends and colleagues, even if they don\u2019t always see eye to eye. The moment also stands out because it comes and goes swiftly, with no tension or awkwardness, no lingering glances. That\u2019s what makes it special.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the cameraman in \u201cGLOW.\u201d His name is Russell, not Phil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Comedy Is Making You Feel Bad, You\u2019re Not Paying Attention", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyFor Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special \u201cNanette\u201d tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths.When did comedy become the worst medicine?But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn\u2019t even seem notable.In the past year or so, there has been a backlash to the growing role of comedy, and as with nearly every cultural trend these days, Donald J. Trump has something to do with it. He became famous in part because of comedy institutions; he was a fixture on roasts, late-night talk shows and Howard Stern. But once he ran for president, comedians obsessed about him as much as cable-news hosts did. Despite the endless internet headlines trumpeting how this host eviscerated him or that comic destroyed Mr. Trump, none did. This clarified what comedy could accomplish.Where Ms. Gadsby suggests that jokes obscure a comedian\u2019s ability to tell the full truth, Ms. Wolf argues that the imperative to go viral with a sincere insult has gotten in the way of being funny.Then there were the many comedians accused of sexual misconduct. Their private behavior was often at odds with their public profile, and since audiences put more stock in the authenticity of a comic\u2019s constructed stage persona than, say, a fictional character in a play, attitudes toward comedy grew darker.Next month, after years of development, the first American museum dedicated to comedy opens in Jamestown, N.Y. Its exhibits adopt a mythologizing tone that can also be seen in the recent CNN documentary series, \u201cThe History of Comedy,\u201d in which talking heads explain George Carlin\u2019s seven words you can\u2019t say on television the same way teachers examine the causes of the War of 1812.There\u2019s enough reverence for comedy these days that it\u2019s easy to forget that the core of most humor is irreverence. If we think comedy can do everything, won\u2019t we eventually be disappointed?Stand-up is not memoir or therapy or a political essay, even if it shares elements with all of these forms. And it cannot solve society\u2019s problems, so in that sense, sure, it\u2019s limited. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s only good for diverting chuckles. What Ms. Gadsby glosses over is that it\u2019s a nimble art form, one whose conventions can be toyed with or subverted or stuck to rigidly.Like any art, it has its clich\u00e9s, but it cannot be reduced to a formula. The irony of rigidly defining it now is that there has never been a time in history where the contours of comedy have been more flexible, when there is more disagreement over what exactly it is.The line between solo show and stand-up has always been blurry, but now it is nearly meaningless. The stand-up John Mulaney cites the writer and actor Spalding Gray as an influence, and theaters are filled with stand-ups like Colin Quinn, Neal Brennan and Chris Gethard. Comedy has already co-opted much of the cultural space that was once the province of performance artists and chameleonic solo performers, precisely because it has found room for the ambitious long-form storytelling of Mike Birbiglia, the experimentation of Kate Berlant and Maria Bamford and the political salvos of Sacha Baron Cohen, who at his most provocative builds tension without offering much relief.And the most discussed work of art this year about the sexist assumptions underpinning our notions of artistic genius did not come from a novel or movie. That was \u201cNanette,\u201d which in finding articulate expression for a pessimistic critique of stand-up also provides the best case for optimism for the future of the form.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Netflix, a Genuine Nail-Biter, and on Amazon, a Genuine Eccentric", "Date": "2018-07-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingIt\u2019s well earned. \u201cCalibre,\u201d written and directed by Matt Palmer (making his first feature) follows two old friends, Marcus (Martin McCann) and Vaughn (Jack Lowden), on a hunting (or \u201cstalking,\u201d as the townspeople call it) trip to the Scottish Highlands. Vaughn has a fianc\u00e9e who\u2019s pregnant, and Marcus takes this occasion to crow to his buddy that he should \u201cenjoy the last few days\u201d of his freedom.The first \u201choly crap!\u201d moment of the movie occurs not even 20 minutes in, and at that point it\u2019s don\u2019t-get-up-from-the-sofa time. And because it\u2019s on Netflix, \u201cCalibre\u201d is a movie you can pause, but you\u2019re not going to want to. As the two friends get into one awful predicament after another, Marcus\u2019s \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what he\u2019s gotta do\u201d attitude rubs up against Vaughn\u2019s reticence, and over the course of the movie their friendship frays. The character dynamics are recognizable in the way they hew to genre conventions. But the details provided in the writing, and by the two leads\u2019 performances, add distinctive details and dimension here. This makes the film\u2019s harrowing action all the more believable. Ultimately, these fellows can\u2019t stop what\u2019s coming.His earliest available work, \u201cDawn of an Evil Millennium,\u201d from 1988, is a component of the anthology film \u201cDawn of Evil.\u201d Like some of Mr. Packard\u2019s shorts, \u201cEvil Millennium\u201d is a kind of trailer for a never-completed picture. Featuring blood-drenched characters staggering through the seedier areas of Hollywood, it plays like an amalgam of the works of the underground luminary Kenneth Anger, David Lynch, the B-movie schlock/shockmeister William Castle, and the barrel-scraping grindhouse auteur Andy Milligan.\u201cReflection of Evil\u201d doggedly defies conventional plot description. The cut of the film streaming on Amazon Prime is almost two hours and 20 minutes. (A shorter version can be rented on the site, but I didn\u2019t have time to watch it.) It begins with a badly redubbed introduction from Tony Curtis, lifted from a LaserLight \u201cclassic films\u201d DVD release. Mr. Packard frequently cuts to an aging couple watching a TV movie in their living room; in the film within this film, a young woman in a nightgown wanders tree-lined streets.In the middle of the street outside, a character named Bobby, played by Mr. Packard himself, materializes out of thin air. The already hefty actor-director is wearing padding to make himself look even bulkier. He paces the street screeching obscenities. Distracted by the noise outside, the man watching TV walks across the living room to his gun rack, which has a Nazi flag behind it. Bobby passes out on the street and regurgitates what looks like a gallon of Dinty Moore beef stew.There actually is a narrative: In the ever-warping alternate realities at play here, the woman in the nightgown is Bobby\u2019s older sister, who decades before had lost her brother somewhere at Universal Studios. This thread allows Mr. Packard to contemplate another one of his obsessions, Steven Spielberg, and he manages to blend archival footage of Mr. Spielberg directing the 1972 TV movie \u201cSomething Evil\u201d into his story line, such as it is.The perspective in Reflection of Evil\u201d is not \u201cmovie mad,\u201d or \u201cmovie crazy\u201d in the sense that people (perhaps insensitively) throw around those terms; it is more like movie deranged. And not in the slightly louche, aesthetically languid sense you get from the French Surrealist writings celebrating cinema\u2019s potential for a derangement of the senses. No, this is Hollywood pop-culture-hoarding derangement.An earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the surname of the director of the film \u201cCalibre.\u201d He is Matt Palmer, not Porter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trade Wars? Three Funds Made Solid Profits Anyway", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter \u2014 as well as over the last five years \u2014 by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. \u201cSmall-cap companies are more domestically focused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing.\u201dShe prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. \u201cThe root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re interested in software, automation and health care.\u201dHer fund\u2019s biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China\u2019s semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.\u201cSemiconductors are China\u2019s largest import, even more than oil,\u201d Ms. Hsiao said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies.\u201dMs. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances. GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.\u201cCancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the U.S., if you get cancer, you\u2019re likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time. In China, 65 percent of treatment is still chemotherapy.\u201dA challenge for an investor in emerging-market small caps is a dearth of the corporate disclosures and market regulation that developed-world investors take for granted. Ms. Hsiao said she compensated by sleuthing.\u201cI\u2019ll interview ex-bosses and ex-co-workers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I visit a factory, I always ask to see the defects. How do they define a defect? If a little scratch qualifies as a defect, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to cheat me on the numbers.\u201dMs. Hsiao\u2019s fund, which has a net expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 2.37 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. For the five years that ended June 30, it returned an annualized average of 14.78 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re usually overweight the U.S. because that\u2019s where the best intellectual property is,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cBut after the Trump victory, we went underweight because stocks went up so much, and emerging markets were in crisis.\u201dMr. Eiswert called himself a \u201ccareful contrarian\u201d about emerging markets and said he waited for crises to buy companies he liked.The fund\u2019s largest emerging-market bet \u2014 the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant \u2014 is also its largest holding. (Alibaba is based in China but has American depositary receipts that trade in the United States.)\u201cFacebook, Amazon, Google \u2014 there are elements of natural monopoly in those businesses,\u201d Mr. Eiswert said. \u201cIn China, it\u2019s similar with Alibaba. And monopolies are good ways to make money.\u201d Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s holding company, Alphabet, are also top holdings.The fund has a heavy slug of technology stocks \u2014 about a third of its assets, compared with only a fifth for the typical world stock fund tracked by Morningstar. That allocation may reflect Mr. Eiswert\u2019s background: He spent about a decade as a tech analyst and tech fund manager for T.

That says so much about the enduring power of the Hollywood myth machine.\u201dHe added: \u201cTelling an alternate history of Hollywood through a lens of one of its great unsung characters is a worthwhile thing to do. Scotty also fills in a lot of the blanks and spaces in the history of the L.G.B.T.Q. movement.\u201dMr. Bowers, who grew up on a farm in Illinois, settled in Los Angeles in 1946 after fighting in the Pacific during World War II. He got a job pumping gas at the corner of North Van Ness Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, about five blocks from the old Warner Bros. lot, where Netflix is based today. He was 23.As the story goes, Walter Pidgeon (\u201cMrs. Miniver\u201d) drove up in a Lincoln coupe and propositioned Mr. Bowers, who accepted. Word got around. Mr. Bowers was soon running what he describes as a matchmaking service, with himself and several adventurous friends as the service providers. \u201cI just wanted to make people happy,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Payment was a $20 bill, given as \u201ca tip,\u201d according to Mr. Bowers, who says that he supported himself as a sex worker and bartender for decades, miraculously avoiding the vice squad and expanding to provide partners for heterosexual stars like Vivien Leigh and Desi Arnaz. He retired (sort of) with the onset of AIDS in the 1980s; he also got married, to a woman, in 1984.Along the way, Mr. Bowers drew the attention of Alfred Kinsey, the sex researcher, Mr. Tyrnauer said.\u201cScotty is the through line of sex and sexuality in the second half of the 20th century \u2014 touching every theme from his dealings with Dr. Kinsey, to the rise of gay communities in the big cities, to the dark days of the vice squad,\u201d Mr. Tyrnauer said.

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Approval Gets Justice Department Challenge", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal government on Thursday mounted a new effort to unravel AT&T\u2019s deal with Time Warner, a blockbuster merger that has already started to reshape the media industry.The deal was finalized a month ago, after a federal judge rejected the government\u2019s argument that the $85.4 billion agreement would harm competition and consumers.The judge\u2019s decision had almost immediately set off a round of intense deal talks among many of the biggest names in the industry, including Comcast and 21st Century Fox. Many media executives, including those at AT&T and Time Warner, say mergers among their companies are necessary to better compete against tech giants like Netflix and Amazon.The Department of Justice filed its notice of appeal on the same day that Netflix beat out HBO for the most Emmy nominations \u2014 ending the premium channel\u2019s 17-year run as the most-nominated outlet.The Justice Department declined to comment. But experts say the appeal sends a clear signal that the government, despite its court loss, will be aggressive on deals between companies with complementary businesses, known as vertical mergers. Immediately after the AT&T-Time Warner merger was approved last month, Comcast entered a bidding war with the Walt Disney Company for the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox.\u201cIf they had not appealed it, it would have been a green light for vertical mergers to proceed apace,\u201d said Andrew J. Schwartzman of the Georgetown University Law Center.AT&T\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee, expressed confidence about the company\u2019s chances in an appeal. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision could hardly have been more thorough, fact-based, and well-reasoned,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the losing party in litigation always has the right to appeal if it wishes, we are surprised that the D.O.J. has chosen to do so under these circumstances.\u201dThe plan to appeal was made public late in the afternoon; shares in AT&T fell 1.3 percent in after-hours trading.The Justice Department had considered filing an injunction to stop the deal from closing after the judge, Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, approved it on June 12. But it did not go ahead with the motion because AT&T said the media arm would be operated as a separate group, making it easier to unwind the business should the Justice Department succeed in an appeal.The latest legal maneuvering will not immediately change the business. But if the Justice Department ultimately prevails in its appeal, AT&T would have to detach the Time Warner business, now renamed Warner Media.The government\u2019s approach to the AT&T-Time Warner merger contrasts sharply with its relatively quick approval of Disney\u2019s proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment properties. That agreement, in which Disney said it would pay $71.3 billion for Fox\u2019s television and movie business, was approved in June, about six months after it was announced. Transactions of such size typically take a year or longer.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to appeal could benefit Rupert Murdoch, the Fox chairman, who has supported Disney\u2019s offer over Comcast\u2019s, according to Craig Moffett, a longtime media analyst.Comcast appeared to already be backing away from its bid, but the government\u2019s appeal could make the giant cable company move away even faster by raising more doubts about whether the Justice Department would approve such a deal.\u201cLobbing in this hand grenade right now sort of seals Comcast\u2019s fate,\u201d Mr. Moffett said.Comcast is locked in a separate bidding war for control of the European satellite broadcaster Sky, which has more than 23 million customers across five countries. After Fox improved its offer to control Sky on Wednesday, Comcast quickly topped that bid with one of its own, valuing the company at $34 billion.The AT&T and Time Warner merger has generated such intense interest partly because of the political overtones. As a candidate, Donald J. Trump, who had frequently criticized the Time Warner property CNN as \u201cfake news,\u201d vowed to stop the AT&T-Time Warner merger if elected to the White House.The Justice Department, however, said politics had played no role in the decision to oppose the AT&T-Time Warner deal.The government sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal late last year, saying the combination of companies that distribute and produce content would lead to higher prices for all cable customers. After a six-week trial, Judge Leon concluded that the Justice Department did not provide enough evidence that it would harm consumers and competitors.The filing that announced the government\u2019s intention to appeal did not include any details about what arguments the government planned to make to a higher court, the United States Court of Appeals in Washington. If either side disagrees with the appeals court\u2019s decision, the case could then move to the Supreme Court.Mr. Schwartzman of the Georgetown University Law Center said the odds of winning are low for the side appealing its case. He and other legal experts said Judge Leon\u2019s decision was specifically tailored for AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner, limiting potential problems in an appeal.Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, was likewise skeptical of the Justice Department\u2019s chances, but he said the government\u2019s intention may not ultimately be to win a court appeal.\u201cIt signals to the market the government isn\u2019t throwing in the towel but I think it\u2019s a long shot because the appellate court has to defer to the trial judge on facts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Here is a sampling, lightly edited:I have sat by the shore of Lake Massawippi in Quebec at least once every summer of my 62 years. My morning ritual is to get up just before dawn to meditate on the screened-in porch as the birds wake up. I then make my first cup of coffee and take it back out to the porch to watch the ducks float past. If I am lucky, the heron stops by. Annis KarpenkoI grew up spending my summers at camp on an island on the British Columbia coast, Texada. My grandparents built it overlooking a bay that partially emptied with the tide and clams squirted their whereabouts to be dug for dinner. When I was in my 50s I gathered family and friends to kayak on the open ocean coast and finally to build a cabin in the coastal wilderness. It was built with cedar logs, escaped from commercial log rafts finding resting places on our beach.Lou McKee, author and illustrator of Klee Wyck Journal: The Making of a Wilderness Retreat.Declaring one favorite cottage routine forces me to choose between picking the wild blueberries that are so essential to a real Canadian experience and playing Hearts at night by the light of the propane lamps.

This was, of course driven by the flood of refugees \u2014 including my family \u2014 into a bombed-out West Germany with little housing for themselves. But the dream was not only housing; it was a cottage on a lake. It embodied the view of Canada most Germans still have today.Ingrid Hurtubise, Marietta, Ga.My log cabin was built in 1903, on an island just outside Ontario\u2019s Algonquin Park, by three American industrialists as a place to send their families in the summer to escape the heat and pollution of the Midwest.

It seems both incongruous, given how embedded cottages are in our Canadian national psyche, and perfect, given how entangled we are with our neighbors. It was by design: The government advertised the sale of cheap crown land in American magazines, like Rod and Gun, as far back as 1926, with the hopes that the tourist windfall would help small-town economies sagging from shuttered log mills.Interestingly, in the 1970s, Canada was experiencing its first real surge of patriotism, and many politicians seized on the fact that Americans \u2014 who were \u201ctaking over the economy\u201d \u2014 owned 14 percent of cottages in Ontario. In 1974, a 20 percent foreign-buyers tax went into effect in Ontario, foreshadowing the debate that grips much of Vancouver and Toronto today, with a different foreign buyer in mind.I spoke to many Canadians this week who are mounting their own personal \u201cboycott America\u201d campaigns.

Each issue builds on the last and this story is definitely not over.That said, I have taken everyone\u2019s reaction to heart. I will be incredibly more sensitive to spoilers and timing, and I will work hard to regain the trust and confidence of my fellow comic book fans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix, the Stock Market\u2019s Big Hope, Disappoints", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen rising interest rates and trade tensions weighed on the stock market in recent months, investors could always comfort themselves with four words: \u201cThere is always Netflix.\u201dNot on Monday.Netflix disappointed investors with news that it added substantially fewer subscribers in the second quarter than expected. The company\u2019s stock, which had more than doubled this year as the wider market stalled, plunged 14 percent after the close of regular trading.While Netflix\u2019s revenue and profits are still surging, the shortfall in subscriber growth is a reminder that companies priced for perfection can disappoint when optimism seems to be at a peak. And the slip-up will revive skepticism about Netflix\u2019s business model.Netflix had forecast that it would add 1.2 million new United States subscribers in the second quarter, but it signed up only 674,000. Internationally, the company gained 4.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, below Netflix\u2019s expectations for five million. Revenue rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $3.91 billion but was slightly below the total that Wall Street analysts had expected.Netflix is hardly in trouble. Paid subscriptions were still up 26 percent from a year earlier. And in recent quarters, subscriber numbers exceeded Netflix\u2019s projections, so Monday\u2019s disappointment may not amount to much in the scheme of things.Still, the company\u2019s stock shows that Netflix has a lot to live up to. The company\u2019s share price, after Monday\u2019s plunge, is equivalent to 107 times the per-share earnings that analysts expect Netflix to make this year. This price-to-earnings ratio is far higher than it is on the stocks of many other technology companies. Bullish investors may contend that such a ratio is justifiable, given that analysts expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to keep growing quickly. Profits are expected to rise 58 percent this year, and 66 percent next.But the subscriber growth fell short at what could turn out to be a challenging time for Netflix. It\u2019s facing competition from Amazon, Hulu, Google and, perhaps, Apple. The Walt Disney Company is buying much of Fox, in part, to bolster its planned streaming service. And, of course, AT&T has big ambitions for Time Warner, which it is acquiring for its video content. Big hit shows, like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d helped Netflix attract new subscribers. The more companies striving to produce blockbusters, the harder it may become for Netflix to maintain the pace of its subscriber growth.And in a drawn-out fight, in which everyone is spending large sums on programming, investors may find it harder to overlook Netflix\u2019s negative cash flows. The company made $674 million in the first half of this year. But its operations used up $755 million of cash during that period.Advertisement"}

A lesbian from conservative Tasmania, she is done mining past trauma for jokes. Instead, Gadsby launches into a shrewd and impassioned dissection of misogyny, homophobia, art history and especially comedy. Is it fair to call this stand-up? Opinions vary. As these essays and conversations about \u201cNanette\u201d prove, however, what Gadsby says is more important than what her performance does.In his review of the version of \u201cNanette\u201d that Gadsby performed this spring at New York\u2019s SoHo Playhouse, Jason Zinoman notes that the comedian \u201ccalls out Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton, not to mention Pablo Picasso, in an ingenious indictment of the sexism and sentimentality of our narratives about genius.\u201d He continues: \u201cBut her real target is the culture that enables and excuses abuse. That doesn\u2019t sound funny, I realize, but she is that, too. Still, the laughs of her show are a means to an end, which is, at its core, a ferocious attack on comedy itself.\u201dAndrew Kahn goes long on the show, in a piece that situates Gadsby within a larger cultural reckoning with comedy. \u201c\u2018Nanette\u2019 challenges an idea of comedy, humor as truth-telling, that passed as common sense until pretty recently,\u201d he writes. \u201cOver the past two years, that idea has come in for a bruising \u2014 if not on the stage, certainly in the public square, where buffoonish politicians, racist trolls, and abusive comedians have stoked a debate about the perils of irony. This show ought to be seen as a product of that debate: When you take the anti-irony train all the way to the end of the line, one place you can end up is \u2018Nanette.\u2019\u201dVulture asked two comedians, Sara Schaefer (\u201cNikki & Sara Live\u201d) and Sabrina Jalees (\u201cThe Lineup\u201d), to discuss \u201cNanette.\u201d Their conversation is thoughtful and honest, as the women discuss both Gadsby\u2019s work and the light it sheds on their own careers. \u201cWhen I was 18 I fell in love with a woman for the first time, but it took me until my early 20s to start talking about it onstage,\u201d Jalees recalls. \u201cI cared too much about what people would think and how they\u2019d judge me. Breaking through that fear and realizing that judgment is unavoidable regardless of your sexuality was a huge lesson for me both as a person and comic.\u201d\u201cNanette\u201d also inspired a candid roundtable among a handful of writers and comedians at Autostraddle, a site for lesbians, bisexual woman and their allies. In praising Gadsby\u2019s take on art history, A.E. Osworth says: \u201cI have long been a champion of the idea that suffering is not required for art; suffering is waste product. Something that comes out of a learned desire to destroy. It produces nothing. Art, however, responds to culture. And we have created a culture of suffering, that says \u2018this is just the way it is\u2019 and places some on top, and some below.\u201dRachel Syme was also struck by the connections Gadsby draws between art, abuse and the way we talk about great artists like Picasso and Van Gogh. \u201cThe reason Gadsby brings up these looming artistic figures is not because she wants to take easy swipes at the dead,\u201d Syme writes. \u201cShe does it because, as a woman who is very much alive and trying to make art, she says she grew up learning that these men (along with Bill Cosby, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski) were the geniuses against whom she should measure herself, and in doing so found almost no room for her own voice.\u201dGadsby\u2019s special feels deeply connected with the movement against sexual misconduct that has dominated pop culture for the past year. In her analysis of this synergy, Moira Donegan writes: \u201cYou could consider the #MeToo moment itself as a kind of callback, a collective return to stories that women have been telling one way \u2014 to others, to themselves \u2014 with a new, emboldened understanding that those past tellings had been inadequate. Like Gadsby, many women have excluded or elided the difficult parts of their stories for the sake of a punch line, the sake of not upsetting the status quo, or the sake of the comfort of their listeners.\u201dMatthew Monagle dissects the emerging backlash against \u201cNanette.\u201d \u201cScroll through Twitter or Reddit and you\u2019ll find plenty of people who are willing to admit that it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just not really comedy,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey would prefer we describe \u2018Nanette\u2019 as an indie TED Talk or some kind of public speaking event due to the lack of conventional humor in the set. The cognitive dissonance in this should be obvious to most \u2014 men are rejecting an unconventional stand-up special because it takes men to task for rejecting anything that breaks with their idea of convention \u2014 but \u2018Nanette\u2019 also reinforces the importance of participating in conversations, even if it\u2019s just as a listener, when your \u2018welcomeness\u2019 is not a priority.\u201dIn a popular Twitter thread, Samara McCann recounts Gadsby\u2019s response to a rude audience member at an early performance of \u201cNanette\u201d in Canberra. \u201cDuring one particularly harrowing moment,\u201d McCann writes, \u201cHannah was describing a moment of violence that was all too familiar to women, particularly those in the L.G.B.T.I.Q. community. The room was silent. Then, a lone male voice from the back of the room shouted \u2018Where\u2019s the bloody jokes?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

It sounds great!\u2019\u201d said Ms. James, who eagerly detoured on her way to the Glastonbury Festival in England to audition for the film. But after learning that the part was hers, she got a case of cold feet.\u201cI really panicked about taking on the role of Donna after Meryl had so magically and vividly brought it to life,\u201d she said. \u201cI panicked about the singing and the dancing and the time to prepare. And then I finally decided to bite the bullet.\u201dFlash forward to the present, where her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is honoring her mother with the opening of the Hotel Bella Donna. Then a storm blows in, and its name is Cher.On her way to catch a flight from London to Stockholm for the \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d premiere, she cheerfully chatted by phone about the perils of channeling Ms. Streep and the power of Cher.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.First things first: Where did you get your chops?Well, my dad was a good singer. He was in a band called Two Way, with the actor Anthony Head, and had a record. He sang and played guitar, so I guess it was from him. Not my mom. She\u2019s pretty tone deaf.You\u2019d already sung in \u201cCinderella.\u201d Were you nervous about auditioning?I sang a few songs \u2014 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d and \u201cMamma Mia\u201d \u2014 and went into a room with the choreographer, the producers and the director. So it was a really scary room. But I was such a big fan of the musical, and I\u2019d seen it a lot when I was younger, and I loved the movie. I just felt like it captured the heart of what the stage production was, and that\u2019s hard to do \u2014 keep the same essence and vibe, and keep people jumping up and down.What\u2019s it like to shoot a musical where the songs are enormous hits?The very first thing I did was go to Stockholm and record my songs with Benny [Andersson] and Bjorn [Ulvaeus], and suddenly I was in Benny\u2019s studio and I was singing Abba songs in front of Abba. So that happened.And Anthony Van Laast is the choreographer and he\u2019s just the best \u2014 a magician of movement. Initially I sort of was like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be told what to do. I need to be an actor where you just figure it out.\u201d And then I slowly began to realize that following this quite rigid structure allowed total freedom within the music and the performance.How does one prepare to play Meryl Streep?[Deep inhale and exhale] Well, I tried to be really proactive about it, just to show that I\u2019d done all the work I possibly could. And I watched the movie thousands and thousands of times and tried to mimic her mannerisms and capture what I thought the essence of Donna was and what Meryl did.And when you finally met?Our paths didn\u2019t cross that much because of the nature of the film. But she seems just really rooted and cool and generous. But you know, she\u2019s Meryl Streep, so she walks in a room and it\u2019s amazing. She was singing in this chapel, and I knew I was about to meet her, and I started to cry. It was just too much to get my head around. And I told myself to pull it together. She is my favorite actress.Then there\u2019s Cher.That was wild. I brought my mom in the day Cher was singing. And me and my mom had this amazing image of watching at the monitors in a dark corner of Pinewood [Studios, near London], just shaking. It was very surreal, this front-row, private, intimate gig of Cher\u2019s. Her voice is so overwhelmingly powerful and rich, and when you hear it in the flesh, it\u2019s mesmerizing.Do you have a favorite scene?There\u2019s a moment when I meet Bill, the young Stellan Skarsgard character played by Josh Dylan, and we dance on the boat on the way to Kalokairi. And there was this magical week when every day we were in the Adriatic Sea [in Croatia], which was just glittering, and dancing on this beautiful boat and Abba was blaring out and it was just too good to be true. Every day on wrap we got to jump into the sea, and the sun would be setting as you\u2019d return home. That\u2019s what I think is so special about [the movie]. If it\u2019s your cup of tea, it\u2019s just joyous.Well, I\u2019m going to hold off before I speak because I\u2019m not actually sure what I\u2019m allowed to say yet. Dot, dot dot.I seem to be going through all the great iconic bands. It\u2019s centered around a world where there\u2019s only one person left who can remember the Beatles\u2019 music. It\u2019s not a musical but it\u2019s got a lot of music in it, and I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it. I\u2019m not [singing], but Himesh Patel, who\u2019s the lead actor, will blow everyone\u2019s mind when they hear him.At least the World Cup will be over by the time \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d opens. Have you been watching? Oh my god, yes, religiously. I\u2019m not usually [a soccer fan] but I\u2019m a Chelsea fan, which I have to be because my brothers and my dad are hard-core fans. But the World Cup, I just can\u2019t help but feel so invested. Nothing in theater can achieve that level of drama, where anything can happen, and commitment and power. It\u2019s art. And other than \u201cMamma Mia!,\u201d what gets a crowd like that leaping to their feet?An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a character Lily James plays in \u201cThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.\u201d She portrays Juliet Ashton, not Asher.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Used Apple\u2019s New Controls to Limit a Teenager\u2019s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixEven as people have embraced the smartphone as one of the most powerful tech products, they are keeping a wary eye on the addictiveness of turning on the device to check for social media updates, read websites and play games. Some studies have tied extended screen time to distraction in classrooms, sleep deprivation and depression.First, a primer on how Screen Time works. The feature, which lives inside the iPhone\u2019s settings, shows a dashboard of data about your iPhone use. You can look at your stats for the day or week, including the amount of time you spent on specific apps and on the phone over all. Inside the dashboard, you can create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games. When you run out of time with an app, it locks you out.Over the last three weeks, I studied Sophie\u2019s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on \u2014 Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter \u2014 I placed a few time limits on each of us.Here\u2019s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt \u201ctriggered\u201d (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat.\u201cIt was just a pattern for me \u2014 to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I\u2019m trying not to do that.\u201dBut in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie\u2019s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie\u2019s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself).These early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple\u2019s new software.Here\u2019s a weekly diary on how Screen Time altered our phone use.Sophie and I had a rough start with the experiment because of technical difficulties. Apple\u2019s iOS 12 is still in beta, meaning an unfinished version of the software system is being tested by app developers and early adopters \u2014 and we ran into major bugs.For most of the first week, a bug prevented me from seeing Sophie\u2019s Screen Time statistics. But at the end of the week, after Apple released a software fix, her weekly stats appeared. They revealed that she had used her phone for six hours and seven minutes a day on average over the week. I could also see that Sophie was sometimes sneaking glances at her iPhone past midnight, when she was supposed to be asleep.After I shared the data with my editor, she bombarded Sophie with a flurry of disapproving text messages and fiery emoji.Meanwhile, my stats showed that I had used my phone for three hours and 46 minutes a day on average over the week. The majority of my time was spent using the Twitter app Tweetbot, and a significant amount was wasted playing Zynga Poker.With Screen Time now working properly, I placed limits for both Sophie and myself. For her, I set a 30-minute limit on gaming and a 60-minute limit on social networking. To help her sleep, I also turned on Downtime, a setting that disables most parts of the phone for a set time, from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.I gave myself the same one-hour limit for social networking apps. But instead of setting a limit for games, I opted to nip my Zynga Poker addiction in the bud by deleting the game and kissing my dreams of being a fake-money billionaire goodbye.Even though Sophie was initially incensed about being locked out of Snapchat after an hour, she eventually came around to enjoying the limit.In fact, she asked for more limits. She said she was wasting too much time reading articles on the Safari browser, so she asked for a 90-minute limit there. She also requested that I keep all the limits on until she finished the monthlong summer camp she was just beginning.I happily obliged. \u201cI raised her so well,\u201d I told my editor.As for me, I realized that when I ran into my limit on Twitter, I would find other ways to stay glued to my phone. I caught myself repeatedly checking my bank account and loading the same news sites over and over.Sophie\u2019s progress was remarkable. Mine not so much. By the end of that week, she managed to cut her average phone use to four hours and 44 minutes a day, down 23 percent from the previous week. (I\u2019m sure the trauma from her mother\u2019s outburst of emoji had something to do with it.)My average screen use barely decreased \u2014 to about three and a half hours a day.At the beginning of the third week, phone use continued to steeply decline for Sophie.On some days that week, Sophie\u2019s phone use was lower than mine. On Tuesday afternoon, her screen time dipped to about two and a half hours, whereas mine had already exceeded three hours.At this point, I felt pathetic. (If I were young, I might have said I felt \u201ctriggered.\u201d) I asked myself: What kind of parent am I if I\u2019m more addicted than my teenage daughter to a smartphone? Who would listen to this degenerate?When I shared this revelation with Sophie, she chuckled and replied: \u201cYou use your phone more than me?\u201dSo for the rest of the week, I kept pushing myself to beat her. I logged out of Twitter after each time I used it in the web browser. I stopped checking my bank account, assuring myself that no more money would magically appear.It felt similar to competing with friends on Fitbit to see who could accumulate the most steps \u2014 the only difference here was that I was trying to win by doing less.On Friday, my phone use was one hour and 51 minutes. Sophie\u2019s was three hours and 17 minutes. With a fist pump I exclaimed, \u201cWhat now, Sophie?\u201dYet in the end, my average daily use for the week was three hours and 36 minutes. That\u2019s largely because on the Fourth of July and throughout the weekend I spent a total of eight hours driving \u2014 with Google Maps running on my phone screen. That doesn\u2019t seem as if it should count against my Screen Time since my eyes were mostly on the road.But alas, with Sophie averaging just over three hours a day, I lost fair and square.I checked in with Sophie to ask how she felt after completing the experiment. She said that other than being a bit more focused on homework for her camp, and sleeping with fewer interruptions, she felt about the same.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying having my phone but not being able to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it increases my good habits, though.\u201dShe also made one more request: \u201cCould you add another limit for Netflix?\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m Dai Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco. It\u2019s my turn to write this newsletter, and, as luck would have it, my moment in the sun comes on a light summer news week.The great thing about the summer is that it\u2019s barbecue season. That means lots of casual conversations where I break free from my technology and news bubble and gauge whether the things we write about are reaching a broader audience.This year, more than I can remember in the recent past, it\u2019s clear how ingrained the tech industry has become in our lives and how people are constantly discussing the ripple effects of its influence and money. Tech was central to discussions I had about local and national politics, real estate prices and how to raise children. The company that most people wanted to talk about? Facebook.Last weekend, while I was in Seattle, Facebook was Topic A with a group of non-tech folks. One told me that she had deleted her Facebook account a month ago. I asked if it was because she was upset about the role Facebook played in the 2016 presidential election. It wasn\u2019t really that, she said. Facebook made her feel bad about herself. She found herself being a person she didn\u2019t like when she was scrolling the News Feed, and she decided that she could live without it. She remains on Instagram because she enjoys it.In my limited sample size, the complaints about Facebook were less about misinformation on the platform or the proliferation of ads. They seemed more basic than that: relatives writing distasteful posts about politics or acquaintances oversharing about their personal lives. For the first time, I noticed people were making excuses as to why they were even on Facebook anymore as though it was an embarrassing vice.I\u2019m heading out on vacation soon with the goal of detoxing a little from my tech use. But before I go, I have to order a few last-minute items on Amazon, download kid-friendly shows from Netflix for my iPad, arrange a few social outings with friends on Facebook Messenger and make sure my privacy settings are in order because my family is definitely going to tag me on Facebook in vacation photos.

His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry.The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions?Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences.This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices.One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights \u2014 not unlike splitting AT&T into eight \u201cBaby Bells\u201d nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission\u2019s verdict on Microsoft\u2019s dominant market position in the 2000s.But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants.In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies \u2014 such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence \u2014 to upend existing industries.\u201cOld economy\u201d companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants.Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.Hernan Cristerna is co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase. The bank advised AT&T on its purchase of Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company on its bid for much of 21st Century Fox.Advertisement"}

It reopens Wednesday with a fourth screen, new seating and more. Some of the improvements, like better sightlines, were responses to persistent complaints from moviegoers. Then again, the changes have been a long time coming.Film Forum opened as a haven for independent and documentary filmmakers in 1970 and moved to its current space, on West Houston Street, in 1989. Since then, only the restrooms, concession area and box office have been updated.When patrons responded to a survey in 2016, \u201c\u2018Love the movies, hate the seats\u2019 was the basic message,\u201d Ms. Cooper said.\u201cThat kind of leads into the 800-pound gorilla, which is how much easier it is for audiences to stay home and watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cWe really feel to stay competitive, we have to offer people the best possible experience with both the comfort level and the caliber of film.\u201dFilm Forum has helped put many directors on the map.

I have a feeling Ira treated me to a lot of movies.Their renovations sound wonderful, because, yes, we all know, their seats were a little uncomfortable and the sightlines were not ideal \u2014 but their programing was so impeccable that we went anyway.Advertisement"}

So it\u2019s less about patting myself on the back and being like \u201cLook what I did,\u201d and more about having the proud uncle moment where I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, look at our boys, look what they did.\u201d Chap and Mac are both very young, they\u2019re still in their 20s. It was all about providing the support system. Jay and I never really had that, we just had to figure out how to do everything on our own.What was it like having multiple brothers involved?Is there a specific moment when that familial feeling came up?Watching the first cut of Episode 1, it became very clear to the Brauns and to the Duplasses that the Ways did not really creatively need us anymore. It was that moment you have as a parent where you\u2019re like \u201cI guess our kids are ready to go to college and they\u2019re gonna be fine.\u201dWere you surprised that a documentary series received so much buzz?I didn\u2019t have any idea of the sort of zeitgeistian explosion that would happen. When does a documentary series that is essentially a sociopolitical study of church and state at its core ever become something that \u201cS.N.L.\u201d is making a skit out of?If I\u2019m being pragmatic about it, I feel like \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d were the gateway drugs into great documentary filmmaking. Murder is like candy for audience members. They just love it. Then they were taking these mild left turns into subject matter that they\u2019re familiar with, but isn\u2019t murder-based.What\u2019s the best response you could hope for from someone who watches the series?I think that if someone can deeply identify at times with some of the crazy activities that the members of Rajneeshpuram engaged in, and then at other times engage or at least sympathize with something that could easily be classified as just white xenophobia and fear of the other. [If] they can put themselves in their shoes and see how they could feel that way even though they might not agree \u2014 that\u2019s a really nice thing for our country, at this point.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young Jean Lee\u2019s Unsafe Spaces", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "FeatureThe first female Asian-American playwright on Broadway takes aim at identity and watches the audience squirm.Supported by\u201cLong neck,\u201d the director tells her. \u201cHair,\u201d he says. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d She gets hit again.Finally, the director says, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s stop.\u201d Lee sniffles and asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cO.K.,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201dThis exchange takes place in the dark. A screen suddenly lights up, showing Lee with her face swollen and tear-streaked. \u201cOne more,\u201d she mouths.The slapping scene moves into a psychotic Vaudeville. A chorus of Asian and Asian-American women take the stage, speaking a hodgepodge of Asian languages and rehearsing every ghastly stereotype you can imagine. A character called \u201cKorean-American,\u201d wearing a childish pink shirt with a giraffe on it, smiles, doe-eyed, at the audience and delivers a venomous monologue about growing up with tiger parents: \u201cHave you ever noticed how most Asian-Americans are slightly brain-damaged from having grown up with Asian parents? It\u2019s like being raised by monkeys \u2014 these retarded monkeys who can barely speak English and who are too evil to understand anything besides conformity and status.\u201dA ruffle of laughter often follows the speech \u2014 the audience sounding nervous but reassured, it seems, to encounter familiar moorings in an ocean of strangeness: stock stories of intergenerational immigrant conflict and the self-loathing minority. But then Korean-American flips the script: \u201cThe truth is, if you\u2019re a minority and you do superracist stuff against yourself, then the white people are like, Oh, you\u2019re a \u2018cool minority,\u2019 and they treat you like one of them.\u201dThe twisty, turbulent, argumentative work of Young Jean Lee is full of such traps: Do you get the joke, or are you the joke? Your responses become part of the play, part of what you watch with fascination and dread. Nervous laughter, I suspect, means more to Lee than any ovation.This month, Lee will become the first Asian-American woman to have a play on Broadway when \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d starring Kate Bornstein, Josh Charles, Ty Defoe, Armie Hammer, Stephen Payne and Paul Schneider, and directed by Anna D. Shapiro, opens at the Hayes Theater on July 23. Lee has written plays about identity politics and identity crises in the lives of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, feminists and evangelicals. Here she scrutinizes what she calls the new ethnic group on the scene: straight white men. For so long simply the default humans, they now face all the indignities of life with a label. This production will be the largest audience yet for Lee\u2019s ceremonial purgings of stereotype, her brazenly unsafe spaces.Lee used to love eavesdropping on viewers as they left her plays. A common remark: \u201cWhy would the playwright do this to us?\u201d (The motto of Lee\u2019s production company was \u201cDestroy the Audience.\u201d) But her work is also full of tense pleasures and zany physical comedy. An extended gag in \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d has the Asian characters scuttling around like crabs as they defend the stage from two white actors who keep encroaching on it. \u201cUntitled Feminist Show\u201d is an entirely wordless play in which six naked performers, often holding pink parasols, tumble around for an hour in joyous, goofy splendor. Lee calls it \u201c\u2009\u2018The Lion King\u2019 for older lesbians.\u201dThe rigors Lee demands of her audience, she demands of herself too. I keep returning to that recording of her being struck on the face. At first it seems like pure provocation \u2014 or penance, perhaps, for airing such awful characterizations of her community. It might be both. It might also be a third thing: her cracked way of signaling solidarity with the viewer. She writes, she has said, to root out her own smugness, self-righteousness and stupidity.Her plays will make you flinch, but it\u2019s hard to look away. When the stage lights go on, the dialogue from the recording loops in my mind: \u201cLet\u2019s stop.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d \u201cOne more.\u201dWe talked over blood-red ribbons of tuna and strawberry shortcake and watched the restaurant from our alcove, our hunting blind. Table after table was being occupied by groups of Asians and Asian-Americans. In the corner, an older Asian woman ate alone, with transfixing slowness; in the middle of the room, a South Asian man and his friends took a large table.When yet another group of Asian patrons was led in, Lee put down her fork. \u201cThis is killing me,\u201d she said, delighted. To enter a situation with certain racial or social expectations and have them turned on their heads is the arc of every single play she has ever written.She has emerged as one of the most fearless experimental playwrights of her generation \u2014 \u201cthe queen of unease,\u201d according to The Village Voice; \u201ca troubling, necessary presence\u201d in American theater, Hilton Als wrote in The New Yorker. She refuses to work from previous knowledge, relying instead on intense research and collaboration.With each production, she begins by asking herself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the last play in the world you would ever want to write?\u201d Then she casts actors and builds a play for them and with them, incorporating their feedback. In 2009, for example, she decided the play she was most reluctant and least qualified to write was a \u201cblack identity-politics show\u201d and proceeded accordingly. \u201cThe Shipment\u201d has two parts. The first is a minstrel show in which the five black actors play the roles they said they were used to getting \u2014 drug addict, criminal \u2014 with a kind of Brechtian awkwardness. For the second part, Lee asked them what roles they always wanted to play. One said a bulimic cake decorator, another Hedda Gabler. She wrote a naturalistic play for them \u2014 with a final twist that upends everything we\u2019ve just seen.Lee\u2019s work is about wrongness: about being the wrong kind of man, woman, Asian; about saying the wrong thing; about getting other people wrong. Her characters are ill at ease in their bodies and in the world and, sometimes, in the very play they\u2019re starring in. In \u201cGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals,\u201d her first full-length play (with a title cribbed from Kant), two characters greet each other, sit in awkward silence, admit they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to be doing and walk off the stage.The plays are oddly constructed; perversely off-kilter; gaudily offensive and random. Their strangeness allows Lee to smuggle in questions about race and gender to an audience distracted by the high jinks \u2014 the sudden appearance of Big Bird in her take on \u201cKing Lear,\u201d a group suicide in \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d accompanied by Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d Early on in \u201cThe Shipment,\u201d a black comic delivers a frenetic standup routine about incest, infanticide, bestiality and the cluelessness of white people. The audience is so jolted by the \u201cjokes\u201d that they actually seem to hear the material about racism, which they might have otherwise glossed over or ignored.Lee looked around the restaurant with quick, practiced curiosity. At 44, she is a study in contrasts \u2014 straight-backed, composed, contained. When she listens, she goes stock-still. But in conversation, she is expansive and trusting and, on occasion, thrillingly indiscreet. There\u2019s an amiable relentlessness to her, a constant churn of intellectual energy. Class is the subject of her new play and her fixation at the moment. She followed up on one of our meetings with an email at 11:27 p.m.: \u201cIdentity politics needs to be more intersectional with class, and if it isn\u2019t, it easily becomes yet another tool of capitalism. I hope I\u2019ve made that clear enough!\u201dLee offered to pay for lunch \u2014 with her \u201cBroadway earnings\u201d \u2014 and relented only when I assured her, repeatedly, that I could expense it. We left the restaurant together, passing through Nougatine, the more casual sister restaurant of Jean-Georges. The guests were an older crowd, and as far as I could see, all white \u2014 the very quarry that eluded Lee. I waited for her to notice. When she did, she laughed, tickled. It was like watching someone open a present.The play follows three brothers, played by Josh Charles, Armie Hammer and Paul Schneider. Their mother, now dead, was determined that her sons grow up without a sense of entitlement. She even retrofitted a game of Monopoly to give them an idea of the advantages they were born into. She called it \u201cPrivilege,\u201d and it featured rules like losing money for being white when you passed Go. Of all her sons, Matt (played by Schneider), the oldest and brightest, took her message most to heart. He was his family\u2019s golden boy, who went to Harvard but has chosen to return home to care for his elderly father (Payne) and take a menial job at a community organization.At dinner, Matt suddenly bursts into tears, which sends his father and brothers into a panic. For all their liberal pieties, we see the full measure of the confusion and disgust with which they view his decisions. Matt is accused of martyring himself to minorities. \u201cAll our lives, guys like us have been told to get out of the way so that \u2018other\u2019 people can have a chance. Matt\u2019s actually doing what they want!\u201d his brother Jake, a banker, says. \u201cYou\u2019re making yourself invisible the way you think we\u2019re supposed to!\u201d Matt stays mostly silent as his family\u2019s arguments crest and crash around him. He responds later, in slightly Bartleby fashion, that he is just trying to find a way \u201cto be useful.\u201d\u201cStraight White Men\u201d looks like an Arthur Miller play and acts a bit like an Arthur Miller play, with its conflict between fathers and sons, between desire and obligation, between self and community. But it withholds some of the key satisfactions for which we go to Miller (or much of theater): motive, psychology, resolution.The play is, in fact, so open, so hospitable to interpretations, that every cast and crew member I talked to described a jarringly different production. For Kate Bornstein, the play drives home how all identities are becoming more capacious and can be transgressed: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who genuinely question their own privilege and do something about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are heterosexual white males who are fabulous \u2014 we\u2019ve got four of them in the play. I wouldn\u2019t call them straight white men.\u201d For Armie Hammer, \u201cthis is an inflammatory play. You\u2019re going to have straight white men who go see this and have to be confronted with the reality of their existence.\u201d Paul Schneider had yet another take: \u201cRegardless of race, gender or sexuality, for me all stories boil down to what our parents did or didn\u2019t do to us.\u201d\u201cStraight White Men\u201d was staged in 2014 at the Public Theater to warm reviews \u2014 Charles Isherwood, writing in The Times, called it \u201cmournful and inquisitive.\u201d But Lee worries about its reception today. The play lands in a season when President Trump\u2019s travel ban has just been upheld, immigrant families are being torn apart at the border, reproductive rights are under attack and protections for L.G.B.T.Q. people are being energetically rolled back. The most salient fact about identity politics these days seems less that some straight white men feel diminished by its existence than that the identity politics of some straight white men threaten the existence of so many others.Lee told me she believes that her very decision to write about the plight of middle-aged, upper-middle-class, straight white men \u2014 to \u201ccenter their experiences,\u201d she said \u2014 might be enough to trigger a backlash. Schneider called her one night, wanting to discuss his character, and mentioned that one of his friends, a person of color, had read the play and said it was potentially dangerous. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations, which it clearly already has. But she won\u2019t deny that it feels particularly risky to stage it now, when \u201cthere is something dangerous about not just clearly demarcating the lines of combat, taking a side and fighting on that side.\u201dThe art that seems to speak most to the mood of the moment has that flavor \u2014 of getting in formation, of fighting the power. Take the movie \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d by Boots Riley, the Oakland-based rapper and activist, a science-fiction workplace comedy that\u2019s also a love letter to labor organizing. Or \u201cNanette,\u201d a new Netflix standup special by Hannah Gadsby, a rousing commentary on the #MeToo movement and the price of silence exacted on women and minorities. \u201cThe story is as you have told it \u2014 power belongs to you,\u201d Gadsby says, addressing straight white men. Lee allies herself with these conversations (and Riley is a hero of hers), but she stands slightly apart, asking unpopular questions, like what would really change if power were to simply switch hands. \u201cI don\u2019t hope for a future in which our existing structures stay the same, but I am the one on top,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post about the slogan \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201dHer plays, with their trickster energies, their interest in delicately destabilizing identity, remind me of what the critic Margo Jefferson called James Baldwin\u2019s \u201csyntactical miscegenation\u201d \u2014 the nebulous way he used the words \u201cour\u201d and \u201cyour,\u201d slipping without a signal from addressing his black readers to his white ones, sometimes in the same sentence, mingling them.The \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d in Lee\u2019s plays are always muddled. In \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven,\u201d even the characters\u2019 names continually change. The rudder in her work, and in her thinking, is this aversion to, and constant vigilance against, easy complacencies and groupthink. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d Lee told me more than once. It gave her the language to understand the racism she encountered as a child growing up in small-town Washington State. But its rhetoric has curdled, she feels. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re good or you\u2019re evil; you\u2019re a queer woman of color or you\u2019re some version of entitled privileged person,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like compassion is very out right now. Curiosity is out. What\u2019s in is condemnation and punishment. Now is not the moment for nuance; people do not want it.\u201dPullman was then, as well as now, a small, very white town. When it has made news, it has often been for its racism. Harassment of black students and faculty at the university led to the exit of 17 African-American faculty and staff members in the \u201990s, remembered by some as the \u201cblack exodus.\u201d In more recent years, members of the College Republicans erected a symbolic, Trump-style border wall on campus, and the group\u2019s president marched in last year\u2019s white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.\u201cWhen you talk to the young people now, they can\u2019t conceive the level of racism I experienced,\u201d Lee told me. \u201cI almost wasn\u2019t considered human. I didn\u2019t get to be in that category.\u201d When she was very young, she wasn\u2019t even sure what was behind the hatred: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on. I thought something was really wrong with me.\u201d She rarely discussed it with her parents, but her mother remembered how often Lee was sent home from school with stomachaches.Lee\u2019s relief at leaving Pullman for Berkeley, where she did her undergraduate and graduate studies, was so profound, she wept when she told me about her first day on campus. \u201cThere were so many Asian people, and nobody was making fun of them. My parents came for a visit early on, and they were like, \u2018Oh, my God, people are just eating rice on the street \u2014 there\u2019s no shame.\u2019 We used to hide that we ate rice.\u201d A boy talked to her, which had never happened before, and Lee ended up going on a date with him that night, her first, so stunned was she by the attention. She thrived in the embrace of a community but began to be troubled by certain tendencies. She had never taken to her parents\u2019 Christian faith \u2014 she started questioning it around age 7 \u2014 but she was discomfited by how Christians were summarily disparaged on campus and how easily she joined in. This kind of casual contempt for a group of people reminded her of her treatment at the hands of her classmates in Pullman. Lee\u2019s wariness of the crowd seems to have started there, a way of ensuring she would never become what she once feared.She majored in English and began a dissertation on \u201cKing Lear.\u201d She was attracted to \u201cLear\u201d for its wildness. The 17th-century source text is a taut piece of theater \u2014 beautifully plotted, something you\u2019d see on Broadway today, she told me. But Shakespeare stuffed it with insanity: \u201cHe loved crazy people, he loved fools. He could basically be an experimental playwright.\u201d She married a fellow student, a history Ph.D. But she was increasingly unhappy. Reverting back to childhood consolations, she bought herself a huge dollhouse with handcrafted furniture from Germany. A therapist asked her what she wanted to do, and she blurted out, to her surprise, \u201cBe a playwright.\u201d She discovered that she was studying Shakespeare only because she secretly wanted to write plays herself. \u201cIt was like being a veterinarian who says, \u2018I want to be a dog!\u2019\u2009\u201dHer husband dropped out of his Ph.D. program to go to law school at Yale. Lee followed him to New Haven and read through the work of all the playwrights on the faculty of the Yale School of Drama. One appealed to her the most: Jeffrey M. Jones, a scabrous and very funny experimentalist. She emailed him and asked him how to get started. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard life,\u201d she remembers him telling her. \u201cIf you can do anything else, do that.\u201d But she persisted, and he told her to call Mac Wellman.Since 1998, Wellman has run an M.F.A. program at Brooklyn College that has produced some of American theater\u2019s most innovative playwrights, including Thomas Bradshaw and Annie Baker. He loathes what he calls \u201cthe theater of the already known,\u201d and in the custom curriculum he prepares for each student, he dispenses gnomic advice: Write plays with your nondominant hand; write plays \u201ccovered with fur\u201d; insert, whenever possible, a farting dwarf.\u201cI listened to her on the phone,\u201d Wellman told me. \u201cHer voice was so intense, I thought, I\u2019m going to let her in. I don\u2019t even need to read anything.\u201d Lee separated from her husband and moved to New York (they eventually divorced). She floundered at first. She hadn\u2019t written much, and she was, Wellman recalled, paralyzed by self-criticism. \u201cWrite the worst possible play you can,\u201d he told her. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a parody. Just something really awful.\u201dThat play became \u201cThe Appeal\u201d (2004), a sendup of the romantic poets, whom Lee had always loathed. \u201cIt was such a pretentious, horrible idea for a play,\u201d she has said. \u201cIt was like a kid playing really sadistically with Barbie dolls. You stick their heads in the toilet, you throw them out the window. The characters were really annoying, and I wrote as badly as I could. When I got bored, I\u2019d restart the scene in the middle without throwing anything away, like a video-game reset.\u201d Wellman showed the play to the head of the Soho Repertory, who decided to stage it \u2014 and asked Lee to direct. She turned out to be a \u201cgenius director,\u201d Wellman said: She had a preternatural understanding of the stage, how to use it, how to talk to actors.In 2003, not yet 30, Lee formed her own theater company. Hwang, the head of the Columbia University M.F.A. program in playwriting, told me that young artists look to Lee \u201cas a kind of model not only aesthetically \u2014 in terms of being able to take risks and play with form \u2014 but also in terms of self-production and the amount of control she\u2019s had over her own work.\u201d In interviews, Lee has identified as a straight white man herself, only slightly tongue-in-cheek. She can echo her own lines from \u201cSongs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m ambitious and want power. ... People think of me as this empowered Asian female, but really, I\u2019m just a [expletive] white guy.\u201dFacebook is \u201ca huge part\u201d of her process, she said, a kind of crowdsourced dramaturgy. She runs lines by her friends, finds readers for scripts, does a little needling. Lately, as she works on her new play on class, her posts have sounded like this: \u201cWho are my Facebook friends who identify as Marxist, Socialist and/or Communist? I\u2019m always a little confused when people identify that way, especially if they are middle to upper class and involved with elite institutions. Does it mean you wish someone would take a bunch of your money away and redistribute it? That you are actively involved in organizing solidarity strikes? Is there any praxis required, or is it a label for an intellectual position? Not trying to be snarky, just trying to figure out if I\u2019m a Marxist or not.\u201dLee\u2019s usual process of teaming up with actors on scriptwriting didn\u2019t work with \u201cStraight White Men.\u201d In previous plays \u2014 on gender, Asian-American and black identity \u2014 the actors gave her more material than she could possibly use. \u201cYou would come to rehearsal and open the floodgates,\u201d she told me. But her straight white male actors were more reserved. \u201cThese men have not spent their entire lives experiencing their own identities; they don\u2019t have a lot of material. A lot of them said, \u2018I don\u2019t really identify as a straight white man because when I think of a straight white man, I think of a jock.\u2019\u2009\u201dWhile writing the play in 2014, Lee ended up interviewing dozens of straight white men and relying on a workshop of diverse college students. She asked them to vent about straight white men \u2014 and then asked them how they would like straight white men to behave. \u201cEveryone at the workshop was like: \u2018I want a straight white man to sit down and shut up. I want him to take a back seat, to take a supporting role. I don\u2019t want him to be aggressive,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018I want him to listen. I don\u2019t want him taking the head role or the biggest job or to be going after the biggest stuff. I want him in a supporting role to me.\u2019\u2009\u201dBut when she created a character according to these specifications, she was shocked to find that the workshop participants hated him. \u201cI realized that the reason they hated him was \u2014 despite all their commitment to social justice \u2014 what they believed in most was not being a loser.\u201dThat word \u2014 \u201closer\u201d \u2014 crops up a lot in Lee\u2019s work. From \u201cPullman, WA,\u201d set in her hometown, featuring three characters desperately trying to give a self-help seminar: \u201cYou are a loser,\u201d one says. \u201cYou\u2019re a loser because you were born that way. You will never be anything other than what you are.\u201d In \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d the brothers use it to goad Matt into action. (Jake: \u201cYou\u2019re just ... giving in to the total hopelessness of everything, being a loser for no reason?\u201d) Jake impatiently tries to school Matt to compete in the world, to master a job interview. The lesson is tantamount to a tutorial in straight white male drag. To earn the trust of other straight white men, Jake says, you must flawlessly pass as one: command space, do not shrink your body, keep your voice low and even, appear always at ease and, above all, conceal weakness.\u201cLoser\u201d is a word from childhood, of the blunt social distinctions of the playground. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite taunt. There\u2019s a particular, almost gendered sting to it \u2014 the way it frames the failure and suffering of men as shameful.Lee has always been interested in exposing how we perform our identities. But in \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d she drills into something more core. Shuck off, subvert, cleave to your gender or race all you like, but a universal horror of weakness remains \u2014 a collective orientation toward status, power, control.\u201cYou have to meet Chris,\u201d Hammer said to Lee. The crowd parted for him; he took Lee over to Chris Rock and promptly appeared to forget about her. He, Riley and Rock began talking animatedly, lovingly yelling into one another\u2019s faces. One of Hammer\u2019s assistants materialized at his elbow, wordlessly put a beer into his hand and vanished. Hammer took a sip from the bottle without seeming to wonder how it got there. Lee kept waiting, hands clasped. But the longer the three men talked, the closer they moved together, blotting out the room, a calyx of celebrity and mutual regard.Lee told me then about the dollhouse from Germany she bought herself while in her Ph.D. program as a reward for a dissertation she would never complete. But she couldn't play with it anymore: \u201cI was too old.\u201d She kept it, though. And even though it was late, and she looked tired and ready to be rid of me, she invited me up to see it.Lee lives with her boyfriend, a reality-television showrunner who is working on a program about people who have been attacked by wild animals. He was not home. Their place had the feel of an airport hotel, cramped and impersonal with only functional necessities: a chair here, a table there. I liked it immensely. It was clearly occupied by people who made things, who slept here but really lived in their minds.Lee pointed out the dollhouse to me, although she didn\u2019t need to. Wedged between the couch and a desk, it eats up a huge amount of space in the living room \u2014 hulking, honey-colored, reaching my shoulder. It has a working elevator.She gestured at it, perplexed. \u201cIt\u2019s this thing I\u2019m hanging onto that I don\u2019t want.\u201d She told me I could play with it, if I wanted to, and sat down at her computer.I knelt and started to play. The facade lifted clean off. It was cobwebby inside, a bit of a crime scene. A doll lay face down on the floor next to the bed. The chairs were toppled, dishes scattered. I restored the candlestick to the mantel and wiped a film of dust off the dining table.What did you play? I asked. There were only two real narrative strands, she told me. Order and disorder. One doll would go crazy \u2014 turn \u201ctoxic\u201d \u2014 and destroy the house. The others would be distraught. Then Lee would set it to rights, putting everything back in its place. The fun, she said, was in being able to corral the disorder. The fun was in putting the people where they should go.Parul Sehgal is a book critic for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Already at Movie Theaters Near You: Ticket Subscriptions", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe really like the subscription model,\u201d said Tim League, chief executive of Alamo Drafthouse, which operates in 10 states. \u201cBut we want to get it right. It\u2019s important to us to build a model that is sustainable for the long term.\u201dHere is a look at prominent movie ticket subscription offers:Still the dominant service, despite mounting questions about whether it can survive. It had more than three million paying members as of June 13. MoviePass executives aggressively insist that the company is viable and say membership could swell to roughly 5 million by January. On Monday, Helios and Matheson said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it hoped to raise $1.2 billion over three years to fund growth.Under the MoviePass model theaters are paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that works like a debit card. When members want to see a movie (no more than one a day), they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry.And it all works independently of theaters.The MoviePass system functions in 91 percent of theaters, including the more than 8,200 movie screens operated by AMC in the United States. But it\u2019s clunky. While the new AMC subscription service may have an unwieldy name, it works without a special debit card and, unlike MoviePass, also allows all subscribers to reserve seats online.The AMC version also includes access to Imax and other large-format theaters for no extra fee and allows members to see more than one movie a day.Mark Zoradi, Cinemark\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call in May that Movie Club had 230,000 members. He said initial results indicated that subscriptions appealed \u201cto the masses rather than just the most frequent value-seeking consumers.\u201d (MoviePass has described Movie Club as \u201cvapid.\u201d)\u201cWe won\u2019t really know until the actual testing begins, but we\u2019re ready to get rolling,\u201d Mr. League, the chief executive of Alamo Drafthouse, said, adding that he sees subscription plans as one way for smaller films to thrive. \u201cFor films that people may not know a lot about, subscription lowers the barrier of entry \u2014 sure, why not check this out.\u201dStarted in 2015 in Turkey, this under-the-radar service bears the most similarity to MoviePass.Unlike MoviePass, however, Sinemia offers tiered pricing. For $16 a month, \u201celite\u201d subscribers receive three tickets a month. \u201cClassic\u201d subscribers receive one ticket a month for $5. (Sinemia subscriptions are sold annually, so that elite package will be billed at about $192.) Sinemia on Friday began offering various family plans, including one that allows a family of five to go to the movies three times a month for $75.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s the kind of \u201csnapping\u201d \u2014 a raw form of comedic trash talk that he grew up with in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York \u2014 that he has known, used and laced with curse words to become a breakout radio and podcast guest in recent years for the likes of Howard Stern and Bill Simmons.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I say anything?\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows me; she doesn\u2019t know you. I\u2019m a fan.\u201dDanielle Belton, The Root\u2019s editor in chief, said that the adversarial relationship between the site and Rapaport isn\u2019t about him but about what he says and stands for.\u201cWhen he talks about race, he seems to be shortsighted and not empathetic to the plight of African-Americans,\u201d she said, adding that she thinks he\u2019s trying to get attention through lewd and sexist comments. \u201cIf we stopped writing about him, I think he\u2019d be offended, because he needs something to complain about.\u201dIn the saturated field of sports podcasting, Rapaport, 48, has orchestrated something of an unexpected success with \u201cI Am Rapaport,\u201d a show built on unfiltered emotional responses and a \u201cno fact-checking\u201d mantra in pursuit of the best sports and culture trash talk on the internet. Ranked as one of the top sports and recreation podcasts by Podbay, the four-year-old show is averaging one and a half million to two million monthly downloads across multiple platforms, according to the show\u2019s producers.\u201cWhen you have somebody who feels that comfortable and says what he feels,\u201d Parker said of Rapaport, \u201cit allows you to open up and say what you feel. In this generation, people know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not \u2014 and he\u2019s been real for a while.\u201dToday, there\u2019s a good chance that a solid chunk of the show\u2019s audience knows Rapaport more for his insight on the greatness of Kevin Durant and the shortcomings of his beloved Knicks, or how he verbally spars with Moore from \u201cReal Housewives,\u201d than for his work in more than 60 films or his current role on the Netflix show \u201cAtypical.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s art, and it\u2019s a performance,\u201d Rapaport said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to polish myself or make myself look smarter than what I am. I want you to hear the genuine truth of what I think or feel, whether I\u2019m incorrect or correct.\u201dIt\u2019s a career transition Rapaport is comfortable with after his guest spots on other people\u2019s shows made him realize there might be a market for his intense, hourlong conversations with his friend Gerald Moody, which regularly leave him exhausted and with a hacking cough.Bill Burr, a comedian, knows Rapaport\u2019s brand of chatter all too well.\u201cThis is a guy who loves his teams and knows the game,\u201d said Burr, the host of \u201cMonday Morning Podcast\u201d and a noted Boston sports fan. But, he continued, \u201cthere\u2019s also this part where you\u2019re laughing at him because a lot of times his passion and desire for his teams to win\u201d make him say crazy things that make no sense.\u201cWhen I watch him go off on LeBron James, I\u2019m like, he\u2019s 6-foot-8 and if he wanted to, he could find you,\u201d Burr added. \u201cHe talks about guys like LeBron the way he talks about me, and I\u2019m barely 5-foot-10 and not built like an Adonis.\u201dBy the time Rapaport\u2019s podcast launched in August 2014, its producers, Miles Davis and Jordan Winter, said they knew there was a chance for him to convert his runs on radio shows and podcasts into something different from the work of other sports personalities.\u201cWe knew right away Michael had that energy and that kind of polarizing personality, and that he was going to be the perfect person to start this with,\u201d Davis said.Winter added, \u201cHe\u2019s been around for 25 years and everyone knows him for something different, but you know he\u2019s Michael Rapaport.\u201d\u201cMy mother always says, \u2018This is just the way you are,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI think certain kids come out with certain energies, and I had that. My parents were very patient and probably let me get away with too much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t take anything back, but I want to mend the fence with him,\u201d Rapaport said. (The Ringer declined to comment.)In February, Rapaport had his most acrimonious beef yet, with Barstool Sports, his former employer, and its president, Dave Portnoy.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to work with somebody who doesn\u2019t seem to be a rational human being,\u201d Portnoy said.Rapaport and his podcast\u2019s staff explained in a February episode \u2014 after he was fired \u2014 that although he was hesitant to partner with Barstool because of outcries that the site was openly misogynistic, teaming up still made sense considering Barstool\u2019s financial stability.The split from Barstool provided, if nothing else, more fodder for Rapaport\u2019s podcast. At the show\u2019s core is the 36-year bond between Rapaport and Moody, his co-host, that started when they were 13 on the basketball courts at the Madison Square Boys & Girls Club.\u201cPeople who are New Yorkers hit me up from around the world to say that the show is so New York that it transports them back home to where they\u2019re talking on a stoop with their friends,\u201d said Moody, 49, who is also a landlord in the Bronx. \u201cWe bring New York to you.\u201dRapaport can only laugh at the attention he has gotten during the early part of this career transition, knowing he may be stepping on toes but not necessarily caring about the blowback. \u201cThe messiness you see around me in the sports world comes from people getting jealous, wondering, \u2018What is this actor doing?\u2019 \u201d Rapaport said. \u201cIt is what it is. I don\u2019t back down.\u201dBut for all the grief he has given James over the years, Rapaport admits that the new Los Angeles Laker \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s got voodoo going!\u201d Rapaport said \u2014 is the one person who has been able to shut him up recently, with a string of dominant performances last season for the Cleveland Cavaliers.Don\u2019t expect him to shut up for long.\u201cMy mouth gets me in trouble, and it\u2019s a comfort zone, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to stirring the pot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Netflix Experiment Gives Deserving Comics Their 15 Minutes", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedySo many stand-up specials are released these days that it\u2019s easy to miss how radically the art form has evolved.Part of the reason Ali Wong\u2019s \u201cHard Knock Wife\u201d and Hannah Gadsby\u2019s \u201cNanette\u201d have made such an impact is that they were thematically and structurally coherent, their jokes integrated into the special the way scenes fit into the plot of a play. The status and ambition of the specials\u2019 directors have also grown, shifting from craftsmen for hire to stylists to the auteur Bo Burnham, whose distinctive work with Jerrod Carmichael and Chris Rock reveals editing and camerawork in dialogue with setups and punch lines.Yet what makes \u201cThe Comedy Lineup\u201d an exciting addition is not the length of the specials, but Netflix\u2019s attempt to give a platform to comics who are not household names. One of the open secrets of live stand-up is that the most famous names are rarely the funniest ones on the bill. They don\u2019t have the time or often the hustle to really hone sets. Of course, novices are too green to be the funniest either. \u201cThe Comedy Lineup\u201d provides a delightful sampler of the performers in between.These eight specials are more topical than most of the recent Netflix hours, with three other comics (Jak Knight, Sam Jay and Sabrina Jalees) mixing in #MeToo material with solid sets. Seeing the same subject matter covered makes you realize how common parallel thinking is in stand-up. Both Ms. Buteau and Mr. Knight use the phrase \u201cread the room\u201d (although she adds a curse to it).Ms. Jay, a sly writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with a propulsive delivery, ties the sexual harassment stories and the rise of Donald J. Trump to a larger trend: the decline of white men. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to handle white guys needing something,\u201d she says, pointing to the stunts of \u201cJackass\u201d as an early sign: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a show. That was white dudes crying for help.\u201dUnlike late-night television sets, 15 minutes is long enough to get into an involved argument or complex bit but short enough that every joke counts. This puts a premium on the start and end of the set, and two of the highlights are satires of a certain hackneyed genre of opening and closing jokes that poke fun at convention while also subverting it.Young comedians\u2019 most common opening move is to poke fun at the way they look. You can find a classic example in \u201cThe Comedy Lineup\u201d by Taylor Tomlinson when she acknowledges how wholesome she appears, describing herself as cute but in an accessible way, \u201clike a shower curtain in Target.\u201d Before you pigeonhole her, she does it for you: \u201cMen don\u2019t even picture me naked,\u201d she says. \u201cThey picture me helping their mom on Easter.\u201dThis is a funny but not a terribly original introduction. (The first joke I ever heard Amy Schumer tell was at the Gotham Comedy Club in 2011: \u201cI know how I look. You\u2019d bang me, but you wouldn\u2019t blog about it.\u201d)In a bolder set, the British-Malaysian comic Phil Wang draws attention to this clich\u00e9 style of joke, before adding a sideways twist that hints at how this entire genre caters to stereotypes. \u201cIf you look at me, right, and squint really hard,\u201d he says, swiveling his head and shifting his tone: \u201cThat\u2019s racist.\u201dThis joke provides a nice bookend to an inventively funny closer by Ian Karmel, a commanding comic who came out of the Portland, Ore., scene. Toward the end of his accomplished set, he says that the \u201csocial contract\u201d of stand-up requires that you end with a big joke, preferably one that calls back to an earlier bit. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen, right?\u201d he says. \u201cNot tonight.\u201dAfter adding that doing something weird can be more memorable, he proves it. I won\u2019t give it away, even though what makes this joke work is less the concept than the execution. It\u2019s a deft performance that is a reminder that comedy, like all art, cannot be boiled down to a formula.Many in comedy today think that too many specials are being released, that comics are not spending enough time developing their art and that a deluge of mediocre stand-up will water down quality. While these are real concerns, I\u2019m not convinced.For some of the stars of \u201cThe Comedy Line-Up,\u201d I would like to see longer performances, but not necessarily right now. It takes time to develop an hour of excellent material that fits together, and amid the glut of specials now, too many feel padded. The solution may not be decreasing the number of specials, but rather how long each one is. For many, 15 minutes is a good alternative. It\u2019s enough time to pique your interest in a performer, but not enough for them to really wear out their welcome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make This the Summer of Missing Out", "Date": "2018-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-CareYou could say I had the epiphany when, in the middle of a flight to Los Angeles \u2014 and a busy New York workday \u2014 the Wi-Fi stopped working. Two very odd things happened in quick succession. First: I did not fall out of the sky. Second: After recovering from the initial fury-implosion, I worked more intently and productively than I had in ages. What was this strange, unburdened feeling, I wondered, as I stepped off the plane hours later? Turns out the internet had a word for it already: JOMO.It\u2019s a lot like that age-old wisdom about being present \u2014 only retrofitted for a world in which missing an email could be a fireable offense, and deleting Bumble could mean you don\u2019t go on a date for another three months. Like it or not, we need our technology devices; we just don\u2019t need them as much as we think we do. JOMO is about finding that balance. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about setting boundaries,\u201d said Cara Wenig, 30, a sales rep and JOMO practitioner. \u201cIn my work, it is really important to respond quickly and to be on top of things so it\u2019s not as if I can completely unplug. But I can be more mindful about it.\u201d Given JOMO\u2019s Luddite bent, it\u2019s (perhaps) surprising that the tech industry has recently come on board. This spring, Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, took the stage at the company\u2019s annual developer conference with the words \u201cJoy of Missing Out\u201d projected behind him. Apple announced, soon after, its own stab at digital health: a \u201cScreen Time\u201d dashboard, which gives you a peek into your digital use, and enhanced \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d functions.\u201cWe see time and time again that the constant distraction is making people feel very unhappy,\u201d said Ashley Whillans, a behavior scientist, who has been studying the relationship between happiness, time and money. All of which means missing out can be a good thing. But how best to do it?If you\u2019re wondering whether you may also be engaging in unhealthy tech habits, here\u2019s a helpful pop quiz:Do you own a smartphone?That\u2019s it. Because if you answered yes, you\u2019re essentially carrying around what the Center for Humane Technology, an organization working to spur reform in the tech and media industries, calls a \u201cslot machine\u201d in your pocket. Play it enough times, and you\u2019re bound to get hooked. This isn\u2019t an accident. This is big business.\u201cTech companies have spent the last 10, 20 years building internet and mobile products that are addictive on purpose,\u201d said Dan Frommer, the editor in chief of Recode. \u201cThere is a threshold where utility becomes addiction, and I think it\u2019s safe to say a lot of the most popular products today have taken it too far.\u201dToday, many of us are mindful about what we put into our bodies because we know how certain foods make us feel: Gluten may make one sluggish, say, while sugar can worsen anxiety. But what about when it comes to our minds? Imagine what that extra hour of mindless scrolling is doing to it. Don\u2019t think of JOMO as a detox, but more like an integral part to a healthy, well-balanced nutrition plan for your brain. You may not always want to do it, it may not always feel natural or fun, but, like that kale smoothie you choke down or the probiotics you spring for at Whole Foods, you do it because it\u2019s good for you.Begin to cultivate the expectation that you may take a while to respond to text messages and emails. If you feel undue pressure from family and friends, you can let them know ahead of time that you may not always be available. Google\u2019s \u201cdirector o\u2019 design\u201d (his real title), Glen Murphy, said one of the most surprising realizations he took out of his digital well-being research was how much \u201csocial factors\u201d played a role in determining \u201cexpectations of responsiveness.\u201d Certain people like to respond to things right away, while others take their time. The problem is, friends and colleagues may have certain expectations no matter which camp you\u2019re in. If you don\u2019t respond quickly, they freak out. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \u201cI think we all have the friend or the boss that takes days to respond to an email,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWe can all strive to have that freedom.\u201dNext time you find yourself about to binge-watch that next series on Netflix, remind yourself what you could be doing instead, like catching up with a friend on the phone, or simply getting more sleep. Of course, the last episode of say, \u201cThe Staircase,\u201d may win out \u2014 but at least you\u2019ll be choosing it with intention.Ms. Whillans\u2019s research suggests that we\u2019re pretty bad at recognizing the opportunity cost that comes with spending money, and even worse at seeing the opportunity cost when it comes to time. \u201cWe don\u2019t spontaneously recognize all the things we\u2019re not getting by saying yes to something,\u201d Ms. Whillans said.

{"Headline": "Labor and Technology Reporting: Two Concentric Circles", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI moved from Washington to Chicago in 2016 because I thought it would improve my reporting on workers. I joked to bewildered colleagues and sources that covering labor from Washington was a bit like covering technology from Washington: By the time the political class gets wind of a story, it\u2019s been percolating in the economy for years.In May, I was at Bombfell, a fashion start-up in New York, getting styled by Will Noguchi, who selects clothing for customers. Mr. Noguchi and his algorithms immediately pegged me for what I am \u2014 a schlub with deeply conservative fashion sensibilities \u2014 and gently eased me toward the 21st-century part of my comfort zone. (\u201cSo this is definitely one that I would go with the algorithm here,\u201d he said, pointing to a johnnie-O T-shirt that the software had recommended.)Still, in my more than three years on the beat, I\u2019ve found that a lot of what we think of as shiny and new has familiar roots.There\u2019s perhaps no better example than the so-called gig economy, in which workers perform tasks on demand \u2014 not just ferrying around people and food, but also assembling furniture, tagging photos, rewriting blog content \u2014 and generally get paid by the task, or for a few hours at a time, rather than earn a steady wage. Admirers hail it as a job market in which workers are, finally, in control of their own destinies. But the gig economy can also be thought of as an elaborate way around an age-old problem: how to control workers without the expense of making them employees \u2014 and without breaking the law.In 2013, about two years after it started, an on-demand food preparation and delivery service called Munchery converted its drivers from contractors to employees. While the move cost about 20 to 30 percent more upfront, the benefits of being able to summon forth enough drivers during periods of high demand made it a better deal for the company in the end. (So did the lower turnover and increased quality control.)The essential facts of the gig economy, though, can be hard to see through the hype that often clouds tech reporting.When I stepped off the elevator into Lyft\u2019s headquarters in the fall of 2016, the techno music was throbbing. There were vast concrete floors and some de rigueur ductwork, and the lobby was painted in striking shades of pink and purple, the company\u2019s signature colors. That was where I had to sign in.As it happened, \u201csigning in\u201d meant entering information on a tablet screen that gradually morphed into a nondisclosure agreement, a fixture of office visits across the Bay Area in recent years. I precipitated a minor uproar by refusing to sign but was eventually waved in nonetheless. (Lyft says it doesn\u2019t require reporters to sign; my Times colleagues don\u2019t sign either.)You can see how this might be subtly corrupting. You begin to think: If they want me to sign a nondisclosure agreement, there must be something transcendent going on here. (Only later do you suspect it\u2019s as much a status symbol as a security precaution \u2014 the Silicon Valley equivalent of a line outside a club.)\u201cImagine Mr. Burns sitting across the table,\u201d one of the doctors, Rajeev Alexander, told me, comparing the experience to negotiating with the notorious \u201cSimpsons\u201d character.\u201cIt was the absolute right thing \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t be here today\u201d without unionizing, Brittany Ellison, one of the doctors, told me at the time.These were highly paid professionals almost universally esteemed in the eyes of the public. And yet they still felt as powerless as people at the other end of the economic spectrum. \u201cWe were trained to be leaders,\u201d Ms. Ellison said. \u201cBut they treat us like assembly line workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Castle Rock\u2019 Is a Stephen King Story That Isn\u2019t Really a Stephen King Story", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCastle RockDEVENS, Mass. \u2014 Deep inside Shawshank prison, a man sits in a cage in the dark. Another man enters and turns on a lamp. They talk wearily of vague obligations and cryptic connections, the air thick with tension. Then the light goes out \u2026\u2026 And that\u2019s about all I can say, because more would be a spoiler, and to be honest, I\u2019m not sure what exactly was happening. But if the details sound like something out of a Stephen King story \u2014 an intriguing encounter drenched in mystery and menace, unfolding in one of the author\u2019s best-known settings \u2014 that\u2019s because they are. Except they\u2019re not.Confused? Welcome to \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d where even the people making the show don\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on. \u201cThe crew gets the scripts at the same time we do, and they\u2019re like \u2018What does this all mean?\u2019 \u201d said Bill Skarsgard, one of the show\u2019s stars.Here\u2019s what we do know: \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d which debuts Wednesday on Hulu, is a 10-episode series executive produced by J.J. Abrams and based on \u201ccharacters and locations\u201d from Stephen King. It tells an original story about a death row attorney, played by Andr\u00e9 Holland (\u201cMoonlight\u201d), who is drawn back to his hometown when a young man, played by Mr. Skarsgard, is discovered in that cage inside Shawshank. (Not so fast: The scene I saw comes later in the season.)\u201cI always loved the idea that this one town was the unluckiest tract of earth on the planet,\u201d said Sam Shaw, who created the show with Dustin Thomason.Long before the Marvel and DC cinematic universes, \u201cStephen King was doing this in the pages of his books,\u201d Mr. Thomason said.\u201cI loved the perpetual possibilities of what you might find for fans of King behind any door, who someone might be, who they might be related to, what they might have been involved in,\u201d he said.\u201cVirtually anything in the Stephen King multiverse is gospel,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.The author, credited as an executive producer, gave his blessing to the concept, reviewed scripts and occasionally sent ideas, but otherwise \u201cleft us essentially to our own devices,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. (Mr. King declined to comment.)Mr. Abrams added, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to just have him as kind of the consigliere of what should or shouldn\u2019t happen in Castle Rock.\u201dOrange, Mass., located just over 40 miles west of the studio in Devens, stood in for the titular town, a down-at-the-heels place in the shadow of its main employer, Shawshank State Penitentiary. The story begins in earnest when Mr. Skarsgard\u2019s nameless, nearly mute character, known as the Kid, is discovered in a neglected wing of the prison. When he chooses Mr. Holland\u2019s Henry Deaver as his attorney, Henry is drawn back to a hometown that long ago \u201cdecided this young black boy is a pariah,\u201d Mr. Holland said, blaming him for a past event that led to the death of his (white) father. Like nearly everything else in the show, the event is shrouded in mystery, another thing for Henry to sort out along with who \u2014 or what \u2014 his new client even is.Folded into a couch in his dressing room, Mr. Skarsgard laughed when I told him I couldn\u2019t make heads or tales of the scene I\u2019d watched earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a key to the whole thing,\u201d he said.His lanky but muscular frame was leaner than usual. He lost 30 pounds to play the Kid, his high, sharp cheekbones and expansive eyes giving the character the air of a ghostly praying mantis. The actor\u2019s unique physicality is part of what made him so chilling as Pennywise, perhaps the greatest King villain.After \u201cIt,\u201d the actor was initially reluctant to get involved with \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d fearing it might be \u201c \u2018The Avengers\u2019 of Stephen King characters.\u201d The scripts convinced him otherwise, but he wasn\u2019t entirely wrong: One of the biggest rewards for longtime King fans is seeing Ms. Spacek back in his world.\u201cI adore Stephen King,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we\u2019re both probably indebted to each other for the experience that we had with \u2018Carrie.\u2019 \u201dThe actress, last seen on TV in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline,\u201d plays Henry\u2019s dementia-suffering mother, Ruth. She was \u201cpulled in\u201d by the challenge of portraying \u201ca horror within the horror,\u201d she said.\u201cWhich is more horrible?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming from the outside, the Stephen King kind of horror? Or what\u2019s happening in your head?\u201dSuch real-world fears were designed to ground the supernatural elements within a more relatable tale. Part of the reason Shawshank is such a terrible place is thanks to profit motives resulting from the privatization of prisons. And whatever his reputation in town lore, the scorn showed Henry by the mostly white Castle Rock carries unmistakable racial overtones. \u201cA black man or a black boy being told who he is and what his place is in the world, or in society \u2014 I really connected with that, that desire to push back against it,\u201d Mr. Holland said.\u201cPart of the idea is to imagine what life was like in the most terrorized town in America right now, in a moment of terror with a national identity crisis we\u2019re grappling with,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s an opportunity to tell a genre story at moment when there\u2019s a great renaissance of storytelling on TV.\u201dHulu is not concerned about such precedents, said Craig Erwich, the head of original programming. But to be safe, it\u2019s making the first three episodes available on Wednesday before doling out one a week for the rest of the season.\u201cWe want to give people enough so that they\u2019re not just checking it out, they\u2019re getting hooked on it,\u201d Mr. Erwich said.Despite the delights it offers King devotees, \u201cCastle Rock\u201d will only succeed if it resonates with neophytes as well as superfans. The references and Easter eggs are designed to add layers of enjoyment and meaning for the author\u2019s disciples, Mr. Thomason said, but the story was conceived to stand on its own.Of course, there\u2019s one viewer whose opinion carries extra weight. While Mr. King gave the showrunners plenty of leeway to \u201cexpand and create new connections among\u201d his stories, Mr. Thomason said, they couldn\u2019t help being nervous about his impressions of what they made from his life\u2019s work. So it was gratifying when he not only praised the first episode, but admitted to a moment of genuine fright.\u201cHe said he had his first \u2018Don\u2019t go down there!\u2019 reaction in about 15 years,\u201d Mr. Thomason said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most you could possibly hope for from a guy who\u2019s had all of us saying \u2018Don\u2019t go down there!\u2019 forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u2019 and the Bliss of the Hyper-Human Tom Cruise", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s a whole lot of everything in the \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout,\u201d an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger. As usual, he works hard for our dollars and eyeballs in a movie that spins the oldies (a blonde with a knife in her garter) while pushing to greater spectacle-cinema extremes.Once again, Mr. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, who leads a crypto government unit called Impossible Missions Force that is as preposterous, politically dubious and near-magical as it was in the mid-1960s when the TV show first hit, latex masks and all. More than a half-century later, this impossible team\u2019s leader is still receiving operational details via a self-destructing recording (should he choose to accept) and leaping unto the breach with his second bananas. Their numbers have shrunk over time, so now it\u2019s a lonely guys\u2019 club that includes the gruff Luther (Ving Rhames), who\u2019s some kind of tech guy, and the rabbity Benji (Simon Pegg), another tech guy with more, faster patter.This is the sixth installment in this long-running series, and while I\u2019ve seen all the movies at least once, the only entry that left a lasting visual imprint on me is the 1996 kickoff directed by Brian De Palma. That one of course features the series-defining image of Mr. Cruise suspended just inches above the floor. Since then, directors have come and gone, but only the latest, Christopher McQuarrie, has returned for repeat duty. Mr. Cruise\u2019s affable, relaxed performance here suggests why. Mr. McQuarrie understands that the looser his star, often the looser (and better) the performance. \u201cFallout\u201d has plenty of serious interludes, but its overall tone is borderline breezy, with bullets.It\u2019s both, in a way, but like an Astaire and Rogers number it\u2019s simply flirty. Much of the fight involves the display of beautiful male bodies, which is punctuated by Ethan\u2019s obvious exasperation having to partner with the younger, taller, bigger Walker. But Mr. McQuarrie also plays with the location using some winking staging in a men\u2019s stall that introduces levity amid the blows. He\u2019s teasing us with the location \u2014 we\u2019re the ones being flirted with \u2014 and by extension rumors about Mr. Cruise\u2019s sexuality. The setup doesn\u2019t fully work and could be read as an example of gay panic rather than a swat at it. But it shrewdly frames Mr. Cruise as being as self-aware as he is famously controlling.Amid rapidly shifting tones \u2014 from slapstick light to grimly dire \u2014 the bathroom is soon demolished and its white surfaces predictably redecorated with a bold red accent. The fighting throughout the scene is meaty, intimate and increasingly, intensely visceral as the men grapple and grunt while they slam to the ground and against, and through, walls. (The stunt coordinator is Wade Eastwood.) The struggling can be unnerving; you wince at some of the more intense wallops and the fatal stakes they portend. Of course it\u2019s also satisfying because each smackdown is followed by a resurrection, a shaky rise from the floor and a counterattack that telegraphs resolve, superiority and victory.There\u2019s real pleasure in the images of Mr. Cruise, tense yet nimble, zigzagging through Paris on a motorcycle or sliding a car across pavement. In the past there\u2019s also been something discomforting about the apparent risks he\u2019s taken, which are inevitably folded into the publicity campaigns and the entertainment coverage. There\u2019s a strange, quasi-religious aspect to these exhibitions of near-sacrifice, one that turns Mr. Cruise \u2014 he almost died (again) for us \u2014 into a would-be martyr, though one who is obviously safe (alive!) and comfortably cosseted. Even the trajectory of this movie\u2019s fights, from cavernous dark to Valhalla-like bright heights, suggests an emergent divinity.This makes Mr. Cruise\u2019s sagging eyes and visible creases an interesting, complicating factor for this decades-long series. Mr. Cruise is now 56, and while obviously fitter than most mortals, he looks closer to his age than ever. Age is the one thing that he can\u2019t control, which works for the character, making Ethan a touch more vulnerable. The movie draws attention to Ethan\u2019s age, sometimes for laughs, though never truly at Mr. Cruise\u2019s expense.The harder laughs are reserved for Mr. Cavill, who\u2019s best known for playing Superman and is close to the age that Mr. Cruise was when the first \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d opened. But Mr. Cavill will never be the star of this show, which Mr. Cruise reminds you as he plays God while gradually making acquaintance with his human self.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

For me, a very casual Marvel fan, \u201cInfinity War\u201d was a decent bad-guy-assembling-a-doomsday-weapon showdown story.But for my neighbor, it was as if Thanos had twiddled the perception-altering reality stone on his Armageddon gauntlet, unveiling a manifestation of the movie rich in detail and reward, strewn with delicious Easter eggs. We were watching \u201cInfinity War\u201d in the same space, but on entirely different planes.All of which brings me to Hulu\u2019s \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d beginning Wednesday, a version of which I am about to review for you. But only my version.\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is based on the work of Stephen King. If the title \u2014 the author\u2019s fictional Maine stomping ground \u2014 is not clue enough, the opening titles feature close-ups of pages from \u201cSalem\u2019s Lot,\u201d \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d and \u201cThe Shining.\u201d It\u2019s as if you\u2019re about to fall into the pages of his novels \u2014 books, beloved by millions, that I haven\u2019t read.It\u2019s not like I\u2019m unexposed to the work of Stephen King. I live in America; \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cCarrie\u201d may as well be articles of the Constitution. I\u2019ve enjoyed some of his books\u2019 screen adaptations, like Hulu\u2019s \u201c11.22.63\u201d from 2016. But I\u2019m not a superfan. At best, maybe a medium fan.\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is an original work (Mr. King is a producer) that borrows from his oeuvre. And while the series is ostensibly created for obsessive and newbie alike, the first episodes \u2014 heavy on atmosphere but weak on character \u2014 feel like the creators expecting affection for his past creations to do a lot of the work.At Shawshank state prison \u2014 that reference, I get! \u2014 the warden, Dale Lacy (Terry O\u2019Quinn), has developed a theory about the malignancy afflicting the town, involving a nameless prisoner (Bill Skarsgard, Pennywise from the recent adaptation of \u201cIt\u201d), being held in apparently extralegal circumstances.The prisoner\u2019s case draws in Henry Deaver (Andr\u00e9 Holland), a Texas defense lawyer and Castle Rock native whose hometown memories are, of course, unhappy. He\u2019s long been blamed for the suspicious death of the pastor who adopted him. With his mother, Ruth (Sissy Spacek), fading into dementia, Henry\u2019s only ally in town is his childhood friend, Molly Strand (Melanie Lynskey).Molly, now a jittery, pill-popping adult, has the challenging job of selling real estate in a burg that\u2019s both economically depressed and, you know, cursed. As she understatedly puts it to a client, \u201cThere is a lot of history in this town, not all of it good.\u201d\u201cCastle Rock\u201d is smothered by that history. The premiere is all mood and tease. The camera lingers on a name tag, \u201cPANGBORN,\u201d letting Kingophiles know that we\u2019re meeting a returning character, the retired town sheriff (now played by Scott Glenn), and sending the rest of us to Google.The impressive cast is rounded out by Allison Tolman, Frances Conroy and Jane Levy. But no character has a chance to develop in the pokey early episodes, which prioritize atmosphere, jump scares and hint-dropping. (The series is produced by J.J. Abrams, of puzzle narratives like \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d along with Sam Shaw of \u201cManhattan.\u201d)Even the mordant dialogue (a victim of decapitation is said to have gotten \u201c10 percent off on the funeral\u201d) doesn\u2019t establish individual character voice so much as a familiar King vibe. You\u2019ve heard the phrase, \u201cThe location is a character\u201d? Here, the town of Castle Rock is an ungenerous co-star, elbowing out its colleagues.The series improves in the third and fourth hours, each of which focuses on specific citizens and how they\u2019ve adapted (or not) to life in a town that\u2019s struggling and spiritually sick. But almost halfway into a 10-episode season, \u201cCastle Rock\u201d hasn\u2019t made the case that you should care, beyond a generic sense of spooky mystery \u2014 or, maybe, a pre-existing attachment to the Stephen King Extended Universe.That\u2019s where I need to leave it to you. \u201cCastle Rock\u201d \u2014 certainly well-acted and produced, with some striking set pieces \u2014 may work well for completists. But it isn\u2019t so successful as TV.Certainly you can pull this sort of thing off, as did \u201cFargo\u201d (\u201cCastle Rock,\u201d but for the Coen Brothers), or \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a series essentially built of memories that nonetheless puts its original characters\u2019 voices first.\u201cCastle Rock,\u201d on the other hand, falls to a distinctively Castle Rockian fate. Its town\u2019s history is just too much for it to escape.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Remember Before You Watch \u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Season 6", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeason 5 of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d played out like more of a thought experiment than a narrative: \u201cWhat would happen if a riot broke out at a minimum-security women\u2019s prison?\u201d the show\u2019s creator, Jenji Kohan, and her writing staff seemed to wonder. And they supplied many answers to that question: some inmates got revenge on guards; some \u2014 like Taystee (Danielle Brooks) \u2014 lobbied for reforms; many others kept their heads down and tried to survive.The season ended with a heartbreaking raid, during which members of a correctional emergency response team, known as CERT, stormed the prison in riot gear, dragged inmates outside and loaded them onto buses. But not every character had been captured by the time the credits rolled on the finale: In a secret bunker maintained by the lone-wolf pragmatist Frieda Berlin (Dale Soules), 10 of Litchfield\u2019s most familiar faces stood their ground. For viewers who could use a reminder, our rundown of where everyone stands going into Season 6 should get you up to speed.Because they\u2019re standing near the door when the raid begins, Taystee\u2019s loyal pals Janae (Vicky Jeudy) and Alison (Amanda Stephen) are the first prisoners to be apprehended.When the finale opens, the group in Frieda\u2019s bunker includes mostly members of Red (Kate Mulgrew)\u2019s family. Once the raid is underway, however, the peace-loving Yoga (Constance Shulman) decides to surrender. Anita (Lin Tucci), Gina (Abigail Savage) and the perpetually silent Norma (Annie Golden) leave with her.In Season 5, Big Boo (Lea DeLaria) fell hard for a new inmate named Amelia Von Barlow. Unfortunately for Boo, she later found out that Amelia was really Linda Ferguson (Beth Dover), an employee with Management & Correction Corporation, who got stuck in the prison when the riot broke out \u2014 and who had previously dated the warden, Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow). In the finale, Boo surrendered but stuck close enough to Linda to ensure that the woman who broke her heart never got a chance to explain who she really was.Maureen (Emily Althaus) spent Season 5 in the infirmary after a fight with her former love interest Suzanne (Uzo Aduba). There, she blew an air bubble into the IV attached to CO Humphrey (Michael Torpey), causing the stroke that killed him. By the finale, Maureen\u2019s battered face was badly infected. She was still in bed when a CERT officer found her and ordered her to walk out of the prison on her own two feet.Brook (Kimiko Glenn) spent the season in mourning for her slain girlfriend, Poussey (Samira Wiley), but she also finally channeled her sadness into a giant work of installation art made from the library books Poussey cherished. When the raiders dragged her out of the prison, Brook was sitting on the floor beneath her monument.The riot catalyzed surprising alliances, but no bedfellows were stranger than Litchfield\u2019s inept white-power gang and the two Latina inmates Pidge (Miriam Morales) and Ouija (Rosal Colon). As the raid began, this unlikely team booby trapped a dorm in hopes of injuring some CERT officers. They succeeded, only to end the season in handcuffs, just like everyone else.The meth enthusiasts Angie (Julie Lake) and Leanne (Emma Myles) decided to fortify themselves for the raid by getting high one last time. But then Angie had a dark thought: \u201cIf we died in here, would anybody really care?\u201d Determined to do something useful for once, the friends set fire to the prison\u2019s files. As they, too, are dragged out of the building, Leanne spotted her Amish mother in the crowd of concerned relatives and realized that her family still loved her.Morello (Yael Stone) has a robust imagination, but her certainty in Season 5 that she was pregnant turned out to be justified. She and Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) rode out the riot in the pharmacy, but when the raid began, Nicky convinced her former lover to surrender. Morello had been fighting with her husband, Vince Muccio (John Magaro), who assumed she was lying about the pregnancy, but when she was led out of the prison, he bounded out of the crowd and was tackled by cops on his way to embrace her.Cabrera (Daniella De Jes\u00fas) has a thing for Litchfield\u2019s wimpy electrical instructor, Officer Luschek (Matt Peters). Their foibles provided comic relief in an otherwise somber finale, as she handcuffed herself to him with plans to use him as a human shield. Instead, they fell down, landed in a compromising position, and Cabrera shattered her ankle. Luschek carried her out of the building and ended the riot an unlikely hero.The fashionista BFFs Flaca (Jackie Cruz) and Maritza (Diane Guerrero) made the most of the riot by starting a YouTube channel to provide D.I.Y. beauty tips and accidental news updates from Litchfield to the world outside. As the raid commenced, they shot one more video, which ended with Flaritza\u2019s violent capture. Tragedy struck again when guards started loading inmates onto buses and the women were directed to separate vehicles.Bitter after having her sentence extended, Ruiz (Jessica Pimentel) became an enthusiastic tormentor of those corrections officers whom the prisoners held hostage during the riots. But then she shifted tactics, cutting a hole in the fence to free the captives officers, having learned that Gloria (Selenis Leyva) struck a deal with the corporation to release the guards in exchange for leave to visit her critically injured son. As it turned out, the deal had never been approved: At the end of the raid, Ruiz was allowed to spend just five minutes with her boyfriend and daughter before getting corralled onto a bus.Chang (Lori Tan Chinn), the quiet loner who presided over the commissary during less volatile times, was among the only inmates who noticed Ruiz\u2019s escape route. While no one was looking, she easily freed herself.The other lucky inmate who slipped out was Doggett (Taryn Manning), the reformed hellion who spent much of the season holed up with her secret boyfriend, Officer Coates (James McMenamin). When her attempt to smuggle him out of the prison went wrong, costing Leanne a finger, Litchfield turned against her. But Doggett came out on top in the end, high-tailing it to Coates\u2019s place, where they watched TV on the couch like a regular couple.After several seasons as a minor character, Frieda became a pivotal part of the show in Season 5. When the riot broke out, she retreated to a secret bunker in an empty basement pool she spent decades stocking with food, homemade weapons and other comforts. But the bunker eventually became a haven for Red\u2019s family and a place for them to stash their hostage, the sadistic Officer Piscatella (Brad William Henke). In the finale, as Yoga, Anita, Norma and Gina surrendered, Frieda and nine other inmates \u2014 all of whom happen to be major characters \u2014 stood their ground.Red and Blanca (Laura G\u00f3mez) teamed up early in the season, digging through the officers\u2019 personnel files and getting strung out on speed. Upon learning that their nemesis, Piscatella, was involved in a male inmate\u2019s death, they tricked him into breaking into the prison, where they intended to trap him. Instead, he captured them and forced Red\u2019s family to watch while he cut off her hair. Only after that humiliation were the women able to gain the upper hand. Red ended the season in an uncharacteristically fragile place, smarting not only from her encounter with Piscatella but also from Yoga and Friends\u2019 decision to abandon her.Alex (Laura Prepon), who was already nursing a broken arm thanks to Piscatella, also wanted to surrender. But, fresh off proposing to Alex \u2014 who said yes \u2014 Piper (Taylor Schilling) convinced her fianc\u00e9e to stay in the bunker with their comrades. As Piper\u2019s mom told Suzanne\u2019s mother outside the prison, \u201cShe always seems to find her way to the middle of things.\u201dNicky\u2019s prison romance didn\u2019t have such a happy ending. Over the course of the season, she had to accept not only that she was in love with the sweet yet obsessive and frequently delusional Morello but also that Morello would never fully reciprocate her feelings.Encouraged by Morello to go off her medication, Suzanne reverted to a psychotic state midway through the season. Tasked with calming down her increasingly disruptive friend, Black Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore) thoughtlessly grabbed some lithium, which rendered the patient unconscious. In the finale, it was Nicky who bought Taystee, Cindy and a catatonic Suzanne to the basement for help. Thankfully, the ever-resourceful Frieda had some EpiPens on hand. Suzanne was revived, but tensions between Taystee (who blamed Cindy for Suzanne\u2019s brush with death) and Cindy (who blamed Taystee for the riot\u2019s failure) continued to simmer.It was a particularly rough season for Gloria, who spent the riot suffering from various forms of maternal guilt. First, her surrogate daughter, Dayanara Diaz (Dascha Polanco), kicked off the riot by shooting Humphrey in the thigh. (Daya disappeared from the story in Episode 8 when she turned herself in to the corporation\u2019s designated negotiator, Natalie Figueroa.) Then, her teenage biological son ended up in the intensive care unit, and Ruiz ruined Gloria\u2019s chance to see him. In the finale, she hid in a correction officer\u2019s office as the raid commenced, called the hospital and learned that her son was going to be all right. The news was a relief, but as she became the last inmate to join the basement crew, she was clearly feeling terrible about never having made it to his bedside.If Poussey was the tragic heroine of Season 4, then Taystee took up that mantle in Season 5, leading a rebellion against Caputo and the Management & Correction Corporation over their failure to say Poussey\u2019s name on TV and for going easy on Poussey\u2019s killer, Officer Bayley (Alan Aisenberg). As the season continued, Taystee\u2019s crusade expanded to encompass a list of demands ranging from a G.E.D. program to a supply of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos. And although her negotiations with Figueroa initially seemed to be going well, they broke down over Taystee\u2019s insistence that Bayley be arrested.By the finale, she was guilt-ridden and disillusioned. Of Poussey, she said, \u201cI failed her.\u201d And when she discovered Piscatella tied up in the bunker, she grabbed Frieda\u2019s gun and aimed it at him, because it was his orders that got Poussey killed. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to pull the trigger. An exhausted Red allowed Piscatella to walk away. And in a final, poetic twist, the CERTs accidentally killed him on his way out of the prison. The season ended with an agonizing cliffhanger: The 10 women in the pool locked arms as the door to their bunker was blasted open.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have the Tech Giants Grown Too Powerful? That\u2019s an Easy One", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe easy question is a common start-up origin story: One day, the founder asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d before going on to figure out, though hard work, that he or she actually can. According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results? Facebook: Why aren\u2019t social networks connecting people with real names? Uber: Why can\u2019t I use an app to summon a taxi? Twitter: Why isn\u2019t there a dead-simple way to just publish whatever you want for a gathered audience? In real life, each of these companies had more sinuous origins, with dead ends and discarded ideas. But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.In 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways. Most recently, however, the case for \u201cjust asking questions\u201d \u2014 for finding a problem intolerable and believing there must be some way to fix it \u2014 has proved remarkably well suited for a fresh purpose: challenging the tech companies themselves.There are companies that are mostly immune to the easy-question-hard-answer dynamic. Easy questions about Netflix, for one, tend to have easy answers: You pay; they stream. Most obvious questions about Apple can be answered by pointing out that it would like to sell you expensive items on a fairly regular basis. What these more straightforward companies have in common is that their founding questions doubled as consumer rallying cries \u2014 they asked, and continued to ask, about things that their customers need, or at least want, and tend to understand.But for the rest of the tech giants, the easy questions have much harder answers. As these companies grew, they did more than just vanquish their competition. Their growth and free-service benevolence succeeded at making the very idea of competitors\u2019 challenging their efforts \u2014 the industry\u2019s traditional way to solve the problems they\u2019ve created \u2014 seem unnecessary or even counterproductive. They\u2019ve ducked the easy questions for so long that it\u2019s reasonable to suspect that they doubt we will like the answers.Advertisement"}

Cutting these trade barriers to zero would be an extraordinarily complex political challenge on both sides of the Atlantic.The trade war\u2019s impact on some companies is causing their stocks to crater. So far, the hit is largely coming from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which have pushed up the prices many firms pay for the metals.The current spending bill that Mr. Trump signed earlier this year expires at the end of September, the end of the current fiscal year.

The hope is that a more aligned family will make better decisions that will benefit its members and its business.In family operations, the role has morphed slightly: The focus is on training the relatives to be business owners and to think about the future of the enterprise.Greg McCann, founder of McCann & Associates, acts as a chief learning officer for family businesses as well as a counselor to those who want to assume his role in a family enterprise. He said that getting families to shift their focus toward unity could be difficult, but that in the long run, they had more clarity about who they were and what they wanted. And sometimes, they chose not to stay together.\u201cI always ask them, \u2018Do you want to be the last but most efficient Blockbuster store owner?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is changing really quickly. You can\u2019t just make the Blockbuster store layout better. You have to think, \u2018How do we go from Blockbuster to Netflix?\u2019 Most families get that.\u201dMr. McCann said the process started with the family itself. \u201cWe say the family defines success, but what\u2019s needed is a definition of family goals,\u201d he said.Haws, a 100-year-old family company in Sparks, Nev., that makes drinking fountains and emergency equipment, found itself needing to redefine its corporate structure when a member of the family left the company abruptly.\u201cWe had family members in the business and assumed they were looking after each other,\u201d said Tom White, the chief executive and the husband of one of the owners. \u201cThey weren\u2019t.\u201dStephanie Kilroy, his sister-in-law and an owner of the company, said the family business hadn\u2019t been mismanaged; it had been \u201cunmanaged.\u201d So the family created governance policies to help align its members and run the business more efficiently.But it became clear that more help was needed, so the family brought in Mr. McCann. In the process, it decided that the best solution would be for Ms. Kilroy and her sister, Mr. White\u2019s wife, to buy out the other relatives.\u201cWe had tiptoed around the deeper issues that related to family dynamics, and it really caught up to us,\u201d Ms. Kilroy said. \u201cWe worked on resetting the family ownership group and committing to the emotional intelligence aspect of families in business together.\u201dThe task can be long and arduous. Mr. McCann said the first year was particularly intense and time-consuming because it required the families to talk about issues that they may have been glossing over for years.One thing families must consider is making the leap from a family business to a family enterprise, which could comprise several related businesses, financial assets or separate holdings that allow different branches to do their own thing.The families that have thought about personal and professional growth are typically the most successful; those whose members are not committed to one another on a personal level often struggle because they fail to see the purpose in keeping the business together.Some families stop the process when they realize what it entails, Mr. McCann said. \u201cThey\u2019d like to be in shape, but they don\u2019t want to run or lift heavy things,\u201d he said.Ruth E. Steverlynck, a chief learning officer and a founding partner of Your Family Enterprise, said she spent years with her clients. She said many families thought that once they had the legal documents like wills, trusts and partnerships in place, their job was done. Likewise, they might be thinking about family governance, but still need guidance.Chief learning officers, she said, are available \u201cto help families learn and develop, to really help families get excited about learning together and why it matters.\u201dDuncan Taylor has been running Taylor Made Sales Agency, an equestrian sales and boarding company in Nicholasville, Ky., with his brothers for more than 40 years. After working with McCann & Associates, he learned his leadership style was not a good match for his brothers\u2019 way of working.\u201cI\u2019ve always been the brother coming into the meeting pushing and pushing an agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a thinker, not a feeler, and I have three brothers who are feelers. When I get into the room, I shouldn\u2019t push so much. I should throw the idea out on the table and ask for input.\u201dChief learning officers can help break through an impasse by showing each side how the other is thinking. Mr. Taylor said he was listening to his brothers more and asking more questions.\u201cBefore, they were thinking I wasn\u2019t respecting them, when I was thinking I\u2019m just trying to get things done for the business,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re giving their thoughts more. They\u2019re not so easily caving in just because they want to get out of the meeting.\u201dHe said this revelation had come at a crucial time for them because their children were beginning to show interest in the business.A chief learning officer at a top corporation earns around $140,000 a year, according to job sites like Indeed and LinkedIn, and those who work for family businesses make about the same. Mr. McCann said that he charged $400 an hour, and that the first year of a project typically ran $80,000 to $150,000.Being the chief learning officer in a family-run business is different from being one in a larger company because family members have different levels of involvement. Some work in the business, while others are merely shareholders. A chief learning officer has to consider the qualifications of the relatives as well as the potential for clashes with others.\u201cThe ability to have the difficult conversation is the best way to ensure families last 100 years,\u201d Mr. McCann said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between hiring one sibling versus having a hiring policy.\u201dWhat most of the founders are looking for is a way for their children to run the company together or find a way to part amicably. But a chief learning officer\u2019s role is to be realistic.\u201cI say, \u2018If we roll the clock ahead 20 years, what do you want it to look like?\u2019\u201d Ms. Steverlynck said. Some families may not want to remain in business together, she said, while others want to build a dynasty.Either way, they have to take the first step. And that\u2019s a learning exercise for any family.Advertisement"}
