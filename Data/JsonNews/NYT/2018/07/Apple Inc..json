{"Headline": "HBO Must Get Bigger and Broader, Says Its New Overseer", "Date": "2018-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChange is coming to HBO, now that it is part of the AT&T corporate family. That much was clear to the 150 employees who attended a recent town hall meeting at the network\u2019s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The main speaker was John Stankey, a longtime AT&T executive who now oversees HBO in his new role as chief executive of Warner Media. During a straight-shooting, hourlong talk, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times, he laid out his rough vision for the network, and warned his audience that the months ahead would not be easy.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough year,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work to alter and change direction a little bit.\u201dBut the town hall meeting suggested that AT&T would not be a passive corporate parent.Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s gregarious and urbane chief executive, hosted the talk at the cozy HBO Theater on the building\u2019s 15th floor. Mr. Stankey\u2019s appearance came as part of a tour that included stops at Warner Bros. and Turner, the media properties that were once part of Time Warner and now belong to AT&T\u2019s Warner Media division.Mr. Plepler, 58, and Mr. Stankey, 55, sat angled slightly toward each other on the modest stage. During the conversation, which began at noon on June 19, Mr. Stankey never uttered the word \u201cNetflix,\u201d but he did suggest that HBO would have to become more like a streaming giant to thrive in the new media landscape.Mr. Stankey described a future in which HBO would substantially increase its subscriber base and the number of hours that viewers spend watching its shows. To pull it off, the network will have to come up with more content, transforming itself from a boutique operation, with a focus on its signature Sunday night lineup, into something bigger and broader.\u201cWe need hours a day,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. \u201cIt\u2019s not hours a week, and it\u2019s not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people\u2019s hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.\u201dContinuing the theme, he added: \u201cI want more hours of engagement. Why are more hours of engagement important? Because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrow\u2019s world.\u201dKnown for \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld,\u201d HBO has long favored quality over quantity. Its high-gloss productions often take years to develop and can cost millions per episode. That approach has won the network more Primetime Emmy Awards than any of its competitors over the last 16 years, with Mr. Plepler the master curator.In recent years, Mr. Plepler has emphasized HBO\u2019s \u201cbespoke culture\u201d and its enduring appeal to A-list producers and stars at a time when Netflix, Amazon and Apple have bottomless budgets. On his watch, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d has brought the Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep to the network, and shows like \u201cBarry\u201d and \u201cInsecure\u201d have charmed critics. But during the town hall meeting, Mr. Stankey said HBO should consider trying something new.\u201cAs I step back and think about what\u2019s unique about the brand and where it needs to go, there\u2019s got to be a little more depth to it, there\u2019s got to be more frequent engagement,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. Bringing the point home, he added that HBO must \u201cbuild that brand so that it\u2019s broad enough to make that happen.\u201dMr. Plepler tried to pin down Mr. Stankey on the question of how much AT&T planned to invest. Without specifying any certain amount, Mr. Stankey said, \u201cI do believe there needs to be stepped-up investment.\u201dMr. Plepler interjected: \u201cLet\u2019s give him a hand for that simple sentence! That simple sentence deserves a hand!\u201d\u201cAlso,\u201d Mr. Stankey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?\u201d\u201cWe do that,\u201d Mr. Plepler responded, to scattered applause.\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cJust not enough.\u201d\u201cOh, now, now, be careful,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.HBO has, in fact, been a consistent moneymaker. Over the last three years, while allocating more than $2 billion a year to its programming, the network has made nearly $6 billion in profit. But if it is to compete with upstart rivals like Netflix, which plans to lay out some $8 billion this year, its level of spending must increase considerably.\u201cWe well understand that we played the best hand we could with the hand we had,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cAnd we well understand that that is not going to be sustainable going forward.\u201dMr. Stankey also said that the network\u2019s number of subscribers \u2014 40 million in the United States, out of 142 million worldwide \u2014 was not going to cut it. HBO will have to find a way \u201cto move beyond 35 to 40 percent penetration to have this become a much more common product,\u201d he said, referring to its current market size.At the same time, he acknowledged that HBO has commanded deep loyalty: \u201cYou\u2019ve earned the dynamic amongst your customer base that when you put a new piece of content out there, people will try it, just because they trust you\u2019re going to be putting something in front of them that they might like. We now need to figure out how to expand the aperture of it without losing the quality.\u201dRepresentatives for the network and Warner Media declined to comment for this article.To make a bigger, broader HBO, while also guarding its distinctive identity, the two executives will have to find a way to work together despite their differences.The California-born Mr. Stankey, who lives in Texas and has donated to a number of Republican campaigns, cuts a lower profile. He started his telecommunications career at Pacific Bell in 1985 and has served in various roles at AT&T, including chief technology officer and head of the company\u2019s DirecTV unit. On the stage of the HBO Theater, he described himself as a \u201cBell-head,\u201d a term that was probably lost on the people in the seats.During the talk, Mr. Plepler seemed willing to make changes. \u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018More is not better, only better is better,\u2019 because that was the hand we had,\u201d he said, as Mr. Stankey looked on. \u201cI\u2019ve switched that, now that you\u2019re here, to: \u2018More isn\u2019t better, only better is better \u2014 but we need a lot more to be even better.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey\u2019s experience at AT&T \u2014 which offers two streaming services, DirectTV Now and WatchTV \u2014 has given him a deep familiarity with the recent shift in how media is distributed. He warned that there would be only so many streaming companies in the future. If HBO would like to end up as a heavyweight in the industry, he said, it would be wise to add \u201cother types of content\u201d to what is available on its stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now.He also made the case that HBO\u2019s employees should consider themselves fortunate to have AT&T as their new corporate parent, rather than a company in the same business.\u201cThe good news for many of you in this organization is that it\u2019s not Fox or Disney sitting up on this stage now,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no duplication with AT&T in what we do.\u201dIn other words, your jobs are safe.But he cautioned that HBO\u2019s employees would notice a change in tempo and metabolism in the days ahead. \u201cI suspect if we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re going to be investing heavier, that means that there\u2019s going to be more work for all of you to do \u2014 and you\u2019re going to be working a little bit harder,\u201d Mr. Stankey said.After comparing the next 12 months to a \u201cdog year,\u201d he invoked another metaphor.\u201cYou will work very hard, and this next year will \u2014 my wife hates it when I say this \u2014 feel like childbirth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll look back on it and be very fond of it, but it\u2019s not going to feel great while you\u2019re in the middle of it. She says, \u2018What do you know about this?\u2019 I just observe, \u2018Honey. We love our kids.\u2019\u201dMr. Stankey also said he was starting to get used to the media glare that has gone along with his new, high-profile job. When he mentioned that the newspapers have lately shown an interest in his personal life, Mr. Plepler cut him off.\u201cYou\u2019re now in the entertainment business, John,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no secrets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Amazon\u2019s Push Into Prescription Drugs Isn\u2019t a Guaranteed Success", "Date": "2018-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, but with drugs, it will need to work with powerful entrenched players. But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapers, it may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That\u2019s because to succeed, it will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well. As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenues, PillPack most likely didn\u2019t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry\u2019s giants, said Eric Percher, an equity research analyst at Nephron Research. PillPack, which was founded in 2013, distributes pills in easy-to-use packages designed for consumers with chronic conditions and multiple prescriptions. The company sorts prescriptions by the dose and includes a label with a picture of each pill and directions on how it should be taken. While the company had a niche appeal, many analysts have speculated that Amazon\u2019s true motivation for buying PillPack is to leapfrog its way into the broader prescription drug business because PillPack has pharmacy licenses in 50 states. It also has relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers, like Express Scripts and CVS Health, that serve as gatekeepers to the majority of Americans who are covered by health insurance.Although that dispute was resolved, Express Scripts said on Friday that its network agreement with PillPack was expiring in July and that the two companies had not reached an agreement on rates. It also said that it was investigating PillPack for \u201cprovider compliance,\u201d although it did not elaborate. CVS Health said PillPack is in \u201cmany\u201d of its pharmacy networks, including for commercially insured consumers as well as Medicare beneficiaries. OptumRx, another large benefit manager, did not comment, although a spokeswoman for PillPack said the company was in OptumRx\u2019s commercial pharmacy network. She declined to comment on the negotiations over the Express Scripts contract.But Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said she was skeptical that Amazon would link up with an established company. \u201cIt\u2019s looking to partner with other innovators, not just your standard vendors like your traditional P.B.M.s,\u201d she said. Any partner \u201cwould have to be one that brings something to the table in an innovative way.\u201dThe months of speculation have allowed competitors to prepare, acting as \u201ca catalyst for participants to close ranks against competition and invest to improve the consumer experience,\u201d Mr. Percher wrote in a research note last week. In a statement, Express Scripts touted the breadth of its services, saying it delivered more than 100 million prescriptions to patients around the country in 2017. \u201cOur scale and quality of care provides patients with access to a broader suite of products than other smaller pharmacies,\u201d the company said.Peter Blicher, 70, of Vacaville, Calif., said he has used several different mail-order pharmacies over the years. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do business with them, takes multiple interaction, the customer service is very poor,\u201d he said. If Amazon were to begin selling prescription drugs, he said, he would sign up. \u201cI haven\u2019t found another e-commerce website that can compare,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "Date": "2018-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.Yet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.Facebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.Facial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201dBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.Rochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.At the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.European regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.Nikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201dFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.People could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.Ms. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.But Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.One patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.Another Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.Ms. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.But legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.The case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.If the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Stock Plunge Shatters Faith in Tech Companies\u2019 Invincibility", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world\u2019s biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.Before Facebook\u2019s tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.In recent years, investors \u2014 from individual traders to the world\u2019s largest hedge funds \u2014 have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.Facebook\u2019s stumble suggests that some of these stocks \u2014 as well as the broader market \u2014 could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don\u2019t live up to investor expectations.Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.It was the details of Facebook\u2019s report that seemed to spook investors. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.Still, Facebook\u2019s sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook\u2019s tumble. Other large tech firms didn\u2019t take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook\u2019s tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve\u2019s increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.\u201cThe market is looking ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. \u201cThere are always going to be these one-day disasters.\u201dIt\u2019s quite possible that Facebook\u2019s shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.Still, the sheer size of Facebook\u2019s fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook\u2019s market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country\u2019s best-known companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.But given the vast market value of today\u2019s tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn\u2019t be surprising.Apple is now worth more than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.Advertisement"}

Now the electric-car maker must prove it\u2019s not a one-time achievement.The company is counting on the Model 3, its first mass-market vehicle, to increase revenue and offset the billions of dollars it has been spending to set up a huge battery plant in Nevada and begin making the Model 3 at its car plant in Fremont, Calif., as well as to develop new vehicles.For now, however, the automaker is celebrating. Tesla said it produced more than 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the last seven days of June, a goal that its chief executive, Elon Musk, has said is crucial to its bid to turn a profit in this year\u2019s final two quarters.\u201cWe either found a way or, by will and inventiveness, created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible,\u201d Mr. Musk told employees Sunday in an email, adding, \u201cI think we just became a real car company.\u201dInvestors initially reacted favorably to the production report, sending Tesla shares up in morning trading, but the stock finished the day more than 2 percent lower at $335.07.Tesla has been struggling with bottlenecks and other glitches in its Model 3 assembly process.

In June, Tesla erected a giant tent just outside the walls of the Fremont plant, where it cobbled together a new production line to hasten final assembly of the cars.The assembly problems had mostly plagued two Model 3 final assembly lines Tesla has set up inside the plant, although there were also production slowdowns in the paint shop.With the three assembly lines running, Tesla built 5,031 Model 3s in the final seven days of June; about 20 percent came from the line set up in the tent outside the plant. It also made nearly 2,000 other vehicles \u2014 the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle.Tesla\u2019s challenge is to prove that it can produce more than 5,000 Model 3s week after week. A company spokesman said Tesla had to operate the assembly line 24 hours a day to reach the seven-day total.Automakers typically cannot run plants around the clock for long periods because they need to stop production to maintain the machinery. Workers also become fatigued if required to work six or seven days a week. Nonetheless, Tesla said it expected to produce 6,000 Model 3s a week by late next month.\u201cI don\u2019t know if the numbers really represent reality or sustainability,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research firm. \u201cYou have to keep a critical eye on them. There is a history with Tesla, and we\u2019ve been told a lot of things about Model 3 targets in the last year that haven\u2019t proven accurate.\u201dAlarmed by both the cash burn and the lagging increase in assembling Model 3s, Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Tesla\u2019s credit rating in March.In the second quarter, Tesla produced 28,578 Model 3s, about three times as many as in the first quarter, the company said. Output for the Model S and Model X totaled 24,761 combined. The overall output of 53,339 was a 55 percent jump from the first quarter.Tesla delivered just 18,440 Model 3s to customers in the quarter, and 11,166 were in transit, a result of having increased production so late in the quarter. Combined deliveries for the Model S and X came to 22,300 vehicles.Tesla has delivered 28,386 Model 3s to date and has reservations for approximately 420,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Want This Tattoo? Get in Line", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeith McCurdy, the owner of Bang Bang, has transformed the body-art industry with his diverse hiring and high prices. Of course there\u2019s a wait list.In a city where high-end hairdressers charge upward of $500 an appointment, it was only a matter of time before tattoos ceased to be a bargain.\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s going to last forever,\u201d said Jack Powers, a 22-year-old operations manager at a logistics company, putting aside the stuff about death and body decomposition. \u201cYou got to go to the best of the best.\u201d Part of the price is attributable to a so-called celebrity tax: Professionals like personal trainers and cosmetic dermatologists can often double or triple prices after getting publicity from famous clients. It was Rihanna who put the \u201cbang\u201d in Bang Bang.She stumbled upon the shop\u2019s owner, Keith McCurdy, 11 years ago, when he was working at a tattoo and piercing shop on West Fourth Street, one of the few remaining blocks in Lower Manhattan that hasn\u2019t been transformed by luxury-goods boutiques. Rihanna came in for a nipple piercing and walked out with several lines of Sanskrit inked on her hip. Last month, Bang Bang opened a second shop, on Grand Street in SoHo, mere feet from an Alexander Wang store. Mr. McCurdy said the cost of the renovation there was north of $1 million. A look around provides little reason to doubt him. The floors are covered in freshly pressed concrete. A wall of screens displays promotional material about the store\u2019s artists, all shot by a full-time videographer. A large aquarium filled with koi runs across the back wall, by a black steel staircase leading to a downstairs lounge where Fiji water is served by the caseload.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Apple store in here,\u201d Miley Cyrus said Saturday night, when she showed up with a friend to have her mother\u2019s signature inked on her arm and then decided to get a second tattoo on her ankle: slang for part of the female genitalia. For four hours, I was at the next station over, getting a bird tattooed on my arm, at a price that exceeded my last paycheck. (The New York Times does not take freebies.)The fancy digs, celebrity adherents and notorious waits for appointments have earned Mr. McCurdy a fair amount of ire in the industry. \u201cI\u2019m public enemy No. 1,\u201d he said. Really?In a movie about his life, Mr. McCurdy, 32, might be played by Seth Rogen: also a bearish guy who is both delightful and aggressive, nerdy and cool, stoner-ish and Type A \u2014 an empath who loves a brawl.Although Mr. McCurdy has made millions of dollars with his craft, he has no interest in fancy watches, art or real estate. Instead, he sermonizes about simple pleasures like Popsicles and amusement parks, particularly Disney World, which he visits multiple times a year with his employees and sees as a metaphor for what America (and his business) should be: futuristic, easy, open to all races, ages and religions. \u201cThey\u2019re the best people in the world at tricking your eye,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said of Disney, sitting in the lounge on Grand Street, wearing Y3 sweat shorts and a black $10 Goonies T-shirt from Target. Mr. McCurdy\u2019s own story is a triumph of American possibility. He grew up in Claymont, Del. His father, Vincent Lacava, was 16 when Keith was born, and his mother, Susan McCurdy, was 17. Ms. McCurdy and Mr. Lacava broke up soon after. He went off to college, and she dropped out of high school and became a stripper. \u201cThere was no shame around it,\u201d said Mr. McCurdy, who dedicated his book to her. \u201cShe was a feminist, and she paid the bills.\u201d Eventually, she opened a cleaning business, relying heavily on her son. \u201cOne of his chores was to rake the leaves,\u201d Ms. McCurdy said. \u201cI remember one day, I walked onto the deck and he had the other kids raking them for him. But he got it done. He was always a delegator.\u201dAt 15, Mr. McCurdy pressured his mother to let him get a tattoo and they struck a deal. If he made the honor roll \u2014 he was not a good student \u2014 he could get one. Soon enough, they drove to a nearby parlor, where Mr. McCurdy got what he describes as \u201cthe cheesiest version of the Superman logo you have ever seen.\u201dUnlike Clark Kent, though, he dropped out of high school, bought a tattoo kit online for $268 and began practicing on a cousin, Edward Borew, now the manager of the store. In 2004, Mr. McCurdy got his first job as a tattooer, working at Rage of the Needle in New Castle, Del. \u201cIf I made $200 a day, it was awesome,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cThe most money I got was from doing tattoo parties in clients\u2019 houses. Then I could make five or six hundred dollars in a night.\u201dLess than a year later, Mr. McCurdy moved to New York, where he lived with his father, who was working as a video-game designer, in a tiny Midtown studio. Mr. McCurdy took a job tattooing the most inebriated among the Verrazano bridge set, at a West 4th street shop called Crazy Fantasy that also sold sex toys and did piercings, and shared a bathroom with the Papaya Dog next door.Mr. Borew had arrived in New York soon after Mr. McCurdy and had gone to work for Andre Balazs at the Mercer Hotel, where he earned a doctorate in tending to fancy people. Mr. McCurdy moved from Crazy Fantasy to what he called a \u201cslightly less disgusting\u201d shop, Whatever Tattoo.In the foreword for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s book, Rihanna writes that Mr. McCurdy did not even know who she was the night she rolled into Whatever, to her delight: \u201cI remember thinking this guy is gangsta.\u201d Impressed by the Freddy Krueger tattoo he had inked on the shop\u2019s manager and his input on where to place the Sanskrit message, she not only returned for more tattoos but also connected various people in her orbit to Mr. McCurdy.After tabloid coverage, demand for Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services grew exponentially. He bounced between Last Rites and East Side Ink, two of New York\u2019s best known high-end tattoo shops, burnishing his star and alienating his bosses.\u201cPeople told me I stepped on people to get where I am,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stepped on people, but I sometimes pushed them out of my way. Wouldn\u2019t everybody?\u201dAt East Side Ink he determined that he was the shop\u2019s biggest earner and pressed for an ownership stake in the business. \u201cThat was never going to happen,\u201d said Josh Lord, the owner. At the time, Mr. McCurdy and his wife, Etsuko Tsujimoto, had a young daughter and another one on the way. Soon, he started making arrangements to open his own shop and made offers to a number of people on the staff. Mr. Lord found out about this, and Mr. McCurdy was ultimately fired. Today, Mr. Lord calls Mr. McCurdy \u201cthe worst person\u201d who ever worked for him, which seems slightly out of sync with the offense committed. Unfazed, Mr. McCurdy professes a continued desire to steal Mr. Lord\u2019s best artist, Cheo Park. \u201cI\u2019d make him more money too,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said, adding that it has been a pleasure to \u201ckick their\u201d butts, referring to East Side.Paul Booth, the renowned owner of Last Rites, agreed to give Mr. McCurdy a chair while he was setting up his business. But when Mr. McCurdy was ready to go, he offered jobs to people on Mr. Booth\u2019s staff.In an interview last week, Mr. Booth accused Mr. McCurdy of being a sellout, a man who made \u201ctattooing dumb little things\u201d on celebrities a bigger priority than the art itself. \u201cYou can run for the money or you can run for the art,\u201d Mr. Booth said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could be much richer, but I lay down at night with my integrity intact.\u201d\u201cPlease,\u201d said Mr. Borew, sitting with his cousin. \u201cI was with Paul Booth when Nicolas Cage called him about doing a tattoo. Paul didn\u2019t even get to do it and he was so excited.\u201d The first Bang Bang, on Clinton Street, opened in 2013. Investment money came from Mr. Lacava. But according to Mr. McCurdy, the relationship between father and son deteriorated quickly. \u201cHe was supposed to be handling business matters \u2014 financial, insurance and everything entailing back of the house,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cIt was a disaster. For months, we didn\u2019t even have furniture.\u201d In a text message, Mr. Lacava said, \u201cAlthough Keith and I have different views about what happened with the shop, I wish him continued success.\u201d One day, employees strolled up to the store and found that someone had changed the locks and removed everything overnight. His shop gone and his marriage suffering, Mr. McCurdy moved onto an air mattress in Mr. Borew\u2019s apartment in Queens and spent several months tattooing clients including Selena Gomez at a small studio he rented in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He and his wife went into counseling with Karen Bridbord, a therapist and executive coach. Soon, Dr. Bridbord was advising Mr. McCurdy on how to restart his business. He found a new store (on Broome Street), borrowed money from friends and opened just as Instagram was taking off. Mr. McCurdy posted selfies with his famous clients and sent direct messages to talented artists around the globe, sponsoring some of their visas. He made hiring women a priority and was clear with his staff that tattoo-world misogyny would not be tolerated beneath his roof. \u201cMy daughter is 9,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a feminist button on her backpack and she doesn\u2019t really know what it means, but I want her to have the sense that she can do anything she wants with her life. Sixty-five percent of our customers are women. And we have employees and they have rights.\u201d Inevitably, there has been some #MeTattoo.The issue, JonBoy said in an interview, was \u201cthe perverted jokes I told, the way I behaved in the presence of females.\u201d After four months, Mr. McCurdy and Dr. Bridbord determined that JonBoy had to go. At least for a while. They provided him with the name of a therapist and told him to stay in touch. A year later, he was hired back, on the condition that he remain in treatment. \u201cI see someone every week, and it\u2019s been so helpful,\u201d he said. And the celebrities kept coming. One is Justin Bieber, who has spent more than $60,000 on Mr. McCurdy\u2019s services. He pays a premium to transport his tattooer between coasts and around the world. \u201cUsually it\u2019s a last-minute thing,\u201d Mr. Bieber said by phone last week, as Mr. McCurdy patched him into a call with me and chuckled in the background. \u201cThat makes it difficult on Bang, but he always goes out of his way to make me a priority and it\u2019s why I love him so much. I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in Panama. Can you come out?\u2019\u201d (For $10,000 he did. \u201cI\u2019ve got kids,\u201d Mr. McCurdy said. \u201cTell me he\u2019s not awesome.\u201d) And sometimes discreet. Mr. McCurdy agreed to tattoo her current favorite food, bacon, only if she put it on the bottom of one of her feet. In retrospect, she thinks that was a fine decision. \u201cI might become a vegan,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are great people who can\u2019t afford to get tattooed by us,\u201d said Balazs Bercsenyi, the 29-year-old artist from Hungary who inked me.One night, a man delivering an Amazon package to the store asked if Kristi Walls worked there. \u201cShe used to be my tattooer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was when she cost less.\u201d But mostly, Mr. Bercsenyi and the other artists are enjoying the premium fees they command.With the SoHo store up and running, Mr. McCurdy is, inevitably, mulling other brand extensions. Later this year, he is introducing a line of tattoo aftercare products. He\u2019d also like to do a show for Netflix and open a Bang Bang in Los Angeles. \u201cWith a pool on the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York is so boring.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beauty Is in the Eye of These Beholders", "Date": "2018-07-28", "News": "Beautycon is the Super Bowl of the beauty industry, where new products are unveiled and celebrities show up to launch their forays into the lucrative makeup business.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Thousands of cat-eyed, contoured-cheeked, glitter-doused women \u2014 and more than a few painted men \u2014 descended on the 347,000-square-foot South Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center earlier this month, gathering at the makeup mecca that is Beautycon. For two days, as they wandered among more than 200 elaborately festooned booths sponsored by brands like Maybelline and Lime Crime, they searched for samples and stars. Some would be instantly familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of reality TV (i.e., Kim Kardashian West). Others clearly had a more specialized fan base. (Nikita Dragun, anyone? How about Gigi Gorgeous or Manny MUA?)Nearly all of the bathrooms at the Convention Center had been converted to gender-neutral. Staff throughout the floor wore T-shirts with a welcome list on the back that read: \u201cAll races, all genders, all ages, all countries of origin, all sexual orientations, all religions\u201d as well as \u201call glamazons, all natural beauties, all unicorns.\u201d\u201cI came for Drew Barrymore,\u201d interjected Ms. Alden, of Denver, her eyes ringed in pink and orange, the only pop of color standing out against her black suspenders holding up her black mini skirt, a black fedora perched on her head. Ms. Alden, who is in the Air Force, had just taken a selfie with the actress on her way to the booth for Ms. Barrymore\u2019s six-year-old Flower Beauty brand. Ms. Tejan nodded in agreement: \u201cMy grandmother loves Drew Barrymore.\u201dAs she participated in a meet-and-greet with fans, Ms. Barrymore said events like this were a particularly useful way to reach out to beauty shoppers. These consumers demand a personal touch \u2014 often literally, in the form of a hug or selfie. The question, she said, is: \u201cHow are you paying attention to me as a loud, confident individual?\u201dA record 23,300 of those loud, confident individuals attended Beautycon LA, an event that is equal parts competitive shopping scene, feel-good festival and marketing bonanza. Described as Sephora meets Coachella, Beautycon is not unlike a theme park, with hourslong lines, expensive food and the occasional chance to scream. Tickets range from $50 for a single-day pass to $1,000 for two days of skip-the-lines VIP treatment.Beauty brands spend anywhere from $5,000 to more than a million dollars on their Beautycon build-outs. From these temporary havens, companies test and sell product, hand out samples, gather email addresses and host appearances with digital influencers.\u201cConsumers are now discovering and experiencing brands in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago,\u201d said Gustavo Andriani, senior vice president and general manager at MAC North America, a division of Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. An ad in a magazine or a presence on social media is not enough, he added. \u201cWe need to physically be where they are.\u201dBoth brands and attendees come with a #picsoritdidnthappen mentality. Shoppers are after social media bragging rights and companies see those same posts as a chance to spread their marketing dollars beyond the convention center\u2019s walls. Dressed-up corporate photo bait filled the hall, including a dozen pink carpets, complete with flattering lighting and a Beautycon backdrop. Swings at Target, Aveda and Rimmel London and shirtless men almost everywhere \u2014 wielding lipstick-tipped power drills at MAC, covered in metallic body paint at Masque Bar \u2014 were the quick pic gimmicks du jour.\u201cYou don\u2019t need lipstick. Lipstick needs you,\u201d one of Beautycon\u2019s hallmark sayings, was stripped in pink block text across the wall behind a pink sofa in the pink-carpeted enclave of Moj Mahdara, the chief executive officer of Beautycon. Clad in a black T-shirt and Nike Air Max 1/97 sneakers, Ms. Mahdara slipped into this relatively quiet space backstage, her 4-month-old son, Neev, leaning against her shoulder.A 40-year-old, gay Persian-American, Ms. Mahdara was born in Lexington, Ky., and grew up in Erie, Pa. She moved to Orange County, Calif., in 1998, then to Los Angeles two years later in search of a way into the music industry. Instead, she found a more viable path as a digital strategist, helping consumer and entertainment brands develop online campaigns with celebrities like Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani. She built and sold a digital agency, and worked with a number of large, consumer-facing brands, including HTC and Lacoste.After briefly toying with the idea of getting an M.B.A., Ms. Mahdara decided instead to take that money and invest it in direct-to-consumer brands like Outdoor Voices and Harry\u2019s razors. In 2013, as she was growing her new digital consulting agency, Ms. Mahdara\u2019s lawyer told her about an upcoming gathering of beauty YouTubers, a group of digital personalities gathering in Los Angeles (IRL, as the kids would say). Although she says, \u201cI\u2019m not a beauty person\u201d \u2014 she does not wear makeup \u2014 Ms. Mahdara was then looking to start her own digital influencer management company, on the hunt for what she said was \u201cthe next gen of QVC.\u201dMs. Mahdara envisioned a new experiential retail model. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff for music and a lot of stuff for gaming and a lot of stuff for sports,\u201d Ms. Mahdara said. \u201cWhat became abundantly clear to me is that there was nothing for young women and people in general who were interested in beauty but not sure how they fit into that world.\u201d Her goal was not just an offline experience but a marketplace, one that would translate into sales for participating beauty companies.\u201cMoj and her team recognize that beauty is about more than just slick advertising,\u201d Debra Perelman, the chief executive officer of Revlon, said in an email. They \u201crealized early that in the digital age you can\u2019t just talk to women, but instead need to build a deep, personal relationship with them.\u201dBeautycon is a festival, yes, but it\u2019s also a data-gathering machine. Two hundred beacons sprinkled throughout the floor in Los Angeles allowed organizers to heat-map the crowds, showing where the largest groups of attendees were congregating. Beautycon held eight focus groups each day that weekend, talking to 320 consumers about their shopping habits and attitudes on health and wellness. Each wristband was equipped with radio-frequency identification (R.F.I.D.) technology, allowing the organizers to monitor the path people took, how long they lingered, and if they visited a booth multiple times.Coupled with registration information, Beautycon can paint a detailed picture of these shoppers. \u201cWe know what she wants, we know what she\u2019s missing, we know what she needs,\u201d said Richelieu Dennis, the chief executive of Sundial Brands, owner of Essence magazine and a Beautycon investor.Beautycon\u2019s connection to customers, paired with the combination of content and commerce, has helped Ms. Mahdara raise $20 million from investors. The most recent round of financing raised $6 million, led by the New Voices Fund, a $100 million fund that invests in businesses owned or managed by women of color and run by Mr. Dennis. \u201cThis is the future of beauty \u2014 this is the future of business,\u201d he said of Beautycon.In Los Angeles, about 60 percent of brands offered attendees a chance to shop on site, either at full price or a discount. Companies at Beautycon also keep close tabs on the e-commerce lift afterward, using special discount codes and tracking conversion rates from follow-up emails. The festival\u2019s implied revenue per square foot, meaning both the dollars spent on site and the resulting online sales, was $4,288 last year, Ms. Mahdara said. (Apple, for comparison, saw sales per square foot upwards of $5,100 last year in its average store, according to eMarketer.) At this point, Beautycon does not take a cut of on-site sales, but organizers say they may revisit that option in the future.Beautycon is expanding, both in the brands it attracts (B-Well, its push toward health and wellness, drew the likes of Kind snacks, Quip toothbrushes and West Elm furniture) and its locations (international dates and cities, beyond London, are in the works). Ms. Mahdara was tight-lipped on a new \u201cexperiential commerce\u201d concept coming this fall, which she said was a \u201creally exciting new format both digitally and experientially.\u201dThe secrecy is tied, in no small part, to the new competition Beautycon now faces. Beauty retail behemoth Sephora, owned by LVMH, is starting its own festival in downtown Los Angeles this fall, dubbed Sephoria. Tickets range from $99 to $449; each level includes a bag of giveaways (Beautycon attendees needed to spend $199 for the \u201cHauler\u201d package to receive such a thing). The overlap in participating brands is minimal. Sephora appears to be using its considerable clout in the industry to attract some of the most popular prestige names, ones that were not at Beautycon in Los Angeles, such as Pat McGrath Labs and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna (Fenty is produced by Kendo, another division of LVMH).A Sephora spokeswoman described its relationship with Beautycon as \u201ccomplementary\u201d and said \u201cthe concept for Sephoria was developed internally long before we shared anything with potential partners.\u201d Beautycon was part of the proposal process, she added, but Sephora \u201cdecided to go with a different partner.\u201dInstead of singing for their supper, Beautycon-goers selfie for their samples. At the recent gathering, staffers in the CoverGirl booth scanned phone after phone to make sure attendees who waited in line to take a photo in front of its branded backdrop (with its new slogan, \u201cI am what I makeup,\u201d in neon lights) also followed the brand on Instagram before they would hand over a full-size mascara sample.The exchange was surprising to watch, if only for how normal it appeared to be for both sides. This younger generation of shoppers knows that in order to get something, you have to give something.An email address is typically the bare minimum. Amorepacific, a South Korean beauty conglomerate of 28 brands, wove attendees through a multistationed testing tour, with a representative explaining the benefits of products at each brand stop. At the end, shoppers received a tote bag with five single-use samples. Those who shared their emails were given an additional travel-size sample.The goal of the booth, which cost \u201cmultiple hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d according to Jessica Hanson, president of Amorepacific US, was to introduce its family of brands to more shoppers. To that end, perhaps more popular than the samples were the headbands Amorepacific gave away: white, flashing branded crowns, which attendees then wore, voluntarily and enthusiastically, throughout the convention hall as a kind of walking advertisement for the company.On its maiden Beautycon voyage, Aveda, a division of Est\u00e9e Lauder, lured attendees to its booth with a towering paper cherry tree next to a swing for photographs. The prop was a popular gathering spot over the weekend, providing ample backdrop for a logo and solving the eternal what-do-I-do-with-my-hands posing question.As people waited in line, Aveda staffers chatted with them about the Cherry Almond collection, which the company introduced the week of Beautycon, handing out scent sticks and samples. The collection was designed to appeal to women with long hair \u2014 73 percent of Millennials have hair that is shoulder length or longer, the brand says \u2014 with promises of \u201ctouchably soft\u201d tresses. It comes in bright-pink packaging and has a sweet scent.Aveda also handed out coupons for 15 percent off a shopper\u2019s first online order if placed by the end of the month and offered 20 percent off all purchases on site, a rarity for the brand. \u201cWe don\u2019t discount very often at all,\u201d said Cydney Strommen, director of marketing communications for Aveda-North America. Unlike the fashion world, which has been plagued by pricing pressure and rampant discounting, beauty brands very rarely go on sale.Nearly three-quarters of Beautycon\u2019s target audience \u2014 Gen Z-ers and younger millennials that Ms. Mahdara calls \u201cpivotals\u201d \u2014 say they are influenced more by \u201ccontent creators\u201d than traditional celebrities, according to Beautycon\u2019s research. Many of the digital stars that were the original draw have catapulted into massive, and massively profitable, operations, some boasting major sponsorship packages with five-figure appearance deals.\u201cFor regular people, you are like, \u2018Who are these people?\u2019\u201d said Ukonwa Ojo, chief marketing officer for consumer beauty at Coty, which had booths for CoverGirl, Rimmel London and Sally Hansen at Beautycon in New York and Los Angeles this year. But beauty junkies \u201cknow them and they love them,\u201d she said.Coty sees Beautycon as a rare chance for consumers to experiment with its products. The three showcased at Beautycon are primarily sold in drugstores and big box chains without a testing option. \u201cFor a lot of people it\u2019s the first time they have ever been to a place where they could try all of our products before,\u201d Ms. Ojo said.These beauty-obsessed consumers are particularly valuable resources for companies, she added, as they are more open to fashion-forward looks and willing to experiment with new products that have yet to go to a wide market.In Los Angeles, Rimmel London introduced 14 new shades of its Stay Matte Liquid Lip Colour, as well as the Wonder\u2019Fully Real Mascara. \u201cIf they love it, you\u2019ve won an advocate,\u201d Ms. Ojo said. And winning an advocate, she added, means that that shopper will share it with his or her followers, who may then want to try it themselves. Every one, after all, is an influencer.From his perch in a hall conference room, one floor up and overlooking the mazelike scene below, Beautycon\u2019s executive vice president, Tripp Mahan, smiled. He considers himself the event\u2019s \u201cconductor,\u201d with the stated goal of \u201ccurated chaos.\u201d\u201cIt has to be a very amped-up atmosphere,\u201d he said.How does one turn a light-filled, cement-floored, 347,000-square-foot hall into a party before noon? With a thumping DJ booth at the entrance and a series of choreographed mobs. Instead of escorting the talent to the booths quickly and discreetly in a golf cart, Mr. Mahan prefers to parade them through the show floor with security detail. The resulting swarm leads to what Beautycon calls \u201cfandomonium.\u201d Ms. Kardashian West was a notable exception; the Beautycon team went to great lengths to remove people from the backstage area where she entered.\u201cIf Meryl Streep walked up to you and me, we would just act cool and move on,\u201d Mr. Mahan said. But the fan-influencer relationship is much more intimate and intense. \u201cStars are just obligated to do a selfie,\u201d Mr. Mahan said.Michael David Magaraci, a 20-year-old from Long Island who trekked to Beautycon by himself, walked into the hall and straight to the main stage, where he snagged a seat in the front row and waited for hours to see Mrs. Kardashian West, who was promoting her KKW Beauty line.\u201cGrowing up, I was always taught, \u2018You don\u2019t wear makeup, you\u2019re a boy,\u2019\u201d he said. He was wearing no fewer than six of Mrs. Kardashian West\u2019s products on his face, including lip gloss and concealer, his thick brows groomed and filled in, and KKW\u2019s blue eye shadow artfully swiped across his lids. \u201cBeautycon is celebrating diversity, and through that diversity comes confidence,\u201d he added. \u201cI feel so amazing here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pursuit of $1 Trillion: Amazon Closes In on Apple", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe race to $1 trillion market value has gotten a lot closer.Amazon\u2019s market value finished Wednesday at $894 billion, nearly $42 billion below Apple\u2019s market capitalization of $936 billion. That marked the narrowest gap between the market values of the two companies since 2006.Investors, traders and Wall Street analysts have speculated for years about which company would be first to surpass $1 trillion in market value. Apple has been the favorite since it became the largest publicly traded company in the United States in 2011. Google has also garnered a few mentions. Earlier this year, its market capitalization crossed $800 billion for the first time and was just $34 billion shy of Apple\u2019s.But Amazon has now passed Google on the list of largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Amazon\u2019s move above $900 billion highlights the run-up in its shares over the past nine months. On Oct. 26, 2017, its market capitalization stood at $467 billion, meaning its value has nearly doubled over that period. To put that in perspective, Amazon\u2019s gain in market capitalization is larger than the value of JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil, or Walmart. In fact, Amazon\u2019s increase would rank it the seventh largest company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.By comparison, Apple has stagnated over that period. The company\u2019s market capitalization first nudged past $900 billion at the start of November 2017, but since then, it has risen just 3.4 percent through Wednesday\u2019s close.Amazon\u2019s time in the $900 billion club has been brief so far. Its stock slipped Wednesday and is down slightly again Thursday, pushing its market value to $876 billion.Apple gained 1 percent in early trading Thursday, pushing its market value to $950 billion. That puts Apple more comfortably in the lead. Still, any disappointments or surprises from either could yet unsettle the race.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Shrugs Off $5.1 Billion Fine With Another Big Quarter", "Date": "2018-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 European authorities took their best swing, but it appears that Google hardly felt it.Alphabet\u2019s stock rose 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, and some analysts recommended the company\u2019s shares. With the regulatory issue settled, they said, Google could get back to focusing on selling ads across the internet.\u201cIt\u2019s like a delivery company having to pay for a parking ticket,\u201d Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst, said of the penalty, which Alphabet accounted for in the second quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a meaningful fine in the context of the size of this company.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s previous record fine was also aimed at Google, a $2.7 billion levy it imposed last year for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in its search results. Google booked that charge in the same quarter a year ago \u2014 and still posted a $3.5 billion profit.More substantive than the fine are the changes that will come to the company\u2019s Android software, which backs 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones. European authorities ordered Google to stop effectively requiring phone makers in Europe to install Google\u2019s search engine and Chrome internet browser on their devices in order to use the Android software.Such a change could mean fewer people using Google\u2019s search engine on their phones, which would undercut an advertising business that is fueled by users clicking on ads in mobile search results.But it is Google that is responsible for crafting a remedy, and it will have much incentive to propose one that limits the impact on its business. After Google complied with last year\u2019s European Union\u2019s charges related to its shopping service, competitors complained that its solution did little to reduce the harm to their businesses.Google is \u201clooking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said on a call with analysts on Monday.Mr. Pichai said Google planned to appeal the charges, though it still must implement a remedy by mid-October or risk more fines. (The company said it was depositing the fine payment in a holding account while the legal process unfolds.) He said last week that Android lowered prices for consumers and encouraged competition in the smartphone market by helping handset makers compete with Apple. Google has said that it provides Android for free to phone makers and it must recoup its expenses by including its services with the software.Europe\u2019s new data privacy rule, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, appeared to have had little effect on Google\u2019s bottom line. The law, which restricts how companies obtain and handle users\u2019 information, sent many businesses scrambling to comply earlier this year. But some analysts believe Google and its partner in the digital-advertising duopoly, Facebook, stand to benefit from the rules because they can afford to comply while smaller competitors might not.Mr. Wieser said that after reviewing Google\u2019s earnings, the privacy rule \u201cprobably helped, at least in the European numbers.\u201d Alphabet\u2019s revenues rose 26 percent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East over the same period a year ago, though some of the increase was related to currency fluctuations.Alphabet\u2019s revenues in the quarter increased 26 percent to $32.7 billion as users clicked on more of the ads that Google serves atop its search results and before YouTube videos. Alphabet earned $11.75 a share in the quarter, excluding the fine, easily beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $9.54 a share.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Urges Congress to Regulate Use of Facial Recognition", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a lengthy blog post about the potential uses and abuses of facial recognition, Bradford L. Smith, the company\u2019s president, compared the technology to products like medicines and cars that are highly regulated, and he urged Congress to study it and oversee its use.Tech giants rarely advocate regulation of their innovations, and Mr. Smith\u2019s unusual entreaty illustrates how powerful technologies involving artificial intelligence \u2014 including facial recognition \u2014 have set off a contentious battle among tech executives. These technologies have the potential to remake industries. They could also reduce workers\u2019 job prospects or result in unequal opportunities for consumers, leading some to argue that the products are too risky for tech companies to deploy without government oversight.Mr. Smith\u2019s appeal also comes as Silicon Valley is facing withering scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy experts. Several companies have been harshly criticized in recent months for their role in spreading false information during the 2016 election, and exploiting users\u2019 personal data. In response, some businesses, like Facebook, have expressed more openness to regulation of practices like political advertising.With many of its rivals under fire, Microsoft has aggressively tried to position itself as the moral compass of the industry. Company executives have been outspoken about safeguarding users\u2019 privacy as well as warning about the potential discriminatory effects of using automated algorithm to make important decisions like hiring.Now that facial recognition has become a new lightning rod for critics, Microsoft is taking the lead in calling for some regulatory restraint.The powerful technology can be used to identify people in photos or video feeds without their knowledge or permission. Proponents see it as a potentially important tool for identifying criminals, but civil liberties experts have warned that the technology could enable mass surveillance, hindering people\u2019s ability to freely attend political protests or go about their day-to-day lives in anonymity.In calling for government oversight of facial recognition, Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of any new state efforts to tightly regulate the technology. Mr. Smith, the company\u2019s president, suggested that governments around the world examine both law enforcement and commercial uses of the technology.\u201cShould law enforcement use of facial recognition be subject to human oversight and controls?\u201d he wrote. \u201cShould the law require that companies obtain prior consent before collecting individuals\u2019 images for facial recognition?\u201dIn the European Union, many of these questions have already been settled.Civil liberties and privacy advocates said they both welcomed and felt wary of Microsoft\u2019s push for government regulation, questioning how committed the company was to strong user privacy controls.April Isenhower, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said that the company had long been committed to privacy, including pushing for a national consumer privacy law in the United States since 2005.Tech companies are spreading facial recognition in part because it provides a powerful way for them to connect consumers\u2019 online and real lives.In addition to using facial recognition for its own consumer services, Microsoft \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 also sells the software to others.Mr. Smith wrote in the blog post that Microsoft was examining its own development and marketing of the technology.He also said Microsoft had rejected facial recognition requests from certain customers \u201cwhere we\u2019ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,\u201d and that the company was committed to \u201cestablishing a transparent set of principles\u201d for the technology.Microsoft employees recently protested the company\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that has been involved in the separation of migrant children from their families at the border. In his blog post, Mr. Smith wrote that the company\u2019s contract with that agency \u201cisn\u2019t being used for facial recognition\u201d or to separate families.Ms. Isenhower, the Microsoft spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about whether the company provided facial recognition services to other government agencies or whether it had put any specific restrictions on its customers\u2019 use of the technology. She also declined to discuss the company\u2019s position on consumer consent for facial recognition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tried to Protect Qualcomm. Now His Trade War May Be Hurting It.", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of Qualcomm, has been waiting for a phone call with news from China. It has been a long wait.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Mollenkopf appeared resigned to Qualcomm\u2019s lack of options with China\u2019s review. \u201cWe can only influence so much,\u201d he said.But the chief executive, a company veteran who took the top job in 2014, also struck an optimistic tone, arguing that Qualcomm can prosper without NXP because \u201cwe have a good technology road map.\u201d\u201cThat technology road map is going to be valuable regardless of whatever the outcome is with NXP,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said.In addition, Mr. Mollenkopf said, if the NXP deal does not go through, Qualcomm plans a stock buyback of $20 billion to $30 billion to help lift its stock price.Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said Qualcomm\u2019s political stalemate with China and the question of whether the company could integrate NXP effectively had led some investors to prefer a buyback. \u201cPeople just want certainty, one way or another,\u201d he said.The fallout from the trade war is the latest challenge for Mr. Mollenkopf, who has been on the hot seat for much of his tenure as chief executive. Qualcomm has been hurt by slower sales of smartphones, while an unusual business model that combines patent licensing with chip sales has prompted antitrust squabbles on three continents.Qualcomm\u2019s share price has been largely under pressure since January 2017, when its longtime customer Apple and the Federal Trade Commission filed lawsuits accusing Qualcomm of abusing its market power and patent position to charge unfairly high royalties. The company has rejected the accusations.It\u2019s unclear if China might now relent on NXP, or keep withholding approval of the deal to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s trade tariffs. \u201cOne weapon is obviously the Qualcomm weapon,\u201d said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank.China\u2019s antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to a faxed request for comment. The country would be the ninth jurisdiction to complete a customary antitrust review of Qualcomm\u2019s NXP deal; eight others, including the United States, have approved it.An NXP spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Richard Clemmer, the company\u2019s chief executive, who said the chip maker continued to believe in the Qualcomm transaction.Mr. Mollenkopf embarked on the NXP deal nearly two years ago to reduce Qualcomm\u2019s dependence on the maturing mobile phone market. While Qualcomm primarily makes mobile chips and earns most of its profit from royalty payments from handset makers, NXP sells more than 14,000 different chips that are widely used in cars, mobile payments and other applications.The deal, announced in October 2016, seemed ambitious from the start. NXP has nearly as many employees as Qualcomm \u2014 about 30,000 \u2014 and a tradition of operating factories, which still make some of its products. Qualcomm has always relied on other companies to make the chips it designs.Regulatory approval was expected to take time, with the companies predicting they would not be able to close the deal until the end of 2017. But the review has dragged on even longer. In Europe and South Korea, where Qualcomm has faced antitrust challenges from regulators, the authorities won concessions to make sure the company would not unfairly exploit patents on a payment technology called near-field communications it would acquire by buying NXP.China presented special issues. The country\u2019s regulatory authorities have taken an activist stance on antitrust reviews in the past few years. Qualcomm gets more than half of its revenue from the country, but its relations with customers and Beijing have not always been smooth.Mr. Mollenkopf, who rose through Qualcomm\u2019s engineering ranks and helped lead chip development efforts, said the company had endured a turbulent period. But one thing is certain, he said: There will be no extension of the NXP deal deadline beyond next Wednesday, when Qualcomm reports quarterly earnings.\u201cWe think NXP is a great deal for us,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get done, we also have means to create value in different ways.\u201dRaymond Zhong contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix, the Stock Market\u2019s Big Hope, Disappoints", "Date": "2018-07-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen rising interest rates and trade tensions weighed on the stock market in recent months, investors could always comfort themselves with four words: \u201cThere is always Netflix.\u201dNot on Monday.Netflix disappointed investors with news that it added substantially fewer subscribers in the second quarter than expected. The company\u2019s stock, which had more than doubled this year as the wider market stalled, plunged 14 percent after the close of regular trading.While Netflix\u2019s revenue and profits are still surging, the shortfall in subscriber growth is a reminder that companies priced for perfection can disappoint when optimism seems to be at a peak. And the slip-up will revive skepticism about Netflix\u2019s business model.Netflix had forecast that it would add 1.2 million new United States subscribers in the second quarter, but it signed up only 674,000. Internationally, the company gained 4.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, below Netflix\u2019s expectations for five million. Revenue rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $3.91 billion but was slightly below the total that Wall Street analysts had expected.Netflix is hardly in trouble. Paid subscriptions were still up 26 percent from a year earlier. And in recent quarters, subscriber numbers exceeded Netflix\u2019s projections, so Monday\u2019s disappointment may not amount to much in the scheme of things.Still, the company\u2019s stock shows that Netflix has a lot to live up to. The company\u2019s share price, after Monday\u2019s plunge, is equivalent to 107 times the per-share earnings that analysts expect Netflix to make this year. This price-to-earnings ratio is far higher than it is on the stocks of many other technology companies. Bullish investors may contend that such a ratio is justifiable, given that analysts expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to keep growing quickly. Profits are expected to rise 58 percent this year, and 66 percent next.But the subscriber growth fell short at what could turn out to be a challenging time for Netflix. It\u2019s facing competition from Amazon, Hulu, Google and, perhaps, Apple. The Walt Disney Company is buying much of Fox, in part, to bolster its planned streaming service. And, of course, AT&T has big ambitions for Time Warner, which it is acquiring for its video content. Big hit shows, like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d helped Netflix attract new subscribers. The more companies striving to produce blockbusters, the harder it may become for Netflix to maintain the pace of its subscriber growth.And in a drawn-out fight, in which everyone is spending large sums on programming, investors may find it harder to overlook Netflix\u2019s negative cash flows. The company made $674 million in the first half of this year. But its operations used up $755 million of cash during that period.Advertisement"}

Both he and his lawyer sent letters to the board over the weekend suggesting that he was pressured to resign without any investigation into the circumstances, which he said included an extortion attempt. Relinquishing the position, he wrote, \u201cwas a mistake.\u201dMs. Glaser said that the Papa John\u2019s board should conduct an investigation into the claims that led to Mr. Schnatter\u2019s removal as chairman. She has sent a letter to the board saying that members cannot remove him as a director without a shareholder vote.For decades, Mr. Schnatter has loomed large over Papa John\u2019s, his personality bound tightly its business strategy as he expanded the company into a chain with more than 5,000 locations around the world, appearing in its television ads and even on the boxes its pizza is delivered in.With a market value of more than $1.7 billion, Papa John\u2019s is now the fourth-largest pizza chain in the country, behind Domino\u2019s, Pizza Hut and Little Caesars, according to the restaurant market research firm Technomic.But Mr. Schnatter, who also owns nearly 30 percent of Papa John\u2019s stock, has drawn an outsize amount of criticism in a short amount of time.Last fall, he complained that the National Football League had hurt Papa John\u2019s sales by failing to handle football players who protested racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.The comments were praised by white supremacists but denounced by many consumers and investors. Mr. Schnatter stepped down as chief executive. Papa John\u2019s gave up a longtime sponsorship deal with the N.F.L. and was promptly replaced by Pizza Hut.The latest furor stems from a May 22 conference call with Laundry Service, a marketing agency, that was intended to prepare him for future questions about diversity.During the call, he was confronted about the N.F.L. uproar and asked whether he was racist, Mr. Schnatter wrote in a letter to the Papa John\u2019s board that was reviewed by The New York Times. He denied the assertion and then, Mr. Schnatter wrote, he said Col. Harland Sanders, who founded the Kentucky Fried Chicken fast-food chain and was its longtime spokesman, used the racial slur to describe black people. Colonel Sanders died in 1980.But Mr. Schnatter said he would never use that word.\u201cLet me be very clear: I never used the \u2018N\u2019 word in that meeting as a racial epithet, nor would I ever,\u201d he wrote.The day after the call, Papa John\u2019s decided to fire Laundry Service, Mr. Schnatter wrote. The pizza company owed $1.3 million for the marketing firm\u2019s services, but Laundry Service said that some of its employees had been offended by Mr. Schnatter\u2019s comments on the call and demanded $6 million, with one of its lawyers threatening to conduct \u201ca smear campaign,\u201d Mr. Schnatter wrote. Papa John\u2019s offered to pay $2.5 million, he wrote.Laundry Service declined to comment, but in an internal memo reviewed by The Times, the company said on Tuesday that \u201cdisparaging and outrageous comments\u201d made in news reports about the company and Wasserman, the talent management company that owns it, \u201care completely false.\u201dBoard members who suggested that he also give up his board seat \u201cwere acting on rumor and innuendo,\u201d Mr. Schnatter wrote, adding that Papa John\u2019s \u201chas demonstrated that it does not know how to handle a crisis based on misinformation.\u201d\u201cI will not allow either my good name or the good name of the company I founded and love to be unfairly tainted,\u201d he wrote.Since then, Major League Baseball has suspended a promotion arrangement with Papa John\u2019s. The mayor of Jeffersonville, Ind., Mr. Schnatter\u2019s hometown, stripped a local gym of his name. The New York Yankees and the Oregon State University athletics department cut ties with the company.Papa John\u2019s has said that it will commission an independent audit of its diversity policies and culture and also send its senior management team to stores around the country to hear employees\u2019 concerns.Still, its best course of action may just be to wait things out, in a political environment with \u201cso much rhetoric and hostility in the air\u201d and confusion caused by differing accounts of the Laundry Service call, said Mark A. Cohen, a former chief executive of several retail companies who teaches business at Columbia University.\u201cTo a super majority of the customers of this brand, what just occurred is meaningless,\u201d said Mr. Cohen. \u201cThe consumer has an extremely short attention span.\u201dPapa John\u2019s now faces the tricky task of disentangling itself from its founder and convincing its customers and investors to move on. The company may need to rebrand itself \u2014 a process that is \u201cnot fast and not cheap,\u201d said John Danner, a lecturer at the business school of the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cIn the short term, it is all about survival and damage control,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to make a commitment to atone, it had better be genuine and you had better be able to stick to it, because you\u2019re only going to have one bite of the apple.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Used Apple\u2019s New Controls to Limit a Teenager\u2019s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)", "Date": "2018-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixEven as people have embraced the smartphone as one of the most powerful tech products, they are keeping a wary eye on the addictiveness of turning on the device to check for social media updates, read websites and play games. Some studies have tied extended screen time to distraction in classrooms, sleep deprivation and depression.First, a primer on how Screen Time works. The feature, which lives inside the iPhone\u2019s settings, shows a dashboard of data about your iPhone use. You can look at your stats for the day or week, including the amount of time you spent on specific apps and on the phone over all. Inside the dashboard, you can create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games. When you run out of time with an app, it locks you out.Over the last three weeks, I studied Sophie\u2019s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on \u2014 Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter \u2014 I placed a few time limits on each of us.Here\u2019s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt \u201ctriggered\u201d (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat.\u201cIt was just a pattern for me \u2014 to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I\u2019m trying not to do that.\u201dBut in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie\u2019s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie\u2019s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself).These early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple\u2019s new software.Here\u2019s a weekly diary on how Screen Time altered our phone use.Sophie and I had a rough start with the experiment because of technical difficulties. Apple\u2019s iOS 12 is still in beta, meaning an unfinished version of the software system is being tested by app developers and early adopters \u2014 and we ran into major bugs.For most of the first week, a bug prevented me from seeing Sophie\u2019s Screen Time statistics. But at the end of the week, after Apple released a software fix, her weekly stats appeared. They revealed that she had used her phone for six hours and seven minutes a day on average over the week. I could also see that Sophie was sometimes sneaking glances at her iPhone past midnight, when she was supposed to be asleep.After I shared the data with my editor, she bombarded Sophie with a flurry of disapproving text messages and fiery emoji.Meanwhile, my stats showed that I had used my phone for three hours and 46 minutes a day on average over the week. The majority of my time was spent using the Twitter app Tweetbot, and a significant amount was wasted playing Zynga Poker.With Screen Time now working properly, I placed limits for both Sophie and myself. For her, I set a 30-minute limit on gaming and a 60-minute limit on social networking. To help her sleep, I also turned on Downtime, a setting that disables most parts of the phone for a set time, from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.I gave myself the same one-hour limit for social networking apps. But instead of setting a limit for games, I opted to nip my Zynga Poker addiction in the bud by deleting the game and kissing my dreams of being a fake-money billionaire goodbye.Even though Sophie was initially incensed about being locked out of Snapchat after an hour, she eventually came around to enjoying the limit.In fact, she asked for more limits. She said she was wasting too much time reading articles on the Safari browser, so she asked for a 90-minute limit there. She also requested that I keep all the limits on until she finished the monthlong summer camp she was just beginning.I happily obliged. \u201cI raised her so well,\u201d I told my editor.As for me, I realized that when I ran into my limit on Twitter, I would find other ways to stay glued to my phone. I caught myself repeatedly checking my bank account and loading the same news sites over and over.Sophie\u2019s progress was remarkable. Mine not so much. By the end of that week, she managed to cut her average phone use to four hours and 44 minutes a day, down 23 percent from the previous week. (I\u2019m sure the trauma from her mother\u2019s outburst of emoji had something to do with it.)My average screen use barely decreased \u2014 to about three and a half hours a day.At the beginning of the third week, phone use continued to steeply decline for Sophie.On some days that week, Sophie\u2019s phone use was lower than mine. On Tuesday afternoon, her screen time dipped to about two and a half hours, whereas mine had already exceeded three hours.At this point, I felt pathetic. (If I were young, I might have said I felt \u201ctriggered.\u201d) I asked myself: What kind of parent am I if I\u2019m more addicted than my teenage daughter to a smartphone? Who would listen to this degenerate?When I shared this revelation with Sophie, she chuckled and replied: \u201cYou use your phone more than me?\u201dSo for the rest of the week, I kept pushing myself to beat her. I logged out of Twitter after each time I used it in the web browser. I stopped checking my bank account, assuring myself that no more money would magically appear.It felt similar to competing with friends on Fitbit to see who could accumulate the most steps \u2014 the only difference here was that I was trying to win by doing less.On Friday, my phone use was one hour and 51 minutes. Sophie\u2019s was three hours and 17 minutes. With a fist pump I exclaimed, \u201cWhat now, Sophie?\u201dYet in the end, my average daily use for the week was three hours and 36 minutes. That\u2019s largely because on the Fourth of July and throughout the weekend I spent a total of eight hours driving \u2014 with Google Maps running on my phone screen. That doesn\u2019t seem as if it should count against my Screen Time since my eyes were mostly on the road.But alas, with Sophie averaging just over three hours a day, I lost fair and square.I checked in with Sophie to ask how she felt after completing the experiment. She said that other than being a bit more focused on homework for her camp, and sleeping with fewer interruptions, she felt about the same.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying having my phone but not being able to use it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it increases my good habits, though.\u201dShe also made one more request: \u201cCould you add another limit for Netflix?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Could Soon Be Worth $1 Trillion as Profits Pour In", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple reported another strong quarter of profits on Tuesday, as consumers kept buying iPhones and paying more for them, news that could soon help make the Silicon Valley giant the first public company to be worth more than $1 trillion.Apple said its profit increased to $11.52 billion in its most recent quarter, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier, showing that the company\u2019s enormous business selling iPhones and other gadgets continues to breeze along.The strong results beat Wall Street estimates, sending the company\u2019s shares about 4 percent higher on Wednesday to a new record and for a market value of more than $950 billion.Apple\u2019s ascent past $1 trillion in market value would further confirm a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago. The steep growth was driven by a series of new products that upended the technology industry \u2014 and, in some cases, society \u2014 and that remain big sellers.Apple said it sold 41.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up less than 1 percent from a year earlier. But iPhone revenues rose 20 percent because Apple is getting customers to pay nearly 20 percent more for the devices on average, a trend driven by its flagship $1,000 iPhone X.\u201cThat\u2019s a sign that the iPhone X, despite its high price, is resonating with consumers,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research.Apple is also offsetting some slowing growth of its hardware sales with an accelerating business charging customers for apps, data storage and other services. Revenue from those services grew 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the quarter, and Apple Music surpassed Spotify in the quarter as the most popular music-streaming service in North America, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, suggested on the company\u2019s earnings call.Total revenues in the quarter were $53.27 billion, up 17 percent from a year earlier.Buying back so much stock helps keep its price high, rewarding investors. \u201cThey have so much cash and so much buying power, they can synthetically support the stock. So it\u2019s very hard to bet against,\u201d said Sander Read, chief executive of Lyons Wealth Management. His firm, an investment adviser near Orlando, Fla., has invested roughly $30 million of the $200 million it manages in Apple stock.Apple said Tuesday that its revenue in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had increased 19 percent to $9.55 billion, nearly the same rate of growth for its sales in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Successful Investing", "Date": "2018-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfIt really is a shame that Taylor Larimore chooses to use the word \u201cBoglehead\u201d in the title of his compelling new book: \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio\u201d (Wiley, $24.95.)There is nothing really wrong with the word. It refers to people who follow the investment principles of John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, the huge mutual fund company known for offering index funds.Mr. Bogle passionately believes in paying the absolute minimum when buying and selling stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds, investing for the long haul \u2014 to minimize both trading costs and capital gains \u2014 and diversifying your holdings.Mr. Larimore, who has been described by Mr. Bogle as \u201cking of the Bogleheads,\u201d accepts these ideas as gospel. And then he goes further, arguing convincingly in this short \u2014 112-page \u2014 engaging book that you can create a solid performing diversified portfolio with just three index funds.One fund invests in just about all United States stocks. Another holds almost every international equity. A third fund is made up of bonds from thousands of United States companies and government agencies. All three are what is typically known as total market index funds \u2014 one for domestic stocks, one for international stocks and one for bonds.So what\u2019s my problem with the word Boglehead? The word, coupled with Mr. Bogle\u2019s introduction to the book and the fact that three funds Mr. Larimore uses as his primary example come from Vanguard, can lead people to think they can only create a three-fund portfolio using Vanguard funds.That is simply not true as even Mr. Larimore \u2014 94 and a self-taught investor \u2014 points out.For many years, \u201cVanguard was the only mutual fund company where total market index funds were available,\u201d he writes. \u201cInvestors are now able to construct the three-fund portfolio with whichever company they prefer.\u201dStill, Mr. Larimore is a \u201cBoglehead\u201d and a co-author of two other \u201cBoglehead\u201d books (\u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing,\u201d Wiley, $26.95, and \u201cThe Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Retirement Planning,\u201d Wiley, $16.95), so we are stuck with the word.But that it is not unique does not minimize the appeal of Mr. Larimore\u2019s idea. People who think investing is difficult and time consuming tend to put it off, and this could get them to act.That is a good thing, as is the fact that Mr. Larimore advocates using index funds, which not only come with lower costs than actively managed ones but typically outperform them.In addition, using only three distinct funds eliminates potential overlap. When you own many mutual funds, the odds are that the same holding (say Apple) will appear in two or more of them, which could reduce the overall diversification of your portfolio.And, of course, having only three funds makes rebalancing your portfolio easier, when stock market gains, for example, leave you with a greater percentage of your wealth in equities than you want.As much as I like this book, I have two and a half bones to pick.The half first. I could have done without the constant praise from his fellow Bogleheads \u2014 who are known only by their initials in the book \u2014 for the three-fund idea. It\u2019s a good idea. Fine. No need to keep saying so.But after repeating that old investment chestnut that you should hold a percentage of stocks equal to 100 minus your age \u2014 for example, if you are 35, your portfolio should be 65 percent stocks and the rest bonds \u2014 he doesn\u2019t really say more.The problem with that is twofold. One size does not fit all. And second, subtracting your age from 100 produces what I think is a fairly conservative portfolio. My rule of thumb, if you need one, would be to subtract your age from 110 to establish a baseline for your stock holdings.My second problem with the book is that the three-fund portfolio he advocates includes no corporate bonds or government bonds from countries other than the United States. If you are going to have international stocks in your portfolio, shouldn\u2019t you have foreign bonds as well?I have been writing and talking about personal finance as part of my living for more than 30 years, and one thing I believe passionately is that people like me \u2014 those who want to help you manage your money better \u2014 tend to make things more complicated than necessary.We do it, I think, not to show off but because we find the subject fascinating. And so we go on at interminable length talking about basis points (one hundredth of 1 percent), inverted yield curves (when long-term debt pays a lower interest rate than short-term borrowings), and decumulation (how you use your savings to fund your retirement.)As a result, we often scare or confuse people.Mr. Larimore\u2019s prose won\u2019t scare anyone.It\u2019s accessible and his tone is friendly. And if it prompts people to create a diversified portfolio that keeps fees and taxes to a minimum and gets them to invest for the long haul, he will have performed a great service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley\u2019s Giants Take Their Talent Hunt to Cambridge", "Date": "2018-07-03", "News": "A boom in artificial intelligence research has drawn the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies and their checkbooks to the storied English city.Supported byCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 When you step off the train here and walk into the city square outside the railway station, you will not see the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel or the turrets atop the Trinity Great Court. The University of Cambridge is still a cab ride away. But you will see a stone and glass office building with a rooftop patio. This is where Amazon designs its flying drones.Their arrival provides a welcome fillip for the British economy that\u2019s expected to be bruised by its departure from the European Union. Apple, Amazon and Google established research and engineering hubs in Britain by acquiring companies that emerged from local universities, spending millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.There are more than 4,500 high-tech firms in Cambridge, employing nearly 75,000 people, many of them commuters from other communities, according to Cambridge Network, a city business group.Just across the street from Amazon\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, ARM, the computer chip company owned by SoftBank, the Japanese tech giant, recently moved a team of engineers into a row of temporary offices. And a new building is going up just yards away. This is where Samsung, the South Korean tech conglomerate, will soon open another artificial intelligence lab, hiring as many as 150 researchers, engineers and other staff.\u201cFor anybody who hasn\u2019t been here for 20 years, they may say: \u2018Is this the same place?\u2019\u201d said Claire Ruskin, the chief executive of Cambridge Network, as she drove through the city on a recent afternoon.But those buildings outside the train station are reminders that Britain \u2014 like Europe as a whole \u2014 does not have its own internet powerhouse, a corporate power capable of pushing the world in new technical, cultural and political directions. The closest match was ARM, and that was acquired by SoftBank in 2016.In London, a 45-minute train ride from Cambridge, you will find DeepMind, perhaps the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab. DeepMind is at the forefront of a technological revolution that many believe will shift economic and societal norms across the globe, and it was acquired by Google in 2014.\u201cWe welcome the big existing companies,\u201d said Matthew Hancock, the British secretary of state who oversees digital policy. \u201cBut we\u2019re incredibly determined to ensure that the next generation of companies are built here.\u201dOn a recent Friday morning, Chris Bishop, who oversees Microsoft Research Cambridge, looked out his fifth-floor office window, with its panoramic view of Cambridge, and pointed to the spires of King\u2019s College Chapel rising over the trees in the distance. \u201cAlan Turing was at King\u2019s,\u201d he said.In 1950, with his essay \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d Turing, the British mathematician, codebreaker and computing pioneer, asked whether machines would ever think on their own. Mr. Bishop, an A.I. researcher who studied at Oxford and took a professorship at the University of Edinburgh before moving to Cambridge, views his work as another link in a long British legacy.Five years ago, Microsoft moved its lab to the city-block-size building near the rail station. Many of Mr. Bishop\u2019s former students and colleagues now work at other big tech companies.Neil Lawrence, a University of Sheffield professor who studied with Mr. Bishop at Cambridge, now works at the new Amazon Cambridge Development Center just down the street. Two prominent A.I. researchers who worked under Mr. Bishop at Microsoft have since moved to Google and DeepMind.Many of these researchers, like a number of other top A.I. researchers in Britain, were born outside the country. Still, local policymakers are concerned about local talent moving into foreign companies.\u201cWe have some of the top A.I. researchers in the world in the U.K.,\u201d said Dame Wendy Hall, a computer science professor at the University of Southampton. \u201cHow do we stop the A.I. brain drain to the U.S. \u2014 or to the U.S. companies anyway?\u201dLast year, the British government commissioned a report on the country\u2019s A.I. landscape from Dame Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the chief executive of BenevolentAI, an artificial intelligence start-up based in London. Within weeks of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pesenti moved to Facebook. He is now vice president of artificial intelligence in the company\u2019s New York office.\u201cIt does illustrate the point,\u201d Dame Hall said. \u201cOnce your head is above the parapet in this world, you draw interest, particularly from the big Silicon Valley giants.\u201dThe report called for increased financing for universities, and in the months following the government responded, saying it would fund 200 new Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence and related fields by 2020 and invest a total of $500 million in math, digital and technical education across Britain.In Cambridge, there are bigger questions about the boundaries between academia and industry. Even those who have prospered financially from the dynamic aren\u2019t sure where to draw the line.Zoubin Ghahramani, a Cambridge professor who sold a start-up to Uber and is now the company\u2019s chief scientist while still maintaining his ties with the university, worries about a brain drain from Europe in artificial intelligence. He has called for the creation of a European research institute to recruit people in the region who may otherwise go work for a Silicon Valley firm.His colleague at Cambridge Steve Young, a respected speech-recognition researcher who has sold companies to Microsoft, Google and Apple, noted that it was \u201calmost impossible\u201d for the university to compete for staff against tech companies, limiting who will teach the next generation of students. \u201cThat could have some very severe consequences,\u201d he said.His comment came with a laugh. Mr. Young splits time between the university and Apple, where an important part of his job is recruitment for the company. \u201cI don\u2019t recruit from Cambridge,\u201d he joked.Vishal Chatrath was the first employee and the chief business officer at VocalIQ, a Cambridge speech technology start-up that Apple acquired in late 2015 and transformed into a local Siri development center. Now, just two blocks from Apple\u2019s Cambridge outpost, he oversees a new start-up called Prowler, which aims to automate business decisions that are typically made by humans.\u201cA lot of capital is now flowing in Cambridge, and that capital helps push the next wave of entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Chatrath said.For others, the question is whether start-ups like this will evolve into vibrant companies \u2014 or just disappear into a company like Apple or Google.The big American companies are also attracted by the salaries they can pay here. According to the recruitment website Hired, the average tech salary in London is $78,000 a year, versus $142,000 in Silicon Valley.\u201cIt remains one of the huge competitive advantages that you can get the same, or better, talent for cheaper and less churn,\u201d said Matt Clifford, a co-founder of Entrepreneur First, a start-up incubator in London that recruits students from Cambridge and Oxford. Entrepreneur First helped create Magic Pony, yet another A.I. company, which Twitter acquired for $150 million in 2016.But some wonder whether these companies could better serve Britain by staying independent.Following a similar path were start-ups like VocalIQ (acquired by Apple) and Evi, the company that Amazon acquired in 2013 as part of its effort to build the Alexa digital assistant. Evi was the foundation for Amazon\u2019s Cambridge operation.Many have applauded the enormous economic change these acquisitions are helping to drive in London and Cambridge. But not everyone is clapping.Last year, in Cambridge, a new housing development was vandalized with graffiti written in Latin: \u201cLocus in Domos Loci Populum.\u201d As the BBC reported, this translates to \u201clocal homes for local people.\u201d As the tech workers land the big salaries, home prices are skyrocketing, and the locals are being squeezed out. It is yet another example of Silicon Fen\u2019s looking a lot like Silicon Valley.A photo caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind in London. It is inside the Google offices at King\u2019s Cross, not next door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qualcomm Scraps $44 Billion NXP Deal After China Inaction", "Date": "2018-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company had already cautioned that the deal was likely to be scrapped, assuming no last-minute approval by Chinese authorities came by a midnight deadline. Both NXP and Qualcomm formally announced the termination on Thursday. NXP said it would receive a $2 billion termination fee from Qualcomm as a result, while Qualcomm said it would buy back up to $30 billion of its stock.Trade experts had said China appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm deal to gain negotiating leverage. Eight other jurisdictions, including the United States, had already approved Qualcomm\u2019s purchase of the Dutch chip maker. China was the exception, dragging the review process out to more than 20 months.The formal deadline for consummation of the acquisition was midnight Eastern time.Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said the decision was a difficult one, triggered by a need to end the uncertainty surrounding the deal.\u201cWe weighed that risk against the likelihood of a change in the current geopolitical environment, which we didn\u2019t believe was a high-probability outcome in the near future,\u201d he said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday afternoon. Qualcomm reported quarterly earnings and sales on Wednesday that were above its predictions.The outcome is a setback for San Diego-based Qualcomm.Now it must convince shareholders that it can expand its business without NXP, which was expected to speed Qualcomm\u2019s expansion into chips for cars, mobile payments and other applications.Qualcomm gets most of its revenue from selling chips that help mobile phones communicate. But most of its profit comes from charging handset makers patent royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale price of their products.That unusual business model has prompted a series of legal battles with antitrust authorities and customers, including Apple. In one positive development for Qualcomm, Mr. Mollenkopf disclosed that it had received a $500 million payment from another licensee that has resisted paying royalties. Qualcomm has not disclosed the identity of the company, but analysts believe it is China\u2019s Huawei.Mr. Mollenkopf\u2019s go-it-alone strategy rests in large part on 5G, the next generation of cellular technology. Qualcomm predicts that 5G will have many uses beyond increasing the speed of smartphones, including car-to-car communications to improve safety, virtual reality goggles and wireless alternatives for home internet service.Qualcomm built a lucrative head start over rivals in delivering wireless chips when the current generation of 4G networks began arriving in 2010. The company believes it has a comparable technology edge in 5G, which poses technical challenges that include potentially relying on higher broadcast frequencies never used previously in cellular networks.The company said it was rapidly surmounting those obstacles, paving the way for some 5G services to begin arriving in the first half of 2019. Qualcomm engineers recently showed a software simulation indicating that a typical 5G user in San Francisco would get a 17-fold increase in average download speeds.\u201cWith every passing week, carriers around the world are announcing an expansion of their 5G rollouts, and we are a partner to nearly all of them,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said.But some analysts questioned the strength of demand for 5G services as well as Qualcomm\u2019s lead over rivals. Intel, for example, has recently succeeded in placing wireless chips in some Apple smartphones and has trumpeted its own 5G advances. Qualcomm disclosed Wednesday that it expected Apple to use only competing chips for its next iPhones.Amid the challenges, Qualcomm said its core business was improving. The company reported Wednesday that quarterly net income increased 41 percent on a 4 percent rise in revenue.Besides chips for smartphones, Qualcomm has said it has a backlog of orders from chips used in cars and other non-phone applications totaling $5 billion, up $2 billion from January.Raymond Zhong contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariffs? Time for a Plan B: \u2018Gobble Up Every Bit of Material That I Can\u2019", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith tariffs driving up the price of stainless steel, the precision-part manufacturer Accu-Swiss in Oakdale, Calif., came up with a plan to save money: turn off the lights but keep the machines on.\u201cWe are being hurt because of the cost increase,\u201d said Sohel Sareshwala, the company\u2019s owner and president. To squeeze more output from existing equipment, he is \u201crunning the machines in a lights-out operation.\u201d After his regular 10-person staff leaves for the day at 6 p.m., Mr. Sareshwala said, the plant is experimenting with slowing down the machines and letting them run unattended for four more hours.For large and small businesses around the nation, the impact of tariffs is expected to grow on Friday, after the Trump administration placed additional duties on $34 billion of Chinese products, many used in American manufacturing. China had said it would respond immediately with sanctions of its own.Mr. Sareshwala is among a growing number of importers and exporters departing from business as usual because of the gathering storm of trade sanctions.For Mr. Sareshwala at Accu-Swiss, Plan B is already the new normal.In his 19 years at the company, which produces parts for devices and machines used in the biomedical, food and semiconductor industries, he has dealt with a few unanticipated events, from the dot-com bust to the Great Recession. But until recently, it probably would have made more sense for him to plan for an earthquake at his San Joaquin Valley plant than a hefty tariff on his primary raw material.\u201cIt is very ironic to prepare for this kind of contingency in the United States,\u201d he said.Accu-Swiss doesn\u2019t use imported steel, but the tariffs have ratcheted up the demand for domestic steel, making it harder to find and afford. So far, Mr. Sareshwala said, his priority is delivering orders on time, regardless of the cost.\u201cI use a lot of stainless steel, so I\u2019m still trying to gobble up every bit of material that I can and not worry about the dollars and cents,\u201d he said. That strategy may wipe out his single-digit profit margin or even bring on a loss, he said, but in the short term he would rather lose money than customers.At the plant, in addition to the lights-out operation, Mr. Sareshwala has begun to stagger the starts of daytime shifts to stretch out the time in which operators are tending the machines.Since the 2016 election, the president\u2019s declarations about his readiness to wage a trade war have prompted heavy users of steel \u2014 foreign and domestic \u2014 to look into alternative supply lines. But some businesses said their contingency plans had not anticipated the extent of the shortages and rapidity of price increases, which started months ago.\u201cIn a few days, domestic companies raised prices on stainless steel anywhere from 15 to 25 percent,\u201d said Joe Carlson, president of Lakeside Manufacturing, a medical and food service equipment maker in Milwaukee with 175 employees. He is also president of the North American Association of Food Equipment Manufacturers, which represents more than 550 companies.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business 24 years, and I\u2019ve seen price increases and tariffs,\u201d Mr. Carlson said, \u201cbut haven\u2019t seen this combination before.\u201dEdward Farrer, director of purchasing at Principal Manufacturing in Broadview, Ill., which produces automobile parts, has felt the same effect. His company, which employs 330 people and has $50 million in annual sales, is a purchaser of imported steel and has not been able to find a domestic alternative.Even if one emerges, he said, \u201cthe tariffs have been a springboard for domestic producers to increase their price\u201d \u2014 and those higher costs will put American companies like his at a disadvantage compared with foreign manufacturers. Moreover, he said, any change in Principal\u2019s suppliers would require customer approval, an exhaustive process that would cause significant delays.Principal \u2014 whose customers include automotive suppliers and other major companies in the United States and abroad \u2014 accounts for contingencies like unexpected price swings in its contracts. \u201cWe have agreement for the ups and downs of markets,\u201d Mr. Farrer said, \u201cbut the increases are so significant now, customers are pushing back. Some discussions are contentious.\u201d\u201cDelivery dates are not changing, and product must be on time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are caught in the middle between politics, customers and steel producers.\u201dJohn Ferriola, president of Nucor, the largest American steel maker, said growing demand \u2014 driven by tax cuts and a rollback in federal regulation \u2014 was primarily responsible for the price increases.\u201cTariffs will result in some long-term price increases as excess, artificially low-cost foreign material is taken out of the market,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as steel buyers adjust to new supply chains and new domestic production comes online, we expect prices will normalize.\u201dSeveral manufacturers, however, said they were skeptical that domestic steel and aluminum makers had the capacity to meet the increased demand any time soon, and worried that prices would continue to rise \u2014 and even threaten jobs at their own companies. Mr. Farrer has halted all hiring, leaving about 30 positions unfilled, and has canceled, at least for now, a major capital purchase, two large machine tools.Mark Vaughn has similarly put a brake on hiring at his metal stamping plant in Nashville. As the year started, he planned to add five or six new machinists in $28-an-hour jobs. His tax bill was going down, he had a fat backlog of orders, and one of his biggest clients, the Swedish appliance manufacturer Electrolux, was planning to invest $250 million to modernize its nearby Springfield plant.Vaughn Manufacturing\u2019s backlog has dwindled, and Mr. Vaughn said he would probably have to revise price quotes he promised six months ago. Instead of expanding his work force, which he described as \u201cvery highly skilled,\u201d he is thinking of cutting five to 10 jobs out of his 50-person staff.The first rule in his contingency plan, he said, is to \u201ctake care of what you got and not overexpand.\u201d\u201cWe were probably in line for $2 million to $3 million worth of work\u201d making cooktops for Electrolux, he explained. And as for the new tax cuts, he pointed out, \u201cTariffs are a tax, so they took that advantage right back out of there.\u201dIn Milwaukee, Mr. Carlson of Lakeside Manufacturing said he had contracts to get steel through the summer, but was worried about the fall.

{"Headline": "E-Waste Offers an Economic Opportunity as Well as Toxicity", "Date": "2018-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThe police raid on a junkyard on the outskirts of Bangkok had all the trappings of a drug bust. Swarming onto the open-air property in late May, officers from the Royal Thai Police found undocumented workers from Laos and Myanmar engaged in dangerous work that exposed them to blasts of toxic fumes and dust \u2014 a common hazard on the lowest rung of their illegal and booming international trade. The products these workers handled, however, were not heroin or methamphetamines but vast piles of discarded computers, electrical wires and circuit boards. And it\u2019s very likely that much of this electronic waste came from one of the world\u2019s biggest producers: the United States.E-waste has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing trash stream. For all of us who have discarded a phone or computer for a newer, sleeker model, the reasons are hardly a mystery. Still, the growth is staggering: The worldwide accumulation of e-waste has more than doubled in the last nine years. In 2016, according to the United Nations University, a global think tank that tracks the problem, the yearly accumulation reached 49.3 million tons \u2014 enough to fill more than a million 18-wheel trucks stretching from New York to Bangkok and back. By 2021, the annual total is predicted to surpass 57 million tons.The explosion of e-waste highlights its dual (and dueling) identities as both environmental scourge and potential economic resource. Though often laced with lead, mercury or other toxic substances, laptops and phones also contain valuable elements like gold, silver and copper. Yet barely 20 percent of the world\u2019s e-waste is collected and delivered to formal recyclers. The fate of the rest is largely unknown. Only 41 nations compile e-waste statistics, and their partial data can\u2019t keep up with the expansion of electronic devices into so many consumer categories \u2014 toys and toilets, watches and refrigerators. In the United States, which generated an estimated 6.9 million tons of e-waste in 2016 (42 pounds per person), most e-waste probably goes straight into the trash. By one account, e-waste makes up just 2 percent of the total volume in American landfills \u2014 but more than two-thirds of heavy metals.A significant but ultimately unquantified portion of American e-waste is quietly exported, mostly to Asia. Until last year, China was handling an estimated 70 percent of the world\u2019s processed e-waste. In January, Beijing imposed a sweeping ban on the import of e-waste as part of its \u201cNational Sword\u201d campaign to slash the levels of what it calls \u201cforeign garbage.\u201d Though spurred by environmental concerns \u2014 rivers choked with toxic chemicals, local children with high levels of lead in their blood \u2014 Beijing\u2019s move also seems emblematic of its increasing self-sufficiency and growing rejection of the West. The ban has caused upheaval in the global trade in e-waste, diverting huge amounts to smaller nations ill equipped to handle the overflow.Even before the ban came into full effect, Chinese waste traders were setting up shop in Thailand. Days after the May raid outside Bangkok, the Thai police displayed seven containers at a local port, each packed with 24 tons of mostly broken electronics. So far, the Thai police have suspended the operations of five illegal e-waste processing facilities and found evidence of dozens of smaller high-polluting operations that risk contaminating the countryside. \u201cThailand is getting hit by a tidal wave of electronic waste,\u201d says Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based nonprofit that has used GPS devices to track illegal exports of e-waste to Asia. \u201cThe rest of Asia better get ready, because they are next.\u201dThe precious metals in e-waste, found especially in circuit boards, are more concentrated than in the most productive mines. In 2016, the gold in the world\u2019s e-waste equaled more than a tenth of the gold mined globally that year. And yet much of this treasure is simply reburied in landfills. Based on e-waste disposal rates, Americans alone throw out phones worth $60 million in gold and silver every year.The idea of \u201cmining\u201d e-waste has tantalized the recycling and electronics industries for decades. Until recently, most methods to extract value have been costly, inefficient and hazardous. Backyard recyclers in places like India and Indonesia recover gold by bathing circuit boards in nitric and hydrochloric acid, thus poisoning waterways and communities. Others, like the migrant workers in Thailand, break down used electronics with cooking stoves and shredders and wear no protection against the emissions.Over the last few years, however, innovators have devised safer techniques in the lab that would wrest value from e-waste. One isolates rare-earth elements with carbon nanotube technology; another recovers key minerals by bombarding them with underwater sound waves. Josh Lepawsky, a Canadian geographer and the author of \u201cReassembling Rubbish,\u201d finds hope in a curious phenomenon: the growing re-export of e-waste from the developing world back to advanced countries that have greater recycling capacity. An \u201ce-waste offset\u201d by which countries importing high-quality used electronics send back an equal volume of e-waste \u201cis very promising,\u201d Lepawsky says.As the extraction of metals becomes more efficient and eco-friendly, tech manufacturers may feel compelled to get raw materials from their own end-of-life products rather than from the earth. Apple, for instance, has pledged to make all of its future laptops and iPhones out of renewable resources or recycled materials. The idea goes beyond business to national security. \u201cGovernments are starting to take a more strategic view of e-waste, too,\u201d Khetriwal says. \u201cThey ask, \u2018How can we secure the raw materials we need for the future?\u2019\u2009\u201d Some of these metals and rare-earth elements are scarce, and some, like cobalt, are found mostly in conflict zones. By mining the ever-expanding mountains of e-waste, countries could steel themselves against the volatility in prices and supplies of the global market.Some e-waste optimists envision a \u201ccircular economy\u201d in which refurbished, reused and recycled raw materials help fuel a sustainable future. Japan was an early leader of this movement, pushing e-waste recycling with tough laws and, more recently, appealing gimmicks. At the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, athletes will receive gold, silver and bronze medals forged from recycled e-waste \u2014 emblems of a world in which e-waste can take on the sheen of immortality.The utopian vision of a circular economy is a long way off, though. E-waste recycling remains stubbornly low in most parts of the world. Even the extraction of precious metals has proved hard for companies to capitalize on. And the remaining mass of e-waste \u2014 mainly plastics laced with metals, chemicals and flame retardant \u2014 pose a more intractable problem. The recycling of these complex plastics would probably need to be subsidized or enforced through legislation \u2014 and few countries outside Europe or Japan have shown the commitment to make that happen.To move toward a circular economy, manufacturers would also need to embrace a \u201cgreen design\u201d that minimizes the generation of e-waste in the first place. Companies like Apple and Dell, though, have not taken enough measures to make their products easier to use longer. \u201cPlanned obsolescence,\u201d the intentional creation of products that rapidly become outdated so customers must replace them with ever-newer models, remains the modus operandi of the tech industry. Manufacturers argue that the approach stimulates not only profits but also the very innovation that drives the global economy. And it has produced a Pavlovian response in consumers, for whom the temptation to buy a slightly cooler phone every couple of years has hardened into a seeming necessity. Not long ago, one tech manufacturer introduced a cheaper, longer-lasting phone \u2014 the perfect antidote to planned obsolescence. It was not a hit \u2014 but it was a reminder that we all share some responsibility for the explosion of e-waste in scrap yards across the world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A $5.1 Billion Fine for Google Won\u2019t Fix Tech", "Date": "2018-07-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean and American officials need to find more effective ways to ensure competition in industries dominated by a handful of big players. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The European case is strongest when it argues against Google\u2019s exclusionary requirements \u2014 that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Google search app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Google products. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Google is hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google\u2019s and users can easily download software by other developers \u2014 something many people do. This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google\u2019s to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition. For his part, President Trump absurdly sought to turn the European Union\u2019s case into another example of how European officials are taking \u201cadvantage\u201d of the United States.Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done.

That\u2019s why it is important that lawmakers and regulators use all the tools they have to encourage competition and fair play.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Is Right About the E.U.\u2019s Penalty Against Google", "Date": "2018-07-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseLet\u2019s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union\u2019s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of Google.But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point.It\u2019s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission.The commission, which is the union\u2019s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects.But the heart of the decision involved Google\u2019s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company\u2019s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs.The commission called this a classic \u201ctying\u201d arrangement, in which a company extends the market dominance it enjoys in one area (in this instance, the app store) to others, specifically the browser and search engine. (For some reason, the commission\u2019s logic did not extend to any other Google apps.)\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief, said in announcing the ruling.The focus on tying arrangements is reminiscent of two famous Microsoft cases: one in the United States, in which the government accused the company of illegally tying its Internet Explorer browser to its dominant Windows operating system, the other in Europe, where Microsoft was found to have abused its Windows dominance by embedding its media player.The outcomes in both cases are now widely viewed as irrelevant, since by the time they were decided, Explorer and Windows Media Player had been overwhelmed by technological change and competition \u2014 from Google, among others. Microsoft\u2019s share of the browser and media-player markets is insignificant today.But even if the European Union\u2019s Microsoft precedent is viewed as sound, Google\u2019s competitive situation is different. \u201cThere\u2019s only a superficial resemblance to Microsoft,\u201d said Pinar Akman, director of the Center for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds in England, who has received support from Google for some of her research.Unlike adding a rival media player to the Windows operating system, which at the time was a slow and cumbersome process, adding rival apps to an Android-based phone can be done \u201cin seconds,\u201d said Ms. Akman, an antitrust expert. \u201cThe commission put a lot of emphasis on the value of preinstallation. But just because an app is preinstalled doesn\u2019t mean consumers are going to use it. It\u2019s very easy to download a rival app.\u201dGoogle\u2019s photo app, for example, has struggled to compete against Instagram and Snap, even though it comes preinstalled on Android-based phones as part of the Google suite.Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, agreed that if installing a rival app is as easy as Google claims, \u201cit would make for a pretty solid argument that whatever dominance Google has retained in mobile search has nothing to do with anticompetitive conduct, and rather just reflects its superiority as a product.\u201dCuriously, the commission\u2019s statement announcing the ruling did not address that issue. (A full written decision is not expected for months.) So I opened the Google Play store on my Android phone and searched for Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine. I was able to download it in seconds. Google suggested I \u201cmight also like\u201d an array of other search options, including Firefox and DuckDuckGo, which were displayed on the same page and equally accessible with a touch of my finger.Even though Google requires phone makers to use the full suite of Google apps if they want to install the Play store, there is nothing to prevent those companies from also preinstalling rival apps. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Microsoft just pay manufacturers to preinstall Bing?\u201d Ms. Akman asked.Apple, for one, makes Google the default search engine on the iPhone\u2019s Safari browser, even though Apple does not use either the Android operating system or the Play store. Oddly, the commission excluded Apple as a Google competitor, saying that because the company produced premium-price products, it did not constrain Google\u2019s ability to dominate the broader market.\u201cCan you imagine a U.S. court finding that Android and iOS don\u2019t compete?\u201d said Professor Sagers, referring to Apple\u2019s operating system.Samsung, too, preinstalls a range of rival apps in addition to the suite of Google products.The commission\u2019s stated mission is to protect European consumers by assuring them the benefits of competition. But the commission does not seem to have considered the possibility that Google\u2019s search engine and browser have achieved such high market share because consumers prefer them, or that consumers might also like having the apps already installed on their phones.The commission argues that when a phone comes with a single search engine preinstalled, it confers an enormous competitive advantage on that product. To support the theory, the commission said that on phones using Windows operating systems, which come with Bing preinstalled, 75 percent of searches are conducted using that engine.But Windows-based phones accounted for only 0.15 percent of the global market at the end of last year. That renders the data irrelevant, Ms. Akman said.A closer analogy, though not one cited by the commission, can be found in Russia. Last April, Google reached a settlement with a rival search engine based there, Yandex, under which it agreed that phone makers could preinstall Yandex on Android devices and let consumers decide which app would be their default search engine.At the time, Google and Yandex each had about 48 percent of the Russian search market. Since then, Yandex has increased its share to 51 percent; Google\u2019s has dropped to 45 percent.Even if preinstallation offers Google an advantage over rival app producers, that does not mean it harms consumers or violates competition law. I, for one, like having the Google apps preinstalled on my phone, unlike most of the clutter imposed on me by my phone service provider, Verizon.Google has said it will appeal the commission\u2019s decision. Given the commission\u2019s track record \u2014 it has rarely been reversed \u2014 the company would seem to face long odds. Still, the European Union\u2019s highest court sent a 2009 antitrust judgment against Intel back to a lower court for further review last year. The higher court\u2019s opinion clarified that the purpose of European antitrust law was not to protect inefficient competitors at the expense of consumers. That could give Google an opening.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Google ruling is anti-American,\u201d Ms. Akman said. \u201cThere are plenty of rulings against European companies, too. It\u2019s just that the American tech companies have been so successful, and have achieved so much market power, that they\u2019re going to come under scrutiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}

According to Reed Hastings, the question that started Netflix was: Why don\u2019t video stores offer flat membership fees the way health clubs do? Indeed, the stories of many tech giants can be told through the big question they eventually answered. Google: Why isn\u2019t there a good way to rank search results?

But their successes are easier to grasp when understood in retrospect as complicated answers to big, obvious questions \u2014 questions that, once heard, made sense to millions of people.In 2018, founders have been questioning matters far bigger than search results or video stores: about politics, about culture and about how the world might be reordered in much more radical ways.

{"Headline": "E.U. Fines Google $5.1 Billion in Android Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-07-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities fined Google a record $5.1 billion on Wednesday for abusing its power in the mobile phone market and ordered the company to alter its practices, in one of the most aggressive regulatory actions against American technology giants and one that may force lasting changes to smartphones.The fine was coupled with remedies that would effectively loosen Google\u2019s grip over its Android software, which is used in 80 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones and is a key part of the Silicon Valley company\u2019s business. Those changes, which European regulators ordered to take effect in 90 days, undercut Google\u2019s ability to automatically include its own search and other apps in mobile devices, opening it to more competition in a market that it has dominated.\u201cGoogle has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s antitrust chief. \u201cThese practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\u201dThe size of the fine, she added, \u201creflects the seriousness and the sustained nature\u201d of Google\u2019s actions.Regardless of an appeal, if Google does not start altering its mobile phone practices in 90 days, it faces penalties of up to 5 percent of the worldwide average daily revenue of its parent company, Alphabet.\u201cAndroid has enabled this and created more choice for everyone, not less,\u201d he added.Yet the ultimate effect of Wednesday\u2019s ruling may be muted given that Europe has largely acted alone in its regulatory actions against Silicon Valley titans, though there have been signs recently of shifting attitudes and a tougher stance by officials in the United States.At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said that the mobile-software market was concentrated and that he spoke with Ms. Vestager on Tuesday.\u201cLet me just say we\u2019re going to read what the E.U. put out very closely,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThe European Commission left Google to come up with its own ways to comply with the decision, an approach that critics said gave the company room to soften the blow. Competitors said that after Google was fined \u20ac2.4 billion, or $2.7 billion, in an antitrust case last year for favoring its comparison-shopping service in search results, the company sidestepped the rules. Google has appealed that decision.\u201cGetting a good headline and a big fine is one thing. Fixing the market is quite another,\u201d said Richard Stables, the chief executive of Kelkoo, a comparison-shopping site that has filed complaints against Google to regulators.Google\u2019s services remain immensely popular, and its stock price, profits and revenue continue to soar. Since the European Commission began investigating Android three years ago, annual revenue for Alphabet has grown to $111 billion from $75 billion. Google has also strengthened its dominance in the mobile phone market, with more than 1.25 billion Android handsets sold globally last year, according to the research firm IDC.The case underscores the broader challenge regulators face in overseeing the digital economy. By the time the authorities home in on an area deserving of scrutiny, the market may have moved on.\u201cFast-moving markets are where competition law is most important,\u201d said Jonathan Kanter, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss and a former antitrust investigator for the Federal Trade Commission, who has worked for Google competitors including Yelp. But \u201cwhen you have cases that are many years old, you\u2019re fighting old battles instead of the next one.\u201dAt the heart of the European Commission\u2019s case was the question of whether Google had abused its power by forcing handset makers like Samsung, Huawei and HTC to make its Google Search and Chrome browser the default services on Android-based devices in order to gain access to other Google apps.While Google gives Android away to handset makers, those companies must effectively pre-install 11 Google apps on their devices, giving Google\u2019s products far greater reach and more users to click on its ads. The strategy has enabled Google to reach more than a billion monthly users for six products: search, maps, Gmail, YouTube, the Chrome internet browser, and the Google Play app and media store.Now the European authorities are ordering Google to stop tying Google Search and Chrome to the Google Play store. In addition, antitrust officials said Google must stop providing financial incentives to handset makers and wireless carriers to favor its services, a practice the company stopped in 2014.In another remedy, European officials ordered that Google must allow handset manufacturers to create their own versions of Android software, otherwise known as \u201cforks.\u201d Google had previously discouraged the rise of competing smartphone software based on Android by blocking manufacturers\u2019 access to Google apps if they built devices using any alternative versions.The case has parallels to a similarly significant action against Microsoft in the 2000s, when it was heavily penalized in Europe and the United States for using its power in the personal computer market to bundle in its own internet browser, boxing out its rivals. At the time, Google, a young upstart, was among those to complain about Microsoft\u2019s practices.Some Google rivals cheered Wednesday\u2019s decision. Locking handset makers into deals with Google made it \u201cvery challenging to compete,\u201d Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-focused search engine, said in an interview. \u201cWe would hope the U.S. would ultimately follow suit and take another look at this.\u201dBut handset makers may continue to pre-install Google\u2019s Chrome and Search because consumers like them \u2014 or because Google pays them to do it.\u201cThe reality is there are not that many other players that can compete, so in some ways, I think the E.U. is fighting a battle that\u2019s already over,\u201d said Ben Schachter, a technology analyst at Macquarie Securities.Google could ultimately decide to charge handset makers for using Android in Europe, a policy shift that could drive up the prices of some handsets.Google argued that the European decision was an attack on its ad-based business model. The company said it required handset makers to use its suite of apps as a way of recouping the billions of dollars it spends to make Android. The arrangement, the company said, lets manufacturers compete with Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads, by making phones and tablets of various designs and prices, while Google makes money through its services.Mr. Kanter, the lawyer, said that although Google had largely won the battle to embed Android into smartphones, Wednesday\u2019s ruling could limit how the company approached new areas where the software was being used, including automobiles and internet-connected home electronics.The regulatory push in Europe might also influence others around the world to take a tougher look at Silicon Valley, he added.\u201cTo say that any single action by the European Commission is going to stop them is probably na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Kanter said. \u201cBut movements have to start somewhere, and good, strong, persistent, decisive action can over time have an effect.\u201dAdam Satariano reported from Brussels, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.
