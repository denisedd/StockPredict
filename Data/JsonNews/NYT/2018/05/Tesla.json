{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Fill Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Moat\u2019 With Candy, but It Still Holds Water", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Elon Musk is taking on Warren Buffett, and their differences run deeper than jokes about candy and medieval fortifications.At Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier.\u201cI think \u2018moats\u2019 are lame,\u201d Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Years and Two Continents \u2014 Behind Walmart\u2019s Flipkart Deal: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How well did Flipkart\u2019s investors do?\u2022 What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen?\u2022 What the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world.\u2022 The bottom line on Vodafone\u2019s big deal with Liberty Global.The story of Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here\u2019s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart\u2019s management some degree of independence.In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India\u2019s two biggest e-commerce services.Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday\u2019s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart\u2019s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s how well some of them did:Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart \u2014 including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent \u2014 could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWhat exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer?- Peter EavisDetails\u2022 Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.\u2022 The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart\u2019s eventual shareholding in Flipkart.\u2022 Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.It\u2019s a risky bet for Walmart\u2022 Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.\u2022 Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.\u2022 While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon\u2019s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap.The big winners\u2022 Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire.\u2022 SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.The advisers\u2022 Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side.\u2022 Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & DavidsonCritic\u2019s CornerUna Galani of Breakingviews writes: \u201cAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart\u2019s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company\u2019s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.\u201dSturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation.The vote was a rebuke to the company\u2019s leaders and a victory for gun control activists.Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company\u2019s reputation and finances.\u2014 Tiffany HsuSears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears\u2019s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months.AT&T said Essential was \u201cone of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February.\u201cRight around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow does he think? What are their priorities?\u201dThe price of benchmark American crude oil rose to more than $71 early Wednesday.Oil prices are hovering near highs not seen since 2014 would seem to run counter to the President\u2019s stated, or tweeted, preference for lower oil prices. But as American oil production has surged, the traditional view that higher oil prices act as a clear drag on American growth has become less of an item of faith.We believe this event is a bellwether for the sector, and could potentially contribute toward a flurry of consolidation across Europe.Not so fast: Expect Deutsche Telekom, now in Vodafone\u2019s cross hairs, to fight the transaction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Temporary Cease-Fire in CBS\u2019s Fight With Redstones: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks.The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution.Apple has quietly explored the idea of opening a campus for 20,000 employees in Northern Virginia, further advancing the possibility that the Washington area could evolve into an East Coast outpost for Silicon Valley.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.\u2014 Prashant S.

Whoever becomes C.E.O. will have to work across three companies with 1.2 million employees and develop solutions to bring down costs in a multi-trillion dollar industry. The group will also be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints\u201d That means whoever takes the job will have to \u201chandle the requisite long hours, extensive travel and public scrutiny of running a high-profile start-up, but probably without the allure of a big stock incentive plan, which is typically an attractive incentive in tech recruiting.\u201d\u2022 At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, Warren Buffett said the partnership hoped to announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months.\u201d But he seemed uncertain, though not unhopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dLachlan Murdoch will become the chief executive officer and co-chairman of Fox, if Disney completes its deal for most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, the company announced on Wednesday.Lachlan Murdoch currently serves as 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman.

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank May Take More Heat From Regulators This Summer: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How Warren Buffett failed to grab a $3 billion slice of Uber.\u2022 White House will impose metal tariffs on Europe, Canada and Mexico.\u2022 More headaches for Deutsche Bank.\u2022 Why C.E.O.s should pay attention to the way Dick\u2019s weathered its gun-sales ban.Deutsche Bank\u2019s difficulties with United States regulators could become even worse in the coming weeks.The Fed\u2019s censure, according to the Journal, stemmed from concerns about Deutsche Bank\u2019s procedures for measuring its exposure to its clients and for valuing the collateral backing its loans. Regulators require efficient and accurate controls so that banks can assess their financial strength and the risks they face, especially through difficult times in the economy.Subpar controls could hamper Deutsche Bank\u2019s ability to pass two crucial upcoming tests in the U.S.The first is the Fed\u2019s stress tests, which are used to determine whether large banks can survive a severe economic downturn. Until now, only Deutsche Bank\u2019s small U.S. trust bank had gone through the tests \u2013 and even that failed. Commenting on the 2016 test, the Fed slammed the subsidiary for continuing \u201cto have material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine its capital planning process.\u201d The entity did not get tested last year because of a rule change.But this year, effectively all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s operations in the U.S., including its substantial Wall Street operations, will be subject to a public stress test (the operations went through a confidential test last year.) If the issues with controls that afflicted the small trust bank exist in the trading business, Deutsche Bank could fall short on the test.Banks can also effectively fail the stress tests if they cannot make it through the hypothetical turbulence with adequate equity capital. Regulatory filings show that, at the end of last year, Deutsche\u2019s U.S. operations had $7.3 billion of equity supporting $148 billion of assets. The stress tests, scheduled for next month, will reveal if that equity is sufficient for the storm.But Deutsche Bank, along with several other large foreign banks, faces another tough challenge. By July 1, the banks have to file a detailed plan with regulators that lays out how they would wind themselves down in a bankruptcy-type scenario. Regulators require such plans because they want to be able to shut down troubled banks while minimizing the chaos and confusion that characterized the 2008 financial crisis. These plans can be difficult to get right, particularly for banks with shoddy controls.- Peter EavisMasayoshi Son\u2019s grand plan for SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund was audacious: Own pieces of all the companies in a wide range of sectors \u2014 transportation, food, work, medicine and finance \u2014 that may underpin the global shifts brought on by artificial intelligence.So far many of the biggest wagers have been on transportation.The fund announced plans Thursday to invest $2.25 billion in General Motors\u2019 driverless-technology division to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service and other new businesses.The investment in G.M. Cruise is just the latest in the companies and technologies rapidly transforming the auto industry.Before GM Cruise, its last investment directly into an autonomous driving start-up was last year, when it co-led a financing round for Nauto, a maker of sensors for autonomous vehicles.So far ride-hailing has been a major focus. SoftBank and the Vision Fund have poured money into Uber and its rivals, like Didi Chuxing in China and Ola in India. SoftBank has also invested in Brazil\u2019s 99 and Singapore\u2019s Grab.The investments go beyond just ride-hailing start-ups. SoftBank also bought ARM and invested in Nvidia, semiconductor companies that are making chips for self-driving cars.There have also been investments in Auto1, a German car dealer service, and Mapbox, a mapping start-up.Michael Ronen, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement that he was \u201cvery impressed by the advances made by the Cruise and G.M. teams.\u201d He also said, \u201cthe G.M. Cruise approach of a fully integrated hardware and software stack gives it a unique competitive advantage.\u201dIt also appears to be second in the state in terms of performance, based on the number of times a driver had to take over from the robotic vehicle. G.M. Cruise drivers had to take control once every 1,300 miles, while Waymo\u2019s drivers intervened just once every 5,600.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe tariffs are meant to make good on President Trump\u2019s longstanding promises to protect American industry. But they have prompted a fierce response from allies, who have already readied lists of American products they plan to tax in return, as well as American businesses that use steel and aluminum, which are seeing their costs rise as a result of the measure.Opposition from an unusual sourceThe tariffs drew the opposition of the Koch brothers\u2019 political network, one of the most powerful in conservative politics. Though known for its advocacy of conservative causes, the Kochs\u2019 approach has generally tended toward more libertarian, deregulatory ends \u2014 and tariffs run counter to that.Trade wars hurt everyone. They trigger retaliatory tariffs from our trade partners and that raises prices on American families who need affordable access to household goods. We urge the Trump administration to abandon these tariffsIt wasn\u2019t just President Trump\u2019s plan to slap tariffs on metal imported from the E.U., Canada and Mexico. While the White House has considered putting tariffs on imported cars, a report from a German business magazine suggested that the president wanted to go much further.Whether the report is accurate, shares in Daimler and Volkswagen fell after the magazine article went up on Thursday, declining about 2 percent.Prosecutors said Woojae \u201cSteve\u201d Jung \u2014 who is Korean and attended Seoul National University before moving to the United States, according to his LinkedIn profile \u2014 made the trades in a brokerage account opened at Interactive Brokers in the name of a friend in South Korea.Prosecutors said he earned illicit profits of just over $130,000.Mr. Jung specialized in technology, media and telecommunications deals, according to his LinkedIn profile. The trades he allegedly made were in the shares of companies involved in deals that Goldman was working on, such as Western Digital\u2019s 2015 acquisition of hardware company SanDisk.The Federal Reserve designated Deutsche Bank\u2019s U.S. subsidiary in \u201ctroubled condition\u201d a year ago, the WSJ reported. The Fed\u2019s action caused the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to recently downgrade Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the bank\u2019s F.D.I.C. insured business, to its \u201cProblem Banks\u201d list.The main points\u2022 The company lost $3.93 per share in the quarter ended May 5, compared to a $2.28 per-share profit a year ago. Revenue slid to $2.9 billion in the quarter.\u2022 Same-store sales, a widely used retailer metric, fell 11.9 percent.\u2022 It will close another 72 underperforming stores.\u2022 The company had $466 million in cash and roughly $641 million in available credit as of May 5.The big issueSears has a precarious cash position. While the company repaid some of its debt due next year, it still has more debt coming due in October of 2019. And overall it still has $3.8 billion in long-term debt that it must settle at some point.But such efforts seem unlikely to counter its debts, and Thursday\u2019s results are unlikely to silence the whisperings of more financial troubles ahead.\u2014 Michael de la MercedIt\u2019s part of a slow but steady removal of Obama-era limits placed on Wall Street \u2014 and a move that bank C.E.O.s like JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon had long pushed for. But critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren have warned that it could reintroduce a Wild West mentality on Wall Street, and potentially leave taxpayers on the hook if banks make poor decisions.Paul Volcker himself has supported simplifying the rule \u2014 so long as the basic principle of no public bailouts for banks\u2019 risky trades remained.Buffett would have effectively lent Uber his sterling reputation, along with some capital, in exchange for cushy deal terms. Under the proposed agreement, Berkshire Hathaway would have provided a convertible loan to Uber that would have protected Buffett\u2019s investment should Uber hit financial straits, while providing significant upside if Uber continued to grow in value.Uber\u2019s C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, reportedly suggested a smaller $2 billion deal, but the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on terms.European officials have said they plan to swiftly impose levies against as much as \u20ac2.8 billion ($3.3 billion) in U.S. exports under a rule at the World Trade Organization that allows members to punish a country immediately for inappropriately seeking a \u201csafeguard\u201d against their exports.Elsewhere in tradeIt was Chesky who pulled the plug, these people say.

{"Headline": "Boosting U.S. Exports to China by $200 Billion Is a Tricky Task", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump is trying to broker a deal to bring down the national trade deficit with China. Experts doubt his goal is achievable.Dear Xi Jinping,Could we interest you in 500 million metric tons of soybeans? We\u2019re just trying to make the math work here. Many experts, though, doubt that plan could work as advertised. Option 1In total, America exported $22 billion worth of soybeans last year, and its soybean production has risen steadily over the last decade. But the country\u2019s total crop is worth just over $40 billion annually. It\u2019s hard to see how it would quintuple in the span of a few years. Mr. Setser estimates that a realistic hope for a near-term increase in soybean exports to China is about $5 billion, which would likely come at the expense of other Chinese trading partners, such as Brazil.Option 2Again, though, the problem is scale. China bought $2 billion worth of liquefied natural gas last year from the United States, double the amount from 2016. It bought about $7 billion worth of other fossil fuel products, including coal and crude oil. If you optimistically doubled those purchases right away, that would still give you less than $10 billion in additional exports, though the number would grow over time. Such an increase would require a massive ramp-up in energy infrastructure, particularly for gas exports.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the liquefaction facilities constructed yet to automatically turn on the spigot,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Option 3That\u2019s still not $200 billion, but it\u2019s a start, which could continue with other high-tech goods that the United States exports a lot of. China could stop buying new jets from Airbus and only source from Boeing, for example (though Boeing appears to be backlogged on filling its orders from around the world). It could buy more cutting-edge American-made cars, such as Teslas. China would probably love to go a step further and buy fighter jets, aircraft carriers and other advanced defense weaponry from the United States \u2014 but for national security reasons, that pitch would probably never fly. Option 4Option 5Neither Mr. Bown nor Mr. Setser find it realistic that a combination of the options above would add up to the administration\u2019s goal, over the span of one year. But it might look more achievable as a three-year accumulation of purchases, through 2020. (Sort of like how the administration passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut in Congress last year \u2014 with that total being for a 10-year window.)Option 6Mr. Setser said he suspects the import growth will continue, in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut, which is giving consumers more money to spend on electronics, clothing and other Chinese-made goods. So unless Americans stop buying Chinese TVs, toys and clothing, the trade deficit may not budge as much as Mr. Trump wants.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Advertisement"}

After testing the car again, Consumer Reports reversed the verdict on Wednesday, only nine days after its original report was published, and gave the car a \u201crecommended\u201d rating.\u201cTo see something updated that quickly is quite remarkable,\u201d said Jake Fisher, the magazine\u2019s director of auto testing. Other manufacturers have made software fixes to correct issues that Consumer Reports has identified, but owners then have to take their cars to dealers to have the update installed.Tesla\u2019s ability to update its cars in much the same way that Apple issues software updates for iPhones is a competitive advantage, Mr. Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a manufacturer do this in the course of a week,\u201d he added.Consumer Reports\u2019 original verdict on the Model 3 seemed like another mark against Tesla.

{"Headline": "Cadillac Makes Great Cars. Too Bad Americans Want S.U.V.s.", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen General Motors recruited Johan de Nysschen to lead Cadillac in 2014, the prominent auto executive hoped for a cavalry of new sport-utility vehicles to shore up the luxury brand\u2019s weakest position.As it awaited reinforcements, Cadillac soldiered on with a legion of widely praised sports sedans, the kind of beautifully engineered vehicles its German rivals would have been proud to call their own.\u201cCadillac is just not selling what people want to buy today, especially in America,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book.G.M. had lured Mr. de Nysschen \u2014 the rare company outsider to lead a G.M. division \u2014 on the strength of a successful stint atop Audi of America. His first major act was to place physical and psychological distance between Cadillac and Detroit, moving Cadillac\u2019s headquarters from Motown to Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in 2015.\u201cHow is it possible that we have so few crossovers from this iconic American luxury brand?\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said in an interview at the time. \u201cThe Germans have more than I can count on two hands.\u201dAt BMW alone, that count now includes the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5 and X6, with the most expensive, the three-row X7, arriving next year. All that from a German brand that built its reputation on high-performance sport sedans and was once criticized for pandering to American tastes by building S.U.V.s. In ironic contrast, while G.M. is known for its expertise in S.U.V.s and trucks, Cadillac has just one car-based S.U.V.: the midsize XT5, which merely replaced the defunct SRX.The result is that Cadillac, a brand that had begun to transform its stodgy, retiree-only image during G.M.\u2019s post-bankruptcy comeback, is struggling. Cadillac\u2019s annual domestic sales had rebounded above 180,000 in 2013, up from about 110,000 in the recession doldrums of 2009. But sales plunged to 156,000 by 2017, even as the German brands were soaring. In the closely watched luxury race, Mercedes rode its own S.U.V.-heavy lineup to 337,236 sales in 2017, while BMW found 305,685 buyers, nipping Lexus\u2019s 305,132.Now, GM\u2019s leadership has replaced the South African-born Mr. de Nysschen with Steve Carlisle, the president of G.M. Canada, who joined the company 36 years ago. In a statement, Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president said that Mr. de Nysschen had set \u201ca stronger foundation\u201d for Cadillac.\u201cLooking forward, the world is changing rapidly, and, beginning with the launch of the new XT4, it is paramount that we capitalize immediately on the opportunities that arise from this rate of change,\u201d Mr. Ammann said.That 2019 XT4 finally goes on sale this fall, priced from $35,790, and it will need to elbow its way through a crowded party of compact S.U.V.s. A three-row XT6 is also in the works, but George Peterson, president of the research firm AutoPacific, did not expect it to arrive before 2020. Mr. Peterson already counts some 38 small crossovers in the marketplace, ranging from $20,000 to more than $90,000, and said that count should soon reach 45.\u201cCadillac is recognizing that it\u2019s a crossover world, but they\u2019ve been slow to get off the dime,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be launching into the teeth of a hugely competitive battleground.\u201dCadillac may have had a chance to move more quickly.Following his hiring, Mr. de Nysschen tried to persuade G.M.\u2019s leadership to move S.U.V.s to the front of the development line, according to two company officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters. Traditional sedans and coupes that were already in the product pipeline, including the flagship CT6, proceeded on course. Despite wildly positive reviews, they have mostly fallen flat with S.U.V.-besotted consumers.Another former G.M. executive, Robert A. Lutz, can empathize with the predicament Mr. de Nysschen faced. Mr. Lutz, a former Chrysler and BMW executive, was also a high-wattage outsider facing huge expectations when G.M. lured him out of retirement in 2001, naming him vice chairman and giving him far-reaching control over G.M.\u2019s designs and product lineups. In contrast, Mr. Lutz said, Mr. de Nysschen lacked veto power and had to answer to several higher-ranking executives.\u201cJohan was a very able executive, certainly able to run a premium brand,\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cBut he was never fully in charge.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say Mr. de Nysschen did not have successes.Mr. Lutz said Mr. de Nysschen had done critical dirty work by breaking Cadillac\u2019s habit of dumping production into rental fleets to plump sales numbers, a practice that marred the brand\u2019s image, retail prices and resale values. By April, according to J.D. Power data, retail buyers paid an average of nearly $54,000 for their Cadillacs, second only to Mercedes among luxury brands.Mr. de Nysschen also helped expand Cadillac\u2019s international reach: Even as its American sales fell 8 percent last year, Cadillac\u2019s 175,000 sales in booming China brought its global total above 356,000, approaching 1978\u2019s historical high for the 115-year-old brand. And Cadillac\u2019s semiautonomous Super Cruise technology \u2014 which allows full hands-free driving on most major highways \u2014 is being hailed by some critics as superior to Tesla\u2019s vaunted Autopilot, particularly for its emphasis on safe operation.But Mr. de Nysschen also frustrated Cadillac dealers with Project Pinnacle, his carrot-and-stick plan that offered tiered incentives to dealers who invested in showroom upgrades and Lexus-style customer service \u2014 and steered others toward $180,000 franchise buyouts.Mr. Lutz suspected that de Nysschen\u2019s physical separation from Detroit made it harder to win allies and arguments alike. He recalled poring over clay models of car designs during his G.M. tenure, and being able to march into a finance executive\u2019s office if he had removed $200 worth of chrome that Mr. Lutz viewed as critical.\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Where did the chrome go?\u201d Mr. Lutz said. \u201cYou stare him in the eye, argue with him and get it fixed. Even in this day of electronic connectedness, distance matters.\u201dMr. Brauer, the Kelley Blue Book publisher, panned Cadillac\u2019s move to New York as window-dressing. It might have made sense, he said, if the brand had set up design studios or engineering in New York, but those linchpins of auto creativity remained in Detroit. The change of address seemed a dubious sequel, Mr. Brauer said. Between his time at Audi and Cadillac, Mr. de Nysschen led Infiniti, where he convinced its parent, Nissan, to move its luxury headquarters from Japan to Hong Kong.Some observers fault Mr. de Nysschen for spending too much effort chasing the Germans, including by challenging them on their literal home turf: the famed N\u00fcrburgring circuit. Cadillac\u2019s 640-horsepower, nearly 200-m.p.h. CTS-V became the world\u2019s first production sedan to circle the 12.9-mile track in less than 8 minutes.But Mr. Lutz, who forged his own industry reputation as an ultimate \u201ccar guy\u201d by birthing performance legends like the Dodge Viper and the CTS-V, said that most of today\u2019s luxury buyers were oblivious to the nuances of speed or handling.\u201cNot one in 1,000 Americans even knows where the N\u00fcrburgring is,\u201d he said.When he was hired, Mr. de Nysschen said that Cadillac would be a distinctly American alternative, on par with any rival in design, quality and performance. But, reached via email, Mr. de Nysschen rejected the idea that Cadillac \u201chas been trying to \u2018chase the Germans.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe team absolutely wants to leverage the unique American heritage,\u201d he wrote, while rebuilding Cadillac\u2019s reputation for excellence in such areas as craftsmanship and fit-and-finish.\u201cI believe that is a noble pursuit, worthy of an iconic brand such as Cadillac.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, relying on information from Cadillac, misstated the source of data on the average sale price of its vehicles.

{"Headline": "China Cuts Car Tariffs, in a Small Offering to the U.S. on Trade", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China has carried out a pledge to cut tariffs on imported cars and car parts, the latest move by Beijing to ease trade tensions with the United States. The American auto industry and its workers, however, might be unimpressed.The moves are intended to address longstanding complaints from the Trump administration and global automakers that China\u2019s tariffs on imported cars are much too high. Those tariffs are one reason \u2014 though by no means the only reason \u2014 that global automakers like Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have built enormous factories in China over the past two decades. Those factories, built and run with Chinese joint venture partners, have helped make China by far the world\u2019s largest automaker.Chinese tariffs will still be relatively high, however, and the change is unlikely to motivate automakers to shift production away from China. The United States has a tariff of 2.5 percent on cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, for example, although it has a 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. Global automakers have also grown comfortable making cars in China, where sales have boomed.The drop \u201cis a significant reduction, but it really won\u2019t have much of an effect\u201d on where automakers assemble vehicles, said James Chao, the chief Asia auto analyst at IHS Markit.By cutting the tariff on imported car parts more than on imported cars, China may actually strengthen its role as the world\u2019s largest car-assembling nation.Lower tariffs on imported components will make it more attractive for global manufacturers to do much of their final assembly in China, since they will not have to pay as much to import high-tech parts made elsewhere.Cementing China\u2019s role as the leading country for car assembly will help Beijing move the economy toward more sophisticated industries that can provide well-paid jobs for an increasingly well-educated population. Through a process Chinese officials call supply-side reforms, they hope to close older, smokestack industries that offer little more than low wages and high pollution.Tariffs will be reduced, the Finance Ministry said in a statement, \u201cin order to further expand reform and opening up, promote supply-side structural reforms, promote the transformation and upgrading of the auto industry, and meet the people\u2019s consumer demand.\u201dIt also hopes to ramp up exports of cars made in China, and reducing its own tariffs makes it less likely that Chinese-made cars will be hit by retaliatory tariffs.German luxury carmakers and German manufacturers of high-technology brakes could also be winners. While all of the world\u2019s major auto parts manufacturers now have extensive operations in China, a handful of the most sophisticated components, notably advanced braking systems, are made only in Germany.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is scheduled to meet Mr. Xi in Beijing this week. The Chinese government is eager to gain her support in its trade struggles with the Trump administration, at a time when Germany\u2019s business elite is deeply worried about Chinese acquisitions in the robotics and auto parts sectors.Ford still exports some Lincolns to China, and Tesla exports large numbers of electric cars to China despite the current tariff. General Motors has already moved to China practically all of its production for the Chinese market, including Cadillacs, which are now made in Shanghai.Advertisement"}

For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018not cool,\u2019 and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla\u2019s Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\u201dAdam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:\u201cTo be clear. Tonight\u2019s conference call didn\u2019t go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201dRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201dAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations.

{"Headline": "Troye Sivan Is a New Kind of Pop Star: Here, Queer and Used to It", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "The 22-year-old singer is climbing the charts while demonstrating how his sexual orientation is both part of his art and beside the point.Supported byHip-swinging pretty boys in eye makeup are nothing new; they\u2019ve been singing on television since Elvis on Ed Sullivan. But Mr. Sivan is a creature of our time: a self-possessed, on-his-own-terms heartthrob, gay and untroubled, with the commercial sheen of a Disney star and the charisma of a boy prince.\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d represents a new frontier for Mr. Sivan, and the audience he has to win over with his forthcoming second album, \u201cBloom.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been following Troye from the beginning,\u201d said Brian Siedlecki, a producer of the show, who oversees the musical bookings, \u201cwatching his evolution through his early career and realizing this kid has the goods.\u201d His second album release had not yet been confirmed when \u201cS.N.L.\u201d reached out. \u201cWe thought let\u2019s get him early, so we don\u2019t miss him this time around.\u201dWhat Mr. Sivan has to reassure him \u2014 besides the healthy push of Capitol Records, a major label that is also home to Katy Perry, Paul McCartney and Sam Smith \u2014 is the die-hard fans to whom, to judge from the comments left on each of his Instagram posts, he is \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d and whose greatness leaves them de-wigged. (In drag slang, gentrified into gay slang, gentrified into everyone\u2019s slang, \u201cWig\u201d is one-word shorthand for \u201cI am shocked, I am overwhelmed, my wig has been snatched off\u201d \u2014 no actual wig necessary.)Such online bravado covers up the more tender, nervous side of his teenage fan base: the young gay boys who come to his meet-and-greets and signings and cry. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re shaky when they come up and say hello,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cWith this album, I\u2019m trying to reach a wider audience than I have before. But then when I do a meet-and-greet like that, it makes me realize that\u2019s not that important. No matter what, for whatever reason, this person standing in front of me who\u2019s shaking and crying and I have connected. I see myself in them.\u201dMr. Sivan is not the first gay pop star, by a long measure. Gay men have been making, managing and influencing popular music and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll since its birth, in ways both implicit and explicit. But whereas the mainstream gay pop stars of a generation ago, like Boy George and George Michael, began their careers closeted, Mr. Sivan has been out since before the beginning of his.\u201cThe music industry in my eyes is still pretty homophobic,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who came out publicly just before the release of his first album. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult place for any L.G.B.T.Q. artist to come out and be supported.\u201d\u201cIt was just fearless,\u201d said Brett McLaughlin, known professionally as Leland, and who is one of Mr. Sivan\u2019s closest friends and songwriting collaborators. \u201cThere was not a question of \u2018should we do this or shouldn\u2019t we.\u2019 It was more a question of \u2018why wouldn\u2019t we?\u2019\u201d\u201cWe knew exactly who he was from the moment we signed him,\u201d said Michelle Jubelirer, the chief operating officer of Capitol Music Group.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have been more supportive and thrilled. He certainly wasn\u2019t one of those artists who waited for success to be who he is.\u201d His demographic, she added, is young and diverse (and not short on young women who have crushes on him, in addition to young men).But \u201cMy My My!,\u201d an ecstatic love song and especially its music video, is a celebration of the tell. Mr. Sivan does his spring-jointed runway walk \u2014 his throbbing flail \u2014 throughout. (\u201cI\u2019ve never had the guts to call it dancing or work on it really,\u201d he said.) It is, to a certain kind of boy, immediately recognizable: The private dance of a would-be diva alone in his bedroom. Which is, Mr. Sivan said, more or less exactly what it was.That was then.The night he filmed \u201cMy My My!,\u201d he said, \u201cI might as well have been Naomi Campbell.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s moving in that video like every single gay boy,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cI identify with that video so much.\u201dFrom there, he traveled Australia\u2019s equivalent of the borscht belt circuit, singing at High Holy Days services. At 12 he began making videos online, parlaying fame and comfort in front of a camera into intimacy and brand-building as well as film roles. He started writing songs, just a boy and a laptop. A self-produced EP got him signed to EMI in Australia at 16, which then put out two more, the second of which was later incorporated into \u201cBlue Neighbourhood.\u201dMr. Sivan\u2019s is not a show business family, per se. His parents are from South Africa, where Mr. Sivan was born. His mother, a former model, worked at a modeling agency, and his father, a plumber by trade, cycled through a host of jobs: real estate agent, garage storage installer, motivational speaker. \u201cHe did it all,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cNow he has an Airbnb business. And drives Uber.\u201dMr. Sivan has three siblings and said he had a happy and supportive childhood, albeit with a familiar lacuna. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any gay people growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had no idea what life was supposed to look like.\u201d He absorbed what he could from secret viewings of \u201cQueer as Folk,\u201d looking over his shoulder as he watched.For his young gay fans who mob his meet-and-greets, it\u2019s a dream life, and a message, especially to those in imperfect circumstances, that it can and does get better.\u201cI can\u2019t squeeze them hard enough,\u201d Mr. Sivan said. \u201cSometimes you hug someone and you can just feel too much weight in their chest for a 14-year-old. You\u2019re like, I see you. I get what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe pressure of writing and recording a second album can be intense, especially if a plaque celebrating your first hit single\u2019s sales is leaning up against the wall. \u201cThe only difference between writing the first album and the second album,\u201d Mr. Sivan said, \u201cwas the second album we had that staring at us the whole time.\u201dBut \u201cBloom\u201d doesn\u2019t sound fearful or timid. It\u2019s darker, more guitar-driven and at times sexier than what\u2019s come before. Sitting in the studio in Los Angeles, Mr. Sivan pulled up a Spotify playlist on his phone, a sonic mood board: Sky Ferreira, Drake and the Replacements. Mr. McLaughlin recalled arriving for one of the first album sessions with a bag of wigs to lighten the mood. (Wig!)\u201cTroye is somebody who\u2019s very good at showing up and understanding the pitch with him, the thing that sets him apart, is his outspokenness about his identity,\u201d said Ms. Nef. \u201cBut I think his new work transcends that.\u201dIn person, Mr. Sivan is cheerful and obliging but, in the way of many young people who have broadcast themselves early and often to fame, a little remote: an uncrackable carapace, the onscreen projection of a (former) teen dream. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of mysterious, in a way,\u201d said Ms. Nef. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s his background or just him, but I\u2019m used to socializing with Americans and they say things like \u2018I love you\u2019 really quickly and they\u2019re super wet as people. I wouldn\u2019t say Troye\u2019s a dry person, but there\u2019s something a little more reserved about him.\u201dI had the sense, as the Tesla sped us back toward Hollywood, that that reserve only fully leaves him onstage, where Troye the person meets Troye the star and the world is the show. He is planning the world tour for \u201cBloom,\u201d which kicks off in the fall, excited for the new Troye \u2014 louder, freer, Troyer \u2014 to meet the world.\u201cI would be doing myself a disservice if I didn\u2019t just go for it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as scary as that is, I\u2019m getting a little bit more comfortable with the idea that if you do something confidently enough, I think people have no choice but to accept it.\u201dThat will require a wind machine, he decided, having gotten his first taste at his largest show to date, for 6,000 people in Australia, outdoors, with the actual wind in his face.\u201cI was like \u2018Oh my God, this is something else,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t kick it. By the end my mouth is so dry and I\u2019m trying to sing, and that gets tough. So, I\u2019m going to figure out how to do it on tour. How does Beyonc\u00e9 do it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Advice for Renovating Your Home", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.This column is part of a series for the Design special section of The New York Times. Readers are invited to send questions to designadvice@nytimes.com.My kitchen has strong natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on two walls. As a result, my maple cabinets have turned an unappealing shiny orange-gold color. I\u2019m considering having them painted the same (softer) color as my kitchen walls to reduce glare and promote a monochromatic look. Thoughts and/or advice? It makes perfect sense to match the color of the adjacent surfaces, but you\u2019ll want to seal the current finish with a primer formulated to kill stains so you never see yellow again. I like Kilz 2 Latex or B-I-N Synthetic Shellac because they are water-based and thus easier to work with. Many others swear by old-school shellac-based primers, which both Kilz and B-I-N also offer. Obviously the cabinets should be sanded first so the primer adheres well. For the finish paint, acrylic is less likely to yellow in a sunny location than oil-based (or alkyd) enamels. Lastly you could consider applying film to your windows to reduce ultraviolet radiation, which is at the root of your problem.I have a 1970s home with nice solid wood cabinetry but it\u2019s dark and needs some tweaking to be more functional. This could be solved with new upper cabinets only. Is it O.K. to have cabinets that don\u2019t match? I plan to retire and move in about 10 years, and I\u2019m thinking of future resale value.Mixing cabinet styles and colors has been a popular way to add interest for a long time now. It\u2019s difficult to say what would work best without knowing more about your kitchen, but I\u2019ve seen nice combinations of, say, dark base cabinets with lighter uppers, or a mixture of stained and painted finishes, or even steel and glass uppers with solid wood cabinets below counter.Beyond the style question, you should consider how the cabinets are used. Open upper shelves look great but require you to keep your china and glassware as orderly as the objects in a Morandi painting. Similarly glass-front cabinets, while less demanding, are probably not suitable for large kegs of protein supplement or microwave popcorn. For most of us mortals, solid fronts on regular cabinets prove most livable in the long run.Also keep in mind that 10 years is the aesthetic and functional lifespan of a lot of kitchens. I would focus on what you like more than what will please an imaginary buyer in a decade. That person will very possibly update whatever you put in place now.I was all set to install solar panels on the roof of my home. I\u2019m committed to the environment and renewable energy, and having done the math I see financial advantages. But I was surprised to hear that solar panels are a turnoff to prospective home buyers who think they\u2019re ugly. Should I go ahead with it anyway?Given the rapid changes in solar technology I wouldn\u2019t bank on panels lending value to your house in resale, unless you\u2019re planning to sell very soon. And if that\u2019s the case, skip them; it usually takes time to recoup the cost.You\u2019ve likely considered these other questions, but here they are anyway: Does your roof get enough sunlight? Is your current roof new enough to endure for the life of the panels? Will the roof warranty be affected by installing them? Does the installation affect your real estate taxes? Does your area permit net metering? These factors not only determine the cost-effectiveness of the project but also the value of panels to any prospective buyer.You can also find alternatives that visually appeal to you more, but they come at a price.If you have room on your property, you could also think about installing ground-mounted solar panels remotely from your house. These allow for precise angling to get the most sun, and are free of obstacles like chimneys, dormers or other roof projections. Fixed ground panels should be comparable in price to roof-mounted systems.I\u2019m looking for a living room sofa and thinking leather because of the comfort and durability. The problem is: I\u2019m vegan. Is there a reasonably priced substitute material that would give me the same advantages?My bathroom needs a redo, but I\u2019m bored to death of subway tile. Where should I go to find something more interesting at a reasonable price?Finally, subway tile doesn\u2019t have to be boring. Rather than install it in the traditional horizontal running bond pattern, you can use the same shape to create a vertical running bond, herringbone or vertically stacked patterns.Steven Sclaroff is a New York-based interior designer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visionaries With the Courage to Change the World", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "Over centuries, these people have shared some important attributes: courage, daring, confidence and a stubborn devotion to an idea.Supported byCall them what you will: change makers, innovators, thought leaders, visionaries.In ways large and small, they fight. They disrupt. They take risks. They push boundaries to change the way we see the world, or live in it. Some create new enterprises, while others develop their groundbreaking ideas within an existing one.Although centuries stretch between them, experts who have studied the nature of innovators across all areas of expertise largely agree that they have important attributes in common, from innovative thinking to an ability to build trust among those who follow them to utter confidence and a stubborn devotion to their dream.Despite the shared characteristics with their predecessors, however, today\u2019s innovators face their own set of challenges. The world around them is changing at warp speed and they need to be able to move with it.\u201cThe one characteristic that I\u2019m very comfortable saying that all remarkable leaders in big business, small business, not-for-profit, military, government and the arts, have to have is courage,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThese people are driven by some cause that compels them to find the courage and take certain risks and work damn hard at it,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the choice is lonely, which is another reason it takes courage. You have to have the courage to do the right thing. Elon Musk is the perfect example of someone with tremendous courage and conviction. He invested nearly everything he had in SpaceX and Tesla.\u201d\u201cHe has a devotion to a vision that very few people do,\u201d Mr. Sinek said.\u201cThings aren\u2019t linear anymore. We are living in an ecosystem world. It is more complex.\u201d\u201cThe mechanical model of organizations in the past has produced hierarchies, static positions and rigid organizational charts, and has produced leaders who, however charismatic they may be, rule from the top and rule unequivocally. They control and direct and others follow. That model doesn\u2019t really work anymore.\u201dThe emerging game-changers appreciate that creating fundamental change is a process, a marathon, not a sprint, and they are comfortable operating at the edge of chaos and ambiguity. They also have an ability to ask questions, rather than feeling they must know the answers and to think in nonlinear and nonbinary ways, according to Ms. Blandin. These attributes stand in stark contrast to the attributes typically associated with strong leaders in the past.They must also be tough enough to bear up under intense public scrutiny on social media and to withstand or adhere to an underlying peer pressure for social do-gooderism.Travis Kalanick, 41, founder of the ride-share app, Uber, introduced a pioneering concept, but was unable to navigate a sequence of scandals surrounding a macho company culture and allegations of sexual harassment that presumably stemmed from his leadership style, forcing him to resign.And time will tell how well Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, who founded Facebook in his college dorm room, will withstand the hot seat that has resulted from revelations that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica gathered data of millions of the social network\u2019s users and might have influenced the 2016 election. It has brought the question of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s societal stewardship front and center.Acting as a guardian for not only people but also the planet is a concern that\u2019s inextricably woven into the fabric of this new generation of leaders. It\u2019s nonnegotiable. \u201cThey are deeply aware of the context in which their organization is operating, and it is beyond the marketplace \u2014 politics, globally, society. It\u2019s a long game and one where doing good is good business,\u201d Ms. Siang said.In the past, leaders had to think almost exclusively about what was good for their organization. \u201cToday, they also have to bear the responsibility of societal stewardship.\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cThe society has ramifications for what is happening in our organization, and our organization has ramifications for what is happening in society. There is this interdependence.\u201dThose who become successful leaders today also must deliver a sense of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d to those who follow them, Mr. Pink said. They create an environment \u201cwhere people are safe to express themselves, to take risks, safe to be who they really are \u2014 whether it\u2019s a business, museum, dance troupe, whether it\u2019s a high school newspaper. That quality gives people the freedom to connect and innovate.\u201dLin-Manuel Miranda, creator of \u201cHamilton,\u201d re-envisioned the Broadway musical to tell a slice of American history via his passion for rapid-fire hip-hop lyrics, a language that bridges generations. It took Mr. Miranda seven years after reading Ron Chernow\u2019s biography \u201cAlexander Hamilton\u201d to bring his masterpiece to Broadway. And for a year, Mr. Miranda starred in his creation.For today\u2019s influencers, what\u2019s different is that, like Mr. Miranda, \u201cyou have to continually show motivation yourself,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cYour followers have to see it in you on a day-to-day basis. You have to demonstrate an emotional investment.\u201dIn fact, they might take a page from the playbook of Mr. Krzyzewski, 71. \u201cNext play\u201d is his mantra.\u201cWhether it is a success, or a failure, it is next play,\u201d Ms. Siang said. \u201cWhat Coach K. means by that is, don\u2019t rest on your laurels, but also don\u2019t be dragged down by your failures. Learn from both of them. Keep going forward, keep learning.\u201dSounds like the perfect prep for the next swell of change makers poised to mastermind a world that is moving like greased lightning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market\u2019s Trump Test Is About to Get Real: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will Trump\u2019s moves on Iran and trade push markets over the edge?\u2022 What\u2019s next for business after Eric Schneiderman?\u2022 D.E. Shaw grapples with an ousted executive who\u2019s fighting back.\u2022 What Rupert Murdoch will weigh if Comcast makes another bid for Fox assets.President Trump\u2019s antagonistic foreign policies have yet to cause serious losses in the stock market.But investors\u2019 stoicism could face greater tests in the coming weeks. They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years. It beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth. But even that strong performance was shadowed by analyst concerns over maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, never mentioned Comcast and presented the Fox deal as a fait accompli. \u201cWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved.\u201dMany analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.Mr. Schneiderman has denied the women\u2019s allegations.The NYT\u2019s Mark Landler reports:\u201cPresident Trump told President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday morning that he plans to announce the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord \u2014 and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said.\u201dHere\u2019s what Joe Papa, the company\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe Bausch name embodies the rich history of innovation, fortitude and dedication to patient health dating back to when J.J. Bausch opened his first optical goods shop more than 165 years ago. These qualities form the foundation of who we are today as we continue to build an innovative company striving to improve the health of patients globally.\u201d \u2014 Michael de la MercedSo where does the deal stack up among big acquisitions? Here\u2019s a breakdown courtesy of Dealogic:\u2022 It is the biggest deal announced this year, beating Cigna\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Express Scripts.\u2022 It is not just the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, but the biggest by a Japanese company. The $63 billion price tag just barely tops the $62.88 billion Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group paid for UFJ Holdings in 2005.The former acting attorney general has returned to King & Spalding as a partner in its special matters team and will head up in the firm\u2019s investigations group, according to a news release.Ms. Yates began her career at King & Spalding before spending 27 years at the Justice Department. She served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration asked her to stay on as acting attorney general until Jeff Sessions was confirmed to be attorney general.Ms. Yates worked at King & Spalding as a civil litigation associate from 1986 to 1989.The firm\u2019s bullying and threats against me over the last week, however, have revealed that the firm is so concerned with creating the appearance of supporting women that it is willing to cast false aspersions on me (and perpetuate false aspersions cast by others) and make me a scapegoat with a proverbial hanging in the town square.\u2022 Mr. Murdoch already spurned a Comcast offer 16 percent higher than what Disney\u2019s, saying regulators were more likely to block it.

In a conversation with New York Times reporters in Los Angeles the other day, Mr. Becerra said that, in fact, litigation directed at the Trump administration accounted for only a small portion of his legal energies.\u201cIt\u2019s a fraction,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cNowhere near what you think. I\u2019ve got 1,200 attorneys.

The rest dealt with immigration, consumer affairs and health care.Mr. Becerra acknowledged that some of his legal actions \u2014 particularly on immigration \u2014 could face dissent here in his home state.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Some red flags to watch at Symantec\u2022 David Tepper close to an agreement to purchase Carolina Panthers.\u2022 AT&T\u2019s C.E.O. said he regretted hiring Michael Cohen.\u2022 Symantec\u2019s stock plunges on news of an internal investigation.\u2022 What China\u2019s crackdown on debt means.\u2022 The latest on potential economic warning signs.Symantec, the cybersecurity software company, late Thursday said its audit committee had started an internal investigation related to concerns raised by a former employeeThe company provided no details about what those concerns were and did not hold a question and answer session with analysts on its conference call following the release of its earnings late Thursday. It did warn that its financial results may be affected, depending on the outcome of the investigation.The announcement helped drive Symantec\u2019s shares down by a third in Friday\u2019s trading.The fact that the audit committee is involved and that Symantec said its annual financial filing might now be delayed, suggests the company\u2019s book-keeping is under the spotlight. The issue may, of course, end up being minor. But until Symantec, which declined to comment, provides details, outsiders will look for red flags. Here are some:\u2014 Peter EavisThe deal could come as early as next week, Bloomberg reports. The N.F.L. owners would have to approve the transaction, and Mr. Tepper would have to sell his stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers.Add Randall Stephenson, the telecom giant\u2019s C.E.O., as another corporate chieftain who regretted getting involved with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.Mr. Stephenson sent out a memo to employees about the company\u2019s $600,000 contract with Essential Consultants, the shell company that Mr. Cohen had created (and which was also used to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels).In the memo, the AT&T C.E.O. said, \u201cThere is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\u201d though he added that the company followed the law.Yet it also said that its legislative affairs team would now report to the telecom\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee. The team\u2019s senior executive vice president, Bob Quinn, will be \u201cretiring.\u201dHere\u2019s the full text of the memo, which was obtained by DealBook:Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged. There is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate. But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment. In this instance, our Washington D.C. team\u2019s vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that. Here is more information on this issue, if you\u2019re interested.For the foreseeable future, the External & Legislative Affairs (E&LA) group will report to our General Counsel David McAtee. Bob Quinn, Senior Executive Vice President - E&LA, will be retiring.David\u2019s number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T.To all of you who work tirelessly every day to serve customers and represent the brand proudly, thank you. My personal commitment to you is \u2013 we will do better.RandallIn a separate document, the company discussed several other points about the hiring of Essential Consultants\u2014 including the fact that Mr. Cohen approached AT&T:Michael Cohen approached our External Affairs organization during the post-election transition period and said he was going to leave the Trump Organization and do consulting for a select few companies that wanted his opinion on the new President and his administration \u2013 the key players, their priorities, and how they think.The company also noted that it had hired \u201cpolitical consultants\u201d in the past, especially at the beginning of new administrations.\u2014 Michael de la MercedSymantec said the investigation was in its early stages and warned its \u201cfinancial results and guidance may be subject to change based on the outcome.\u201dIf Symantec\u2019s stock closes at its current levels, it would mark its worst single-day decline in 17 years and second worst fall in its history.First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months.Super huge thanks to everyone that helped with this project. Strong support from public, elected officials & regulators is critical to success.As mentioned in prior posts, once fully operational (demo system rides will be free), the system will always give priority to pods for pedestrians & cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.\u201cSome financial risks are longstanding, lurking sources of infection that are concealed very deep but may erupt in a flash. The United States subprime crisis erupted in a night. If we\u2019re going to have big trouble in the future, it could well be in this area, and this demands high vigilance.\u201d(Another of his worries: losing a tech race to the West.)But reducing debt will be difficult, as Christopher Lee of S.&P. Global told the NYT: \u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless.\u201dThe push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants.An earlier version of this briefing incorrectly said China\u2019s debt was 256 times the country\u2019s gross domestic product.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Is Comcast going to play spoiler?\u2022 Why bitcoin tumbled from its highs at the end of last year.\u2022 Apple is just $80 billion shy of $1 trillion.\u2022 Elliott Management offers to buy Athenahealth.\u2022 Catch up on the highlights from Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting.According to Reuters, Comcast is holding discussions with investment banks about financing an all-cash deal, but the cable giant is waiting on a judge to rule next month on the Department of Justice\u2019s suit to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner before submitting an offer, Reuters reported.ContextSince then, Comcast has moved to complicate Fox\u2019s plan to sell the bulk of its businesses to Disney.On Dec. 17, 2017, the price of bitcoin hit a high of $19,511. That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.The researchers write:\u201cThe advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\u201d\u201cThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\u201dShares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions. That rally has pushed the iPhone maker\u2019s market value back above $900 billion and just $80 billion shy of $1 trillion.Apple\u2019s shares had stumbled late last month as investors grew increasingly concerned that sales of iPhone\u2019s would disappoint. But revenue from the iPhone proved stronger than feared, and the company announced a $100 billion buyback plan.Elliott Management offered on Monday to buy Athenahealth for $160 a share, or $6.5 billion.The offer was made in a letter Elliott sent to the board of the health care software company. The activist hedge fund led by Paul Singer also said it may be \u201cable to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.\u201dIn Monday\u2019s letter, Elliott said: \u201cAthenahealth\u2019s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we are faced now with the stark reality that Athenahealth as a public-company investment, despite all of its promise, has not worked for many years, is not working today and will not work in the future. Given Athenahealth\u2019s potential, this reality is deeply frustrating, but the fact remains that Athenahealth as a public company has not made the changes necessary to enable it to grow as it should and to create the kind of value its shareholders deserve.\u201dElliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.\u201cThe letter doesn\u2019t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,\u201d The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct\u2019s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the \u201cWoodstock of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett \u2014 and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question \u2014 which they rarely do \u2014 that was critical of Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Wells Fargo. And Mr. Buffett\u2019s response to a gun question and a critique of Elon Musk caused lots of chatter.\u2022 Mr. Buffett is sticking with Wells Fargo despite its current troubles, and said that its current C.E.O., Tim Sloan, \u201cis correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201d\u2022 He loves Apple \u2014 but wants the company, of which Berkshire owns about 5 percent, to keep buying back shares. He had less-kind words for cryptocurrencies, which he said will \u201ccome to bad endings.\u201d\u2022 He defended business with the gun industry, reiterating, \u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201dThe alliance underlines Nestle\u2019s efforts to capture more upscale java drinkers in the U.S., where the maker of Nespresso and Nescafe has been outpaced by JAB Holding. The investment company of Europe\u2019s billionaire Reimann family has spent more than $30 billion building a coffee empire by acquiring assets such as Keurig Green Mountain and Peet\u2019s.Then there was this, from the NYT:In 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear.Aleksandr Kogan wasn\u2019t the only academic to harvest data from Facebook users: Researchers have collected information from the site for more than a decade. But the proliferation of these data sets has made it easier to identify some of the millions of individuals whose information was collected.One 2015 paper published in the journal Science looked at credit card spending data and found that data scientists could pinpoint 90 percent of the shoppers by name with just four random pieces of information from sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s kind of our ethos.\u201d Louis Anderson, a 16-year-old aspiring biotech entrepreneur, eats dinner with an anarchist, a world-renowned tongue splitter and at least 30 people who have implanted themselves with magnets or radio-frequency identification chips, a.k.a. RFID implants, for fun on a recent Friday night in Tehachapi, Calif.We\u2019re at Grindfest, an annual meetup of biohackers, and Louis has never met a single member of the community in the flesh before, although he\u2019s been planning the trip for two years. They have a lot to talk about.Will artificial intelligence kill us or save us? Will global warming be worse than experts predict? When will the next financial crisis strike? What brings Louis here?\u201cI don\u2019t want to say too much,\u201d he demurs, the lanky high school senior as coy as anyone confident enough to defer college to start a company might be. \u201cWe could be competitors.\u201dGrindfest is named for grinding, a subculture I might describe as medical punk. Less than a decade old, it is the anti-establishment fringe of a biohacking movement that\u2019s increasingly in the zeitgeist, in the form of health and fitness trackers, \u201ccognitive enhancing\u201d coffee and vitamins, and billionaire-backed schemes to outwit aging. Grinders, too, aim to optimize the body \u2014 with scalpels more often than seed funding. Now in its fifth year, Grindfest isn\u2019t on the radar of the cowboys at the rodeo ground down the road, much less the wider public. But that might soon change \u2014 people like Louis hope it will. \u201cBuilding your own computer used to be really niche,\u201d he says. \u201cNow everyone does it. \u201d Louis \u2014 who talks at a speed he calls \u201c2x,\u201d for the YouTube videos on cryptocurrency he watches when he\u2019s not winning science-fair prizes \u2014 is at Grindfest on business. By the end of the weekend, a biocoating of his invention will be attached to a glowing wire under the forearm of Hylyx Hyx, a self-described \u201csubmissive for science\u201d who met Louis in a Slack group. Yes, glowing. That is, if all goes according to plan.Hylyx is happy to serve as a test subject. \u201cI\u2019m used to having weird feelings about my body,\u201d says the pink-haired 35-year-old. \u201cI use \u2018they\u2019 pronouns. I don\u2019t care about most of my meat, so this is a way to have control over a part that I chose.\u201dThat night in the mountain air, a North Star shines \u2014 under the skin of Justin Worst, an archaeologist in whose hand the LED device was implanted. A dozen bodies curl together under blankets on a living room floor; more are in tents and in the backs of vans. A laundry alcove is strewn with circuit boards and soldering irons; in a 1980s garage-cum-laboratory, baby chicks chirp in a pen near the door. The mood resembles an alternate universe, what Silicon Valley might look like if a natural disaster had wiped the electrical grid for the entirety of the 1990s, or if Burning Man had devoured it rather than vice versa.There are blunt knives rigged with shock wires for sport. There are scalpels, carefully sterilized. There will be blood, and a documentary crew that will hover around it. Perhaps this isn\u2019t our dystopian past, but an imminent future, biding its time in the mountains near the western edge of the Mojave Desert.\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to talk,\u201d says Mr. Tibbets. He wears an eyebrow piercing everyday and scrubs during procedures. \u201cYou should be taking action. That\u2019s kind of our ethos.\u201d Near the lab, a group of understudies practices his techniques for suturing on a fleshy kombucha culture. Mr. Tibbetts is careful to emphasize what they are doing is not medicine or surgery but akin to body modification and piercing (the first two could be legally problematic). In the driveway outside, Russ Foxx, a body-modification artist with puck-like horns, shouts after Louis Anderson Sr., who\u2019s carrying fruit into the house. \u201cAre those bananas fully automatic?\u201dMr. Anderson, a suburban dad in a Nike T-shirt who woke up at dawn to go into town and get everyone doughnuts, responds without a beat: \u201cYep, plug me in and get ready!\u201d The two shared a ride together up from Los Angeles, organized by Louis.Buddy Ratner, a professor of bioengineering at the University of Washington, has spent two decades developing coatings and other strategies to improve the healing of implanted biomaterials and medical devices, and is skeptical. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in this particular brew that would solve the very difficult problem of how to heal the skin around transdermal foreign objects,\u201d he tells me after reviewing Louis\u2019s science-fair paper. \u201cAlthough this is a high school student, so you\u2019ve got to admire their motivation.\u201d\u201cHow do I say this nicely?\u201d considers Amanda Plimpton, who wears a circuit-print dress and a caffeine-molecule pendant. Her collective-turned-company, Livestock Labs, is developing implantable biosensors to predict diseases in cattle. \u201cThose white rich dudes wanna live forever. So that\u2019s where they put their money. They don\u2019t care about other things.\u201dLate Saturday, at a saloon a few miles away, Max Mata, a veteran in a cowboy hat who had never heard of Grindfest, contemplates the notion of electronic implants. He worries about privacy, like access to his Social Security number: \u201cCould they get your social off that thing? No thanks.\u201d\u201cWe made it available for dogs and they\u2019re not dying,\u201d counters his friend, Dakota Turney, a police officer.\u201cIt\u2019s different when it\u2019s humans,\u201d says Lexie Armienta, a waitress. \u201cYour body is your body.\u201d\u201cWhat about tattoos?\u201d asks Mata. \u201cWe all have those.\u201dOn Sunday morning, Mr. Tibbetts and Hylyx prepare to test Louis\u2019s coating. Overnight, the mixture has begun to crack around the edges of the wire. That wasn\u2019t the case in Louis\u2019s rodent trials, in which the coating dried smoothly around discs. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d ventures Mr. Tibbetts. \u201cThis wire is too flexible. If Hylyx\u2019s body rejects it, there\u2019s no way to know whether it\u2019s because of Louis\u2019s coating or something else.\u201d\u201cI want my arm to light up, but yeah,\u201d agrees Hylyx.The Andersons are in Los Angeles, waiting to catch a flight back to Arizona, when they hear the news via text. \u201cIf you fail once, try again,\u201d says Louis. \u201cThat\u2019s how I am.\u201d Louis\u2019s role model, the polymathic John von Neumann, tried his hand in a plethora of different fields. In June, the Andersons will fly to Shenzhen, China, to scout suppliers for his company.Hylyx goes into the procedure room anyway, with a finger magnet that has been failing, which means the uncanny sensation of electromagnetic fields \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s like air has a texture,\u201d someone says \u2014 has dulled. Underneath a bright fluorescent light, Hylyx pushes a scalpel into a finger; blood trickles down. \u201cDoing it on yourself is easier,\u201d Hylyx says. \u201cIf you make a mistake, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh well.\u2019 You feel it.\u201dHylyx, who has been living in a lemon-colored converted bread truck for the past few months, doesn\u2019t know yet where to travel tomorrow. Hylyx is considering installing a device that would link the vehicle to the entire world via radio waves, to talk to anyone in the world at any moment.

{"Headline": "Downloadable Neurons, Life on Mars: A Physicist\u2019s View of Where We\u2019re Headed", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The physicist Michio Kaku begins his new book, \u201cThe Future of Humanity,\u201d with the near-extinction at Toba because of his explicit concern with human survival into the distant future. While our Twitter-blinkered culture can barely think past the next election cycle, Kaku goes long in this new work. The timescapes he tours are breathtaking to consider, ranging from the next few centuries to millions of years of continuing human evolution. But prediction, as Yogi Berra once said, is difficult, especially about the future. Kaku believes he has guardrails that can keep his predictions in check, though: the progress of science and technology. Their sure advance, Kaku believes, allows for the extrapolation of what is possible now to a road map of what we might ultimately become.The first and most important limit for us to vault past is Earth itself. Kaku opens the discussion as to how humans might become a multiplanet species by quoting Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the self-taught Russian genius who first conceived of rocket-based space travel: \u201cThe Earth is our cradle, but we cannot be in our cradle forever.\u201d While the American space program has seemed rudderless for years, an era of New Space, led by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other high-frontier entrepreneurs, has just begun. They are the ones making tangible accomplishments in lowering the cost of reaching space. (There\u2019s a red Tesla Roadster orbiting Earth as you read this.) The vitality of the New Space movement means the next 200 years may well see humanity move from just exploring space to actually settling it.Kaku maps the path to become a true multiplanet species, beginning with reaching, and then settling, Mars. This includes \u201cterraforming\u201d \u2014 the large-scale alteration of Mars\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 for the benefit of its new human inhabitants. (It\u2019s worth noting that on one level the climate change we\u2019ve wrought on Earth now represents a kind of unintentional terraforming.) After Mars, Kaku turns to the science of asteroids and comets, since they will likely serve as resources to be mined or outposts of our expansion.Cosmically speaking, however, the solar system is nothing more than the neighborhood humanity was raised in. Like all good techno-optimists, Kaku believes growing up must mean getting out to the stars. But to make that jump we may need more than new machines. Instead, radically new versions of humanity itself may be the price the stars exact.Even the closest suns are so distant it could take centuries, at best, to reach them. This barrier leads Kaku to consider the ways humans might alter their own design to achieve approximations of immortality. Genetic engineering could allow us to correct the preprogrammed decay hiding inside every cell. Then there are \u201ctrans-humanist\u201d dreams of liberating consciousness from its biological wetware. Kaku believes we are all reducible to patterns of connected neurons in our brains. Once it\u2019s possible to fully digitize these \u201cconnectomes,\u201d travel via gleaming spaceships might be unnecessary. By encoding our connectomes into laser light we could beam directly from one star system to the other. Once received, our encoded consciousness would be downloaded in different machine, or perhaps biological, bodies at each new location.You would be right to think this sounds like science fiction or to be skeptical that some of it is even possible. (I\u2019m good with terraforming but doubt that we are nothing but our neurons.) But the strength of Kaku\u2019s writing is knowing which science fiction ideas are worth following. Kaku grounds his readers in science happening right now, while throwing open the windows to imagine where it might lead in a thousand years. In this effort he is particularly adept at drawing from the lexicon of popular science fiction. From Marvel\u2019s \u201cIron Man\u201d to Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cInterstellar,\u201d he uses ideas from our shared cultural warehouse as launchpads for questions of the deep future.But is a future of genetically engineered bodies, or of no bodies at all, the kind anyone would want to inherit? Once, as I extolled the virtues of our cosmic future, a nonscientist friend quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be a sexless space orb.\u201d It\u2019s this important question of what we value that Kaku\u2019s optimism fails to fully comprehend.The future will be shaped not just by what we can do but by what we will want to do. That pivot is what makes the deep future so hard to imagine. At one point Kaku makes the argument that the genetic divergence of people 75,000 years ago to now is so small that even with genetic engineering we won\u2019t be so different as to be inhuman 75,000 years in the future. But this argument misses an essential point about culture and imagination. Seeing the extraordinary cave paintings of Lascaux, for example, it seems clear our hunter-gatherer ancestors lived a dense, rich experience that differs significantly from our own. The remarkable science fiction stories of Cordwainer Smith (a.k.a. Paul Linebarger, a noted East Asia scholar and C.I.A. expert in psychological warfare) are instructive in this regard. The universe of his series \u201cThe Rediscovery of Man,\u201d set tens of thousands of years from now, offers a future rich in symbols and dreams, where technology has irrevocably altered the mythic underpinnings of what it means to be human.It\u2019s also worthwhile to ask whose future we\u2019re talking about. Most of our popular science fiction visions of the future were written by men (and most of them white). From feminist critiques to the alternative lines of Afrofuturism, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time recently wondering what our imagined futures would look like if more kinds of people were encouraged to imagine them.But these misgivings don\u2019t detract from the book\u2019s pleasures. Kaku does acknowledge many of the issues, ethical and otherwise, the science raises, at least in passing. While those problems are likely to be central to the future, this book is meant to introduce readers unfamiliar with science to the vast horizons it has already opened and where our journeys toward those frontiers might lead.Adam Frank is a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester and the author of \u201cLight of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: State Farmers Supported Trump. Now His Trade Policies Have Them Worried.", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The June 5 primary election here in California will be the first major test of a feverish effort by Democrats to fight President Trump\u2019s agenda.Their aim is to flip a handful of Republican-held congressional districts in the Golden State as part of their broader goal to take control of the House of Representatives in November.But in the heavily agrarian San Joaquin Valley, where several Republican members of Congress are expected to pull off easy re-elections, the mood is decidedly less feverish.In 2016, the state exported $2 billion in agriculture products to China, which is the state\u2019s third biggest foreign market for farm goods.\u201cThere is definitely a sense of frustration and just anxiety over all about how this all plays out,\u201d said Sara Neagu-Reed, of the California Farm Bureau Federation. In addition to decreased demand for American farm goods, there are other indirect trade effects related to the uneasy trade relationship that can hurt farmers.In particular, more frequent and thorough customs inspections of American goods on the Chinese mainland have caused problems. Ms. Neagu-Reed said that she and the organization have heard from growers who have shipped their products only to find them delayed by inspection backlogs.If the products sit there too long, they risk rotting. But she demurred when asked what she was hearing from farmers about the president\u2019s performance on trade issues. Ms. Neagu-Reed said she had heard many growers express hope that the administration was pursuing trade policies to expand available export markets; such efforts could at least balance out potentially shrinking sales to China.\u201cWhat I can say from the California perspective and our growers is that we\u2019ve already been put in a really tough situation,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil we see that actually happen, then our growers won\u2019t really take a stance against or with all the policies the administration is pursuing.\u201dTricia Stever Blattler, the executive director of the Tulare County Farm Bureau, said she believed it was too early to tell if farmers in the valley would change their support for the administration\u2019s broader goals.She acknowledged that some of the administration\u2019s positions don\u2019t align perfectly with the needs or preferences of farmers. But she pointed to widespread support for the work the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S.D.A are doing to promote agriculture, which she said had \u201cre-energized\u201d many people.\u201cWe really do have to have trade offs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize we\u2019re not going to win on every issue every time.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Mr. Cooper, who is black, was sentenced to death for a quadruple killing in Chino Hills in 1983.

Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that.That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.

McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis.\u2022 Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison\u2019s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent.\u2022 With Ms. Morrison\u2019s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin.\u2022 Campbell\u2019s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company\u2019s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell\u2019s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year.\u2014 Tiffany HsuContext\u2022 Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba.\u2022 On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn\u2019t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right.

Next?\u201dTesla\u2019s stock price fell 5.6 percent the next day.On May 11, a Tesla sedan with a semiautonomous Autopilot feature rear-ended a truck at 60 miles per hour, leaving the driver with a broken right ankle and a totaled car.In a tweet that would foreshadow his complaints to come, Mr. Musk said: \u201cIt\u2019s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage.\u201dMr. Musk has been on something of a Twitter rampage the last few days as well.On Wednesday afternoon, the news website Electrek published an article that appears to have perfectly captured Mr. Musk\u2019s mounting frustration with the media.The article pointed out that \u201cthe media has been having a field day with Tesla crashes and Model 3 delays lately, which has affected the company\u2019s stock,\u201d and it highlighted a note put out by an auto analyst for the financial services firm Baird.The note argued that all the negative reports are \u201cincreasingly immaterial\u201d and that because \u201cwe have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment,\u201d the company\u2019s stock could rally as that sentiment improves.Mr. Musk retweeted a link to the article and commented: \u201cThe holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.\u201dBy about 8:42 p.m., Mr. Musk had sent more than two dozen tweets and was still going.

I don\u2019t have other things I need to think about.\u201dWhat\u2019s especially noteworthy, given that workload, is that between his two offices \u2014 he maintains one in SoHo in New York, where he spends time every month \u2014 he has barely 30 employees.His creatively cluttered Culver City office here has an inflatable lobster hanging from the ceiling, and the structure has been pared back to reveal the trusses and beams holding it up, a signature move of his. Nearby is a drawing of a smiling octopus holding up signs that tick off some the firm\u2019s specialties, including exhibit design, artist collaboration and \u201cone-offs.\u201dKnown as a garrulous and social sort, Mr. Yantrasast actually attributes his success to listening.\u201cI think I\u2019m definitely a collaborator,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a matchmaker \u2014 between me and other people.\u201d\u201cI love making good spaces,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not in it to create a monument to myself.\u201dMichael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, praised Mr. Yantrasast\u2019s \u201cfresh approach\u201d and his subtlety.\u201cIt\u2019s a highly sensitive group of people \u2014 artists, and those who run art galleries and museums,\u201d Mr. Govan said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many architects who have the right sensibility.\u201dMr. Govan hired Mr. Yantrasast to design a 2014 exhibition of samurai armor. \u201cIt was brilliant how he organized it as a march, using the long space of the Resnick Pavilion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was super dramatic and theatrical, without taking away from the work.\u201dMr. Govan added, \u201cIt was a great example of why you don\u2019t always do the white box,\u201d the default minimal setting of art spaces.The New York architect Annabelle Selldorf \u2014 a contemporary of Mr. Yantrasast\u2019s who has much gallery and museum work under her belt \u2014 said that in addition to his honed sensibility, Mr. Yantrasast has the elusive ability to motivate others.\u201cHe has a way to rally people,\u201d Ms. Selldorf said. \u201cThey can sense his devotion to art.\u201dGrowing up in Bangkok, Mr. Yantrasast was making drawings alongside his engineer father by the time he was in the sixth grade. After graduate school at the University of Tokyo, he went to work with the Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Tadao Ando for eight years.Like Mr. Ando, Mr. Yantrasast has a penchant for the power of concrete, but he has established a distinct style: decidedly modern, but with openness and warmth.\u201cI love minimalism and the strong gesture as much anyone, but sometimes when you do that it\u2019s more exclusive than inclusive \u2014 only for the select few,\u201d he said.Mr. Yantrasast has a passion for food, and he elaborated on his approach with a cuisine metaphor related to his roots.\u201cJapanese food is all about refinement, abstraction clarity,\u201d he said. \u201cThai food is about everything at once \u2014 flexibility and improvisation. I really think the world of architecture and design is moving from Japanese food to Thai food.\u201dProminent architects travel widely as part of their jobs, living much of their life in airports. In late March and April alone, Mr. Yantrasast was in Tokyo; Hong Kong; Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in addition to his usual bicoastal hubs in the United States.Design was on his mind when he settled in Los Angeles. \u201cPart of why I moved here was Frank Gehry,\u201d Mr. Yantrasast said of the influential architect. But it was not Mr. Gehry\u2019s buildings exactly, which are quite distinct from Mr. Yantrasast\u2019s. It was more Mr. Gehry\u2019s ability to break tradition: \u201cHe created a sense of place that wasn\u2019t European.\u201d\u201cAnd I saw his background as encouragement,\u201d Mr. Yantrasast added, referring to his working-class roots. \u201cFrank didn\u2019t fit in.\u201dTwo of Mr. Yantrasast\u2019s biggest museum projects have been in the middle of the country. In 2007, he completed a $75 million, 127,000-square-foot building for Michigan\u2019s Grand Rapids Art Museum, now credited with bolstering urban renewal there. (It was designed with his former partner at wHY, Yo-Ichiro Hakomori; they founded the firm in 2003.)In 2016, he completed a $60 million renovation and an addition, in the form of an elegant glass box, to the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky\u2019s largest and oldest art museum.In some ways, the Marciano Art Foundation project, completed a year ago, perfectly illustrates Mr. Yantrasast\u2019s skill set. The building, a 1961 Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, has a fortresslike appearance with its soaring, largely plain travertine exterior, but inside, the big spaces had potential for art.\u201cWe cleaned it up and really let the DNA of the building shine through,\u201d Mr. Yantrasast said.He pared back what he could, all the way to the wide-span architecture of the roof; he even revealed the structural elements behind the stained glass windows, which feature dramatic eagle figures. He added a couple of partial walls in the top-floor gallery, not only to hang more art but also to change the proportions of the room, which to him seemed too wide.Mr. Yantrasast could probably ride the wave of similar projects for the rest of his career, but he is also branching out.So what else is on his architectural bucket list? As in his buildings, Mr. Yantrasast is comfortable throwing in a curve to the shape of his career.\u201cI want to design senior housing,\u201d he said at the end of a long day. \u201cI\u2019m looking to make an impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could a Colonial-Era Golf Club Solve Hong Kong\u2019s Housing Woes?", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 The Hong Kong Golf Club is a 129-year-old enclave of privilege whose quiet fairways once catered to the city\u2019s British colonial rulers, but whose parking lot is now filled with the Teslas and Porsches of its wealthy Chinese elite.More recently, this sprawling golf club, with 54 holes, has become something else: the focal point of a raging, citywide debate about how to use Hong Kong\u2019s scarcest and most valuable resource, land.\u201cGolf is a plaything of the Brits,\u201d said Ng Cheuk-hang, 23, a spokesman for the Land Justice League, an activist group that wants the golf course redeveloped into low-rent public housing.\u201cIt\u2019s not a grass-roots sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sport for the people, and it creates a lot of social injustices.\u201dYoshihiro Nishi, 51, the president of the Hong Kong Golf Association, a group representing four private golf clubs in Hong Kong, thinks the activists are unnecessarily politicizing the issue.\u201cAll the members of the Hong Kong Golf Club understand the housing needs in Hong Kong,\u201d said Mr. Nishi, who works as a private banker by day. \u201cWe just want to make sure that we get to say what we want to say. Don\u2019t turn it into a little bit of fight between the haves and don\u2019t-haves.\u201dThe problem is that property prices in Hong Kong have soared to the highest levels in the world; blue-collar and middle-class families are priced out of the market. And so the city is searching everywhere for places to build \u2014 the edges of public parks, a few remaining farms, land reclaimed from the sea and so-called brownfield sites, like former container yards.It\u2019s an affordable-housing crisis whose effects have rippled across the broader economy and inflamed political tensions in a society already divided over Beijing\u2019s refusal to allow free elections.Much of this mountainous, densely populated territory of more than seven million has already been filled with high-rises, shopping centers and concrete sprawl. Hong Kong\u2019s golf courses and other private recreation clubs \u2014 long given special treatment as the city strove to be an attractive hub for global bankers and executives \u2014 are increasingly seen as one of the quickest solutions to the land shortage.But as the golf courses and clubs face growing calls to be redeveloped into public housing, they also are facing angry protests linking the crisis over land use to the city\u2019s broader problems of economic inequality and declining social mobility.In late March, protesters stormed the Hong Kong Golf Club, in the far-flung suburb of Fanling just two train stops from the Chinese border. Chanting \u201cLand for all!\u201d and \u201cWe want public housing! Take back the golf course!\u201d they marched down the neatly manicured lawns before occupying a putting green.When protesters reappeared a month later, they scuffled with security guards who barred them from entering. A golfer who was not a member of the club was seen grabbing a protester by the neck and throwing him to the ground.The dispute has been exacerbated by Hong Kong\u2019s political paralysis.Bitter infighting between its unelected, Beijing-backed leadership and the pro-democracy opposition has left the city\u2019s government unable to tackle tough problems, chief among them the lack of affordable housing. The prohibitive property prices, while a boon for the elite, have hurt the rest of the economy by raising costs for small businesses and start-ups.The activists seemed to get support from a recent government report proposing that the 425-acre golf course be partly or fully redeveloped for housing and other public uses. According to the report\u2019s estimates, the course is big enough to hold 13,200 apartment units, housing 37,000 people.The club is one of six golf courses and 24 private sports clubs on special government leases. Some of the others, including the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club and the Hong Kong Cricket Club, also date to the 19th century, and used to serve a mostly white, colonial clientele.Together, the clubs occupy 828 acres of land \u2014 about the size of Central Park in New York City \u2014 and serve about 56,000 members. They rent their land from the government through the special leases, so-called private recreational leases, that offer often below-market rates, drawing accusations that the government is \u201csubsidizing the rich.\u201dThe private recreational lease policy is a holdover from Hong Kong\u2019s colonial days, when recreational facilities were few and far between. A policy document from 1979 said the private clubs \u201cprovide an important outlet for the upper middle class and business circles.\u201d\u201cWe are lacking in golf facilities severely,\u201d said Arnold Wong, 44, the previous captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, an elected position in which he represented its members. Mr. Wong, the co-founder of a restaurant company, pointed out that Hong Kong has fewer 18-hole courses than Singapore, which has a smaller population.\u201cIn terms of golf facilities, we are already lagging way behind as a major financial city,\u201d he said.As the debate has grown, the government\u2019s Home Affairs Bureau has proposed changes to the leasing policy, like charging the golf clubs higher rent.Last year, the Hong Kong Golf Club paid 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars (about $320,000) to the government in rent, a mere 3 percent of actual market rental value. Even so, the club had a deficit of the equivalent of $1.27 million in 2016, according to its annual report, suggesting that substantial increases in rent would pose a financial challenge.As the largest of Hong Kong\u2019s private clubs, the Hong Kong Golf Club represents the upper-class elite of the city. A corporate membership can be bought for some $2 million. Individual memberships have a one-off entrance fee of around $64,000, and monthly dues of several hundred dollars, but require personal connections and patience for a waiting list that is years long.For most of its history, the club had the word \u201cRoyal\u201d in its name, and members were predominantly British expatriates. Today, most of the 2,660 members are Hong Kong Chinese, many of whom got rich in real estate or finance after the economy took off in the 1970s. More recently, wealthy Chinese mainlanders have joined in growing numbers.The club opens its gates to nonmembers on most weekdays, though the fee of about $140 per 18-hole round puts it out of reach for many in Hong Kong, where the median monthly income is around $2,150. In recent years, the club has invested in community outreach, like teaching golf to underprivileged students and training talented young golfers.Yet as Hong Kong feels increasingly divided between rich and poor, the debate surrounding the golf course speaks to more fundamental questions about the future of this city, and whether it will be affordable to all, or just a playground of the rich.Some of the most vocal opponents of the course are young social activists who call land ownership the biggest dividing line between Hong Kong\u2019s haves and have-nots.Yam Chun, 24, a community organizer for the Concerning Grassroots\u2019 Housing Rights Alliance, sees the golf course as the epitome of inequitable use of land.Born to a working-class family, she said she grew up in cramped subdivided flats and old tenement buildings while her family sat on a long waiting list just to get into public housing.\u201cWhen my family and I were still waiting for public housing, I thought to myself, does Hong Kong really not have enough land?\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve grown up, I realize that the real problem is the unfair distribution of land.\u201dSome experts say that while the dispute has exposed deeper anxieties caused by Hong Kong\u2019s economic rise, the golf course is not big enough to solve the housing issue.\u201cThe golf course problem is just pure political populism,\u201d said Richard Wong, professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe golf course is peripheral, completely peripheral, to the solution to this problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic.\u201dStill, symbols can be important, and some argue that getting rid of the golf course would hurt Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness.\u201cAs an international financial city you do need to balance housing needs with sporting needs,\u201d said Mr. Wong, the club captain. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a walled city of just concrete, with no facilities, no attractions to other investors, foreigners, expats, people of different backgrounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 Is Still the \u2018Ultimate Trip\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "Out ThereThe rerelease of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece encourages us to reflect again on where we\u2019re coming from and where we\u2019re going.Supported byIn the spring of 1964 the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was very worried. NASA was about to fly the Mariner 4 space probe past Mars.At the time he was deep in development of a blockbuster film about the discovery of alien intelligence. Word was that MGM had bet their studio on the film. What if Mariner discovered life on Mars and scooped them?Mr. Kubrick\u2019s movie, \u201c2001, A Space Odyssey,\u201d finally debuted, late and over budget in April 1968, to baffled film critics and long lines of young people. John Lennon said he went to see it every week. It was the top-grossing movie of the year and is now a perennial on critics\u2019 lists of the most important movies of all time, often the first movie scientists mention if you ask them about sci-fi they have enjoyed.The movie broke with many of the conventions of the time, like mood music to tell you what to feel and think. \u201c2001\u201d left you alone in space with your thoughts.The story begins four million years ago in Africa, where a bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until a strange black monolith appears. To the thunder of \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra,\u201d one of those apemen is inspired to pick up a bone and use it as a club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around.Suddenly, the apemen are eating meat and chasing their rivals away from the water hole. In a moment of exultation the ape throws the bone into the sky where, in what has been called the longest fast forward in film history, it turns into a spaceship.Around that toss Kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution. Another monolith appears on the moon, and yet another in orbit around Jupiter, where an astronaut named Dave Bowman connects with it after subduing a neurotic computer, the HAL 9000, which has murdered his shipmates. In the finale, Bowman is sent through a \u201cstar gate\u201d on a trip through space and time, death and rebirth, returning as a glowing Star Child to float like a fetus over the Earth.The last time I watched the movie (on VHS of all things on my tiny home television), was in 2000, on the eve of its eponymous year.I never realized how much I had missed until I read Mr. Benson\u2019s book, a deep, informative and entertaining dive into the making of the movie.One revelation is how haphazardly the movie was made. Nevermind the special effects and the model spaceships, Kubrick and Clarke were making up much of the story as they went along. Up until the very end, Mr. Benson tells us, they were struggling with how to portray the alien being responsible for the monoliths, until they realized it couldn\u2019t be done. We don\u2019t know what is out there. It would be hubris to even try to imagine.This is not a review of the book; Mr. Benson is a friend of mine, and I\u2019m unabashedly ignorant of the history of cinema anyway. But it is a review of my own shifting attitudes and encounters with the movie itself over the years.One mark of the movie\u2019s status as a masterpiece is that it has something different to say to us every time we encounter it anew.Like the monolith it appears to give us what we need.Fifty years ago it was a harbinger of the future. We were about to win the race with the Russians to the moon. A whole generation was pumped and primed to tune in, turn on and transcend the whole dreary space-time continuum as we knew it.Thoroughly researched by Kubrick and Clarke, large swaths of the film were like a documentary of the future: the space station, the moon base, the grand-stepping outward just as Clarke and people like Wernher von Braun had prophesied.It\u2019s now been 46 years since there was anyone on the moon. It\u2019s possible to imagine a time in which there will be no humans alive who have been there.But Mars is having a moment in the popular imagination \u2014 from the Matt Damon film \u201cThe Martian,\u201d which got high marks for scientific realism a couple years ago, to an upcoming television series \u201cThe First,\u201d about settlers on Mars being planned by Beau Willimon, the producer and showrunner of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dWhere the script has really flipped is in the future history of evolution.We all carry HAL in our pockets now, and in a few years he, it, will be in our bloodstreams. The future, to the extent that humans are part of it, is bionic.Computers, to the delight of surveillance states and the despair of civil libertarians, can now recognize faces. For all we know neural networks like Deep Mind can dream.In that case, I have a bone or two to pick with the director.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a rocket engineer. He is Wernher von Braun, not Werner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Musk vs. Buffett: An Invitation for Investors to Take Sides", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElon Musk and Warren E. Buffett clashed over the weekend after Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, derided as lame Mr. Buffett\u2019s concept of companies having \u201cmoats\u201d to keep potential competitors at bay. When Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman, cited his confectionery maker, See\u2019s Candies, as proof to the contrary, Mr. Musk pledged to launch his own candy maker. It\u2019s an invitation for investors to take sides; many already have.For the 40,000 shareholders who flooded Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting on Saturday, Tesla looks like the epitome of a terrible investment. Mr. Buffett prizes companies with healthy management incentives, simple operations and little competition. Mr. Musk\u2019s electric-car maker flunks on all three counts.Take incentives. Mr. Musk is remunerated in part for pumping up Tesla\u2019s share price \u2014 his new 10-year bonus plan could net him $55.8 billion in stock if the company\u2019s market capitalization hits $650 billion and bull\u2019s-eyes certain revenue and profitability targets. Investors won\u2019t be complaining if he gets there, but it\u2019s an incentive to take huge risks. If the company misses those goals, or fails outright, Mr. Musk has other irons in the fire. He holds a significant stake in the rocket company SpaceX, recently valued in a private transaction at around $26 billion.The cultural divide is mirrored on the balance sheet: While Berkshire Hathaway holds $116 billion in cash, Tesla has just $2.7 billion in cash \u2014 roughly equivalent to one year\u2019s capital expenditure \u2014 yet is burning greenbacks and has $500 million in debt coming due in a few months.The Oracle of Omaha and the Playboy of Palo Alto have taken opposing positions before, including when Mr. Buffett\u2019s Nevada energy company clashed with Mr. Musk\u2019s solar-panel group SolarCity in 2016. Yet they share some common ground, too. Both think deeply about their customers. Mr. Musk often responds personally to Twitter requests \u2014 such as for a service center in Iceland or a hardtop convertible. He\u2019d probably agree with Mr. Buffett that thinking like a consumer is paramount.For now, at least, shareholders have Mr. Musk trailing Mr. Buffett. Tesla\u2019s highly volatile shares are down 4 percent over the past year, whereas Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s are up 19 percent. And investors have piled into short-selling Tesla, with almost one-quarter of the stock out on loan, according to Thomson Reuters data.Of course, Tesla doubters could end up burned if the shares rise in the short term, as Mr. Musk says they will. And Mr. Buffett himself doesn\u2019t bet against stocks falling. So buying Berkshire Hathaway and shorting Tesla makes ample sense for those who believe Mr. Buffett\u2019s teachings \u2014 but not those who actually copy him.Advertisement"}

It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy.Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state\u2019s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city\u2019s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations \u2014 a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income\u2019s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor.The idea is that single mothers might use cash to go back to school, while poor families add fruit and vegetables to their diets.Basic income confronts potent skepticism. Some argue it will undermine the work ethic. Others contend that it will compete with \u2014 and siphon funding from \u2014 existing government relief programs for the poor and jobless. A national program could cost trillions of dollars a year.But the Stockton trial is engineered as an test of how an unconditional cash grant program can operate.Which means that a Central Valley City that has long represented scarcity will now be used to convey how life can change when struggling people get a little more.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Google\u2019s work for the Defense Department has touched off an existential crisis in Mountain View.It recently won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used for drone strikes.By reviewing emails and documents and interviewing Google insiders, Times reporters got a detailed picture of how the news fractured its work force, fueling heated staff meetings and prompting employees with moral objections to resign.Executives now face this dilemma: Proceeding with defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; rejecting such work would deprive the company of a potentially huge business.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 CBS takes its biggest step yet to block a Viacom deal.\u2022 Tim Armstrong looks like he\u2019s staying put at Oath.\u2022 The complexities of President Trump moving to save ZTE.\u2022 What\u2019s in store for Xerox?\u2022 How the White House is warning Europe over Iran.For Les Moonves and his team at CBS, Monday meant war against Shari Redstone and her desire to merge the media company with its corporate sibling, Viacom.Let\u2019s break down what happened:\u2022 In the lawsuit, CBS accused Ms. Redstone of presenting \u201ca significant threat of irreparable and irreversible harm to the company and its stockholders.\u201d\u2022 CBS also asserts in its lawsuit, \u201cMs. Redstone told the C.E.O. of a potential acquirer of CBS that he should not make such an offer, thereby depriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity that the board or the special committee should have been free to evaluate.\u201d That chief executive was Lowell C. McAdam of Verizon, according to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.The lawsuit was pre-emptive, given that Ms. Redstone has considered replacing CBS\u2019s board if it continued to resist a merger with Viacom. CBS has wanted Les Moonves to become the combined company\u2019s C.E.O. and his C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to take the No. 2 position. Viacom has pressed for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to hold that spot, and Ms. Redstone had largely sided with Viacom.CBS added that its board believes it is acting out of a fiduciary duty to all of its shareholders, and not just Ms. Redstone.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAfter CBS essentially declared war against its controlling shareholder and her desire to combine the company with Viacom, Ms. Redstone dropped a bombshell of her own.From a statement by National Amusements, the vehicle through which the Redstones control CBS and Viacom:NAI believes CBS\u2019s action today was precipitated following NAI raising specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation in relation to one CBS director, dating back to 2016. NAI has made every effort to deal with this matter privately and confidentially. Unfortunately, CBS\u2019s action today continues to enable and empower such conduct.In meetings and informal discussions during the week of May 7, 2018 and continuing over the weekend of May 11\u201313, 2018, the CBS Special Committee finally determined that a CBS/Viacom merger is not in the best interests of CBS stockholders (other than NAI).CBS asserted that it filed suit because it was worried about Ms. Redstone blocking a meeting of the special committee taking place on Thursday. At the meeting, the committee is set to consider issuing a special dividend to all shareholders that could effectively neuter Ms. Redstone\u2019s 79 percent voting stake in the media company.National Amusement also said that CBS and Viacom had even reached a provisional agreement on valuation. Viacom\u2019s investors would receive 0.6135 CBS shares for each Viacom share they own, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. The valuation marked a compromise for both sides and is a sign that CBS had previously supported exploring a merger of the two companies.Symantec, a cybersecurity software company, on Monday released details about an internal investigation that arose from concerns of a former employee.Symantec announced the investigation late on Thursday but provided scant details. On Monday, the company said the employee had drawn attention to certain financial measures and the company\u2019s public disclosures, including commentary on its historical financial results. The measures included those that might affect executive compensation, the company said in a statement released after the close of regular trading on Monday. Retaliation was another issue the former employee raised, the statement said, without going into detail.Symantec said it \u201cdid not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements.\u201dShares of Symantec lost a third of their value in Friday but recovered somewhat on Monday. The stock finished up nearly 10 percent and added another 2.6 percent after the close.Symantec executives on Thursday did not hold a question and answer session with analysts to discuss the quarterly results it put out that day.

In Monday\u2019s decision in the case, Murphy v.

From the FT\u2019s story:Mr. Armstrong, who also declined to comment, ran AOL until its $4.4bn sale to Verizon in 2015. He is chief executive of Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns AOL and Yahoo. One person close to the search process said Mr. Armstrong would be a good choice as \u201che knows all about restructuring\u201d.A former Google executive, Mr. Armstrong was appointed to the helm of AOL in 2009 to revive a company that had fallen from the dizzying heights it had reached during the dot-com bubble.Since the FT article was published, I\u2019ve heard arguments that Mr. Armstrong would have made sense as WPP\u2019s next C.E.O., given his commercial and digital savvy. But it was unclear whether the London-based WPP would feel comfortable with an American as C.E.O., and whether Mr. Armstrong would be willing to move to Britain.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAndrew asks: When Mr. Trump says the Commerce Department would act independently on ZTE \u2014 after he instructed it to make a deal with the Chinese \u2014 is that different from when he said the Justice Department would act independently on AT&T after he urged it to block the Time Warner deal?The stock is currently up 6 percent.The assets being put up for sale include \u201cKenmore brand and related assets, the Sears Home Improvement Products business of the Sears Home Services division and the Parts Direct business of the Sears Home Services division.\u201d\u2022 Xerox said that it was withdrawing from the Fujifilm transaction because its Japanese partner had not delivered audited statements on time.

But Tesla is supposed to be the auto manufacturer of the future, not a bauble maker for the rich.Tesla, by contrast, today is a terrible idea with a brilliant leader. The terrible idea is that electric cars are the wave of the future, at least for the mass market. Gasoline has advantages in energy density, cost, infrastructure and transportability that electricity doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t for decades. The brilliance is Musk\u2019s Trump-like ability to get people to believe in him and his preposterous promises. Tesla without Musk would be Oz without the Wizard.But the Tesla story isn\u2019t just about the perils of misdirected government-led development and clever rent-seeking entrepreneurs.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Seeks Its Economic Mojo in the Stuff That Makes the Stuff", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 There is absolutely nothing sexy about bellows. But they just might be the future of Japan.\u201cThe technology used in making these products is very difficult,\u201d said Norihiro Irie, Irie Koken\u2019s president. \u201cNot many companies are able to do it.\u201dJapan is moving toward \u201can entirely different strategy, where other countries cannot compete,\u201d said Ryoji Musha, president of the economic analysis outfit Musha Research in Tokyo. \u201cGoing forward, Japan will show a remarkable emergence as one of the locomotives of the global economy.\u201dMany of Japan\u2019s biggest players have to look beyond the country\u2019s borders in their quest for growth. The declining population helped drive Takeda Pharmaceutical\u2019s deal on Tuesday for Shire \u2014 the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\u201cThe undertow pulling at the dynamics of growth is the main limit to what Japan can do on a sustained basis,\u201d said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of the finance firm Starfort Investment Holdings. Though Japan has some competitive companies that will continue to excel, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that changes the overall equation.\u201dJapan also had several false starts over the past quarter-century, only to stumble back into the doldrums. If this time is different, one big reason will be companies like Irie Koken.Mr. Irie said business had not been this good since he took over as the company\u2019s president 19 years ago. Sales more than doubled in its last fiscal year.\u201cWe can\u2019t catch up with all our orders,\u201d Mr. Irie said.With I.T. becoming more critical to just about every sector and factories looking to improve efficiency, greater demand is expected for robots, chips and other high-tech products \u2014 and the made-in-Japan parts and machines needed to manufacture them.\u201cEven if there is a recession, I don\u2019t see it changing speed right now,\u201d said Rosen Diankov, chief technology officer at the robotics company Mujin Inc.Mr. Diankov, an American robotics specialist, founded Mujin in 2011 with Issei Takino of Japan, a former cutting-tool sales manager, to produce devices that control industrial robots. Its headquarters in a refurbished warehouse in east Tokyo have the hipster vibe of a garage start-up, with offices and workshops cluttered with equipment.Such entrepreneurial companies are all too rare in Japan, where venture capital and risk-taking are scarce compared with the United States or China. But Mujin\u2019s founders believe that Japan is leading the way in automation, and they wanted to be part of the action.\u201cWe could have opened our company in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Takino, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOne of the good things about being in Japan is that it is very easy to find a customer.\u201dMujin\u2019s technology can appear retro at first glance. One hand-held remote looks as if it belongs with a 1990s video game console. But Mujin says its advanced components make robots more efficient and easier to use, and are hard for competitors to recreate.The sheer complexity of these Japanese specialties may help the economy maintain a competitive edge. Unlike the TVs, CD players and other consumer electronics that drove Japan\u2019s past boom, Mujin\u2019s controllers and Irie Koken\u2019s bellows are much harder for manufacturers in China and elsewhere to replicate. When the Beijing-based online retailer JD.com wanted to automate an unmanned warehouse in China, it turned to Mujin.Some of Japan\u2019s big corporations are heading in the same direction. The electronics giant Panasonic was once synonymous with televisions and videorecorders. But over the past six years, it has drastically downsized its consumer businesses \u2014 it no longer sells televisions in the United States \u2014 and shifted into industrial electronics, including the batteries for Tesla roadsters and sensors and cameras for automobiles.\u201cIt is very important to position ourselves wisely,\u201d said Yasuyuki Higuchi, chief executive of Panasonic\u2019s connected solutions unit. \u201cOtherwise, we cannot be competitive.\u201dHowever, even the most competitive sectors aren\u2019t immune from Japan\u2019s problems. Severe labor shortages are already plaguing businesses, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at the research firm Capital Economics, who added that the country was not welcoming nearly enough foreigners to offset the impact.\u201cThe demographic headwinds will continue to resist,\u201d said Mr. Thieliant, who estimates that Japan\u2019s current spate of growth has already ended. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get more immigrants in, you eventually hit a wall.\u201dMr. Irie has struggled to find the workers he needs to fill the deluge of new orders. His customers now have to wait twice as long as usual for their bellows \u2014 up to five months. \u201cThe economy is very good, so good workers are being taken by other companies,\u201d he complained.The shortage has prodded management to invent new ways to attract talent. Mujin employs a chef to cook lunch for the staff every day. Mr. Irie in recent years has taken all of his employees on a Hawaii vacation and renovated the company\u2019s offices.\u201cThe older employees asked, \u2018Why do you have to spend money to make things stylish?\u2019\u201d Mr. Irie said. \u201cThe image of manufacturing may not be very nice. We want to change it.\u201dHe remains optimistic, too. He plans to expand the capacity of his factory in Japan over the next few years, possibly making the company\u2019s largest investment ever.\u201cWe are riding a wave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be on this wave because we have something special.\u201dChie Kobayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank\u2019s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis.The nation\u2019s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests \u201cperiodically.\u201d These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks\u2019 risk management. If the Fed requires these company tests less frequently, regulators may end up with less insight into how the most systemically important banks are preparing for shocks.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2014 Michael de la MercedCritics\u2019 corner\u201cIf you\u2019ve already confronted so many dysfunctions, there has to be clearly a problem,\u201d Mr. Verhofstadt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the banks.\u201dHe also asked whether Facebook could compensate European users for the way their data is being used, asking: \u201cWhat will be the amount that you give them?\u201dThe new flaw will lead to the same problem: Intel says that users could see a 2 percent to 8 percent decrease in performance when updates are installed.Yet both firms still face challenges.AMD has enjoyed recent success from some of its chips being used to mine cryptocurrency, but more specialized processors from other manufacturers are becoming popular in the Bitcoin community. And Intel still needs to ensure that it cements itself as a major player in A.I. chips, which is becoming harder as companies like Tesla, Apple, Google and Facebook design their own.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeTo those on Wall Street and other executives who make a living negotiating, the deal struck by the president who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d doesn\u2019t look too artful. Not only that, the deal \u2014 to the extent there is one \u2014 raises all sorts of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to extract concessions in future negotiations.\u201cThis was not a quid-pro-quo or anything else. This was merely President Xi asking President Trump to look into this, which he\u2019s done. Any changes to this will fully support the mandate of making sure our sanctions and our technology are protected.\u201d\u201cI can assure you whatever the Commerce Department decides, the intelligence community has been part of the briefings and that we will make sure we will enforce national security issues.\u201d\u201cThe objective was not to put ZTE out of business.

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Continues to Test Regulators: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 What\u2019s next for CBS and Shari Redstone?\u2022 Kushners are near a deal for troubled 666 Fifth Avenue.\u2022 China\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.\u2022 How Michael Cohen\u2019s bank records emerged.\u2022 The splits in the Trump trade team.Wells Fargo\u2019s missteps are creating an important test for President Trump\u2019s regulators.In a statement included in the Journal report, Wells Fargo said: \u201cThis matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.\u201dBut a bank doesn\u2019t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture.It is not clear how widespread the purported abuses are. But the documentation was reportedly related to controls aimed at spotting money-laundering, an area of compliance where regulators tend to hold a hard line. If the documentation missteps in the business bank are significant, regulators could be ready to take tough action. In its enforcement action, the O.C.C. stated that it:\u201c\u2026expressly reserves its right to assess future civil money penalties, or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including in circumstances where the O.C.C. determines that the bank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress towards implementation of an effective and sustainable enterprise-wide compliance risk management program.\u201dIf more problems crop up at Wells Fargo, the public will be more likely to believe that the bank is too big to manage \u2014 and that regulators are not up to the task of reining it in.- Peter EavisChina\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.The only change from last year among the 10 largest banks came at the No. 10 spot, where France\u2019s Credit Agricole leapfrogged Wells Fargo. Here\u2019s a look at the top 25.Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery rescinded a temporary restraining order against Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, handing her a victory in an unusually vicious battle between the broadcaster and its controlling shareholder.In his ruling, Chancellor Bouchard said that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the court to grant the restraining order \u2014 one CBS argued was necessary to prevent Ms. Redstone from replacing directors, to the harm of other shareholders \u2014 because Delaware law allows the company to challenge such board removals.From the ruling:I am not convinced that the harm plaintiffs fear would be irreparable. To the contrary, the court has extensive power to provide redress if Ms. Redstone takes action(s) inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by a controlling stockholder\u2014 Michael de la MercedShares of CBS declined 6 percent after CBS\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Ms. Redstone was denied. The stock was recently down 4 percent.What could happen when Chancellor Bouchard rules, as soon as today:\u2022 He blocks Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw amendment; CBS\u2019s board proceeds to neuter its controlling shareholder; a big new precedent is set.\u2022 He lets Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw change stay; CBS\u2019s insurrection is defeated; and the fate of its board and its C.E.O., Les Moonves, becomes cloudy. (Ms. Redstone has said she doesn\u2019t want to oust the board.)\u2022 Something else we haven\u2019t thought of. Stay tuned.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws. The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.Charles Kushner, head of the Kushner Companies, is in advanced talks with Brookfield Properties over a partnership to take control of the 41-story aluminum-clad tower 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the pending deal but are not authorized to discuss it. Brookfield is a publicly traded company, headquartered in Canada, one of whose major investors is the Qatar Investment Authority.Mr. Kushner and his son Jared, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his key advisers, bought the office tower, which is between 51st and 52nd Streets, 11 years ago for a record-setting $1.8 billion. But the building today only generates about half its annual mortgage payment, and 30 percent of the 41-story tower is vacant.In late 2016, Mr. Kushner and his son were close to a much different kind of deal with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company with ties to the country\u2019s ruling elite, and with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani. That plan involved demolishing the existing building at 666 Fifth and erecting a $7.5 billion luxury super tower.\u2014 Charles V. BagliFrom the WSJ:\u201cThe employees in Wells Fargo\u2019s so-called wholesale unit, which is separate from its retail bank, added or altered information without customers\u2019 knowledge, according to the people familiar with the matter. The information added varied from social security numbers to addresses to dates of birth for people associated with business-banking clients, the people said.\u201d\u201cThe behavior took place in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls, the people said.\u201dFor investors, there was perhaps no number in Walmart\u2019s earnings report that mattered as much as the giant retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales, or more specifically the growth of those sales.Walmart said this morning that its digital sales grew 33 percent in its fiscal first quarter and that it expects online sales to grow 40 percent for the year.But the transformation has had its bumps. After three quarters of more than 50 percent growth, e-commerce sales increased just 23 percent in the fourth quarter.

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well.

But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

Notably, average growth in that period was slower than in the preceding 10 years, sometimes by a lot. The slowdowns were no doubt largely due to the negative impact of the financial crisis.

{"Headline": "Tesla Is Still Burning Cash, but Elon Musk Sees a Turning Point", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe electric-car maker Tesla continued to burn through cash as it posted a loss for the sixth quarter in a row, the company said Wednesday. Yet Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, once again said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn.Mr. Musk asserted that Tesla would make money in the second half of this year \u2014 if it could meet its latest production goals for the Model 3, its first mass-market offering.But Mr. Musk has made bold predictions in the past. Less than a year ago, he hoped to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by the end of 2017. So far, Tesla has not come close to that. On Wednesday, the company said it had produced more than 2,000 a week for three straight weeks before a production halt in mid-April. It said its profitability goals for the second half of the year hinged on making 5,000 a week.In a letter to investors, Tesla said it had \u201cgood visibility of our path to fully ramp and stabilize Model 3 production\u201d this year. Mr. Musk added on the conference call, \u201cIt\u2019s not like brain surgery to get these things to work.\u201dTesla\u2019s shares fell sharply in extended trading during the call, to about $285. They have lost more than 20 percent of their value since their peak last year, when Tesla surpassed the Detroit automakers in market value.While Tesla still has many fans and believers, analysts now tend to take a cautious look at Mr. Musk\u2019s pronouncements.In a report issued before Tesla released its results, a Barclays Capital analyst, Brian Johnson, told investors that he believed the company to be \u201cfundamentally overvalued.\u201d Barclays expects Tesla shares to head down to $210.In the first quarter, Tesla recorded a loss of $785 million on revenue of $3.4 billion. And the company burned through $745 million in cash, a significant increase from $112 million in the previous quarter.Tesla has not had a profitable year since it was founded in 2003.In the conference call, Mr. Musk complained of \u201cfundamentally misleading\u201d news reports about the Autopilot system\u2019s involvement in some serious crashes. \u201cThere should be no question that Autopilot improves safety,\u201d he said. Serious accidents that occur while Autopilot is operating, he said, are \u201calmost always\u201d the result of \u201ccomplacency,\u201d when drivers fail to keep their attention focused on the road.Amid all of those issues, the Model 3 is perhaps the most serious area of concern. With a starting price of $35,000, it is meant to be Tesla\u2019s most affordable and top-selling vehicle. The company has been counting on a quick increase in sales to bolster revenue and enable Tesla to pare losses and pay off debt while still investing heavily in future vehicles.Mr. Musk said Wednesday that Tesla had become capable of making more than 3,000 battery packs a week at a giant factory in Nevada. At its car plant, parts of its assembly line, such as the paint shop, are not yet up to that rate, he said.Mr. Musk acknowledged anew that Tesla had erred in trying to build a highly automated production line to assemble the Model 3. For example, it had been using a robotic machine to place lightweight, sound-deadening material on top of battery packs.\u201cIt was an incredibly difficult machine to make work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was basically picking up fluff. Hands are way better doing that.\u201dMoreover, Tesla later learned that the material wasn\u2019t even necessary. It made little difference in dampening sound inside the car.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to recent turnover in Tesla\u2019s management. While several senior executives have left, the head of operations in Europe is not among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank Fund Puts $2.25 Billion in G.M.\u2019s Driverless Unit", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-driving cars have increasingly figured in visions of the automotive future, and a big new investment is the latest signal that such a moment is close at hand.On Thursday, a fund affiliated with SoftBank Group of Japan said it planned to invest $2.25 billion in the driverless-technology division of General Motors to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service in select cities.The deal\u2019s magnitude reflects the growing confidence that commercial use of autonomous cars is in sight \u2014 despite recent setbacks to some other companies, including at least two fatal accidents, that have raised questions about the technology\u2019s safety.\u201cThis is a new source of capital to scale this business,\u201d Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, said in a conference call. \u201cWe think this fully funds our plan.\u201dAs part of the deal, G.M. said it would put an additional $1.1 billion of its own money into the unit, which is known as G.M. Cruise Holdings and is based in San Francisco. SoftBank\u2019s investment will be made through its Vision Fund, which focuses on the technology sector.Investors offered the move a vote of confidence, sending G.M.\u2019s shares up almost 13 percent on Thursday.In both Detroit and Silicon Valley, as well as overseas, the rush to build a foundation for autonomous-driving technology is gathering momentum. Waymo, the driverless-technology company spun out of Google, said Thursday that it had agreed to purchase as many as 62,000 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for a ride-hailing service that will start operating commercially in Phoenix by the end of this year.Waymo previously agreed to buy up to 20,000 compact cars from Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2019, giving it a potential fleet of more than 80,000 driverless vehicles within three or four years.\u201cThe volumes they are committing to is a clear signal these companies think they\u2019ve got it, that their technology is very close to commercial ready,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks autonomous technology.The determination of G.M. and Waymo to offer ride services within months also suggests a conviction that businesses that use driverless cars to ferry ordinary people from place to place will spread rapidly and \u2014 absent the cost of a driver \u2014 yield hefty profits.At the same time, Mr. Ramsey noted, \u201cit\u2019s a completely unproven business model,\u201d with costly technology that is bound to have growing pains. The first vehicles will probably be programmed to be so cautious in traffic that crosstown trips may initially take much longer than people are used to, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think safety will be the concern for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time it takes to get to your destination could be a turnoff, though.\u201dLike G.M., Ford is racing to put self-driving cars into ride and delivery fleets, but it has a longer timeline and is hoping to have its car in production by 2021.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the SoftBank investment validated the direction that G.M. and its Cruise division were taking. The investment gives SoftBank a 19.6 percent stake in G.M. Cruise and values the unit at more than $11 billion. That\u2019s well above the $1 billion that G.M. paid two years ago to acquire Cruise as a start-up company.\u201cThere\u2019s no other company in the world that has the technology chops and the experience to lead the industry on this front,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank\u2019s investment arm, SoftBank Investment Advisers.The investment highlights the ambition and seemingly bottomless wallet of SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son. It was Mr. Son who came up with the idea of raising nearly $100 billion from investors ranging from Saudi Arabia to Apple for the Vision Fund, which is now one of the world\u2019s biggest and boldest investors in tech companies.In a reflection of Mr. Son\u2019s personality, SoftBank and the Vision Fund have become known for moving quickly to invest in companies with products seen as crucial to the future of technology. They have been willing to pour large sums into early start-ups at enormous valuations, crowding out other potential investors.Ride-hailing has been a major focus for SoftBank, with investments in Uber, Didi Chuxing of China, Ola of India, Grab of Singapore and 99 of Brazil.At the time, the company said its vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be produced on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate. Likely spots for initial operations are San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz., where Cruise is already conducting tests.Waymo, on the other hand, does not intend to make cars but instead will rely on partners to produce vehicles that it will outfit with sensors, radar and other technology.A unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, it has been working on self-driving technology for nearly a decade, and is focusing on four potential lines of business. In addition to the ride service it intends to start, the company expects to put its autonomous-driving technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, and aims to license its technology to automakers like Fiat Chrysler. It sees a potential fourth business line in driverless shuttles that can ferry riders to mass transit systems.The company expects to begin buying Pacifica minivans for its ride service later this year. They will be produced at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Windsor, Ontario, and equipped with self-driving technology at a Waymo technical center in Novi, Mich.Waymo gave no details on how many minivans it expects to buy this year or next, the value of the deal, or the period covered by the purchase agreement.The companies said Thursday that they were in talks about licensing Waymo technology to Fiat Chrysler so the carmaker can at some point sell self-driving vehicles to consumers.Advertisement"}

Jack Ewing, a correspondent based in Frankfurt who covers economics and autos, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What impact is tech having on the auto industry?It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the automobile industry is undergoing its biggest transformation in a century. Three big trends are converging and feeding off one another: battery-powered cars, autonomous driving and connectivity \u2014 the integration of cars into digital traffic networks.Some say cars have become the biggest mobile computers. Why is that, and do you agree?Cars have been carrying around lots of computing power for a while, but most people weren\u2019t aware of it.Are we anywhere near having autonomous cars become mainstream consumer vehicles? What has to happen?Fully autonomous cars that can drive themselves from A to B while drivers sleep or watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will probably take a while. But onboard computers will increasingly augment drivers and take over city driving. Cars will be able to communicate with one another and with control centers, resulting in better traffic management and reduced congestion.The people developing autonomous vehicles should probably be thinking as much about how to get people to accept the technology, and how to protect individual freedom, as they are about making the technology work.What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job?An app called AudioNote has been life changing. It records sound while you type notes on your MacBook or iPad. Later, you can click on a word in the text and it will take you to that spot in the recording, so you can easily double-check quotes.

Disney\u2019s market capitalization is currently a little more than $151 billion, while Comcast has a market capitalization of roughly $145 billion.Netflix\u2019s move above Disney and Comcast serves as a symbolic moment. Netflix and its Silicon Valley brethren have upended the media industry and spurred a rush of consolidation. Disney and Comcast are fighting over the assets of 21st Century Fox, while AT&T is trying to acquire Time Warner.Netflix\u2019s ascendance also caps a remarkable run for the company. A decade ago, Netflix was valued at $2 billion and less than $15 billion five years ago.

That industry has benefited from one particular feature of the region: the widespread use of smartphones.YellowPepper\u2019s C.E.O., Serge Elkiner, pointed out that mobile penetration has always been superior\u201d in Latin Americay. While he conceded that the region doesn\u2019t yet have a Silicon Valley or a Berlin, he asserted that the start-up community there is continuing to grow.YellowPepper and Visa first formed a business partnership last year, and it\u2019s from that business bond that the new investment grew. With the new cash, Mr. Elkiner said, his company now hopes to work on even bigger projects. One of them: making it easier for customers to sign up for a Visa-branded credit card within minutes when they\u2019re buying something online, then completing that transaction using a virtual version of the card, without having to wait for a physical one.The ultimate goal, according to Mr. Salazar, is simple. \u201cThe largest opportunity in the industry is in displacing cash,\u201d he said.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThere\u2019s an opening for Comcast.

At least until the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, started talking.Mr. Musk\u2019s contentious conference call with analysts after Tesla\u2019s earnings announcement on Wednesday sent shares of the electric-car maker sharply lower. And the losses extended into Thursday\u2019s trading session.Tesla\u2019s stock price fell 5.6 percent on Thursday, after Mr. Musk butted heads with analysts on the call who wanted updates on the company\u2019s continuing production issues and high cash-burn rate. At one point Mr. Musk even told one analyst: \u201cWe have no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders. I couldn\u2019t care less. Please sell our stock and don\u2019t buy it.\u201dShareholders were listening. The stock sell-off gained pace in after hours trading Wednesday after the conference call began at 5:30 p.m. Eastern. And volume surged as the stock fell after the open of trading Thursday.\u201cLet\u2019s just say that Elon\u2019s behavior on the call should give even the uberbulls pause,\u201d wrote Brian Johnson, an analyst who covers Tesla at Barclays Capital, who described the conference call as \u201cdownright bizarre.\u201dConference calls after earnings reports are released tend to be clubby affairs where analysts gently probe executives for details they can use to adjust their profit and revenue estimates up and down for coming quarters.But Tesla\u2019s call Wednesday contained considerable fireworks. Mr. Musk cut off an analyst asking about the company\u2019s need to raise additional money from investors.\u201cSo where specifically will you be in terms of capital requirements?\u201d asked Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst covering Tesla for Sanford C. Bernstein.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Mr. Musk responded, according to a Bloomberg transcript of the call. \u201cNext. Boring bonehead questions are not cool.

These questions are so dry. They\u2019re killing me.\u201dOver the last five years, Tesla has at times been one of the hottest stocks in the market and it has been widely owned by both individual investors and technology enthusiasts, as well as institutional investors excited about the long-term business prospects for the company.Since the start of 2013, its shares are up more than 700 percent, dwarfing the gain of more than 80 percent for the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. But since peaking in September 2017, the shares have slumped by more than 26 percent, as concern has grown about ongoing production problems for the Model 3, and the prodigious amount of cash the company is burning through.Many expect that its need for cash will require the company to again turn to markets to raise more capital. In light of that, some analysts have suggested that Mr. Musk\u2019s attitude toward Wall Street could be self-defeating.\u201cThe analysts on the call represent the providers of capital that Tesla has throughout its history depended upon,\u201d wrote Adam Jonas, who covers Tesla for Morgan Stanley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Boots Riley Infiltrated Hollywood", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "FeatureThe cult indie rapper smuggled his radical anticapitalism into his biting new film \u2018Sorry to Bother You.\u2019Supported bySo he honed a spiel consisting of \u201cvarious levels.\u201d Level 1 was 23 words long, and on a recent afternoon, in a coffee shop in Riley\u2019s hometown, Oakland, Calif., he recited it to me more or less exactly as he recited it over the years to potential actors, producers, investors and advice-givers:\u201cIt\u2019s an absurdist dark comedy with magical realism and science fiction, inspired by the world of telemarketing. It\u2019s called \u2018Sorry to Bother You.\u2019\u2009\u201dAt which point he would take them to Level 2:\u201cCassius Green is a black telemarketer with self-esteem issues and existential angst who discovers a magical way to make his voice sound like it\u2019s overdubbed by a white actor.\u201dRiley let that premise sink in, then moved to Level 3:\u201cThis catapults him up the ladder of telemarketing success, to the upper echelon of telemarketers, who sell weapons of mass destruction and slave labor via cold calling. In order to do this, he has to betray his friends who are organizing a telemarketers\u2019 union.\u201dWho, at this point, could resist knowing more? And who, having heard the rest \u2014 the coke-snorting billionaire bad guy, the climactic battle, the many dystopian flights of fancy \u2014 could resist helping Riley get the thing up on screen? The answer was: plenty of people. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting many responses,\u201d he recalls.Riley has a sly grin, a slight build and a large afro. To comb it, he carries around a kitchen utensil called an angel-food-cake cutter \u2014 designed to slice delicate desserts, it does double-duty as a pick and fits comfortably in his back pocket. He furrows his brow frequently while talking to people, and if this is disconcerting at first, it turns out to be essential to his charisma, because it shows he\u2019s actually listening to what you\u2019re saying: Many entertainers are expert at connecting with crowds and much less adept in one-on-one interactions, but Riley takes visible pleasure in conversation.He is also a veteran hustler, and when it looked as if \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d might never materialize, it wasn\u2019t for lack of enterprise. At one point Riley sneaked into a private dinner at the Napa Valley Film Festival to get his script to Viggo Mortensen, with whom Riley shared an acquaintance. (Mortensen passed on participating.) He wrote to an email address belonging to the wife of Colin Firth, because the actor once approached Riley at a party rapping some Coup lyrics. (Firth said he couldn\u2019t do the movie, either.) But Riley, who is 47, had invested too much time to give up, and there were flashes of support. The comedian David Cross, who performed alongside Riley years ago at a fund-raiser for Palestinian medical services, read the script and told Riley to count him in. Further encouragement came from Patton Oswalt, who made a similar commitment, and the author Dave Eggers, who gave the script a look and, after calling it one of the best unproduced screenplays he\u2019d ever read, published it with McSweeney\u2019s as a book in December 2014.In late 2015, this gradual accumulation of boosters finally yielded funding, and more actors circled the project. Jordan Peele considered starring as Cassius for a time, then Donald Glover did, until Glover\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d co-star, the captivatingly droll Lakeith Stanfield, signed on as Cassius for good. Over 28 days last summer, Riley shot the movie around Oakland and Berkeley, completing a cut in time for Sundance, where Annapurna \u2014 the prestige picture house behind films by Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell and Kathryn Bigelow \u2014 bought its distribution rights for seven figures. The buzz surrounding the film was excellent, if echoey: Vice called it the \u201cmost bonkers movie\u201d at the festival; Vanity Fair called it \u201ca bonkers social satire\u201d; Slate called it a \u201cfeverish, bonkers satire.\u201d\u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d comes out in wide release in July. The film is visually ingenious and funny, yet grounded by pointed arguments about the obstacles to black success in America, the power of strikes and the soul-draining predations of capitalism. A self-described communist since his teens, Riley has said he aims \u201cto help build a mass movement that can use withholding of labor as a strategy for social change.\u201d That credo suffuses \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d and, notwithstanding the delay in getting it made, the film\u2019s timing could hardly be better. In Hollywood, two recent blockbusters by black directors \u2014 Peele\u2019s horror hit \u201cGet Out\u201d and Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 staged nuanced readings of race within fantastical scenarios. Fresh anxieties about the precariousness of work and the increasingly precarious place of the worker have, meanwhile, permeated the cultural mainstream, from mounting critiques of the so-called gig economy to the teachers\u2019 strikes enjoying popular support nationwide to Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d a Hollywood vision of the future that features characters who become indentured servants to rapacious tech overlords.Culture is not a substitute for direct political action, of course, but as Riley has put it, \u201cit tills the soil and gets people ready\u201d \u2014 and he has spent his life tilling the soil. While \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d may register as a thoroughly Trump-era artifact, its concerns have long been with him. He wrote it toward the end of Barack Obama\u2019s first term, back when many liberals, he says, simply \u201cturned a blind eye to real problems.\u201d The film didn\u2019t need to change from one president to the next, because \u201cthe system hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dRiley connects with others easily, on the street and in his art \u2014 he has been writing rhymes about radical politics long enough to know how to frame ideas in punchy, compelling language. It\u2019s a skill at the intersection of activism and art-making, which is where he sits. In high school, when he still went by his given name, Ray, he acted in student plays and danced at talent shows. (During a senior trip, where he wore a pair of brown Florsheim boots, his schoolmates gave him his nickname.) He also joined the Progressive Labor Party, at 15, and worked to unionize California farmworkers, linking up with \u201cMexican dudes who came to the Central Valley with the purpose of fomenting revolution, doing work in the fields \u2014 the literal fields. They had a vision that wasn\u2019t new, but it was new to me, about how you could create a mass radical movement step by step.\u201dHis conviction, forged in the P.L.P., is that as long as politicians are beholden to big-money \u201cpuppeteers,\u201d the best strategy for change is to bypass the puppets and directly threaten the string-pullers\u2019 economic interests, through work stoppages \u2014 the one radical act, perhaps, that entrenched power can\u2019t co-opt. \u201cIt affected me because it wasn\u2019t this vague notion of \u2018change the world,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said of his time among the farmworkers. \u201cIt was, \u2018Here\u2019s a way things can happen.\u2019\u2009\u201d After that he became an advocate for Palestinian rights and a prominent member of the Occupy movement, helping Oakland residents to protest home foreclosures. In the wake of the Ferguson protests and amid the rise of Black Lives Matter, Riley, in an interview with \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d disputed the notion that \u201call you need to do is get your voice in the streets and things will change,\u201d describing mere attempts to \u201cshame power into action\u201d as ineffectual. Rather, he argued that demonstrators should \u201ccombine social movements with the ability to withhold our labor\u201d in order to \u201cgive social movements teeth.\u201dOne of Riley\u2019s influences in revolutionary thinking was his father. As a San Francisco State student in the 1960s, Walter Riley was an anti-Vietnam War activist; in 1968 he drove a Muni bus around the city and helped establish a rank-and-file caucus of fellow drivers. He later volunteered as a housing-and-welfare-rights advocate in Chicago, where Boots was born, then as an auto-industry organizer in Detroit. By the time Boots was 13, they were back in Oakland, where Walter, deciding that he could do good as a civil rights and criminal-defense lawyer, went to law school and started a practice.In 1989 Boots enrolled at San Francisco State himself, studying film. \u201cI did shorts, but they were style exercises, very abstract, figuring it out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I was making music to go in the films.\u201d Outside class, he joined anti-racist protests. \u201cWhite supremacists said they were going to take back the Bay Area,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had the \u2018Aryan Woodstock\u2019 in Napa, and they\u2019d have rallies in Union Square, with cops surrounding these Nazis.\u201d Riley and his cohort liked to lob soda cans over the police officer\u2019s heads, aiming for those within \u2014 a technique he pays homage to in \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201dRiley worked part time for U.P.S., a Teamster job at which he met two aspiring rappers, Spice 1 (Robert Green Jr.), who became a prominent gangsta rapper in the \u201990s, and E-roc (Eric Davis). \u201cWe\u2019d rap in the bellies of planes we were loading up at Oakland airport,\u201d Riley recalled. He and Davis founded the Coup with the East Bay DJ Pam the Funkstress, and when they landed a record deal, Riley quit school. (Pam died last year at 51.)Looking back on the Coup\u2019s first album, the brash \u201cKill My Landlord\u201d (1993), Riley dismissed it as \u201ca pamphlet on tape,\u201d criticizing what he saw as its leaden pileup of leftist lingo. His assessment may be overly harsh, but Riley\u2019s point was to underscore a subsequent broadening in his artistic approach that tracks through to \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d: \u201cI moved to trying to talk to folks who don\u2019t identify with those politics.\u201dHe went on to fill his songs with cleverly loaded wordplay (\u201cI slang rocks, but Palestinian style\u201d) and set galvanizing slogans (\u201cWe got hella people, they got helicopters\u201d) to freewheeling funk. Many of Riley\u2019s most beloved verses unfold as vivid, frequently comic narratives. For \u201cFat Cats, Bigga Fish,\u201d from 1994, he assumed the voice of a pickpocket who, posing as a waiter to hunt wealthy marks at an Oakland gala, overhears a developer pitch the mayor on a conspiracy to turn low-income housing into condos. \u201cAin\u2019t no one player that could beat this lunacy,\u201d the narrator concludes, realizing just how small-fry his own thievery is by comparison: \u201cAin\u2019t no hustler on the street could do a whole community.\u201d Even as the Coup took off on the indie circuit and landed videos on MTV and BET, Riley remained an activist. During a four-year hiatus between the group\u2019s second and third albums, he phone-banked for nonprofits \u2014 a miserable experience that he tapped when it came time to write his movie.One of the Coup\u2019s best-known moments was a result of wild chance. In September 2001, the group gained notoriety for an eerily coincidental cover for its album \u201cParty Music\u201d \u2014 designed months earlier \u2014 in which Riley and Pam stand before a Photoshopped World Trade Center, holding up drumsticks and a bass-tuner as if they are detonators, as the towers explode behind them. (This cover, intended as a metaphorical blow against capitalism, was changed against his wishes after the Sept. 11 attacks.) Riley became an outspoken guest on shows like \u201cDemocracy Now!\u201d and \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d with Bill Maher, unflagging in what you might call his blanket bipartisan disdain for politicians. Asked by RT America in 2011, for example, about whether Barack Obama represented a \u201creal change\u201d from his predecessors, Riley replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really like we just got a black manager at McDonald\u2019s, and all the workers at McDonald\u2019s are happy, thinking that everything\u2019s gonna be different, but no, you still gotta get your ass in front of that cash register and you\u2019re still gonna have to sweep and mop the floors just as hard \u2014 and you\u2019re gonna still get paid the exact same amount, although you got a new, handsome, black manager.\u201dDuring our walk through Oakland, we passed a tiny vintage clothing store called Regina\u2019s Door, and its owner, Regina Evans, a congenial woman in a headwrap, emerged to hug Riley. In addition to selling clothes, the shop offers financial support and \u201ccreative arts healing\u201d to survivors of sex trafficking and provides a venue for Evans\u2019s plays, which Riley has attended. She gave Riley a happy update on one of the women she helps support, then let him know about a new play she would be mounting soon in Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s very weird and different, about a slave who kills herself and rebuilds her life with two spirits she can\u2019t really see but knows are there,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWriting it, I came to a standstill and got scared: \u2018I don\u2019t think this is gonna work.\u2019 Then I started reading your movie reviews, and everyone\u2019s saying, \u2018It\u2019s crazy but it\u2019s awesome.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, Boots wrote a crazy script,\u2019 and I started writing again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Riley said, nodding.In Riley\u2019s hands, these fantastical elements have a clear dramatic purpose. Cassius\u2019 ability to speak with a \u201cwhite voice\u201d (provided by David Cross) is a way to poke fun at perceptions and performances of racial identity. The film\u2019s central villain, a company with the innocuous name of Worry Free, signs laborers to unpaid lifetime contracts in exchange for a guarantee of meals and glammed-up prison-style housing \u2014 bunk beds crammed beneath chandeliers. Worry Free\u2019s scheme seems a touch less far-fetched when considered alongside old company-owned mining towns, Foxconn City in Shenzhen or even tech campuses with their free amenities and napping pods, meant to blur the line between work and life and extract more value from employees in the name of providing perks. Eggers, a longtime San Franciscan, said: \u201cWhen I read Boots\u2019s script, I\u2019d just published \u2018The Circle\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 a 2013 dystopian novel set in Silicon Valley \u2014 \u201cand it struck me that we were both picking up on changes we\u2019ve seen in the Bay Area. There\u2019s this strangely sinister cast to life here sometimes, where it\u2019s still idyllic and free and open but also there\u2019s a sense of consolidation of power, of wealth and of control that was never part of the Bay before.\u201dCassius begins the movie broke and aimless, renting a room from his uncle Sergio (Terry Crews), who is facing imminent foreclosure. When the telemarketing firm rewards Cassius\u2019 supernatural cold-calling prowess with promotions and praise, these represent a concrete means to save Sergio\u2019s house and the first time in Cassius\u2019s adult life that people in power have told him he\u2019s good at something \u2014 even if that something turns out to be shilling for weapons manufacturers and Worry Free (whose sarong-sporting chief executive is played with slick, winking malevolence by Armie Hammer). Cassius comes to see his striking co-workers and his radical artist girlfriend, Detroit (a transfixing Tessa Thompson), as impediments to the blossoming of his own excellence, but Riley and Stanfield make it compellingly tough to dismiss his motivations here as merely selling out. \u201cBoots and I wanted to make sure he was relatable,\u201d Stanfield told me, \u201ca normal guy in an otherworldly situation that actually has a lot in common with real-world situations.\u201dAmong the questions the movie raises is whether black success within capitalism is something to reflexively celebrate or whether the success of individuals who belong to an exploited class serves to ratify and consolidate \u2014 rather than thwart or ameliorate \u2014 the system doing the exploiting. Discussing this question, Riley used the example of the resolutely capitalist Jay-Z: \u201cWhen people listen to Jay-Z, they\u2019re working all day or trying to work and pay their bills, and what they hear is someone who\u2019s free. Who doesn\u2019t have to worry about the electricity. But all we\u2019re taught is that those who are rich deserve to be rich because they worked harder than the rest of us or they\u2019re smarter. And this may be true of some of those folks, but there are definitely very poor people who are very smart and work hard. It\u2019s just that this system can only have a few people on the top. So Jay-Z is saying: \u2018You can do this, too, I\u2019m trying to give you game,\u2019 and it ends up explaining poverty as a system of bad choices. Yes, maybe you can make better choices and be the crab that gets out of the bucket \u2014 but that\u2019ll be at the expense of all the other crabs in the bucket.\u201dIn the past, Riley has criticized Hollywood as abidingly reactionary in the stories it tells about black people: \u201cAll these movies \u2014 whether it\u2019s \u2018Menace II Society\u2019 or \u2018Boyz N the Hood\u2019 \u2014 the moral is \u2018Move some place else and everything\u2019s better,\u2019\u2009\u201d he has said. \u201cAnd the message is always \u2018We\u2019re destroying ourselves,\u2019 and there\u2019s no mention of anything systematic.\u201d At one point, drinking coffee on stools in an uptown cafe, I brought up \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Riley told me that he admires Ryan Coogler and considers him \u201ca mentor,\u201d but his praise for that film came with an asterisk: \u201cIt was great \u2014 for a superhero movie. One of the best I\u2019ve seen. But I have a problem with superheroes in general, because, politically, superheroes are cops. Superheroes work with the government to uphold the law. And who do the laws work for?\u201d Riley answered this question with a smirk. \u201cPut it like this: We all love bank robbers, because we know that in the two sides of that equation, the robbers are the ones to root for, not the banks. Only in superhero movies and the news do they try to make us think we\u2019re against the bank robbers!\u201dI asked Riley if, when shopping the film, he ever deployed his own version of a white voice. He said no, then elaborated. \u201cEverybody feels like they\u2019re the exception,\u201d he went on. \u201cThere\u2019s a story I tell, which was told to me by Tom Morello,\u201d who was the guitarist for Rage Against the Machine, with whom Riley formed a side project several years ago. \u201cRage were going to shoot a music video for one of their songs, Michael Moore directed it and the idea was they were gonna show up on Wall Street and play loud in the middle of the day, and when the cops came, and when Wall Street people came and yelled at them, even if it got shut down, that would be the video. So they get there, they play the song one time. Tumbleweeds. Play it again. Nothing\u2019s happening \u2014 a couple cops talking into their radios. They play it a third time and start hearing a rumble. \u2018Are they sending SWAT in?\u2019 And then, from around the corner, they see hundreds of people in business clothes coming closer, chanting \u2018Suits! For! Rage!\u2019 They\u2019re fans!\u201d (In the finished video, for the song \u201cSleep Now in the Fire,\u201d a few men in trading-floor jackets rock out in the crowd.)Transgressive gestures have a dispiriting way of being absorbed by the forces they\u2019re intended to transgress, and so I initially took this story to illustrate how Rage Against the Machine had been revealed, in this moment, as insufficiently radical. But for Riley, it conveyed an altogether different point, one that reflected the baseline faith in other people that a lifelong activist must sustain in order to keep going: \u201cIt turns out that Rage have hundreds of fans on Wall Street who are totally into what they\u2019re saying, and who felt like they were against the system, too, but this was just what they had to do because the system wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And that\u2019s what most of us feel. That we\u2019re only doing what we\u2019re doing because there\u2019s no way to change things.\u201dWealth in the East Bay has historically concentrated itself in the hills. Today, despite some fast-gentrifying exceptions, the general rule still holds: The flatter the land, the poorer the people living on it. Spring Mansion \u2014 named for its original owner, the mining and real estate tycoon John Hopkins Spring \u2014 was a universe away from the Oakland flats, where Riley grew up and shot most of the film. Modeled on Empress Elisabeth of Austria\u2019s Achilleion Palace, the mansion sits ostentatiously on three acres, with balustraded terraces and a view, through palm trees, out to San Francisco Bay. The place is currently uninhabited, sitting on the market with a $7.5 million asking price, but for the next 12-odd hours, a plutocrat\u2019s palace would become a communist\u2019s playground.Something about this situation seemed to make Riley a touch uneasy \u2014 or, at least, to strike him as grimly amusing. Part of his decision to shoot \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d in his hometown was his knowledge that he could call in favors, make handshake deals and save money. He enlisted friends as extras and used other friends\u2019 artwork to decorate scenes. That spirit of community-abetted thriftiness extended all the way to the film\u2019s Oakland premiere on April 12, where Riley wore a vintage three-piece suit that Regina Evans had given him gratis, \u201cstuffed into a trash bag with a bunch of other suits,\u201d he said. Riley had gravitated toward Spring Mansion in the first place because a local musician he knew once shot a video there for peanuts, and Riley figured he could finesse a similar deal. \u201cBut then line producers and location scouts insist on getting involved, and it\u2019s out of your hands,\u201d he said. Today\u2019s reshoot would result in maybe five seconds of new film. Considering this, Riley chuckled and shook his head. The footage was necessary, but \u201cif we\u2019d been able to get to this when we were first here,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have taken 10 minutes instead of a whole day and, like, $100,000.\u201dLakeith Stanfield flew up from Los Angeles and was driven straight to the mansion. Crew members had erected their temporary gate on the patio, marking the spot where Stanfield was to stand, consult his phone and enter the code. \u201cI love how non-actory Keith is,\u201d Riley told me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t learn all his lines until right before, so you get this sense that he\u2019s actually figuring out what he\u2019s going to say in the moment.\u201d\u201cHello, beautiful people,\u201d Stanfield said, greeting the crew as he walked on set.\u201c777-9311,\u201d Riley sang to him \u2014 the title of a 1982 track by the Time and, for no reason other than his love for the song, the code he wanted Stanfield to type in.Boots\u2019s directing style, Tessa Thompson later told me, fosters a spirit of exploration: \u201cHe did this really cool thing with me and Lakeith, where he had us do takes of scenes, but without using any words. He said, \u2018I heard Spike Jonze does this, let\u2019s try it!\u2019 \u2014 I loved that he said he\u2019d borrowed it from someone he respected. On the one hand he has this chutzpah and confidence, but he also has the ability to be humble and trust other people to know things that he doesn\u2019t.\u201dAfter a few takes at the mansion, Riley broke in and altered Stanfield\u2019s pacing a bit, to give himself options in the editing room. \u201cAy, check this out,\u201d he said. It was a phrase I heard him utter several times that day \u2014 a rhetorical device that made instructions sound like shared discoveries. \u201cThis time, try starting out of frame, then walking in,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019ll cue you.\u201d They shot the keypad sequence a few more times, then moved the camera around to the other side of the fence to capture Stanfield head-on.I asked Riley whether Annapurna had given him any larger notes about the movie, expressed concerns beyond the level of logistical snags. He said no, but did mention a bit of test-screening feedback the executives passed along about the movie\u2019s final moments, which \u201cunsettled\u201d some viewers. That reaction was fine by him: Riley ends the film on a note of volatility, introducing disconcerting new information in the closing seconds and then leaving this, and one of the film\u2019s major antagonisms, unresolved.When it came to endings, though, Riley emphasized that unresolved was not the same thing as unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s never all the way good or all the way bad,\u201d he said, \u201cas long as the fight is going on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Model 3 Goes Upscale, and Base-Price Buyers Must Wait", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as Tesla scrambles to master the production challenges of making its first mass-market electric car, the Model 3, the company is moving to add two high-end versions of the vehicle \u2014 versions that its chief, Elon Musk, said may be crucial to its profitability.In fact, delivering the base-price model at this point would cause the company \u201cto lose money & die,\u201d he declared in a Twitter post over the weekend.Tesla began producing the Model 3 last summer, and so far it has made only versions selling for $49,000 or more. The base model priced at $35,000 \u2014 meant to make the car broadly affordable \u2014 is not yet available.In a series of tweets over the weekend, Mr. Musk suggested that the company would suffer significant losses on the $35,000 model at this stage. He said that Tesla must increase Model 3 production to 5,000 cars a week \u2014 and then keep up that pace for three to six months \u2014 before it could begin shipping the base version.The company has said it expects to offer the standard model by the end of the year.In the meantime, the company is moving to take the Model 3 farther upscale. Mr. Musk said two more variants were now available for order \u2014 an all-wheel-drive version starting at $54,000, and a high-performance model at $78,000.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said it was not unusual for companies to produce higher-priced, more profitable models when they start making a new vehicle. But Tesla risks frustrating its customers if the most affordable version isn\u2019t available soon, he said.The Model 3 \u201cwas dubbed the first mass-market car, and a year after launch, we\u2019re getting more higher-priced versions and the $35,000 model isn\u2019t out,\u201d he said.In a statement, Tesla said that the Model 3 performed well in its own braking tests, and that braking performance could be improved through software updates.Tesla is counting on a rapid rise in Model 3 sales to increase revenue and generate profits. Mr. Musk has said that Tesla expects to become profitable in the third and fourth quarters of this year \u2014 if it can produce 5,000 or more Model 3s a week.The company has taken orders for about 400,000 Model 3s \u2014 each secured with a $1,000 deposit.Customers who put down deposits must wait until they are given clearance by Tesla to go online and place an order for their Model 3. Currently the lowest-priced model available is a $49,000 version, which features a longer-range battery than the basic version and a package of premium options.A group of preferred customers was invited to order the $78,000 performance version of the car, the company said. It features a white interior and 20-inch wheels. Mr. Musk said on Twitter that the car could accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds, had a top speed of 155 m.p.h. and could go 310 miles on a single battery charge.Delivery is likely to take 12 to 16 weeks, the company said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Electric Cars Without a Plug, Thank Tesla (the Scientist)", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAt its introduction last summer in Barcelona, Spain, the 2019 Audi A8 quattro became the poster child of automotive high tech: matrix L.E.D.s that shine from the headliner with the wave of a hand, advanced autonomous driver assistance sensors, active electromechanical suspension. And on the floor under one of the models, a gray metal pad.But induction charging is at least three years away from mass-market automotive application, said Jesse Schneider, who heads a wireless task force for the Society of Automotive Engineers. And, like most technological advances in this industry, a wireless power transfer standard \u2014 now in late-stage discussions by the S.A.E. \u2014 will need to be approved as safe and secure by the federal government.It will also require consensus among the world\u2019s vehicle makers. In an industry where competition and proprietary technology are the norm, establishing a one-size-fits-all system is a tricky proposition. But Brian McKay, the North America director of powertrain technology and innovation for the automotive components supplier Continental, said most automakers had already accepted \u201ca pretty well-defined standard to ensure interoperability.\u201dMr. Schneider said he believed that wireless charging would help break down barriers for electronic vehicles by making it as simple as pulling into your usual parking spot and walking away. \u201cThere are 14 automakers and suppliers on my team, and we have a huge effort underway to come up with one standard methodology,\u201d he said.The limited real-world systems that employ wireless charging require precisely parking a receptor-equipped vehicle over a charging platform. Audi claims a charging efficiency of more than 90 percent, meaning that less than 10 percent of the power sent to the charger is lost in the process of topping off the battery. Fully charged, the car \u2014 which is not due in the United States until next year \u2014 is expected to be able to travel about 30 miles on electricity alone, Audi said.Automakers generally have shied away from revealing details of their plans for wireless charging. Mark Dahncke, a spokesman at Audi of America, said he had not yet seen the specifications of the United States-bound A8 e-tron. And a spokesman for Nissan had no comment on \u201cfuture product plans.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the price of gasoline that\u2019s driving the E.V. market,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more about government regulations and the environment.\u201dMr. McKay of Continental said he was convinced that engines powered by gasoline would coexist with electrics for at least the next decade. But at the same time, he sees wireless charging technology becoming more cost-effective \u2014 and necessary to meet the emission requirements emerging around the world.\u201cEven though each vehicle is getting cleaner, there are just more of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go to a more sustainable approach, which is more electrification in the future.\u201dEven as the automotive industry hurtles toward meeting more immediate challenges, a team of electrical engineering students at Stanford University has taken a decidedly more futuristic approach.Under the direction of Prof. Shanhui Fan, they are among those who have envisioned dynamic charging of a vehicle \u2014 sending power to a moving car using transmitting devices either along the roadway or embedded in it.So far, the Stanford researchers have been able to send consistent power to a moving light bulb.The team\u2019s vision is very much blue-sky, Professor Fan allowed; he wouldn\u2019t even guess a date for commercial real-world dynamic charging.Mr. Schneider of the S.A.E. said he was skeptical of on-the-fly charging. A proof of concept is one thing, but standardization is necessary.\u201cAnd why do you need it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy do you need to tear up highways? Just because it sounds cool?\u201d He added, \u201cBefore jumping to science fiction, well, a lot of things are possible.\u201d\u201cA car sits for between 90 to 95 percent of its life,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cIf you can take advantage of the time it doesn\u2019t move with a wireless-equipped parking space at home, where the customer doesn\u2019t have to plug in but just park, then it changes the whole dynamic of the electric vehicle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At the Royal Wedding, Something Green", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week, even the climate team is getting in on the royal wedding coverage. Also, is the biggest hurdle for electric cars the car dealerships themselves? And, a NASA climate program is at the center of a budget battle.Royal wedding viewers may have had a few questions as they watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (a.k.a. Harry and Meghan) drive off from Windsor Castle after the ceremony to a reception at Frogmore House a mile or so away. Such as: As for the happy couple\u2019s borrowed car, Climate Fwd: is pleased to report that it was a zero-emissions vehicle.The car is a vintage silver-blue 1968 Jaguar E-Type Roadster with one crucial, and major, modification: Its famous six-cylinder gasoline-powered XK motor was replaced with an all-electric drivetrain.All of that was done without cutting or otherwise modifying the car\u2019s frame, and the new drivetrain weighs about the same as the old one, so there was no need to change the suspension. Such \u201cnondestructive modification\u201d is important, said Nathan Hoyt, a spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover North America, because while owners of vintage Jaguars may wish to switch to an all-electric drive, they may want to reinstall the gasoline motor to sell the vehicle.\u201cIt gives customers options without having to worry about doing permanent harm to the car,\u201d Mr. Hoyt said.A few other changes were made: the dashboard was swapped out with a new one with gauges to monitor electrical performance, the vintage incandescent headlights were replaced with more efficient LED bulbs, and the gas tank fill tube was removed in favor of an electrical coupling for charging the battery. Many viewers noted that the steering wheel was on the left-hand side; Mr. Hoyt said this particular car, a one-off prototype that was first shown last fall, was originally exported to the American market after it was manufactured 50 years ago.Jaguar Land Rover has been weighing reaction to it and may decide to go ahead with a program in which customers could order a new, all-electric E-Type or have their existing vintage car converted at the factory.Either way, an electric Jaguar won\u2019t come cheap. Mr. Hoyt said that a complete factory restoration of an E-Type that remains gasoline-powered typically costs about $390,000. An electric version would cost even more.But this week, three researchers in Europe found that there\u2019s another potential hurdle for electric cars to clear: auto dealers.What they found was striking: In 77 percent of visits to dealerships that stocked electric cars, the sales staff didn\u2019t even discuss the vehicles as an option. Many dealerships were \u201cdismissive\u201d of electric cars or provided incorrect information about the technology, instead steering customers toward conventional gasoline or diesel models.There were some fairly benign explanations for this, the lead author, Gerardo Zarazua de Rubens of Aarhus University in Denmark, said. After interviewing dealers and industry experts, he found that salespeople were often just responding to incentives. They work on commission and have to sell cars as quickly as possible. It can take up to four times as long to explain the ins and outs of electric cars to unfamiliar customers who might be anxious about things like range and battery life. So dealers often stick with what\u2019s easiest.\u201cDealer apathy is still a serious issue for EVs,\u201d Mr. McKerracher said. But, \u201cas EVs get cheaper and more prevalent, I expect this all to get resolved.\u201d Once automakers start introducing many more plug-in models, he said, \u201cthe amount of customer education that a dealer needs to do in order to make a sale starts to fall.\u201d\u201cIt may turn out that the biggest barriers for electric vehicles are not technical,\u201d Dr. Sovacool said, \u201cbut social and cultural.\u201dThe Trump administration appears to be trying to kill off a program that you may have never heard of, in what critics say is a sign of the administration\u2019s hostility toward climate science.At $10 million per year, the Carbon Monitoring System is dwarfed by the multibillion-dollar NASA missions that launch satellites into space. It pays for research that gathers information from Earth-observing satellites and other tools to measure the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, oceans and forests around the world.\u201cIf you wanted to mitigate climate change, and therefore wanted to manage carbon, you can\u2019t do it unless you can measure it,\u201d said George Hurtt, a researcher at the University of Maryland who was the science team leader for the program.Philip B. Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, said canceling the program would be \u201ca blow to climate science.\u201d The 65 projects funded by the program have produced nearly 300 research papers since 2010, when Congress created it.The move comes down to politics, said Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, who serves as ranking member of the House science committee. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious to anyone that has been paying attention that this program is being canceled because it tracks carbon pollution, and that information would be used in efforts to understand and respond to climate change,\u201d she said.The Trump administration\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget called for the program\u2019s end, but Congress provided adequate funding in its omnibus spending bill. That funding would usually mean that the program would continue, but NASA appears to have interpreted things differently.Advertisement"}
