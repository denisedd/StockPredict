{"Headline": "How Hard Can It Be to Grow a Garden?", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at HomeSpring came late this year, and as I knelt in my garden digging up the first weeds of the season, a friend stopped by and looked quizzically at my work. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up in Jersey City.\u201dI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing, either, but I\u2019m giving it my all.The andromeda alongside my front steps mysteriously died over the winter. I\u2019m not sure how I killed this little plant with fiery leaves and drooping bundled blossoms, but I feel guilty about it. I blame heavy March snow for splitting the trunk of my miniature weeping maple, the showpiece of my front yard. I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s dead, but it looks alive to me.I am winging it here, filling flowerpots with annuals and pruning the forsythia back to within an inch of its life. Come fall, I will bury a few daffodil bulbs and hope for the best.Many of us move from the city to the suburbs for the open space. We imagine throwing a ball on a thick bed of grass, or drinking lemonade on a wraparound porch overlooking lush rhododendrons and peonies. But someone has to plant, mulch and prune all that foliage. For those of us who did not grow up digging in the dirt, but want to give it a try, the prospect can be intimidating.The trouble is there is no escaping your horticultural gaffes. If you stop in the middle of stripping the paint off your kitchen cabinets, no one will know unless you invite them in for coffee. But murder a rosebush, and there\u2019s no hiding your crime. Let the dandelions run rampant on your front lawn and all those bright yellow faces stare up at every passer-by, announcing that this homeowner has not kept up with the mowing.We\u2019re also cowed by social norms. My property receives full sun only in the front, making that area the best spot for a vegetable garden. But can you imagine the looks I\u2019d get if I set up a farm in the middle of my front lawn?Until I gather up the courage to go rogue, I have resigned myself to raising nonedible plants. Mr. Robbins says the reluctance to scrap a traditional lawn for something more functional is \u201cin the psyche. It\u2019s not in the realm of the rational.\u201dThe pressure to keep up appearances can be especially acute if you live in a show place. Julie Edwards, who works at Google, mostly killed houseplants when she lived in the city. But that didn\u2019t stop her from buying a four-bedroom house in 2016 in Pleasantville, N.Y., with a garden that looked as if it belonged in a Renoir. The previous owner, a botanist, clearly knew what she was doing. Since Ms. Edwards did not, she insisted that as a condition of the sale, the seller draw a map of the place detailing all the plants.\u201cWe\u2019ve inherited something that is both very beautiful but also burdensome,\u201d said Ms. Edwards, 46, who lives with her husband, Jim MacDonald, 51, an architect, and their two children in this impressionist wonderland. \u201cAm I going to kill this beautiful garden?\u201dSo far, the casualties have been minimal. But with two small children, a full-time job and a lack of confidence, her goals are modest. \u201cI will be lucky if I keep this baby alive,\u201d she said.Plants actually do want to live, which can come as a shock if your grandmother\u2019s anemic orchids are the only greenery you\u2019ve ever known. Eric Udin, 37, who works for Major League Baseball, grew up without a garden in the Bronx. In 2014, he moved to a three-bedroom house in Chappaqua, N.Y., with his wife, Diane Udin, 38, who works for the National Hockey League, and their two children.Two years ago, Mr. Udin cleared a patch near the back of their half-acre lot, and had an epiphany. \u201cWhat if I were to build a garden?\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife looked at me like, \u2018you\u2019re crazy.\u2019 Coming from city life, what did I know about gardening?\u201dWhat Mr. Udin lacked in experience, he made up for in enthusiasm. He built a raised-bed and planted cucumbers, watermelon, peppers and tomatoes. \u201cAll of a sudden things started growing,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not realize that watermelons grow on vines.\u201d His mother started calling him Farmer Eric.Last summer, the little Udin farm met its match: Deer moseyed over and devoured most of the crop. This spring, Mr. Udin wised up, surrounded the beds with chicken wire and placed pieces of Irish Spring soap around like amulets because deer are rumored to turn their noses up at the perfumed cleanser. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a fortress now,\u201d he said.Even in the city, property owners can be skittish about taking horticultural risks in their postage-stamp spaces. When Katherine Lilleskov moved into a co-op in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in 2011 with her husband and two children, the board would not allow anyone to plant anything in the 13 garden beds lining Bay Ridge Parkway.The sad little plots held only a few dreary evergreens pruned into geometric shapes, but Ms. Lilleskov, 60, a registered nurse and lactation consultant, saw their potential. She started covertly trimming the evergreens to \u201clet them be themselves,\u201d as she put it. She sneaked vinca, creeping Jenny and lily turf into the beds.Her efforts did not go unnoticed and in 2016, the board took the hint. It formed a gardening committee and appointed Ms. Lilleskov the chairwoman. The volunteer position came with a $1,000 annual budget, no strings attached, for flowers and shrubs. \u201cI felt like I had another baby,\u201d she said.She filled the beds with rhododendrons, azaleas, weeping blue Atlas cedars, daffodils, tulips, salvias and coral bells, transforming the spaces into a long, lush garden. Other shareholders added touches, and some even pitched in to water during the summer.\u201cHaving this mutual thing blossoming has been really good for the co-op,\u201d Ms. Lilleskov said. No one has requested a return to flat-topped shrubs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201dThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201dIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201dWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201dWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201dPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Adds A.I. Labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, Pressuring Local Universities", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is certainly true in the important area of artificial intelligence, which Mr. Zuckerberg says can help the social media giant deal with some of those problems.Facebook is opening new A.I. labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, after hiring three A.I. and robotics professors from the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon University. The company hopes these seasoned researchers will help recruit and train other A.I. experts in the two cities, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, said in an interview.As it builds these labs, Facebook is adding to pressure on universities and nonprofit A.I. research operations, which are already struggling to retain professors and other employees.\u201cIt is worrisome that they are eating the seed corn,\u201d said Dan Weld, a computer science professor at the University of Washington. \u201cIf we lose all our faculty, it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers.\u201dWith the new labs, Facebook \u2014 which already operates A.I. labs in Silicon Valley, New York, Paris and Montreal \u2014 is establishing two new fronts in a global competition for talent.Over the last five years, artificial intelligence has been added to a number of tech products, from digital assistants and online translation services to self-driving vehicles. And the world\u2019s largest internet companies, from Google to Microsoft to Baidu, are jockeying for researchers who specialize in these technologies. Many of them are coming from academia.\u201cWe\u2019re basically going where the talent is,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said.But the supply of talent is not keeping up with demand, and salaries have skyrocketed. Well-known researchers are receiving compensation in salary, bonuses and stock worth millions of dollars. Many in the field worry that the talent drain from academia could have a lasting impact in the United States and other countries, simply because schools won\u2019t have the teachers they need to educate the next generation of A.I. experts.Over the last few months, Facebook approached a number of notable researchers in Seattle. It hired Luke Zettlemoyer, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in technology that aims to understand and use natural human language, the company confirmed. This is an important area of research for Facebook as it struggles to identify and remove false and malicious content on its networks.In the fall, Mr. Zettlemoyer told The New York Times that he had turned down an offer from Google that was three times his teaching salary (about $180,000, according to public records) so he could keep his post at the university. Instead, he took a part-time position at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle lab backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.Many researchers retain their professorships when moving to the big companies \u2014 that\u2019s Mr. Zettlemoyer\u2019s plan while he works for Facebook \u2014 but they usually cut back on their academic work. At Facebook, academics typically spend 80 percent of their time at the company and 20 percent at their university.Like the other internet giants, Facebook acknowledges the importance of the university system. But at the same time, the companies are eager to land top researchers.In Pittsburgh, Facebook hired two professors from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, Abhinav Gupta and Jessica Hodgins, who specialized in computer vision technology.Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, did not respond to a request for comment. But over the past several months, he has been vocal about the movement of A.I. researchers toward the big internet companies. Google also operates an engineering office near Carnegie Mellon.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d he said.The two new Facebook labs are part of wider expansion for the company\u2019s A.I. operation. In December, Facebook announced that it had hired another computer vision expert, Jitendra Malik, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He now oversees the lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Even with its deep pockets, Facebook faces fierce competition for talent. Mr. Allen recently gave the Allen Institute, which he created in 2013, an additional $125 million in funding. After losing Mr. Zettlemoyer to Facebook, the Allen Institute hired Noah Smith and Yejin Choi, two of his colleagues at the University of Washington.Like Mr. Zettlemoyer, both specialize in natural language processing, and both say they received offers from multiple internet companies.The nonprofit is paying Mr. Smith and Ms. Choi a small fraction of what they were offered to join the commercial sector, but the Allen Institute will allow them to spend half their time at the university and collaborate with a wide range of companies, said Oren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute.\u201cThe salary numbers are so large that even Paul Allen can\u2019t match them,\u201d Mr. Etzioni said. \u201cBut there are still some people who won\u2019t go corporate.\u201dOthers researchers believe that companies like Facebook still align with their academic goals. Nonetheless, Ed Lazowska, the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was concerned that the large internet companies were luring too many of the university\u2019s professors into the commercial sector.Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, he said, are working on a set of recommendations for commercial companies meant to provide a way for universities and companies to share talent more equally. Mr. Lazowska added that every university should ensure that it did not become too close to one company.\u201cThe university must be a Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every company to collaborate with us and to feel like they have an equal opportunity to hire our students and work with our faculty.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ed Lazowska\u2019s position at the University of Washington. He is the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science, not the chairman of the computer science and engineering department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PayPal Agrees to $2.2 Billion Deal for European Payments Start-Up iZettle", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Seeking to extend its global reach, PayPal has reached a deal to buy iZettle, Europe\u2019s answer to the mobile payments company Square, for about $2.2 billion.The deal would be the company\u2019s biggest takeover \u2014 and would underscore the arms race in the world of payments, especially as digital and mobile transactions are increasingly being adopted across the world. The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Fill Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Moat\u2019 With Candy, but It Still Holds Water", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Elon Musk is taking on Warren Buffett, and their differences run deeper than jokes about candy and medieval fortifications.At Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier.\u201cI think \u2018moats\u2019 are lame,\u201d Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s File on Me Was Huge. Here\u2019s Why It Wasn\u2019t as Creepy as My Facebook Data.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou may wonder: Why is that? After all, we turn to Google for not only our internet searches but also for our emails, calendaring, maps, photo uploads, video streaming, mobile phones and web browsers. That\u2019s far more pervasive than the baby photos and comments that we post on Facebook.What I found was that my Google data archive was much larger than my Facebook file \u2014 about 12 times larger, in fact \u2014 but it was also packed with fewer unpleasant surprises.Most of what I saw in my Google file was information I already knew I had put in there, like my photos, documents and Google emails, while my Facebook data contained a list of 500 advertisers with my contact information and a permanent record of friends I thought I had \u201cdeleted\u201d years ago, among other shockers.Whenever I was perturbed by parts of my Google data, like a record of the Android apps I had opened over the past several years, I was relieved to find out I could delete the data. In contrast, when I downloaded my Facebook data, I found that a lot of what I saw could not be purged.Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company had spent many years developing tools for people to download their information.\u201cIt should be easy for people to understand and control their Google data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage everyone to use these tools so they can make the privacy choices that are right for them.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say that we should be complacent. Tech companies like Google and Facebook have an incredible amount of power over us that only increases with the more that they know. So downloading and analyzing your Google data, and determining what information you want to keep around or delete, is an exercise I highly recommend. Here\u2019s how I did it \u2014 and what I learned.If you download your whole archive, your file will probably be enormous. Mine was eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. After I requested my archive, it took Google about half a day to send an email with links to download my files.Here\u2019s what jumped out to me:\u2022 The most noteworthy folder is labeled My Activity, which is an overview of what you have done on Google\u2019s products, including Android, Google Maps and Google News.Inside My Activity is a subfolder labeled Ads. This record contained a history of many websites I had visited, including those I had reached without the help of Google.com. Even sites I opened through Twitter or links I clicked on through a text message were recorded in the Ads folder.What gives? Google said that many web articles load advertisements served through its ad network, and when you visit sites loading Google ads, you are contributing to an advertisement-related profile that Google is building about you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s logged in the My Activity folder.In my conversations with Google, the company argued that it was better to be transparent about the information being collected as opposed to not showing it at all.Brian Fitzpatrick, the former Google manager who led the team that created Takeout, put it another way. \u201cCompanies are gathering this data about you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just an honest way to look at it.\u201dMy take: It is helpful to see that this data is collected. But it should be labeled precisely \u2014 like \u201cPages We Know You Visited\u201d \u2014 so people can find this data more easily and decide whether to delete it.\u2022 A subfolder labeled Android contained a detailed history of the Android apps I had opened over the past three years, including the time and date I had launched each app. For example, my log showed I opened the Instagram app in March, the Gmail app in December 2015 and the Google Play Music app in January 2016.\u2022 Many files in my archive were odd formats that were not easy to open or read. For example, some files included the extension .JSON. My Google Maps location history was stored in a .JSON file, and it displayed an unintelligible list of GPS coordinates and time stamps.Google explained that Takeout was designed for people to be able to easily remove their data from Google and use it elsewhere. Files like those with the .JSON extension are common formats designed to be machine readable so that other programs and tools can make use of the data, according to Google.That makes sense \u2014 but our data should be readable by us, too.After poring through your Google file, ask yourself what personal data you are uncomfortable with having the company keep. Everybody is going to have a different answer.For me, I was troubled by Google keeping a history of websites I had visited even when I wasn\u2019t using Google products. I also found the company\u2019s log of my Android apps usage overly intrusive.I opted to purge the entire history for Ads, where my web-browsing activity was being tracked even when I was not using Google products. I also deleted all my Android data. Once I got going, I also deleted my history of requests made to Google\u2019s voice assistant and the web-browsing histories for sites I visited through Google News and Google Chrome.But that all raises a larger question. What does it mean to delete something from Google? Is it just hidden from plain sight or actually expunged?In other words, some of the data you eliminate will actually be deleted eventually, and some will not.That may not offer much solace. But short of ceasing to use the web entirely, occasionally purging parts of your account data, much like you would do with unwanted junk in your home, is the best you can do.Advertisement"}

If you\u2019re going, have a blast, and say \u201chi\u201d to Eminem. If not, we\u2019ve got a lineup of very quiet, anti-festival activities that you may prefer to 12-hour days of crowds on Randalls Island.A couple of housekeeping items:What\u2019s the Plan?Perhaps you remember when Governors Island was little more than a quiet piece of green surrounded by empty ex-military buildings and gorgeous views.If you visit today though, you\u2019ll see a much different landscape. The island now offers choose-your-own adventures of flourishing public arts, fun outdoor activities, food trucks galore and project after project on urban sustainability. Increasingly glittery, it\u2019s undergoing the outward changes that might imply gentrification anywhere else. Here, though, there\u2019s no one to displace, only a public to serve.But the best new feature is extended Friday hours, giving you access to the island\u2019s sun, sea breezes and skyline views until 10 p.m.There\u2019s a lot you could be doing on a Friday, but why mess with perfection?Before and After: The Best Food TrucksBefore and After: Bars on the IslandAnd Nearby (But Still on the Island)Required ReadingWhat\u2019s the Plan?In 1939, a pineapple company sent Georgia O\u2019Keeffe to Hawaii to produce paintings for a national ad campaign. Refused a bunk near the male-dominated pineapple plantations, she painted everything from papaya trees to volcanoes, but no pineapples; it wasn\u2019t until she was back in New York that she begrudgingly painted the fruit.Besides the special exhibits, the Garden is a delightful excursion: It\u2019s huge (250 acres), varied (with biomes from desert to local) and incredibly pleasant (miles of flora, what\u2019s not to love). Acquired by the city in 1891, the land was modeled after London\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens and is now a world-class facility for botany, research and public education.Plan an hour or so for O\u2019Keeffe, then grab a coffee at the Pine Tree Cafe and stick around. With native species fresh in your mind, hit the native plant garden to see a New York without foreign growth, then dip into the adjacent rock garden and learn how plants grow in the cracks in sidewalks. You could spend the whole day here, and you might as well plan on it. It\u2019s a real plant playground. Couldn\u2019t you use some more green?Before and After: RestaurantsArthur Avenue is a must-go destination for some of the city\u2019s best Italian produce, fresh cheese and pastas.Before and After: BarsAnd NearbyNote that the Garden is right by Fordham, so you\u2019re on a college campus, not in a neighborhood.

Indians come in all stripes, from the chief executives of Google and Microsoft to the Apus of Deli Marts and Kwik-E-Marts to the taxi drivers of New York City.I myself am Indian and a professor at Rutgers Business School, and I am not in the least offended by Apu\u2019s accent. Mr. Bajaj, smile and get over it.MARK CASTELINO, NEWARKTo the Editor:Vikas Bajaj raises important questions. Stereotypes in a comedy are meant to generate laughter, but Apu is simply not funny anymore, and the grossly exaggerated South Asian accent and behavior are tiresome.It is the successful sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d that has appropriated the modern comedic stereotype of an Indian-American. Raj is nerdy, highly educated with a professional job, video-chats with his parents on a laptop, doesn\u2019t handle alcohol well and is inept with women.Raj is not an Indian role model by any measure, but Apu\u2019s character invokes the worst kind of stereotyping and socioeconomic exclusion. Moreover, it belies American society\u2019s willingness and capacity to assimilate and empower the immigrant. In 2018, Apu\u2019s America appears claustrophobic, static and without hope. Where\u2019s the fun in that?RAJIV THIND, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIATo the Editor:Most of us know a friendly, hardworking and thrifty Apu somewhere. An endearing person. If Apu has to go for political correctness\u2019s sake, then other \u201cSimpsons\u201d characters have to go as well, since they all are representations of bumbling people of one kind of another. As a grandfather, I object to Grandpa. I look much better and \u2014 obviously \u2014 I am a lot smarter.But the one character who definitely has to go is Homer. He is a white working-class guy, with limited education and skills, and not very good judgment. I even suspect whom he voted for in the last presidential election. I say if Apu has to go, so does Homer. And Grandpa. Marge, you may be next.To the Editor:Instead of dumping the character Apu from the show, the writers of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d should introduce two new characters: Apu\u2019s Ivy-educated son and daughter, the software engineer and the doctor.To the Editor:Please don\u2019t terminate Apu for the sins of others. I am very sorry that Vikas Bajaj is offended by the character Apu. But the real offense is that people don\u2019t teach their children to show kindness and respect to others, and are not held to account. The real offense is that in this Trumpian era, people who would have been hesitant to display their bigotry no longer feel the need to keep it under wraps, but are content to use Apu as a tool to tease, humiliate or exclude other people.Now that many people from South Asia are living and working in the United States, they are targets of the ignorant, offensive behavior that is always the lot of immigrants, for at least one generation. Apu is a wonderful, vivid character, and I\u2019m glad to have met him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bots and Trolls Elbow Into Mexico\u2019s Crowded Electoral Field", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The message that circulated on social media earlier this year \u2014 most Mexicans would have to re-register within days if they wanted to vote in the presidential election \u2014 set off a low-level panic on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.The thing is, it wasn\u2019t true.The source remains unclear. But whether the message was a dirty trickster\u2019s attempt to undermine the system or just an ill-informed public service effort, the anger and uncertainty it generated represented an early skirmish in the battle over disinformation in this year\u2019s fiercely contested election season.\u201cWhat candidates do on social media will be decisive,\u201d said Carlos Merlo, managing partner of Victory Lab, a marketing firm dedicated to spreading viral claims, saying they must respond quicker than ever to combat disinformation.There is a lot at stake in the July 1 vote: over 3,400 elected positions at the local, state and federal levels, more than in any other election in Mexican history. The biggest prize is the presidency, with five candidates on the ballot competing to succeed President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto for a six-year term.Fake news has been flowing fast, and the campaigns have traded accusations that they have hired paid, online agitators called trolls and used automated programs known as bots to flood social media platforms with messages intended to deceive and manipulate voters.And as investigators in the United States continue to investigate the extent of Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election, the threat of Russian interference has loomed over the Mexican race as well.Mexican officials say they have not found evidence of Russian meddling or received any from their American counterparts, and the Russian authorities have denied engaging in such activity.Enrique Andrade, a top official at Mexico\u2019s National Electoral Institute, said the agency was on guard against any foreign interference. \u201cWe do think it is a possibility, and we are preparing ourselves so that it will not affect the process,\u201d he said.Some analysts have speculated that Russia might still try to disrupt the region by intensifying political polarization in Mexico ahead of the vote. And, they say, the Russians may view Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the front-runner in the polls who has cut a more antagonistic figure toward the United States than his rivals, as a useful vehicle for that goal.Manuel Coss\u00edo Ramos, a digital strategist, claims to have found Russian fingerprints on social media traffic concerning the election, much of it about Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador. Mr. Coss\u00edo is not affiliated with a presidential campaign, but acknowledges being no fan of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador.Using an analytics tool called NetBase, Mr. Coss\u00edo said he found that 4.8 million items about Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador had been posted to social media and news websites in the past month by users outside Mexico. About 63 percent were associated with users in Russia, he said, and 20 percent with Ukraine.Similar searches for two other leading candidates, Ricardo Anaya and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, found that most of the foreign activity was coming from the United States, with only 4 percent emanating from Russia, Mr. Coss\u00edo said.But other digital consultants, running different programs, said they had found no such evidence of election-related social media activity from Russia, and Mr. Coss\u00edo\u2019s findings could not be independently verified.Officials with Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s campaign have dismissed Mr. Coss\u00edo\u2019s findings as biased because of his political inclinations.The many pieces of fake news that have circulated in Mexico of late include a claim that Pope Francis weighed in on the presidential race and criticized Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s political ideology. (He didn\u2019t, according to Verificado 2018, a fact-checking group established in March to verify election-related news.)Another recent claim \u2014 also exposed as false by Verificado \u2014 held that Mr. Anaya was related to members of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration and, thus, his opposition party was in league with it.Since then, the online audience has nearly doubled: about 71.3 million internet users in Mexico, according to the latest census data, up from 40.9 million in 2012. At the same time, the campaigns have become more adept at designing online strategies.\u201cFrom this point on, the battle will be fought on the social networks,\u201d said Javier Murillo, co-founder and chairman of Metrics, a digital technology consultancy in Mexico.Using proprietary algorithms, Mr. Murillo said he found that bots and trolls generated up to 27 percent of election postings on Facebook and Twitter in Mexico during a recent monthlong period.Digital consultants working with the campaigns of the three leading presidential candidates \u2014 Mr. Lopez Obrador, Mr. Anaya and Mr. Meade \u2014 denied that the campaigns were using such methods, or spreading fake news.\u201cSocial media is now an obligatory part of any campaign war room,\u201d said Mr. Anaya\u2019s digital strategist, Juan Pablo Adame Alem\u00e1n. \u201cBut we see no benefit to inflating topics\u201d with bots or trolls.In an effort to get ahead of the problem as Election Day draws closer, Mexican authorities have reached agreements with Facebook, Twitter and Google on ways to counteract fake news and spread accurate information. Facebook, as part of its agreement, placed ads in Mexican newspapers this spring providing guidance on how to detect fake news.Election officials have been particularly worried about rumors that seem intended to undermine the integrity of the system. The message concerning voter registration this year was of the biggest concern to them so far, said Mr. Andrade of the National Electoral Institute.\u201cThen again,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cwe are only getting started in terms of the campaign process.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I manage our projects at sites having property damage of at least $250,000.How did you get started in this field?After high school I enlisted in the United States Army and served for 12 years, the last one in Iraq. In 2005, when I returned, a family friend who worked here told me about an opening for a carpenter.Instead I got a job as a technician in the warehouse.

What happened?After the Army I was in the Army Reserve for several years, and in 2008 they sent me to Afghanistan for about a year.When I returned, the company made me a project manager in the field. I moved to my current position in 2015.What do you do when a disaster occurs?I drive or fly to the site and handle logistics like food and lodging for our technicians that will be arriving. I do a walk-through of the structure with the home or business owner and determine the supplies and equipment and number of employees that will be needed.Then we work out a schedule on paper or using Google Calendar, whichever the client prefers.For a business, I might set up 24-hour operations to get it up and running again.What was the longest you were away from home on a single trip?Last year I was away for eight weeks. I\u2019m married with four kids, so I didn\u2019t score any points for that, but it would have been tough to get home.A construction company found formaldehyde leaking from floor joists supporting subfloors in about 2,000 homes they built. A faulty product was to blame. They hired us to determine whether to remove the joists, seal them, or do something else. I covered two states, Colorado and Illinois.Has your Army training helped in this job?It taught me to be a leader, set goals and take responsibility for completing tasks. After experiencing extreme situations overseas, I can appraise a situation, enter a disaster site and remain calm.

{"Headline": "Dean Heller, Buffeted on Both Sides, Tries to Save His Nevada Senate Seat", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 There was not an overabundance of enthusiasm for Senator Dean Heller when the Nevada Republican Men\u2019s Club gathered for its monthly luncheon at the Bali Hai Golf Club here.Karl Johnson, a precinct director for the Clark County Republican Party, wrinkled his nose and raised his eyebrows when asked about Mr. Heller\u2019s prospects for re-election. Paul Workman, a banker who supports Mr. Heller, said conservatives are complaining to him about the Republican senator\u2019s shifting stances on health care.Linda Cannon, a candidate for the Nevada State Assembly, summed up the views of many. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold my nose and vote for him,\u201d she said.Democrats deride that awkward reversal as a flip-flop, one of many, including an about-face on immigration. The senator\u2019s backers say he was simply making thoughtful decisions. Regardless, it hangs over Mr. Heller, who at the moment is something like a man without a country.He is struggling to mend fences with backers of President Trump, who have not forgotten that in 2016 he declared himself \u201cvehemently opposed\u201d to Mr. Trump as a candidate. They are suspicious of his recent embrace of the president. But his appeal will have to extend well beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in a state where polls show Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity near or below 40 percent.And his seat is one both sides desperately need. With Democrats defending 10 Senate seats in states Mr. Trump won, Mr. Heller\u2019s is that rare opportunity to mitigate potential losses. For Republicans clinging to a 51-to-49 Senate majority, Nevada is one of only a handful of states where they are on defense \u2014 and in a Democratic sweep, it could be one of the seats that costs them control.While the president gave him a big boost recently, by nudging Danny Tarkanian, a conservative businessman and perennial candidate, out of the Republican primary, people in both parties say Mr. Heller remains the most vulnerable Republican in the Senate.\u201cHe\u2019s not hard-enough red meat for the Republicans, not moderate enough to satisfy the nonpartisan folks,\u201d said David Damore, a political scientist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who is following the race.But Mr. Heller\u2019s chief strategist, Mike Slanker, said that in a swing state like Nevada, Mr. Heller \u2014 who has never lost a race in his nearly 30 years in politics \u2014 is exactly where he should be. He was recently ranked No. 5 on a list of the most bipartisan senators, developed by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University.\u201cPeople may knock him, but he\u2019s a winner,\u201d Mr. Slanker said, \u201cand he\u2019s a winner because voters like him.\u201dMr. Heller declined to be interviewed for this article. During a quick hallway conversation in the Capitol in Washington, he brushed off questions and, perhaps only half-jokingly, urged a reporter not to write about his race.\u201cDon\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it,\u201d he said with a smile.In Nevada, he pitches himself to voters as the candidate with experience who can work in a bipartisan way, and he spotlights his work on behalf of veterans, an important constituency in Nevada, and on the recent tax overhaul.\u201cIt\u2019s still Heller\u2019s race to lose,\u201d said Sig Rogich, a longtime Republican strategist here.Ms. Rosen, 60, casts herself as a fresh face and a woman of the people who worked her way through college as a waitress \u2014 and worked her way up as a computer programmer when few women were in the field. In a brief interview, she suggested she would make an issue of Mr. Heller\u2019s embrace of Mr. Trump.\u201cDean Heller last year voted 96 percent of the time with Donald Trump, and he\u2019s never voted against a Trump nominee,\u201d Ms. Rosen said. \u201cI\u2019m always going to stand up for Nevada first.\u201d\u201cThe people in Nevada who are solid Trump supporters aren\u2019t buying into this idea that now he\u2019s suddenly becoming a Trump supporter,\u201d said Chuck Muth, a conservative blogger here. \u201cThey\u2019ve become Never Hellers. And there\u2019s going to be a lot of Trump supporters who will not vote for Dean Heller. They\u2019ll vote for none of the above.\u201dThat said, Republicans are desperate to keep their seat in Nevada. Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative talk show host who has been one of Mr. Heller\u2019s staunchest critics, now says he is \u201call in\u201d for the senator.\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way,\u201d Mr. Root said. \u201cIs it a miraculous religious conversion or is it just convenience to get elected again? I\u2019m a skeptical guy. We\u2019ll see after the election.\u201dMr. Heller, a former Nevada secretary of state, cuts a low-key figure in the Senate. He is media shy; in Washington, he typically takes a back stairway to reach the chamber during votes, to avoid the usual scrum of reporters. Here in Nevada, journalists say he often ducks their questions.\u201cIf you could do a specific Google search to find \u2018Heller was not available,\u2019 there would be a lot of results,\u201d said Jon Ralston, the editor of The Nevada Independent.Friends say the senator, an amateur racecar driver who likes to spend weekends on his ranch in northern Nevada, simply does not seek the limelight.\u201cHe\u2019s not a glitzy guy in any way. It\u2019s just not his nature,\u201d Mr. Rogich said.Appointed by Gov. Brian Sandoval in 2011 to fill a seat left vacant by the departure of John Ensign, Mr. Heller was elected in his own right, by a thin one-point margin, in 2012. The following year, he broke with many in his party to vote in favor of an immigration law overhaul \u2014 a vote that pleased Nevada\u2019s growing Hispanic population. But this year, he sided with the president in backing a plan that would sharply limit legal immigration, a move that again exposed him to accusations of flip-flopping.On health care, the senator voted against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act at the urging of Mr. Sandoval, who has used the law to expand Medicaid in Nevada. The narrower version, which Mr. Heller backed, left the Medicaid expansion intact. Pete Ernaut, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Heller, summed up the situation: \u201cThere was no perfect answer. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered what he did on that. Somebody would have picked it apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the G.D.P.R., Europe\u2019s Tough New Data Law, Means for You", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what it means for you.The law, which goes into effect on May 25, strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.Europe is attempting to push back.It\u2019s too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally.Not really.Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn\u2019t likely to see a difference.If you live in one of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome \u2014 you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping.As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads \u201cfine tuned,\u201d but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, which makes tools to help companies work around ad-blocking software.Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information.The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps.That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience.Even if you don\u2019t notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about.But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn\u2019t been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data.The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered.But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look.A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear.Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed.He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share.Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the \u201cspirit\u201d of the law.It\u2019s too soon to tell.That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won\u2019t be known for years.Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders.A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data.The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When People and Companies Are Both Just \u2018Brands\u2019?", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsSome ideas are bigger than others. Some even grow so large that they turn into paradigms, their logic organizing the way we see everything around them. And if you\u2019re uncertain what framework dominates modern life, well, you can take it from the TED conference fixture and Advertising for Humanity founder Dan Pallotta, who put it bluntly enough in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review: \u201cBrand is everything, and everything is brand.\u201dHe was writing in the service of building his own brand, which is about rebranding other people\u2019s brands. The brand, in fact, is such a ubiquitous organizing principle for so many things \u2014 companies, products, people \u2014 that it has been forced to spawn an expansive glossary of subcategories and varieties. There are \u201cpublic brands\u201d (civic institutions), \u201cbrand extensions\u201d (new products from existing brands), \u201cfighter brands\u201d (cheaper brands released by costlier brands to reattract lost brand loyalty) and \u201cbrand leaders\u201d (the very best brands). Even aspects of branding itself are branded, with \u201cbrand managers\u201d (marketers) building \u201cbrand equity\u201d (likability) through the cultivation of \u201cbrandface\u201d (the way the consumer sees herself when she engages with the brand). The apotheosis of all this might be the \u201clifestyle brand\u201d \u2014 a corporate bid to escape the humdrum reality of selling products and instead market an entire way of being. Taco Bell is entering the category with a Forever 21 clothing line targeted at \u201cmaking wardrobes a whole lot saucier.\u201d Lexus has chased the luxury lifestyle into the sea by introducing a yacht. A vice president for Good Foods describes its guacamole as part of \u201ca lifestyle brand that adds optimum nutrition and wellness, along with the fun factor that can be enjoyed during holidays like Cinco de Mayo.\u201dAnything that can be consumed is now understood as a brand \u2014 and on the internet, that\u2019s every last bit of content. This is how a consultant like Eric Garland can, on the strength of a viral tweet storm about the \u201cgame theory\u201d behind American politics, brand himself as a Russian conspiracy sage and market subscriptions to @gametheorytoday. It\u2019s also why actual brands, like Hamburger Helper or Denny\u2019s, hang around social media masquerading as people, posting jokes and memes and roasting haters. Even the most cynical internet users speak semiseriously about our posts being \u201con brand\u201d or \u201coff brand.\u201d There is no refuge from the logic of the brand \u2014 and if there is, some up-and-coming strategist will soon enough bolster her own brand by colonizing it.At its core, branding is a process of humanization: It imbues companies with personalities. Often the personification is overt. Once there were Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker; now there\u2019s the Trump Organization and Fenty Beauty. As the celebrity adman Bruce Barton once said: \u201cInstitutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls.\u201d A company with a soul becomes relatable, but in a deceptive way: The more we think of it as a \u201cbrand,\u201d the more our focus shifts away from things like labor practices and supply chains and onto issues of narrative and identity.Part of what Peters envisioned was human beings\u2019 thinking of themselves in the same way. The internet had made people identical, too, just messages stacked in a virtual box; like the snacks and sneakers that came before them, they needed ways to differentiate themselves. Where \u201cThe Brand Called You\u201d becomes fascinating, though, is when it applies this logic to employment. Peters saw personal branding as a way to liberate yourself from the constraints of corporate life; he described lifelong steady employment as \u201cwhat we used to call indentured servitude.\u201d In its place, he hailed the emergence of a new \u201cproject world,\u201d where work \u201cis organized into bite-sized packets.\u201d To thrive in such a world, he encouraged readers to collect and market skills and connections \u2014 to throw out their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in favor of a \u201cmarketing brochure for brand You.\u201dHe imagined empowered workers divesting themselves from corporate drudgery, but what actually happened was the opposite: Our corporations divested from us. Over the two decades since \u201cThe Brand Called You,\u201d full-time employment has steadily atomized into casual, part-time and temporary work, culminating in the \u201cproject world\u201d of the gig economy \u2014 microjobs driving for Uber, running errands for TaskRabbit or cooking up side hustles on Fiverr, a company whose subway ads glamorize pitiless overwork (\u201csleep deprivation is your drug of choice\u201d) despite its being named after a woefully small amount of cash.The opportunities to market ourselves online are never-ending, but the financial rewards remain elusive. Headlines heralding the multimillion-dollar incomes of YouTube stars can make cultivating a brand there seem like a real career option, but a recent study found that even channels among the top 3 percent of viewership can bring in as little as $16,800 a year. (When a would-be YouTube star opened fire in the company\u2019s offices, it was perhaps the first workplace shooting of the gig economy.) Marketing money flows through Instagram, but few of the \u201cinfluencers\u201d there see much of it; the Cornell professor Brooke Erin Duffy has described them as engaging in \u201caspirational labor,\u201d a \u201cmode of (mostly) uncompensated, independent work that is propelled by the much-venerated ideal of getting paid to do what you love.\u201dThey burnish their brands based on the unspoken assumption that a successful brand leads naturally to actual success. But this tricky conversion rarely takes place, and the work behind it tends to be less valuable to us than it is, in the aggregate, to the companies that facilitate it. All the time I thought I was building my own brand, seeding the internet with personal information in a bid to dominate the Google results \u2014 fending off challengers like Amanda Hess, the saintly doctor who delayed giving birth in order to deliver another woman\u2019s baby first \u2014 I was enriching any number of tech companies.Tom Peters encouraged us to break the chains of the corporate world in favor of pursuing a life of autonomous creativity. But now branding has taken over not just work but life itself, seizing control of our appearances, our social relationships, even our approach to civil society. After Starbucks staff called the police on two black men waiting in one of their stores \u2014 then closed 8,000 locations to conduct bias training for employees \u2014 a Forbes contributor praised the company for showing \u201cbrand purpose and promise\u201d that could \u201cprovide direction for both Starbucks and society at large.\u201d Even in the age of the personal brand, corporations rule.Amanda Hess is a critic at large for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

The key assumption of that era was that markets work best when the government focuses exclusively on enforcing contract and property rights.This sort of agreement is now illegal, but businesses have nevertheless found new and creative ways to achieve monopoly profits, while antitrust enforcers have fallen behind.According to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.To revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.We also need a renewed public awareness of the dangers of monopolies to ensure that in the future antitrust enforcers feel the pressure to keep up with the ever-changing faces of monopoly power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When 2 + 2 Might Equal 5", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Abrams is a First Amendment lawyer who has represented journalists and media clients for decades.England is the mother country of the United States, and much American law is deeply rooted in that of its maternal forebear. But in few areas do the two systems diverge more than on freedom of expression. \u201cNo purpose,\u201d the Supreme Court observed in 1941, \u201cin ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for the people of the United States much greater freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than the people of Britain had ever enjoyed.\u201dA decision a few weeks ago by the English High Court illustrates the magnitude of the differences. The European Union has adopted what is generally referred to as the \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d based on a 2014 ruling of the European Court of Justice. At the heart of that ruling is the determination that Google and other search engines must remove links to content published years before that was harmful to personal reputation but that is now deemed to be \u201cirrelevant or no longer relevant.\u201dGoogle and other entities that carry such data, upon receiving complaints from people who maintain that published information about them is no longer relevant, must make an initial determination as to whether to delete the challenged information. If the offended individual disagrees, he or she may go to court to seek an order requiring the deletion. Truth is no defense for Google; lack of continued \u201crelevance\u201d carries the day.Since the 2014 ruling establishing the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d Google has received over 2.4 million such requests and has acceded to their pleas about 43 percent of the time. In the recent case decided by the English High Court, the first to be decided in that country, Google declined to do so.Viewed through American eyes, every aspect of the court\u2019s ruling would have been at odds with the First Amendment. The published material was true. The businessman-former convict who prevailed before the court had been duly convicted and jailed. There was not even a claim that the conviction had been wrongly imposed. In fact, the judge cited the acknowledgment of guilt by the individual seeking to bar Google from including his name as a factor in favor of suppressing that fact from Google users.An American judge confronted with such a case would probably have responded that the First Amendment would not permit even the beginning of engagement in what is nothing less than official censorship.Yet the door is not completely closed to the importation into America of the notion that certain truths may not be set forth by certain entities. A state assemblyman has introduced legislation that would create a version of a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d law in New York. While there seems little doubt that the courts would hold any such legislation to be unconstitutional, the fact that it has even been introduced illustrates the appeal of limitations on the dissemination of older information, however accurate the data may be.The dangers of one generation suppressing information about events of a previous one have not been limited to the imposition of content restrictions on Google. The same restrictions have been applied to online copies of newspapers that published truthful articles years before. In Belgium in 2016, for example, a superior court ordered a newspaper to delete from a 22-year-old article in its online archives the name of the driver who was in an accident that resulted in two deaths. That censorship of speech was the natural consequence of requiring older facts to be forgotten.The appeal of erasing certain facts is understandable. But the danger of allowing governmental suppression of truth is real. One need not envisage a dystopian world to recall Orwell\u2019s enduring warning that \u201cfreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\u201dFloyd Abrams is senior counsel at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP and the author of \u201cThe Soul of the First Amendment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Six C.E.O. Pay Packages That Explain Soaring Executive Compensation", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs economic uncertainty roils the country, the income gap between top executives and everyday employees continues to grow ever wider.Here are six pay packages that stand out.Mr. Bisignano was the second-highest paid chief executive in the country this year, and one of only two on the Equilar list to earn more than $100 million.The median salary at First Data, which processes credit-card transactions, was $50,406, resulting in one of the highest pay ratios \u2014 2,028 \u2014 on the Equilar list.First Data, which did not reply to requests for comment, promotes an employee-ownership model in which stock is a part of every employee\u2019s compensation, and \u201ceveryone is a shareholder and is rewarded as the company performs better.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean the equity is evenly distributed. \u201cSome people are getting more equity than others,\u201d said Louis Hyman, a business historian at Cornell University. \u201cIt seems like another way to get people to work harder for a smaller cut of the pie.\u201dOracle has not one, but two chief executives \u2014 and it compensates each of them quite generously. Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, the technology company\u2019s co-C.E.O.s, were each awarded about $41 million last year. Taken together, their combined pay package of $82 million would amount to the third largest of the year.Mr. Hurd, a longtime technology executive, has criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, and could be in line to take sole control of Oracle in the event that Ms. Catz takes a government job.Oracle did not report a median employee salary or a pay ratio because its fiscal year had not ended. As is typical with most C.E.O. packages, the bulk of the pay for Ms. Catz and Mr. Hurd was composed of stock awards and stock options. Oracle declined to comment.Walmart employs 1.5 million people in the United States, making it by far the country\u2019s largest private employer.\u201cWe have invested billions in our associates the past few years to increase wages and develop training and education programs to build a career where each job can serve as a pathway to greater opportunity,\u201d Randy Hargrove, a company spokesman, said in an email, after this article was published. \u201cWalmart has represented a ladder of opportunity since we started the business, and we want to make sure that\u2019s the case going forward everywhere we operate including in the U.S.\u201dThe efforts have only helped so much. The median employee at Walmart made $19,177 last year. In that time, Mr. McMillon made more than $22 million, resulting in a pay ratio of 1,188.\u201cAt a time when too many Walmart workers face stagnant wages and tens of thousands still qualify for public assistance, is paying your C.E.O. 1,188 times the median employee really the best investment for Walmart?\u201d said Randy Parraz, director of Making Change at Walmart, a labor group. \u201cInstead of pursuing billion-dollar stock buybacks and million-dollar C.E.O. payouts, Walmart needs to make the necessary investment to eradicate poverty within and among its own work force.\u201dMichael Weaver, a Wynn spokesman, pointed out that shareholders fared well last year despite the allegations against Mr. Wynn.\u201cSteve Wynn\u2019s 2017 compensation should be considered in comparison to the 97 percent shareholder return that same year,\u201d he said in an email.There is another wrinkle in Mr. Wynn\u2019s pay package worth noting. Mr. Wynn, a major Republican donor, appears to have taken advantage of changes to the tax law. Wynn Resorts paid eligible employees their 2017 bonuses in December, rather than in the beginning of 2018, according to Equilar. Executives who got those bonuses owed more taxes that year, but the company offered them tax equalization payments to cover the charges. The net result of this maneuvering is likely to save the company money on this year\u2019s tax bill, according to Equilar.Ms. Georgiadis, a former Google executive, arrived at Mattel with great fanfare last year, a technology executive recruited to turn around a toy business being disrupted by online shopping.It didn\u2019t work out so well. Mattel shares lost about half their value last year, and last month, Ms. Georgiadis left the company. She is now the chief executive of Ancestry.com, the genealogy website.Because it operates its own factories overseas, Mattel reported one of the highest pay ratios among companies on the Equilar list, with Ms. Georgiadis being awarded a whopping 4,987 times the median employee\u2019s pay.\u201cMore than half of Mattel\u2019s worldwide employee base consists of manufacturing plant workers in Asia and elsewhere, which of course significantly impacts our median employee pay rate,\u201d said Alex Clark, a company spokesman.As a result of her departure, Ms. Georgiadis forfeited most of her reported compensation, which was in the form of stock awards and options that had not yet realized or vested. Instead, Mattel said Ms. Georgiadis earned about $10.8 million last year.Using Ms. Georgiadis\u2019s actual pay from last year would lower the company\u2019s pay ratio somewhat, but it would still be quite high. To earn the $10.8 million Ms. Georgiadis took home last year, the median Mattel employee would have to work for 1,722 years.Incyte, a biotechnology company with just one cancer drug on the market in the United States, had the lowest pay ratio on the Equilar list.Given the company\u2019s generous median salary of $253,015 and the $16.1 million awarded to Mr. Hoppenot, the chief executive, the company\u2019s pay ratio was 64 to 1 \u2014 positively modest compared with companies like Walmart and Mattel.But look more closely, and the comparison falls flat.

{"Headline": "Facebook to Reorganize After Scrutiny Over Data Privacy", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook overhauled its structure on Tuesday into three new divisions and shuffled the leadership of its key products, in one of its biggest reorganizations.The moves happened at the direction of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said a person with knowledge of the changes, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss them. The reorganization was intended to streamline the company and clarify who oversees what after a long period of growth and numerous acquisitions, according to another person involved.Facebook now plans to organize its product and engineering teams under three new categories, grouping its biggest moneymaking services together and separating them from its moonshot technologies.One new group will focus on Facebook\u2019s key products, including the social network itself, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, all of which generate the most revenue for the company. The second will concentrate on emerging technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The third will be centered on ads, personnel, security and growth.Facebook\u2019s key products group will be run by Chris Cox, its chief product officer. The emerging technologies division will be led by Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer. And Javier Olivan, a vice president of growth, will lead the final group.Other executives are changing jobs as part of the shifts. WhatsApp, for instance, will now be led by Chris Daniels, a Facebook executive who was previously tasked with bringing new people online through a free or affordable version of Facebook called Internet.org.The roles of the company\u2019s top two leaders \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 remain unchanged. Ms. Sandberg\u2019s business teams are unaffected by the restructuring.Ari Ratner, a former Obama administration official who now runs Inside Revolution, a strategic communications firm, said the restructuring would likely have little impact on the root issues that Facebook has been grappling with.This \u201cwill have minimal impact on the issues themselves,\u201d said Mr. Ratner. \u201cIf you want to send the message things will be different, I\u2019m not sure if that accomplishes much.\u201dUnder Facebook\u2019s new emerging technologies group, Mr. Zuckerberg has also created a new team focused on blockchain, a digital ledger that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The group will be led by David Marcus, who had been overseeing Facebook Messenger, with the mandate of examining how Facebook can incorporate blockchain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Brief Trip to Cancerland", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterI knew, as soon as I heard the radiologist\u2019s voice on the phone, that the news wasn\u2019t good. \u201cIs this an O.K. time to talk?\u201d she asked. If everything was fine, she would have said that. Instead, she was saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but your biopsy came back positive for cancer.\u201dStill in my pajamas, I scribbled down notes. \u201cWill probably need lumpectomy and radiology. Find surgeon. Call this number.\u201d Of course, through the 10-minute conversation, the only word that really registered was \u201ccancer.\u201dWhat happened was this: A few months ago, I went for a mammogram. The doctors saw spots they didn\u2019t like. I wasn\u2019t concerned. Once you hit your late 40s, it\u2019s practically a rite of passage. You will see your mother\u2019s face when you look in the mirror. You will require a young child to fix your phone or explain a meme. And you, or a friend, or a sister, will get a call about her mammogram. Over the years, I\u2019ve driven friends to get ultrasounds, and taken them home after needle biopsies. Everything always turned out fine, which reflects the statistics: Most women who have an abnormality on their mammograms will be O.K.This time, not me. I went for additional imaging. I had a core needle biopsy.Then I got the call.I hung up the phone and went into panic mode. I worked my contacts, calling or emailing every friend I knew who had been unlucky enough to go through this, thinking that I was lucky to have people to call, a sister-in-law who works for Stand Up to Cancer and knows every doctor in the world, and good insurance. I locked in on a surgeon and began leaving borderline-frantic messages on her voice mail.When the surgeon\u2019s office called back, I was in the car, on my way to Vermont with my family for Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. I\u2019d thought about canceling, then decided that going away and staying busy was better than sitting home obsessing. The soonest appointment available was weeks away, an announcement that kicked off a second round of frantic calling and emailing. I had cancer, and they expected me to just hang out for weeks with this thing in my body?We got to Vermont. My husband was sick in bed. My mom, who was with us, had been knocked out by a bad reaction to a tetanus shot. For a while, I was the only able-bodied adult, getting ski boots on and off, shepherding the kids to their lessons. At one point, I slipped on a patch of ice. My feet flew out from under me and I landed on my back, cracking my head on the ice. I lay in the snow, looking up at the sky, calling, \u201cIsn\u2019t there someone who doesn\u2019t have cancer who can help?\u201d There was not.I made it through the weekend. I skied with the kids. I practiced the piano. I tried to act like everything was fine even, while every minute I was awake my mind was churning, repeating the words \u201cbreast cancer\u201d on an endless loop.And then I got some good news.My surgeon read my films, examined me, sat down in her office with me and my husband and told us that the thing that I have, L.C.I.S., lobular carcinoma in situ, is not cancer, exactly. It\u2019s more like a warning sign for cancer.Then why did the radiologist tell me I had cancer? I asked. I had taken notes \u2014 I was sure that\u2019s what I\u2019d heard. The surgeon didn\u2019t have an answer, but she did have a plan. Because my not-exactly-cancer \u2014 pleomorphic L.C.I.S. \u2014 had features that made it behave more aggressively than just plain, old L.C.I.S., my surgeon wanted to examine the tissue, make sure that the margins were clear and that those cells weren\u2019t hiding worse news. It should come out.Ten days later, at 7 a.m., I went to the hospital. In the radiology department, two lovely nurses, a technician and a doctor worked together to place a wire into my breast that would guide my surgeon to the mass. I stood on my tiptoes, leaning forward with my back arched and my breast stuffed into the mammogram chamber, with the doctor crouched underneath me and the technician watching a screen, calling out quadrants like my breast was a Battleship board. It was almost as much fun as the pre-surgery M.R.I., which involved lying face down with my breasts dangling, udder-like, through cutouts in the table and a bar digging into my sternum.Then I sat in a waiting room, a warmed blanket over my legs, while at least six people asked my name and my date of birth and what I was there for. Lumpectomy, I said, over and over. Left breast. Lumpectomy. Left breast. A technician used a Sharpie to write \u201cYES\u201d on the appropriate side, and I snapped a picture for my \u201cDrag Race\u201d-loving daughter, captioned \u201cServing fierce pre-surgery realness.\u201dMy surgeon swung by with her own Sharpie, and the anesthesiologist put in an IV. I was wheeled into the chilly operating room and shifted onto the narrow table. An hour later, I woke up with the bottom half of my breast stiff with bandages and the top looking like a graffitied wall.Two days later, my surgeon called. The margins were clear. Everything was fine. I could breathe again.When I imagined telling people about my experience, I envisioned its conclusion: a rousing chorus of \u201cGo get your mammograms!\u201d Even if you\u2019re busy! Even if you don\u2019t have a family history! Even if you nursed your kids!I know the stories about women who, like me, had abnormal mammograms, but whose biopsies or M.R.I.s revealed advanced cancers that were successfully treated. Early detection saves lives, I\u2019d always heard, and it seemed like a reasonable mantra.Except now, some researchers are rethinking this practice. There are organizations saying that the word \u201ccarcinoma\u201d shouldn\u2019t be part of lobular carcinoma in situ \u2014 and that women should be told they have a growth or a neoplasm, an elevated risk or a precancerous condition instead. (Though pleomorphic L.C.I.S., which I had, is considered more serious.) Some organizations even contend that women under 50 with no family history of the disease shouldn\u2019t be getting mammograms at all.Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, the author of the book \u201cOverdiagnosed\u201d has spent 20 years arguing that looking for trouble with increasingly advanced tests and machinery means it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll find it and that aggressive treatment isn\u2019t necessarily the best way of handling early cancers.\u201cAre fewer women dying from breast cancer? The answer is a dramatic yes,\u201d Dr. Welch told me. Breast cancer death rates are down by nearly 40 percent since 1989. But he credits that improvement to better treatment of advanced cancers, not to screening.Dr. Welch pointed to men who receive a low-risk prostate cancer diagnosis. In many cases, they are encouraged to watch and wait instead of jumping immediately to surgery.Someday, he thinks, doctors and patients could talk about managing cancer, the way people manage heart disease and diabetes and AIDS.When I told him that I couldn\u2019t imagine just \u201cmanaging\u201d something with a name that includes the word cancer, or telling my friends I\u2019d decided to forgo mammograms, he was sympathetic. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe the best approach to health isn\u2019t constantly looking for things to be wrong.\u201dDr. Steven Katz, a professor of medicine and health management and policy at the University of Michigan, studies cancer treatment communication and decision-making. He understands that people who hear the C-word want to take immediate action. \u201cOur intuitive and emotional reactions are wired for millennia and millennia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a fire in the cave, you run. \u201dMaking good decisions begin with what you hear from your doctor in the first place.\u201cThe way we frame illness and the treatment options is the most important factor driving what happens next,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the cancer label is particularly profound.\u201d\u201cDid you get a second opinion?\u201d he asked me.\u201cThere is time for just about any decision you make,\u201d he said.Four weeks after my lumpectomy, the purple-and-yellow bruises that made my breast look like a summer thunderstorm have faded and the stitches have dissolved. All that\u2019s left are the occasional twinge, a U-shaped scar that looks like a smile, and questions. When I look back, I feel like Dorothy, scooped up by a hurricane, blown into a strange new land and just as quickly dumped back in Kansas.It wasn\u2019t until after my panic and my surgery that I began to read about doctors who think we\u2019re testing too much and treating too aggressively, and to think about what the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky called the anchoring effect, the way the first number you hear affects the decisions you make. When you\u2019re told that a set of knives is valued at $59.99, $19.99 sounds like a bargain. Maybe when the first word you hear is \u201ccancer,\u201d surgery, as soon as possible, feels like the only possible move.I know myself well enough to believe that there was no way I was going to live with something, whether it was cancer or pre-cancer or cancer\u2019s second cousin once removed, hanging out in my chest. I don\u2019t regret my decision. But I have questions about the way I made it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: In Chile, a Gorgeous, Very Rainy and Sometimes Lonely Journey", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlace 11My 50-mile trip south through Pumal\u00edn should have clocked in at around an hour. It took me four. That meandering was spiked with so much joy. But it was also the first time, in two and a half months of solo travel, that I have felt truly lonely. There\u2019s nothing like shouting out, \u201cThis is so beautiful!\u201d to an empty car to make you wish for company. THE SOUTHERN HIGHWAYDEALING WITH THE DELUGETen years ago, the entire settlement had to be evacuated when the adjacent Volc\u00e1n Chait\u00e9n erupted unexpectedly for the first time in over 9,000 years. Stalwarts moved back and rebuilt, but there\u2019s still a ghostly row of collapsed houses on the street closest to the mountains. It wasn\u2019t lava that caused the destruction, though, but a mudslide of volcanic ash triggered by rain, which I experienced as a biblical deluge four of my five days in Pumal\u00edn. The name of Chait\u00e9n means \u201cbasket of water\u201d in the native language of Huilliche. \u201cThe same thing we always do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work hard, we eat our meals. If we stopped doing anything because it rained, nothing would ever get done.\u201d Then the rain returned, flowing through holes in the roof as if from a sprinkler. I wasn\u2019t scared, yet, just cold. I posted a tweet, mainly to create a record of where I was. Half an hour passed, then an hour. The rain wouldn\u2019t let up and now my phone was dead and the day\u2019s light was beginning to fade. I could see my car in the far distance. The wind was gusting with such force that the rainfall rose off the pavement in waves. I took a deep breath and ran. Water flew up my nose and soaked my socks, which wouldn\u2019t dry for days \u2014 and I was laughing. Laughing and running. And there was my car but I didn\u2019t open the door. I wanted to stand there, getting wet, taking it in. THE FRIENDS YOU MEET ON VOLCANOESDetermined to get in one hike in the window of what looked like a rain-free day, I set off on the three-hour round trip trail up Volc\u00e1n Chait\u00e9n. I hadn\u2019t counted on quite how remote and steep it would be. A sea of burned sticks that were trees before the 2008 eruption towered above a undergrowth of ferns. My pace was so slow that people who\u2019d passed me on their way up were lapping me on their way down. I realized I hadn\u2019t told anyone where I was, and hadn\u2019t had a cell signal for days. All I had in my backpack was photo equipment, two liters of water and a packet of salami.Then the rain began again, coming down so hard it flowed off every plant in mini-waterfalls. I wondered who would notice I was missing (probably my mom) and how long it would take to find my body.By the time I crested the top of the volcano, a moonscape of ash and the charred remains of what must have once been grand alerces, three hours had passed. All of my photographic equipment failed at once. Chilly cloud cover had made my fingers numb. And I still had to hike down. A lone figure in a black hoodie emerged from the clouds, and we circled each other silently before I finally asked him if he spoke Spanish or English. He broke into a huge grin: English. His name was Manuel Knoche, a 33-year-old Berliner who had been traveling for six months. He, too, was a little lonely and ill-prepared: he had hitchhiked to the wrong volcano, had walked two hours on the highway to get to this one, and had no idea how he was going to get back. I had a car, I told him. If he was willing to walk at my slow pace, I\u2019d be happy to give him a lift. He said sure. The clouds cleared for a minute, revealing a barren red-dirt mountaintop. Then they came back, bringing hail. \u201cI was a journalist, he was a German punk rock drummer. We met in a hailstorm on a volcano in Chile,\u201d is a pretty good start to a rom com, though. THE WAY STATION THAT BECAME A HOMEOur travel styles were certainly different, but I admired his ability to wake up every morning with a sunny attitude, and an openness to what the day might bring him. One day, he went for a walk and brought back a friend, Lukas Lencak from Slovakia, whom Mr. Knoche had met earlier when they were both backpacking in Argentina. Mr. Lencak was a 31-year-old service engineer who\u2019d quit his job to travel. PRACTICAL TIPSNot a hiker? Sendero de Alerce in Parque Pumal\u00edn is an a short, flat walk through an amazing alerce grove. Afterward, head to Termas de Amarillo, a set of swimming-pool-like hot springs set in the rain forest south of Chait\u00e9n. The road is, of course, impossible to find. Going while it\u2019s raining is double the fun. Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Denver, Colo. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Abortion Vote Nears, Irish Fashion Designers Choose a Side", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo weeks before a historic referendum, the style set make a statement in Dublin \u2014 and not just of the fashion kind. Dublin is not a city known for its fashion extravaganzas. But last Thursday, inside the vaulted atrium of the upmarket Powerscourt Centre shopping arcade, models took to the catwalk clad in one-off couture creations by a dozen of Ireland\u2019s best known designers. One model wore a knit navy sweater with neon yellow trim, covered in prints based on the number 8, by Pearl Reddington. Another wore a trilby hat by the milliner Margaret O\u2019Connor; it was bedecked with colored sequins and black ribbons emblazoned with the word \u201cRepeal.\u201d A third woman modeled a black shift dress with puffed sleeves, finished with chiffon ruffles and a large scarlet heart, by Natalie B. Coleman.It was a visual statement, but not solely of the fashion kind.Titled \u201cFashion Is Repealing,\u201d the event had been organized by abortion rights advocates, two weeks before a vote on Ireland\u2019s strict abortion laws, with every garment then offered for sale to benefit the Together for Yes campaign.On May 25, voters will be asked if they want to repeal Article 40.3.3 (known as the Eighth Amendment), which since 1983 has effectively enshrined a ban on abortion in the Irish constitution. \u201cThe abortion issue is primarily a women\u2019s issue, and until recently I noticed a lot of women\u2019s media here hadn\u2019t really broached the topic,\u201d said Andrea Horan, a Dublin-based nail bar owner. \u201cSo making Irish fashion a focus of our campaign was partly a bid to draw that media spotlight in on us, and get more voices heard.\u201dMs. Horan was the driving force behind the \u201cRepeal\u201d show and is the founder of the women\u2019s rights discussion platform Hunreal Issues, which she describes as \u201cthrowing glitter on issues without minimizing them.\u201d\u201cA lot of the time, political conversations can be academic, highbrow and exclusive. And fashion can act as a great leveler in terms of welcoming a bigger audience who may not be politically minded,\u201d Ms. Horan said. \u201cThis abortion vote is going to be the most important we\u2019ve ever had in this country. It was great to see so many Irish designers felt they had something to say about it.\u201dMs. O\u2019Connor, the milliner, who lived in Britain for eight years before moving back to County Clare in western Ireland in 2017, said: \u201cI can look back at this and see that I spoke out, created some art and at least did something. I\u2019d hate to look back 20 years from now and think I was one of the people in the corner who said nothing because it felt safer.\u201dThat the established fashion community, predominantly populated by left-leaning social liberals in Ireland as it is in many countries, overwhelmingly landed on the side of abortion rights is not surprising to many observers. (In the United States, the Council of Fashion Designers of America has supported Planned Parenthood, handing out pink pins during one fashion week.)\u201cWearing what you believe is more apparent with this debate in Ireland than ever before,\u201d said Deirdre McQuillan, the fashion editor of the Irish Times newspaper. \u201cOne of the most powerful symbols of the entire pro-choice movement has been the Repeal Project sweatshirts, which you now see out on the streets at the moment almost every day.\u201dBlack with the word \u201cRepeal\u201d stamped in a slogan-like graphic across the front, these sweatshirts were the brainchild of the activist Anna Cosgrave. She founded the Repeal Project after attending a vigil for Savita Halappanavar, an Indian-born woman whose death in 2012, after her requests for an abortion were refused by a hospital in Galway, Ireland, prompted widespread outcry across the country. Similarly, an alliance called Abortion Rights Campaign has been selling popular T-shirts printed with \u201cFree Safe Legal.\u201d And Repealist, a brand that specializes in clothing and housewares, has created a dress that reads, \u201cOur Bodies Our Choice,\u201d with a print of an upside-down hanger, emblazoned with \u201cHanging in the Balance.\u201d\u201cAt one level they are just garments,\u201d Ms. Cosgrave said. \u201cBut now they are also a rallying cry.\u201dIt\u2019s a call that has been heard by several young Irish fashion designers living and working across the sea in Britain. More than 4,000 Irish women leave home for England every year to get an abortion, according to data from Marie Stopes, an organization that provides sexual and reproductive health care.\u201cComing from a working-class background and being brought up by strong women, the debate around abortion is one I\u2019ve been having for as long as I can remember. At root, it\u2019s not just a women\u2019s rights issue, it is a human rights issue,\u201d said Mr. Malone, who has been back and forth between London and Ireland in recent months to canvass for the Yes campaign. \u201cMy work is all about what it means to be a woman and making statements about femininity. This issue, for me, is impossible to ignore.\u201dFor Mr. Malone, luxury meant an unfettered freedom of expression: He drew hearts and slogans in red across the glass panes, and had organized a number of speakers to read from Una Mullally\u2019s \u201cRepeal the 8th\u201d book, along with dancers and music as part of his installation in the window. The store\u2019s management was not amused.\u201cSelfridges is a politically neutral safe space for everyone, and it\u2019s regrettable that a platform for celebrated creative talent was commandeered in this manner,\u201d a Selfridges spokesman said in a statement after the event.Still, Mr. Malone remained unrepentant. \u201cIt was disappointing, but sometimes as a designer there are more important things than working with stores \u2014 you have to stay true to your voice,\u201d he said. \u201cFashion is so concerned with image making, or faux politics for an Instagram post, which means nothing. You have to physically get out there and do it. All I can do now is raise awareness and use my platform within fashion and beyond. Ours is a battle that hasn\u2019t been won yet.\u201dPaul McLauchlan contributed reporting from Cork.Advertisement"}

In other cases, you may need to manually create a backup file from that app\u2019s settings. Then you can plug your phone into your computer, drag those backup files onto your desktop (I\u2019d also drag your photos over, just in case) and store them safely for your next phone. If you aren\u2019t sure if you have everything, it might be a good idea to buy your new phone before selling the old one, so you can make sure you have what you need before wiping.Once you\u2019re sure you have everything backed up, you\u2019re ready to erase that data from your device.

The device just marks that space \u201cfree\u201d to overwrite with other data. But anyone with easy-to-obtain recovery software can view recently deleted files, which means your personal information is at risk.The encryption process may take a few hours, but once it\u2019s finished, you can now proceed to erase your phone.

{"Headline": "Ireland, Enthusiastic About Gay Rights, Frets Over Abortion", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARRIGTWOHILL, Ireland \u2014 When it comes to the Roman Catholic Church, Judy Donnelly has been something of a rebel over the years. Like much of Ireland, she supported contraception, voted in a referendum to legalize divorce and, three years ago, backed same-sex marriage.That last vote was joyously celebrated around the country and the world, placing Ireland, which elected its first gay prime minister last year, at the vanguard of what many called a social revolution.But when it comes to the historic decision on legalizing abortion, which will be put to the nation on Friday, Ms. Donnelly says she will vote no, as will enough of her countrymen and women, including lawmakers across the political divide, to throw the referendum result into doubt. Polls for the May 25 vote have narrowed so tightly in recent weeks that \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d campaigners are not able to confidently predict a victory.\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same,\u201d said Ms. Donnelly, 46, who works in a pub in Carrigtwohill. \u201cIt\u2019s about values and morals.\u201dEven if Ireland is becoming more culturally liberal in many respects, opposition to abortion is deeply ingrained, as many people are still strongly against it on moral grounds. To some, abortion amounts to murder rather than being about liberal cultural values.Advocates of abortion rights cite several reasons for why attitudes have not changed: a history of female oppression; the church\u2019s continuing grip over sexual education; and very private experiences around miscarriages, fetal deformities, adoption difficulties and spousal disagreements over whether to keep a baby.At the same time, many Irish say, sex and sexual health remain somewhat taboo subjects. Often, the negative consequences of sexual activity, including infections or unplanned pregnancies, are seen through a moral lens rather than as health issues.The Catholic Church opposes abortion, and some Mass-goers here said priests had told their congregations that they would not be able to receive Communion if they voted yes in the referendum.Ironically, it was a gay prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who called for this referendum that will essentially ask voters to repeal a 1983 amendment to the Constitution that gives a fetus the same right to life as the mother and allow unrestricted terminations of pregnancies for up to 12 weeks.\u201cI know I come across as a hypocrite,\u201d said Darren Haddock, 48, a cabdriver who initially planned to vote in favor of abortion because he saw it as a woman\u2019s right. But now, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about hurting a life.\u201dThe referendum on gay marriage was different, he said. \u201cThe time was right for Ireland to come out of the Dark Ages, to break the shackles from the church, and it was a victory for people to stand up to it,\u201d he said.Ms. Donnelly, who recently divorced, voted in favor of same-sex marriage because her sister-in-law was part of the first gay couple to get married in England. Another cousin is gay, and recently got married, too.When it came to abortion, she reflected on some of her other relatives who had miscarriages, having wanted children badly. \u201cAnd then you have people who cross over to England to get an abortion,\u201d she said, although she said there were some exceptions, as in the cases of rape or incest. \u201cBut just because you made a boo-boo doesn\u2019t mean you get an abortion.\u201dStill, she voted in three previous referendums allowing women to have abortions if their lives were in danger, to travel abroad for the procedure and to have access to information about it. The legalization of abortion, she said, would \u201cmake it easier for people to say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just go and rid of it.\u2019\u201dMs. Donnelly spoke as an older woman slowly pushed a baby carriage up the street, carrying two baby dolls under plastic wrapping to protect against a cold drizzle. Mr. Haddock recalled seeing the woman nearly four decades ago, when he was a child. She had had several miscarriages, he explained, and hadn\u2019t stopped pushing the carriage ever since.\u201cMisogyny is much more embedded in Irish life than homophobia,\u201d she said. \u201cIreland has a terrible history of oppressing women, and the legacy of the Catholic Church is control,\u201d she added, referring to the thousands of unmarried women who became pregnant and were placed into servitude or mental asylums since the 18th century until as recent as the mid-1990s.Even when the country in 1985 legalized condoms to be sold without prescriptions, she said, it was to deal with the AIDS epidemic, rather than to give women their reproductive rights. \u201cWomen\u2019s autonomy has always been viewed with suspicion or through a lens that is very bizarre,\u201d she said.In Cork, Ireland\u2019s second-biggest city, placards for opposing campaigns were attached to almost every street lamp, but the mood was subdued. Most people interviewed for this article didn\u2019t want their names published; many of them hadn\u2019t even spoken about the subject with their friends, let alone their families.\u201cOh God, no,\u201d exclaimed a 24-year-old barista named Maedhbh who worked in a coffee shop and wore a nose ring and a bright yellow sweatshirt with the words \u201cBitter Lemon\u201d printed on it.\u201cMy grandparents don\u2019t want to engage in it,\u201d she said, just as her grandfather Paddy walked in. When asked about the referendum, he stopped in his tracks and pretended to be hard of hearing. \u201cYou could be shot for giving an answer,\u201d a customer standing nearby said smirking, before rushing out the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Irish: \u2018Whatever you say, say nothing.\u2019 \u201dWhile the church\u2019s influence has fallen drastically in most spheres of Irish life, its hold on sexual education remains strong \u2014 the institution still controls most schools in the country.Even young, internet-savvy Irish in their early 20s spoke about receiving more of a lesson in biology, and a cursory one at that, than instructions about sexual health and safety.\u201cWhen we were 16 we had two lads, monks, come in to talk about abstinence, and that one in 10 people get pregnant and that you can still get STDs from wearing condoms,\u201d said Ben Collins, a 22-year-old college student, who plans to vote to legalize abortion. \u201cIt was basically fear. The Catholic influence is so big here, but you don\u2019t even realize it.\u201dDeirdre Allinen, 32, recalled sitting in a classroom and having nuns wheel in a television before being shown a grisly video about abortion. \u201cThen we\u2019d say the rosary and stand around praying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way it\u2019s taught to us, it\u2019s still in me. The curriculum is still hidden in our brains. It took me a long time to shake it off.\u201d\u201cA lot of these issues around sexual health and reproductive rights all stem from a lack of information and shame,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest element \u2014 what we do with our bodies and with other people carries shame.\u201d\u201cWe see ourselves as global, checking in at airports, L.G.B.T., Eurovision,\u201d he said, and Ireland as a mecca for tech giants like Google, Facebook and Apple. \u201cBut this crushing theocratic doctrine put on Irish society has permeated right to the core,\u201d he added, \u201ceven to the person who doesn\u2019t go to church: that sex is seen as a sin. It\u2019s in our DNA.\u201dThe dearth of a proper national conversation is part of the reason Ireland is seeing a surge in sexually transmitted diseases, Mr. St Leger said, with 15- to 24-year-olds, for example, making up half of Ireland\u2019s number of reported annual chlamydia infections.The nation is also in the throes of an H.I.V. crisis, he added, pointing to opinion polls that show one-quarter of respondents are not properly informed about the virus. At least a quarter of respondents still believe they can catch it by kissing or sitting on a toilet seat. And for all the excitement around the vote on same-sex marriage, Mr. St Leger pointed out, the government has since 2009 cut the budget in half for Gay Men\u2019s Health Service, which provides H.I.V. testing, screenings and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, and outreach.The same-sex marriage vote was \u201call about love and relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about sexual health.\u201dStill, sexual education has improved from Ms. Donnelly\u2019s time, when nuns taught her class: \u201cIf a lad sat on your lap, you\u2019d put a newspaper on your lap. That was the contraception of the day.\u201dIn recent years, Ireland has seen some of the biggest turnarounds in public opinion in the Western world. In 1992, for example, when homosexuality was still considered a crime in the country, participants in a gay pride parade in Cork wore masks so as not to embarrass relatives. In 2018, Ireland has a gay prime minister, same-sex marriage is allowed and some of the world\u2019s most progressive bills concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are being put forward in Parliament.For many voters, the referendum over abortion is, ultimately, a deeply private choice.In 2015, after the same-sex marriage vote, \u201cit was like Glastonbury; it was party central,\u201d recalled Mr. Haddock. But this week, he said, \u201cno matter who wins or loses, there\u2019s not going to be a party.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An American Alternative to Europe\u2019s Privacy Law", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in telecommunications.Imagine that you\u2019ve been struggling with a serious and fairly embarrassing personal problem. Putting aside a longstanding reluctance to address it, you finally consult a therapist. The therapist is friendly and welcoming and promises to protect your privacy. Gaining a sense of trust, you bare your soul, describing the issue you are struggling with in all of its painful detail.Only later do you realize, to your horror, that your confessions were being recorded and retained by the therapist. It turns out that your therapist, to supplement his income, has gotten into the advertising business: He takes data gleaned from his patients and offers it to advertisers (or any other interested party) for a fee.Everyone would be outraged by this; it is professionally unethical and a serious breach of trust. Yet what I\u2019ve described is not so different from our relationship with businesses like Google, Facebook, Quora and Amazon. They hold themselves out as trustworthy, enticing us to share our information with them \u2014 from the banal details of our lives to our most intimate secrets \u2014 without making it very clear that everything is being recorded, kept and used for advertising.The Europeans find this kind of thing distasteful, which is why last Friday they instituted a strict online privacy law \u2014 the General Data Protection Regulation. The law\u2019s approach is, for want of a better word, European: broad, rule-driven and administered by regulators. Under the G.D.P.R., any company that gathers or processes personal data is defined as a \u201cdata controller\u201d and is subject to a raft of new rights and duties that are enforced by Europe\u2019s member states.For all these reasons, the United States may need to try something different and more American: namely, to rely on judges and state law to establish that the legal concept of \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d can apply to technology companies.To understand what fiduciary duties are, return to the example of the unfaithful therapist. Given that he used a position of trust and expertise to gain sensitive information from you, medical ethics and the law hold that he has a special obligation to be loyal and careful with your data. He is a fiduciary. (The word derives from the Latin for \u201ctrust.\u201d) The idea of a fiduciary duty is intuitive and familiar to American law: Your lawyer, your doctor, your therapist and your accountant are all fiduciaries.So why not your search engine, your digital assistant and your social media platform? These entities present themselves as trustworthy, have a special expertise and usually require you to reveal information about yourself to be useful. As Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, himself put it: \u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your data.\u201d These companies should be considered, to borrow a term coined by the law professor Jack Balkin, \u201cinformation fiduciaries\u201d \u2014 or perhaps \u201cdata fiduciaries.\u201dHow would this work in practice? Once these fiduciary duties were established by state legislation or a court ruling, questions about the breach of such duties would be addressed case by case, by courts and judges, in the American common-law manner. Instead of asking what responsibilities all \u201cdata controllers\u201d have, as the Europeans must now do, courts in the United States could ask more specific questions.For example: Did Equifax, the credit reporting agency, fail to adequately protect user data? (Obviously.) Should a firm like Quora, the question-and-answer website, require that users \u201copt in\u201d before allowing other people to find out what you are asking about? (Almost certainly.) Should Alexa, Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, require users to \u201copt in\u201d before it listens to their conversations? (It depends on how it would be carried out.)A defining fact of our existence today is that we share more of ourselves with Silicon Valley than with our accountants, lawyers and doctors. It is about time the law caught up with that.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Entire Economy Is MoviePass Now. Enjoy It While You Can.", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIt\u2019s called the 75 Cent Dollar Store. We\u2019re going to sell dollar bills for 75 cents \u2014 no service charges, no hidden fees, just crisp $1 bills for the price of three quarters. It\u2019ll be huge.You\u2019re probably thinking: Wait, won\u2019t your store go out of business? Nope. I\u2019ve got that part figured out, too. The plan is to get tons of people addicted to buying 75-cent dollars so that, in a year or two, we can jack up the price to $1.50 or $2 without losing any customers. Or maybe we\u2019ll get so big that the Treasury Department will start selling us dollar bills at a discount. We could also collect data about our customers and sell it to the highest bidder. Honestly, we\u2019ve got plenty of options.If you\u2019re still skeptical, I don\u2019t blame you. It used to be that in order to survive, businesses had to sell goods or services above cost. But that model is so 20th century. The new way to make it in business is to spend big, grow fast and use Kilimanjaro-size piles of investor cash to subsidize your losses, with a plan to become profitable somewhere down the road.\u201cThe fact that Google and Facebook were able to generate such enormous profits and growth does give hope to some companies,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. If start-ups can figure out to convert a large user base into paying customers, he added, \u201cit can be enormously profitable.\u201dBut investors aren\u2019t convinced. Shares of MoviePass\u2019s parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, have fallen more than 90 percent since October, and the company recently reported that it has been burning through its cash reserves, spending an average of $21.7 million per month with just $15.5 million left in the bank at the end of April. On Tuesday, Helios reported that MoviePass lost $98.3 million in the first quarter, despite adding more than a million net subscribers.Mitch Lowe, the chief executive of MoviePass, told me in a phone interview this week that the company\u2019s financial troubles have been exaggerated. The company has access to a $300 million equity line of credit that will keep it solvent, he said, and blamed the company\u2019s competitors, such as large theater chains, for sowing the seeds of doubt.\u201cThey smell blood in the water, so they\u2019re spreading rumors and hypotheses,\u201d he said.Ultimately, companies like MoviePass illustrate the perilous tightrope many growing businesses must walk. Spend too little on acquiring new customers and drawing business away from your competitors, and you won\u2019t make it off the ground. Give too many freebies away, and you risk running out of cash before you\u2019re big enough to cash in.\u201cPricing can be strategic,\u201d said Kara Nortman, a partner at Upfront Ventures, which invests in technology companies. \u201cIf you can attract a lot of consumers to your product or service, it gives you a lot more power with incumbents who are limiting your growth.\u201dThe king of money-losers, of course, is Amazon, which went years without turning a profit. Instead, it plowed billions of dollars back into its business, building out its e-commerce infrastructure and jump-starting side efforts like Amazon Web Services and Amazon Prime Video. Those years of investments paid off, and Amazon is now the second most valuable company in the world, with $1.6 billion in profit last quarter alone.An economy full of unprofitable companies has risks, of course. Along with the danger of investor wipeouts \u2014 which are unavoidable in early stage investing \u2014 customers of these companies have come to expect a kind of whiplash that can involve sudden price hikes, disappearing benefits, and useless subscriptions and meaningless warranties. It\u2019s also difficult for small businesses without access to huge amounts of capital to compete with the Googles and Amazons of the world, which further distorts economic growth in favor of corporations that can afford to spend billions of dollars undercutting the competition.For consumers who are willing to do their research, though, this can be a golden age of deals. We can get our \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d tickets and pecan-crusted salmon meal kits, reaping the benefits of artificially cheap goods and services while investors soak up the losses. The current crop of money-losing companies may not survive forever, but as long as someone is willing to keep funding these types of gambles, there\u2019s no reason to stop enjoying the fruits of their optimism.So, back to the 75 Cent Dollar Store.

Certain products she\u2019d been told to buy were utterly useless; a specific breastfeeding pillow she\u2019d found to be a godsend.This is how the first six months of my own pregnancy have gone so far: I\u2019ve been the recipient of 10-paragraph emails, Google spreadsheets, filled-up Amazon carts, group texts \u2014 all themed around babies and the mental and physical tools required to prepare for them. As more friends have kids, this stream of information gets steadily replaced by reports from the other side: women who have made it through the gantlet and reported back.This information exchange has left me both enormously grateful and utterly panicked. I feel as though I\u2019m back in school, cramming for a final \u2014 only to learn that the one chapter I haven\u2019t studied is the focus of the test. In all of this, I\u2019ve learned only one thing to be universally true: For all the Google docs you share, baby books you buy and delivery plans you make, childbirth is an experience for which you will never be truly prepared.When O\u2019Connell, a writer living in Brooklyn, learns she is pregnant, she instinctively wants a child but, given the circumstances of her life and work, feels unready. After a long discussion with her boyfriend, Dustin, that begins as they\u2019re picking up their weekly farm share and continues into the night, the couple finally, definitively decides to keep the baby.The author quickly learns the difference between pregnancy and the way it is performed for the world. \u201cThere should be Polaroids our son finds in a shoe box 30 years from now and feels sentimental about,\u201d she writes. \u201cI want this baby to think his mom was radiant, effortlessly so, hugging her massive, miraculous body in floral prints. I want him to post them to the 2045 version of Instagram. I want his friends to leave comments about my fashion sense.\u201dMuch of her pregnancy is spent planning for a natural birth until the particularly harrowing scene in which she receives an epidural and then an emergency cesarean section. Once her baby is born, when friends come to visit, she envisions herself as \u201cthe matriarch welcoming everyone in with French-press coffee and banana bread that I had somehow baked during early labor,\u201d even though in reality she is bleary-eyed and rattled from the surgery. Eventually, after conquering her constant fear of SIDS, she gets the hang of it \u2014 and finds in motherhood an unexpected peace.Isabel Wilkinson is the digital director at T Magazine.Advertisement"}

He added that \u201cthe quality of the glasses is getting so much intensely better\u201d over the three years he has been experimenting with virtual reality.\u201cYou can put your hand in the rain and swish the drops around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a challenge to give it an ephemeral quality, but I am very excited about the result.\u201dIn April, Acute Art\u2019s VR Museum introduced a subscription program to experience works by Mr. Eliasson and the performance artist Marina Abramovic while distributing the output of five other artists free of charge for nonsubscribers.The website works with three brands of virtual-reality headsets.While a painting is acquired through a single sale payment, Mr. Klaris said, virtual-reality works may demand a monetization plan more along the lines of the film industry. An artist who creates such a work \u201cmight be paid every time it is sold or distributed,\u201d he said.Khora Contemporary was founded, however, with the main objective of helping established and young artists translate their work into the realm of virtual reality. The company was inaugurated at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale with commissioned works by Paul McCarthy and Christian Lemmerz.Ms. Nedvetskaia cited a \u201ctriangular\u201d business model involving the artist, production company and gallery. The structure varies on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d Khora Contemporary is also in talks with film festivals on both sides of the Atlantic. Down the line, Ms. Nedvetskaia envisions creating pay-per-view versions of artwork online.She pointed to virtual reality as a new frontier for artists at a time when all other forms and genres have been explored. \u201cThere is little today which is brand new,\u201d she said.But the collector base is just developing. \u201cIt is too early to talk about at this point,\u201d she said of \u201ca very nascent market\u201d while mentioning sales in Asia and the interest of private museums and collections.The Salon Berlin of the Museum Frieder Burda \u2014 a private collection in Baden-Baden, Germany \u2014 is displaying its first virtual-reality component with \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d by the Ukranian artist Nikita Shalenny.The salon\u2019s curator, Patricia Kamp, pointed to the irony that, in an exhibition exploring the alienation from nature in modern society, virtual reality represents a crucial means of harnessing younger visitors.\u201cWhen art doesn\u2019t move people emotionally, it has no purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next generation only grows up with screens. They have a totally different point of access.\u201d\u201cThe Bridge\u201d is juxtaposed with both modern and contemporary paintings in an effort to create dialogue between the different mediums. Ms. Nedvetskaia also mentioned the possibility of exhibiting virtual-reality works alongside the physical material on which they were based, such as Shalenny\u2019s watercolors or video directed by Mr. McCarthy.\u201cIt makes it more believable,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt gives people the confidence that it can be taken seriously as a real art form.\u201dAs Glenn D.

Can you attend? How much will it cost? What name will be on Meghan Markle's driver's license? And dozens of your other really important royal wedding questions answered.I\u2019d soon come to learn how such ceremonies functioned to maintain the love of the monarchy in even black nations that demanded independence from the Crown. But at the time \u2014 unaware that a few miles away, college students from the University of the West Indies protested her arrival \u2014 I was mesmerized by my cultural pride for my father\u2019s country and excitement for the Queen.Today, as my Google alerts feed me all things Meghan Markle, I struggle even more with conflicting feelings of ambivalence and awe.Just this past Sunday, the Lifetime television movie \u201cHarry & Meghan: A Royal Romance\u201d portrayed this sentiment when the fictional Meghan (Parisa Fitz-Henley) decides to forsake her acting career to fulfill an even larger obligation of being a racial symbol. After a young black Canadian girl asks for her autograph, the girl\u2019s uncle proclaims: \u201cFor a little girl like her, someone like you marrying into the royal family, that\u2019s huge. This is going to change the way people see the world.\u201dAnd while I, too, am moved by the transformative potential of this marriage, I am also skeptical. Imbuing Ms. Markle\u2019s racial biography with so much redemptive potential \u2014 much like we did with President Barack Obama \u2014 ignores the xenophobia and structures of racial inequality upon which Brexit, and by extension insular notions of British identity that the monarchy symbolizes, thrives.Ms. Markle\u2019s desegregation of the royal family gives us a unique opportunity to examine the contributions and experiences of black people on both sides of the Atlantic. But instead, the new multiracial veneer she gives the monarchy has been portrayed in wedding coverage as not simply modernizing, but inevitable, while Britain\u2019s troubled racial past and present is glossed over.Such stories prepare us for seeing Meghan and Harry\u2019s nuptials as a completion of a circle in which multiracial identity is not only embraced, but in fact encoded in the DNA of the royal family of which Ms. Markle is now both an extension and its most recent member.Which is why I\u2019ll be watching the wedding on Saturday with wonder, and a bit of worry.Will Ms. Markle ultimately end up as a truly transformative figure or, like Queen Charlotte (if you believe the theories), a curious historical blip? Who knows? I just hope it doesn\u2019t take another 257 years until the monarchy, and more important, England and Ms. Markle\u2019s home country, the United States, can celebrate the full racial integration of all its citizens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran, Like Russia Before It, Tries to Block Telegram App", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Iran blocked Telegram, the most popular messaging app in the country, on Tuesday, claiming the service used by 40 million Iranians endangers national security.It was just the latest in a series of moves by the Iranian authorities to limit use of the app, part of a tug of war between hard-liners and President Hassan Rouhani, who has long campaigned for more freedom on social media.The hard-liners complain that Telegram poses dangers because Iran\u2019s censors have no control over it. In a statement posted on the news website Mizan, which is associated with the country\u2019s conservative judiciary, a prosecutor accused Telegram of supporting terrorists and other hostile groups.The minister of information and communication technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, at 35 the youngest member of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s cabinet, said on Twitter that trying to stop technology was pointless.There have since been reports, so far unverified, that Mr. Azari Jahromi has resigned.On Tuesday, some users of Telegram in Iran said they were still able to communicate through the app over their home internet connections. In the confusion, several websites that are usually freely accessible \u2014 including Wikipedia and Google \u2014 were hard to reach.In Iran, the battle over the app has become something of a litmus test for Mr. Rouhani, whose popularity has dropped significantly since his re-election in May last year. During his campaign, he promised to deliver more freedoms, to provide greater employment opportunities and to get the country\u2019s notorious morality police off the streets. He has largely fallen short of those goals.Telegram is widely used in Iran, for activities as varied as chatting, booking appointments at beauty salons, selling cars or finding partners. Even the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had his own channel until recently. Such channels, which sometimes draw hundreds of thousands of users who receive instant messages at the push of a button, played a major role in spreading videos of nationwide protests in December.On Monday, Iran\u2019s judiciary issued a decree ordering internet service providers to block access to the Telegram app, as they have already been doing for years for Facebook and Twitter.In recent weeks, government institutions had already begun taking down their Telegram channels, urging people to switch to Iranian applications such as Soroush. But many Iranians chose not to follow the guidance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for Google", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fei-Fei Li is among the brightest stars in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, somehow managing to hold down two demanding jobs simultaneously: head of Stanford University\u2019s A.I. lab and chief scientist for A.I. at Google Cloud, one of the search giant\u2019s most promising enterprises.Yet last September, when nervous company officials discussed how to speak publicly about Google\u2019s first major A.I. contract with the Pentagon, Dr. Li strongly advised shunning those two potent letters.\u201cAvoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,\u201d she wrote in an email to colleagues reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWeaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI \u2014 if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.\u201dDr. Li\u2019s concern about the implications of military contracts for Google has proved prescient. The company\u2019s relationship with the Defense Department since it won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, has touched off an existential crisis, according to emails and documents reviewed by The Times as well as interviews with about a dozen current and former Google employees.It has fractured Google\u2019s work force, fueled heated staff meetings and internal exchanges, and prompted some employees to resign. The dispute has caused grief for some senior Google officials, including Dr. Li, as they try to straddle the gap between scientists with deep moral objections and salespeople salivating over defense contracts.The advertising model behind Google\u2019s spectacular growth has provoked criticism that it invades web users\u2019 privacy and supports dubious websites, including those peddling false news. Now the company\u2019s path to future growth, via cloud-computing services, has divided the company over its stand on weaponry. To proceed with big defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; to reject such work would deprive it of a potentially huge business.Executives at DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer based in London that Google acquired in 2014, have said they are completely opposed to military and surveillance work, and employees at the lab have protested the contract. The acquisition agreement between the two companies said DeepMind technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes.Those emails and other internal documents, shared by an employee who opposes Pentagon contracts, show that at least some Google executives anticipated the dissent and negative publicity. But other employees, noting that rivals like Microsoft and Amazon were enthusiastically pursuing lucrative Pentagon work, concluded that such projects were crucial to the company\u2019s growth and nothing to be ashamed of.Many tech companies have sought military business without roiling their work forces. But Google\u2019s roots and self-image are different.\u201cWe have kind of a mantra of \u2018don\u2019t be evil,\u2019 which is to do the best things that we know how for our users, for our customers and for everyone,\u201d Larry Page told Peter Jennings in 2004, when ABC News named Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, \u201cPeople of the Year.\u201dThe clash inside Google was sparked by the possibility that the Maven work might be used for lethal drone targeting. And the discussion is made more urgent by the fact that artificial intelligence, one of Google\u2019s strengths, is expected to play an increasingly central role in warfare.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, made a much-publicized visit to Google in August \u2014 shortly after stopping in at Amazon \u2014 and called for closer cooperation with tech companies.\u201cI see many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry,\u201d he said.A number of colleagues weighed in, but generally they deferred to Dr. Li, who was born in China, immigrated to New Jersey with her parents as a 16-year-old who spoke no English and has climbed to the top of the tech world.Dr. Li said in the email that the final decision would be made by her boss, Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google Cloud. But Dr. Li thought the company should publicize its share of the Maven contract as \u201ca big win for GCP,\u201d Google Cloud Platform.\u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,\u201d she wrote in the email.Asked about her September email, Dr. Li issued a statement: \u201cI believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI.\u201dAs it turned out, the company did not publicize Maven. The company\u2019s work as a subcontractor came to public attention only when employees opposed to it began protesting on Google\u2019s robust internal communications platforms.The company promised employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the ethical minefield of defense and intelligence contracting. Google told The Times on Tuesday that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice.At a companywide meeting last Thursday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Google wanted to come up with guidelines that \u201cstood the test of time,\u201d employees said. Employees say they expect the principles to be announced inside Google in the next few weeks.The polarized debate about Google and the military may leave out some nuances. Better analysis of drone imagery could reduce civilian casualties by improving operators\u2019 ability to find and recognize terrorists. The Defense Department will hardly abandon its advance into artificial intelligence if Google bows out. And military experts say China and other developed countries are already investing heavily in A.I. for defense.But skilled technologists who chose Google for its embrace of benign and altruistic goals are appalled that their employer could eventually be associated with more efficient ways to kill.Google\u2019s unusual culture is reflected in its company message boards and internal social media platforms, which encourage employees to speak out on everything from Google\u2019s cafeteria food to its diversity initiatives. But even within this free-expression workplace, longtime employees said, the Maven project has roiled Google beyond anything in recent memory.When news of the deal leaked out internally, Ms. Greene spoke at the weekly companywide T.G.I.F. meeting. She explained that the system was not for lethal purposes and that it was a relatively small deal worth \u201conly\u201d $9 million, according to two people familiar with the meeting.That did little to tamp down the anger, and Google, according to the invitation email, decided to hold a discussion on April 11 representing a \u201cspectrum of viewpoints\u201d involving Ms. Greene; Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who is a leader in the anti-Maven movement; and Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who is considered one of the fathers of the internet for his pioneering technology work at the Defense Department.Because there was so much interest, the group debated the topic three times over one day for Google employees watching on video in different regions around the world.According to employees who watched the discussion, Ms. Greene held firm that Maven was not using A.I. for offensive purposes, while Ms. Whittaker argued that it was hard to draw a line on how the technology would be used.Last Thursday, Mr. Brin, the company\u2019s co-founder, responded to a question at a companywide meeting about Google\u2019s work on Maven. According to two Google employees, Mr. Brin said he understood the controversy and had discussed the matter extensively with Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai. However, he said he thought that it was better for peace if the world\u2019s militaries were intertwined with international organizations like Google rather than working solely with nationalistic defense contractors.Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ many of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence researchers. Some researchers work inside an A.I. lab called Google Brain in Mountain View, Calif., and others are spread across separate groups, including the cloud computing business overseen by Ms. Greene, who is also an Alphabet board member.Many of these researchers have recently arrived from the world of academia, and some retain professorships. They include Geoff Hinton, a Briton who helps oversee the Brain lab in Toronto and has been open about his reluctance to work for the United States government. In the late 1980s, Mr. Hinton left the United States for Canada in part because he was reluctant to take funding from the Department of Defense.Jeff Dean, one of Google\u2019s longest-serving and most revered employees, who now oversees all A.I. work at the company, said at a conference for developers this month that he had signed a letter opposing the use of so-called machine learning for autonomous weapons, which would identify targets and fire without a human pulling the trigger.DeepMind, the London A.I. lab, is widely considered to be the most important collection of A.I. talent in the world. It now operates as a separate Alphabet company, though the lines between Google and DeepMind are blurred.DeepMind\u2019s founders have long warned about the dangers of A.I. systems. At least one of the lab\u2019s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, has been involved in policy discussions involving Project Maven with the Google leadership, including Mr. Pichai, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Certainly, any chance that Google could move quietly into defense work with no public attention is gone. Nor has Dr. Li\u2019s hope to keep A.I. out of the debate proved realistic.\u201cWe can steer the conversation about cloud,\u201d Aileen Black, a Google executive in Washington, cautioned Dr. Li in the September exchange, \u201cbut this is an AI specific award.\u201d She added, \u201cI think we need to get ahead of this before it gets framed for us.\u201dScott Shane reported from Washington, Cade Metz from London, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Fatal Uber Crash, a Self-Driving Start-Up Moves Forward", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRISCO, Tex. \u2014 On Monday, an orange and blue car with the words \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle\u201d prominently displayed on both sides drove itself through the streets of this rapidly growing city north of Dallas, navigating across four lanes of traffic and around a traffic circle.The car, operated by the Silicon Valley start-up Drive.ai, will eventually become part of a fleet of autonomous taxis that will ferry locals along a predetermined route between the Dallas Cowboys facility in Frisco and two other office, retail and apartment complexes.But Drive.ai\u2019s announcement that it will officially begin its taxi service in July showed that the industry is starting to get back on track.Tarin Ziyaee, until recently the chief technology officer of the self-driving start-up Voyage, said he hoped the Uber crash would push companies to openly discuss the powerful but still limited technologies inside their test cars.\u201cWe need to talk about the nitty-gritty \u2014 what these systems are really doing and where their weaknesses are,\u201d said Mr. Ziyaee, who also worked on autonomous systems at Apple. \u201cThese companies are putting secrecy over safety. That has to change. The public deserves to know how things work.\u201dMr. Ng said the Uber crash had not affected Drive.ai\u2019s rollout plans. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on the path forward,\u201d he said.Drive.ai was founded in 2015 by Mr. Ng\u2019s wife, Carol Reiley, a roboticist, and several students who worked in a Stanford University A.I. lab overseen by Mr. Ng. The start-up specializes in a rapidly progressing type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which allows systems to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data.Venture capital firms including New Enterprise Associates have since invested in the start-up. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Drive.ai has raised $77 million and has more than 100 employees.When Drive.ai\u2019s free, daytime-only service begins this summer, it will be open to 10,000 people who live or work in the area. The cars will travel along a few miles of road where the speed limit does not exceed 45 miles an hour, with passengers being picked up and dropped off at only a few specific locations.Backup drivers will be behind the wheel, taking control when needed. But as the program expands, Drive.ai plans on moving drivers into the passenger seat and out of the cars entirely by the end of the year.Because the cars are equipped with sensors that gather information about their surroundings by sending out pulses of light \u2014 as well as radar and an array of cameras \u2014 the cars could potentially operate at night as well. But the start-up decided to keep a tight rein on its service before gradually expanding the route and exposing the cars to new conditions. Drive.ai said it would suspend operations during a downpour and in the rare event of snow.There will still be situations where the cars are slow to make decisions on their own \u2014 in the face of extremely heavy traffic, for instance \u2014 but remote technicians employed by Drive.ai will send help to the cars over the internet. The cars will include connections to three separate cellular networks.Drive.ai said it was working closely with Frisco officials. The city of 175,000 can keep the company abreast of construction zones and other road changes, Mr. Ng said, and signs identifying the area where the cars will drive have been installed.Thomas Bamonte, a senior program manager for automated vehicles with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which handles planning for Dallas and surrounding areas, said such work would become increasingly important as the metropolitan area added roughly a million new people every 10 years.\u201cWe want to invest in new technology rather than the physical expansion of roadways,\u201d he said.Asked if the Uber crash gave him pause, he said state law allowed companies like Drive.ai to operate without interference from local governments. The companies, he said, must be cautious.Noah Marshall, a financial analyst with Jamba Juice, which is based in Frisco, said the new autonomous taxi service would be a \u201cgreat thing\u201d for the town. His office is along Drive.ai\u2019s route, and he said he hoped to try the service.Other Frisco residents were warier.\u201cThis might be a good idea, but there is so much traffic here, and Texans aren\u2019t very patient,\u201d said Mark Mulch, a local real estate agent. Referring to one Arizona city where self-driving cars are being tested, he added: \u201cScottsdale is laid back. But Dallas is too fast.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Princeton and the Padres to M.L.B. Headquarters", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExtra basesPitcher Chris Young became a vice president for the league, working under Joe Torre, within weeks of playing in the Padres\u2019 spring training camp.Chris Young could have been a Chihuahua in the Pacific Coast League. Instead, he became a vice president for Major League Baseball.When the San Diego Padres told Young in March that he would not make their opening day roster, they offered him a chance to pitch for the El Paso Chihuahuas, their Class AAA affiliate. Young could have tried to squeeze his way back to the majors for a 14th season. His stuff had felt crisp in spring training.\u201cI thought there was a little bit of juice still left in the lemon,\u201d he said by phone on Monday. \u201cBut at what expense?\u201dWhen life gave him lemons, Young came to baseball\u2019s aid. Unwanted by the Padres, he was eagerly welcomed by the commissioner\u2019s office. Major League Baseball hired Young this month as vice president for on-field operations, initiatives and strategy, and he works out of the league\u2019s Park Avenue office in Manhattan.\u201cWe were all blown away, everybody from the commissioner on down, with his demeanor, intelligence, composure and passion for the game,\u201d said Dan Halem, M.L.B.\u2019s deputy commissioner for baseball administration. \u201cWe all knew we had to hire him.\u201dYoung, who started on Monday, will assist the chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, and a senior vice president, Peter Woodfork, on issues related to discipline, rules, pace of play, umpires and special projects.Torre is a Hall of Fame manager, but he has not played a major league game in more than 40 years. Young, who turns 39 this month and holds a degree in politics from Princeton, brings a fresh perspective to the commissioner\u2019s office that it had lacked.\u201cAutomatically, Chris is going to be a very influential voice,\u201d Halem said, adding later: \u201cWe get a lot of our player input from the union, but it gives us a real benefit to have a player come right off the field to give ideas and perspectives we wouldn\u2019t think of. When he speaks on issues, everyone\u2019s going to be quiet and listen because he\u2019ll be the only one in the room, at least on our side, who played the game for the last 14 years.\u201dYoung \u2014 who pitched for five teams and won a World Series ring with the 2015 Kansas City Royals \u2014 has long been interested in a front office career. His father-in-law, Dick Patrick, is the president of the Washington Capitals, and a Princeton friend, the former N.H.L. right wing George Parros, is the head of that league\u2019s department of player safety.\u201cHe\u2019s had to levy suspensions,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s a tough job, and you\u2019re going to make some enemies, but you\u2019re trying to protect the integrity of the game and protect the way the game should be played.\u2019 He said he does it with the right intent, and that\u2019s the same plan I have.\u201dYoung has experience on the other side of discipline. In 2007, while pitching for San Diego, he was fined and suspended five games for throwing a punch at the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Derrek Lee, a hulking first baseman.\u201cThat was the heavyweight division, no doubt about it,\u201d said Young, who is 6 feet 10 inches. \u201cIn the heat of the moment, you say things, you do things, you misunderstand things \u2014 and certainly now that my kids are old enough to Google that, I regret it. But it\u2019s part of the game and it happens.\u201dWhile discipline will make more day-to-day news, the broad strokes of Young\u2019s job may be more important. Baseball wants to appeal to younger fans who expect action, yet fewer and fewer balls are being put into play. In his new position, which includes a spot on baseball\u2019s competition committee, Young can influence any potential changes to the game.\u201cThe main goal here is to make the game better than we found it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what excites me and motivates me.\u201dWhen the Seattle Mariners\u2019 Robinson Cano received an 80-game drug suspension on Tuesday, it felt as if a plaque had been removed from the Hall of Fame before it even got there. Cano has been one of the most productive second basemen in major league history, and he leads the majors in games, hits and doubles since 2009.Yet his chances for Cooperstown now look grim. While Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens have increased their vote totals in each of the last four writer elections \u2014 both have moved above 50 percent \u2014 their ties to performance-enhancing drugs came in the era before testing, meaning they never served a suspension for drugs. Superstars caught after penalties began, in 2004, have been treated differently.This spring, at the Mariners\u2019 complex in Peoria, Ariz., Cano spoke about his chances for the Hall of Fame. He has 2,417 hits, 305 homers and a .304 average in his 14-year career.\u201cI\u2019m focused more on having six more years left on the contract, and in those six years, I still want to be able to play second base,\u201d he said. \u201cI focus more on year by year. I mean, maybe in the next four years I might be sitting down and saying, \u2018You know what, maybe I have a chance now.\u2019 But I\u2019m still at, what, 2,200 or 2,300 hits? You\u2019ve still got to keep adding numbers. Gary Sheffield has 500 home runs, and he\u2019s not even in. So I don\u2019t know what it takes to make it to the Hall of Fame.\u201dIt would seem to make sense for teams to have the option of voiding the remainder of a player\u2019s contract after he violates the drug agreement. But while Cano will not be paid during his suspension, the rest of his 10-year, $240 million contract is guaranteed. He will have plenty of time to keep compiling numbers, but there\u2019s another benefit to the length of his contract.It runs through 2023, the year he turns 41. If he retires at the end of it, he would not appear on the ballot until December 2028. Voters need 10 years in the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America to be eligible to cast a ballot, so some who will judge Cano have not yet participated in the process. If they take a sympathetic view of him \u2014 and if existing voters\u2019 attitudes change \u2014 Cano could still have some hope, however bleak, of election.When he stepped into a minor league batter\u2019s box on May 1, Mark Reynolds learned a lesson in status. Except for a brief appearance a few years ago on a rehabilitation assignment, Reynolds had taken more than 5,000 major league plate appearances since his last stint as a farmhand. But now he was playing for the Syracuse Sky Chiefs, the Class AAA affiliate of the Washington Nationals, after failing to land a job despite hitting 30 home runs for the Colorado Rockies last season.The game was in Allentown, Pa. \u2014 home of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs \u2014 and Reynolds had gone there from extended spring training in Florida, taking his equipment with him. That meant he was using a helmet with only one earflap (the one facing the pitcher), as nearly every major leaguer does. This prompted a question from the umpire: \u201cAre you on a big-league rehab?\u201dReynolds lied and said yes, but he soon switched to the helmet all non-rehabbing minor leaguers must wear: the bulkier, two-flap helmet that seems as awkward to a major leaguer as a football with white stripes would seem to an N.F.L. quarterback.\u201cI figured I\u2019d earned the right to at least use my helmet, but they made a big deal of it, so when we got back home, I got a new helmet,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble.\u201dYou might think that the money, the travel accommodations or the prestige would be the best part of playing in the majors. But, Reynolds said \u2014 jokingly, we think \u2014 you would be wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s the best part of getting to the big leagues: You get the single-flap, nonspace helmet like they wear down there,\u201d he said, smiling.Reynolds, 34, slammed two home runs in his Nationals debut last Sunday in Arizona, helping his new team \u2014 his eighth in the majors \u2014 to a victory. As for his difficulty finding a team, Reynolds figures the rest of the league simply caught up with his approach: Swing hard for home runs and live with the strikeouts. He is the active leader in strikeouts, with more than 1,800, and he set the single-season record with 223 in 2009.\u201cI was kind of the O.G. of striking out,\u201d he said, meaning original gangster. \u201cMe and Adam Dunn were the trendsetters back in the day. Maybe that\u2019s why I was out of the game \u2014 there\u2019s too many guys like me now.\u201dThere are two missing lines on the unusual baseball itinerary of Brandon Mann, a left-handed reliever who finally reached the majors last Sunday with the Texas Rangers, nearly 16 years after Tampa Bay had drafted him in the 27th round out of a high school near Seattle.One missing line is from 2007, when Mann quit after five unfulfilling seasons in the low minor leagues. He worked the register at a Whole Foods back home and enrolled in community college, but soon regretted the hasty decision. The Rays signed him back the next spring.The other missing line is from 2013, after stints with farm teams of the Rays and the Dodgers, with an independent team in Maryland and two seasons shuttling between the majors and in the minors in Japan. Mann swears he did play in 2013, after the Nationals released him in spring training.\u201cI actually went to play indy ball in Japan, in Nagano,\u201d Mann said. \u201cI played for the Shinano Grandserows, but there\u2019s no way to find those stats. I guess they don\u2019t post those in English.\u201dMann said he started that season with a 1-8 record, in a league then known as the Baseball Challenge League. His team averaged 676 fans per home game. Mann pitched better as the season went on, earning a chance to work out for the SoftBank Hawks in Japan\u2019s major league. They did not sign him.Mann worked out at the Driveline baseball complex near his home, as he had for two years, hoping for one more chance. The Rangers, intrigued by an online video of Mann pitching at Driveline, sent scouts to see him.\u201cBeing in Double-A at 33, it\u2019s hard for a team to take a chance on you,\u201d Mann said. \u201cThe Rangers took a big chance on me, and I knew this was probably my last opportunity with an organization if I didn\u2019t do something.\u201dAt last, he did enough to get a call to the majors, after posting a 1.04 earned run average in 12 games for Class AAA Round Rock. Mann hugged his manager, Jason Wood, and his pitching coach, Brian Shouse, and was off to Houston, where he worked one and two-thirds scoreless innings in his debut.In doing so, at age 33 years 362 days, Mann became the oldest American-born pitcher to make his major league debut since Joe Strong, who was 37 when he first pitched for the Marlins in 2000. But the reality of Mann\u2019s new life sank in three days later.\u201cI told my wife all off-season, \u2018How amazing would it be if I made it to the big leagues, in Seattle, on my birthday?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cMy mom actually bought tickets for that day three weeks ago.\u201dIt happened on Wednesday, when he turned 34. Mann pitched another scoreless inning and two-thirds in his hometown, in front of family and friends, right where he had watched countless games from the stands. He had finally arrived.\u201cRunning on the field at Safeco Field, it wasn\u2019t like I was nervous, but it was like, \u2018Wow \u2014 this is real now,\u2019 \u201d Mann said. \u201cHalf my life I\u2019ve been doing this, I\u2019ve been fighting for a dream. The dream\u2019s coming true.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The scooter companies want to use the sidewalks as a place to store their vehicles until the next customer comes along.To the activists, privileging the scooters over the homeless is another example of what they call \u201ctechsploitation.\u201d \u201cSweep tech not tents,\u201d was one of the rallying cries of the blockade. Another sign: \u201cThey call it \u2018Disruption.\u2019 We call it displacement.\u201dThe protests were generally small and nonviolent, although when the actions spread to Oakland a tire was slashed and a window broken. An episode in which a demonstrator vomited onto the windshield of a Yahoo bus in Oakland quickly entered the annals of famous Bay Area moments of street protest.On Thursday, someone sprayed a vulgar message on the side of one bus but otherwise the mood was largely respectful and inclusive. Aside from the buses, traffic continued to flow through the intersection. A microphone was passed around and people from the community spoke briefly.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lives and we don\u2019t got nowhere to go,\u201d one young man said. Another, addressing the workers in the buses, said, \u201cEach one of you has taken the space away from someone who belongs here.\u201d A third said the tech industry wanted \u201cmore money out of each square inch, and people are pushed out the sides.\u201dSome of the workers got off the buses and left. Others filmed the action on their phones. A half-dozen of the buses were Google\u2019s. At least one was for employees at YouTube, a division of Google. Other buses belonged to Facebook.Gina Scigliano, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was a good corporate citizen.\u201cGoogle has contributed over $250 million to the Bay Area in the areas of homelessness, economic opportunity and education,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAnd since 2014, specific to San Francisco, we have given $63 million to these causes.\u201dFacebook declined to comment.The blockade was not publicized beforehand, so only a handful of people were present. After an hour, there was a prayer and the blowing of a conch. The action disbanded, the scooters went back to the sidewalk and the buses were able to move on.Advertisement"}

At the same time that the law provides more protection to personal expression than at any time in the nation\u2019s history, large numbers of Americans feel less free to speak. The culprit isn\u2019t government censorship but instead corporate, community and peer intimidation.It is right to decry this culture of intolerance and advocate for civility and engagement instead of boycotts and reprisals. The cure for bad speech is better speech \u2014 not censorship. Take that message to the heartland, and conservatives cheer.Until, that is, Colin Kaepernick chose to kneel. Until, that is, the president demanded that the N.F.L. fire the other players who picked up on his protest after he was essentially banished from the league.That was when the conservative mob called for heads to roll. Conform or face the consequences.This isn\u2019t a \u201cmiddle ground,\u201d as the N.F.L. claims. It\u2019s not a compromise.

It\u2019s every bit as oppressive as the campus or corporate attacks on expression that conservatives rightly decry.I agree. It is different. Because it\u2019s about the flag, the censorship is even worse.But even in the darkest days of war, the court wrote liberating words that echo in legal history: \u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\u201dMake no mistake, I want football players to stand for the anthem.

Or should a free people protect a culture of freedom?In our polarized times, I\u2019ve adopted a simple standard, a civil liberties corollary to the golden rule: Fight for the rights of others that you would like to exercise yourself. Do you want corporations obliterating speech the state can\u2019t touch? Do you want the price of participation in public debate to include the fear of lost livelihoods? Then, by all means, support the N.F.L. Cheer Silicon Valley\u2019s terminations. Join the boycotts and shame campaigns.

It diminishes the marketplace of ideas. It mocks the convictions of his fellow citizens. And it divides in the name of a false, coerced uniformity.

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.- Peter EavisThe governing coalition\u2019s majority in the upper one \u2014 the Senate \u2014 is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.- Peter EavisUltimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:\u201cProtecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.\u201dSo, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update.

Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus \u2026 well, everybody.The technology world\u2019s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech\u2019s future everywhere else, too.Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses \u2014 games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba \u2014 to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing.But in the internet realm, China still offers a spooky potential vision of the future, one in which online behemoths like Tencent and Alibaba become the gatekeepers to the entire economy, wielding immense power over traditional industries and becoming very, very rich in the process.\u201cSometimes I think, \u2018Ah, we\u2019re competing in this now, too? All right then,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ma said, chuckling. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\u201cAs profitability reduces, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Now I need to monetize my customer base,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rajgopal said. \u201cThe innovation we\u2019re seeing in China could be seen in the U.S. in the next three to five years,\u201d he added. \u201cCustomers are demanding that.\u201d\u201cIf you can become so big, and so successful in so many areas, this in itself shows that you must have maintained very good, very friendly relations with the government,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Neither giant is done getting bigger.Each has a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, making them among the most highly valued technology firms on the planet. Google and Facebook still claim more users, but the Chinese heavyweights arguably do more \u2014 and more, and more \u2014 for theirs.They have both funded ventures that offer online education, make electric cars and rent out bicycles. For the giants, such initiatives represent new opportunities for people to use their digital wallets \u2014 Ant Financial\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay \u2014 and new ways to collect data on consumer behavior. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein counted 247 investment deals by Tencent in recent years and 156 by Alibaba, though given the pace of the companies\u2019 deal-making, they said their database was \u201clikely to be perennially incomplete.\u201dOnce the companies have locked people into their payment systems, they can become the enablers of commerce and financial services of even more kinds. In a sign of investors\u2019 excitement about the possibilities, Ant Financial is making plans to go public, in a blockbuster stock offering that could give the company a market value larger than Goldman Sachs\u2019s.China has become a model for tech\u2019s world-swallowing tendencies partly out of circumstance.With the country\u2019s high-speed churn of well-funded start-ups, planting flags on new turf is often the only way for large players not to be constantly losing ground.\u201cThe whole China internet market is way more competitive than the U.S. market,\u201d said Xiaoyan Wang, an analyst at 86Research in Shanghai. \u201cEveryone is trying to expand their presence in every sector.\u201dAlso, both Alibaba and Tencent have struggled to make much money outside their home market. That means their surest way to keep growing is to get more deeply involved in more areas of their Chinese users\u2019 lives.In a report this week, Morgan Stanley predicted that by 2027, the total market in China in which Alibaba could be making money will be worth $19 trillion \u2014 more than Amazon\u2019s potential market worldwide.At the moment, both Chinese giants are hustling to find more ways for people to transact using their wallet and not the other\u2019s. Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites and physical stores do not allow users to pay for stuff with WeChat. Tencent-backed companies, such as the retailer JD.com or the service platform Meituan-Dianping, either downplay Alipay as a payment option in their apps or do not accept it at all.Whether any of this will give either camp an enduring lead in payments is unclear. Eric Wen, the founder of Blue Lotus Research Institute, expects them to end up at roughly 50-50.The payments contest will at least propel both companies to keep expanding their kingdoms, including overseas. Alibaba is pouring billions of dollars into online shopping ventures in India and Southeast Asia. Tencent is backing start-ups around the world that have even a distant chance of enriching its ecosystem.George Favvas did not know too much about Tencent before it invested in his company in San Francisco, Circle Medical, whose app lets users summon doctors on demand. He also had no specific plans to take his business to China in the near future, if ever.\u201cMy first question was, \u2018Why are you interested in us?\u2019\u201d Mr. Favvas said.He gets it now, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just such a big player, and health care is so broken,\u201d Mr. Favvas said.

{"Headline": "Before Irish Abortion Vote, Facebook Adds Tools to Curb Interference", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Facebook faced a wave of criticism for missing interference by Russian-based groups during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. Now, it is making Ireland an early test case for new policies meant to block such meddling in foreign elections.With a contentious May 25 referendum on Ireland\u2019s abortion ban approaching, Facebook said on Tuesday that it would block political advertising from groups based outside the country. The company also recently introduced a tool so users can see all the ads a group is posting on the social network, in a bid to increase transparency of political campaigning on its platform.Facebook has said similar tools will eventually be rolled out in other countries, with analysts and observers focused in particular on the 2018 midterm elections in the United States.The referendum on whether to end Ireland\u2019s constitutional ban on abortion, a vote that is expected to be tight, has drawn concerns that foreign groups will try to influence the debate through social media. Irish electoral law bans political donations from non-Irish citizens or residents, but online advertising was not envisioned when the law was written, and transparency activists and online monitors have reported a swelling number of online ads, many of unknown origin.Facebook said on Tuesday that groups working on both sides of the Irish referendum would be able to flag advertisements suspected of coming from foreign organizations. The advertisements will then be investigated by the social media platform. The company also said it would use artificial intelligence technology to spot potentially problematic material.Many countries, including the United States, prohibit foreign groups from advertising in domestic elections, but regulating the spending is difficult with more political activity moving online. Facebook\u2019s advertising system has become a favorite of political groups because it is largely automated, and makes it easy to target narrow segments of voters.Since the 2016 election, Facebook has made several policy changes to address concerns over the role it plays in elections and politics around the world. The company has changed its News Feed algorithm to de-emphasize political news, and has hired thousands of moderators globally to spot rumors and extremist content.The company is also changing its advertising policies, including allowing only authorized groups to buy political ads. A new verification process will eventually require advertisers to be based in the country where the election is taking place.In addition, Facebook is planning to introduce a searchable database to show how much an advertiser is spending, as well as the demographic details of the audience that a group is trying to reach.Padraic Ryan, projects coordinator for the social media verification service Storyful, said that Facebook\u2019s move was a welcome one. But he added that countries like Ireland needed to formulate their own rules, rather than rely on private companies.\u201cThis is about regulation and transparency,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Facebook.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen preroll ads on YouTube, display ads on any number of sites, suggested results on Google linking to pro- or anti- pages, and it\u2019s not at all clear who is behind these. It seems manifest now that there should have been rules regulated before the fact.\u201dGoogle and its video-sharing service, YouTube, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Europe in particular has become a testing ground for some of Facebook\u2019s changes to protect against political interference. Before the German election in September, for example, the company deleted thousands of fake accounts and worked with election officials to stop the spread of misinformation more quickly.Researchers are now focused on the referendum in Ireland, and the platform\u2019s role in the campaign.Last week, Gavin Sheridan, a former employee for Storyful, was able to trace one web page, ostensibly an information source for undecided voters but with no verifiable identification or contact details, to conservative Roman Catholic groups in the United States. The page seemed designed, Mr. Sheridan said, to draw in undecided voters, who would then be targeted with personalized ads for the campaign that seeks to maintain Ireland\u2019s conservative abortion laws.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily underhanded to try and identify targets for advertising, but if you are not being transparent about who you are representing, then it\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative, a group set up to monitor online content during the campaign, said that Facebook\u2019s decision to ban foreign-sourced advertising was a step in the right direction, but that more needed to be done.Facebook\u2019s new Ad View tool, which allows people to see all the ads that a Facebook page is running \u2014 and not merely those targeted at them \u2014 is an improvement, she said. But it allows users to see only current ads, so it is impossible to gauge the totality of an organization\u2019s online activity.

But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like \u201cHow to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover\u2019s Phone.\u201dA similar app, mSpy, offered advice to a woman on secretly monitoring her husband. Still another, Spyzie, ran ads on Google alongside results for search terms like \u201ccatch cheating girlfriend iPhone.\u201dAs digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent.Digital monitoring of a spouse or partner can constitute illegal stalking, wiretapping or hacking. But laws and law enforcement have struggled to keep up with technological changes, even though stalking is a top warning sign for attempted homicide in domestic violence cases.Statistics on electronic stalking are hard to find because victims may not know they are being watched, or they may not report it. Even if they believe they are being tracked, hidden software can make confirmation difficult.According to data published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men in the United States at some point endure stalking or sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner that has significant effects. While comprehensive numbers aren\u2019t available on domestic abuse cases involving digital stalking in the United States, a small survey published in Australia in 2016 found that 17 percent of victims were tracked via GPS, including through such apps.In a Florida case involving abusive surveillance, a man named Luis Toledo installed an app called SMS Tracker on his wife\u2019s phone in 2013 because he suspected she was having an affair. \u201cHe said he was able to see text messages and photos his wife was sending and receiving from others,\u201d Sgt. A. J. Pagliari of the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office recalled.Representatives for SMS Tracker, made by the Dallas-based Gizmoquip, did not respond to requests for comment about the app\u2019s role in the case. A recent review on the Google Play store for SMS Tracker tells potential users: \u201cI would recommend if you think your partner is cheating.\u201dThere is no federal law against location tracking, but such monitoring can violate state laws on stalking. Spying on communications can break statutes on wiretapping or computer crime. And knowingly selling illegal wiretapping tools is a federal crime.But it\u2019s not illegal to sell or use an app for tracking your children or your own phone. And it can be difficult to tell whether the person being surveilled has given consent, because abusers frequently coerce victims into using such apps.In Everson, Wash., for example, Brooks Owen Laughlin is accused of beating his wife and using an app typically used for benign purposes, Find My iPhone, to control her movements.\u201cIf she would turn it off, he would instantly call her or text her and say, \u2018Why did you turn that off? What are you doing?\u2019 That was pretty much 24-7,\u201d Chief Daniel MacPhee of the Everson Police Department, said in an interview. Mr. Laughlin pleaded not guilty in April to charges of assault, harassment and stalking.Such technical and legal ambiguity has created an environment in which tools are marketed for both legal and illegal uses, without apparent repercussion.\u201cThere are definitely app makers that are complicit, seeking out these customers and advertising this use,\u201d said Periwinkle Doerfler, a doctoral student at New York University and an author of the study on apps, which will be presented in the coming days. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit under the radar about it, but they\u2019re still doing it.\u201dThe researchers, from N.Y.U., Cornell University and Cornell Tech, contacted customer support for nine companies with tracking services. The researchers claimed to be women who wanted to secretly track their husbands, and only one company, TeenSafe, refused to assist.KidGuard, the app largely aimed at parents, also bought ads alongside Google results for searches like \u201ccatch cheating spouse app.\u201d A spokesman for the business, based in Los Angeles, said in an email that the company worked with third-party marketers and customer service reps who had been \u201ctesting new strategies.\u201d It deleted blog posts about tracking romantic partners and said it did not support that activity.Spyzie, another app that ran such ads, did not respond to requests for comment.On YouTube, dozens of videos provide tutorials on using several of the apps to catch cheating lovers. The videos frequently link back to the app makers\u2019 sites using a special code that ensures the promoter will get a cut of the sale \u2014 a type of deal known as affiliate marketing.Affiliate marketing also appeared on multiple websites that discussed using surveillance apps to track romantic partners. One site, spyblog.ml, had posts about spying on \u201cloved ones\u201d and linked to mSpy. The app company said that its terms of service prohibited illegal activity and that it would block the site from its affiliate program.Reviews and online discussions about the apps suggest the market for spying on spouses has been important to the businesses. FlexiSPY, an app company, posted survey results on its site showing that 52 percent of potential customers were interested because they thought their partners might be cheating. Asked about the results, the company said the data was five years old and \u201cno longer relevant.\u201dThe proliferation of such tracking apps raises questions about the role of businesses like Google and Apple in policing their services.The two companies, which run nearly all smartphones in the United States, have long taken different approaches to regulating apps.Apple makes it difficult for iPhone users to download apps from outside the company\u2019s App Store, and has many restrictions on what apps in its store can do. After testing several programs available in the stores on both platforms, the researchers found that Apple\u2019s strict rules resulted in more limited surveillance capabilities on those apps than those running Google\u2019s software.Many App Store apps offered location tracking for phones. But for more intrusive surveillance, spying companies had to work around Apple\u2019s restrictions by using the victim\u2019s name and password to get data. To combat misuse by predators, an Apple spokesman said, the company urges people to use a tool called two-factor authentication to help protect their accounts even if their passwords are stolen.Google prides itself on being more open. Its smartphone software, Android, allows people to install apps from anywhere, and the most invasive ones were found outside the company\u2019s app store, Play.The researchers found two apps in the Google Play store that allowed the app icon to be hidden from victims and the camera to run without notifications, as well as a handful of others that tracked users\u2019 locations without telling them, all apparent violations of Google\u2019s rules.\u201cThey\u2019re not enforcing their own policies,\u201d Ms. Doerfler, the N.Y.U. researcher, said. \u201cIf someone reports it then they\u2019ll take it down, but it\u2019s not something they are checking within their operating system.\u201dIn response to the researchers\u2019 findings, Google tightened several policies \u201cto further restrict the promotion and distribution\u201d of surveillance apps, a company spokesman said. The company provides funding to the N.Y.U. team that helped conduct the study.Google removed many spying and tracking apps and blocked advertising on search results about spying on spouses and romantic partners. YouTube, owned by Google, took down some videos about spying services, although the company determined that others didn\u2019t violate its policies because the services could be used with consent.Many law enforcement agencies don\u2019t have the computer skills to quickly help survivors, or they don\u2019t devote forensic resources to domestic abuse and stalking cases, which in many states are misdemeanors.One sheriff\u2019s department, in Dakota County, Minn., is trying to tackle the problem of abusive digital surveillance, and has used Justice Department grants to hire a forensic specialist for the task.The sheriff, Tim Leslie, said that from 2015 to 2017, the department went to court in 198 cases involving technology and stalking or domestic abuse, on par with earlier years. Its conviction rate rose to 94 percent from 50 percent, with many more suspects pleading guilty instead of contesting the charges, he said.In one case, the specialist analyzed a woman\u2019s phone and found it had a program on it called Mobile Spy, bought using her then-husband\u2019s email address. The specialist could see that it had been launched 122 times. The effect of the stalking was \u201cprofound,\u201d the woman said.Even though it had been more than a year since the app was last used, the man was charged with misdemeanor stalking and pleaded guilty in 2015.\u201cWe go after the misdemeanor stuff pretty hard, in the theory that if you stop that, it doesn\u2019t escalate,\u201d Sheriff Leslie said.Federal cases involving such spying are rare. The Justice Department in 2014 charged the maker of a spying program called StealthGenie under a wiretap law that prohibits advertising and selling a device for \u201csurreptitious interception.\u201d The developer paid a $500,000 fine, shut down StealthGenie and was sentenced to time served.Victims\u2019 advocates said they noticed after the case that makers of surveillance tools changed their tactics, sometimes moving computer servers overseas or scrubbing explicit language about spousal spying from their websites. \u201cAs soon as these companies caught wind that they shouldn\u2019t be doing it, they just changed their marketing,\u201d Ms. Olsen said.One app maker told The Times that he hired a legal team after the StealthGenie case to help him avoid running afoul of the law. \u201cThere were a few modifications we had to make,\u201d said Patrick Hinchy, the founder of New York-based ILF Mobile Apps, which makes Highster Mobile and other services. Several apps, he said, removed call recording and delayed the availability of the data by 10 to 15 minutes. Mr. Hinchy said the company only provided assistance to customers that it believed was legal.When a researcher recently contacted the company and asked, \u201cIf I use this app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?\u201d the representative responded: \u201cOur software is undetectable from the home screen.\u201dThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is 1\u2212800\u2212799\u22127233.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 At first blush, Margrethe Vestager\u2019s decision to investigate Apple\u2019s planned acquisition of the music-identification app Shazam seems fairly minor, at least by her standards. As Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.\u201cWe\u2019re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data \u2014 how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \u201cWhat will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\u201dWhile Ms. Vestager\u2019s global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.He added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.As for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201dMs. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201dHer party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201dIn 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Berkshire\u2019s Annual Meeting: Buffett Approves of Apple\u2019s Buyback Plan", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Saturday. Welcome to a special DealBook Briefing of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting.\u2022 What is Berkshire doing to promote gender equality?\u2022 Apple\u2019s buyback plan gets a thumbs up.\u2022 Warren Buffett isn\u2019t backing off his comments about guns and is sticking by Wells Fargo despite the scandals.\u2022 Where does Berkshire\u2019s health care venture with JPMorgan and Amazon stand?\u2022 Is Mr. Buffett now semi-retired?\u2022 Trade \u2018is a win-win situation.\u2019Asked what Berkshire Hathaway was doing to promote gender equality, Warren Buffett said Berkshire\u2019s recent choices of chief executives to run its businesses reflected fairness. \u201cBefore we made this management change, I probably named only six or seven C.E.O.s in the last five or six years. I would say that half of them that I\u2019ve named have been women,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\u201cI feel very good about the decisions we\u2019ve made about our C.E.O.s,\u201d he added.He did not answer whether Berkshire would push for gender equality on the boards of the companies that Berkshire is invested in.Mr. Buffett also said it was clear that women had been treated unfairly in the past.\u201cI have two sisters who are absolutely as smart as I am, and they have better personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t remotely have the same opportunities as I had.\u201dMr. Buffett said there was still a \u201cpipeline problem\u201d in corporate America, making it hard to find as many qualified women to lead companies.But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t use that excuse forever.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterBerkshire is quickly building its stake in Apple.Since Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the stake has grown into Berkshire\u2019s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.So what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201dCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Given Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.Mr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.Here\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201dAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201dHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.The discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:Warren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.Mr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.But his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201dThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.Mr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201dMr. Munger then added:\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201dOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.Berkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.In response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201dMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterThe question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has been a thread through many of the exchanges with shareholders.\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201dHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201dCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201dAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.The shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen GrocerThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.Warren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.But just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.Mr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201dCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\u2014 Emily FlitterThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.So it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d\u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201dSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.In the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.Given the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.Berkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\u2022 What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? \u2014 Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\u2022 What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this?Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\u2022 What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? \u2014 Jason Lu, Shanghai\u2022 Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? \u2014 Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\u2022 He\u2019s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? \u2014 Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\u2022 How long he plans on doing this. \u2014Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\u2014 Elisa Mala(As Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting has grown over the years, it has become a three-day event. Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)Shareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.What was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.Investors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth).

Shareholders Meeting\u201d and guests had the option to \u201cPut yourself in Warren Buffett\u2019s boots,\u201d as the marketing materials suggest, and purchase a style that had been owned by the man himself.Jim Van Fossen, a retired financial planner, bought matching Berkshire Hathaway boxers for himself and his son, Conner Van Fossen. In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders\u2019 meeting.Of course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses. See\u2019s Candies displayed Scotch Kiss confections \u201cmade by Warren,\u201d and one staff member\u2019s uniform bore Mr. Buffett\u2019s autograph.The most photographed autograph was at the Benjamin Moore paint booth, where Mr. Buffett had signed his name in permanent marker next to a wall-size mural of his face. All day long, revelers followed suit, decorating the wall with their own signatures in dry-erase ink, and snapping selfies to preserve the memory.\u2014 Elisa Malahealth carepriceyear endAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sights and Smells of Sicily\u2019s Second City", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerWhile it doesn\u2019t attract the same kind of attention as Palermo, Catania seems to be getting ready for its moment in the spotlight. That sounded like a great frame of mind to begin my trip to Catania, the second largest city in Sicily, positioned in the shadow of Mount Etna on the island\u2019s eastern coast. While it doesn\u2019t attract the same kind of attention as Palermo, Catania\u2019s unheralded delights are worth exploration: fine architecture, bustling markets, lively cultural events and centuries of history dating to the city\u2019s beginnings as a modest Greek colony. And while the euro has seen an uptick over the dollar in the last year or so, a trip to Catania can be had for a relatively modest sum.While I could have flown to Catania from where I was staying in Rome, I opted for the more scenic train ride. A second-class seat cost me 69.50 euros (about $86), and while the seats didn\u2019t recline (brutal on a 10-hour ride), the train was half empty so I had the seats next to me to myself.The sights and smells of the new city hit me square-on after stepping out onto the uneven stone pavement: the peddlers selling gelato and icy granitas, shops full of fresh pasta, motorbikes zooming in and out between lanes of cars, and walls covered in multicolored graffiti. I walked a bit along the water, taking in the slightly briny sea air before hanging a right and making my way toward my lodgings in the center of town.One aspect of the hotel I particularly enjoyed was the ability to take breakfast on a large terrace overlooking Piazza Giuseppe Mazzini. Piazzas are essential to Catanian life, something I discovered during my first morning walking around the city. The main square, Piazza del Duomo, seemed to fill with people proportionally as the morning sun illuminated it: Vendors, shoppers heading to the market and old men sitting around the elephant statue in the square\u2019s center fill the plaza. You\u2019d be wise to grab an espresso macchiato (an espresso with a dash of milk) from one of the cafes on the west side of the square and watch this snapshot of Catanian life \u2014 Caff\u00e8 Prestipino makes a good one (1 euro).While Catania has a public transportation system, its center is small and very manageably explored on foot, allowing you to match the unrushed pace of life and enjoy the narrow stone streets, polished by years of automobile and foot traffic; the sunbaked facades of its buildings; and the thousands of balconies that lean out into its avenues.Undeterred, I went to the box office about 30 minutes before showtime, and slowly pushed my way to the front of the line. I was in luck. My balcony seat wasn\u2019t cheap (42 euros), but I was happy to have landed a seat, and the guy at the box office even floated me a 20 percent discount (off the regular price of 52.50 euros). The gorgeously gilded opera house was a perfect environment to watch the trials and tragedy of the courtesan Violetta Val\u00e9ry.Ursino Castle, which dates to the 13th century, now holds a civic museum (12 euros admission with audio guide) and is also worth a visit. Inside you\u2019ll find treasures from the old Italian masters: works from El Greco and Battistello, and Caravaggio\u2019s somber \u201cMaddalena Addolorata.\u201d For the most part, works proceed chronologically, eventually getting into the 20th century and the colorful, almost Van Gogh-like \u201cAutoritratto\u201d (self-portrait) by Antonio Ligabue. The museum is quite large and parts of it, like one area where 500-year-old relief fragments are just sitting on the floor, feel a little like the curators didn\u2019t know what to do with so much history.And at Gammazita, a cultural association/library/performance space, I saw both young and old united on Piazza Federico di Svevia enjoying a public performance, socializing, eating and drinking. Inside the building is a warm, eclectically decorated informal lending library \u2014 further back is a small bar and cafe. A couple in the front room was setting out food announced on a hastily scrawled menu: Eggplant lasagna, arugula salad and a couple of other dishes.The chaos spilled charmingly out into the street. Two young women were singing and playing the guitar, and guests could enjoy their food and peruse piles of books that were set up outside. A store just across the alleyway (also called Gammazita) specializes in circus and street performing. Alongside, a tall young man was giving an informal plate-spinning lesson to some youngsters. All in all, it was a welcoming, festive atmosphere. That eggplant lasagna, which I had, along with the salad, for 10 euros, also happened to be excellent, with perfectly al dente noodles and a creamy tomato sauce.The latter market was vast and labyrinthine, with vendors selling everything from fresh fennel and cauliflower to knockoff designer handbags and shoes. I dug through a pile of clothing and picked up a button-down shirt and sweater for one euro apiece, and a bag of fresh green and black olives mixed with pickled carrots and cauliflower (one euro). My bad Italian led me to accidentally buy way more pepato stagionato \u2014 a powerfully salty sheep\u2019s milk cheese that resembles pecorino Romano \u2014 than I intended, picking up more than a pound. At 6.50 euros, it was still a good deal, and I enjoyed it with a crusty white roll I purchased from a local baker for 25 cents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Starbucks\u2019s Bias Training, Despite Skepticism, Is an Important Start", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookStarbucks will temporarily shut 8,000 stores for four hours Tuesday afternoon to conduct racial bias training for its employees. It follows an incident in Philadelphia last month in which two black men were arrested simply for waiting in a store.What would seem like a positive step forward is already, perhaps predictably, being criticized.There is undoubtedly a public relations aspect to this. Starbucks wants to polish its image as an inclusive, progressive company.But what other American company do you know that is spending tens of millions of dollars to try to begin a discussion about race at such a scale and in such a public way?Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.The National Football League, for example, took the opposite approach: It set rules last week aimed at keeping any conversation about race or social justice far from its fields.They\u2019re right. But that\u2019s not the way to measure it.The training program, if it is effective, will start a dialogue among some 175,000 employees. The hope is that they will continue the conversation in stores, at home and among their family and friends for days, weeks and months, multiplying the impact.That\u2019s called a start. And if the program is well received, it could give license to other companies to wade into a historically sensitive issue.The incident clearly rattled Starbucks\u2019 leadership. If nothing else, it was an ugly public image for a company that prides itself on showcasing its inclusive values.The seminars will involve groups of about four employees being guided by an interactive iPad workbook, featuring videos from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schultz and the rapper Common. Staff will also watch a documentary short by Stanley Nelson Jr., the Emmy-winning filmmaker. A series of conversation-starters are included in separate worksheets.Of course, it is possible that Starbuck\u2019s training program could lead to bruised feelings, tears and fighting among employees.But whatever happens, someone always has to go first.In 1953, a year before Brown v. Board of Education, I.B.M.\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Watson Jr., wrote a letter describing a commitment to nondiscrimination. He was in the process of building factories in North Carolina and Kentucky, and he wanted to integrate the work force. \u201cIt is the policy of this organization to hire people who have the personality, talent and background necessary to fill a given job, regardless of race, color or creed,\u201d he wrote.Corporate America has come a long way since that letter was written. Clearly, there\u2019s a lot more to be done.Advertisement"}

And with the internet\u2019s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe.Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe\u2019s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\u201cWe want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in S\u00e3o Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was \u201cpushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.\u201dEurope is determined to cement its role as the world\u2019s foremost tech watchdog \u2014 and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies.\u201cThe E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,\u201d said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google.Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies.European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cIf we can export this to the world, I will be happy,\u201d said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a \u201cglobal challenge.\u201dBrazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cMany countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,\u201d said Mr. Buttarelli.Europe\u2019s fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches \u2014 both share elements with the European rules.Europe\u2019s influence is not going unnoticed by America\u2019s tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them.The new privacy rules are part of a \u201cstrong European tradition\u201d of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does \u201cconstrain business,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official.To meet G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers.\u201cIn the absence of another approach, it\u2019s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,\u201d said Mr. Garfield.Whether Europe\u2019s tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region\u2019s regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers.Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing.Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have rules on the books,\u201d said Mr. Tene. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sure, you might not trip on the charging cable every time you get up but it happens \u2014 and it\u2019s worth investing in a product that\u2019s up to the task.\u201cAlmost every device we use on a daily basis needs a cable to charge, so investing in a cable that\u2019ll last is a good idea,\u201d said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer at Wirecutter. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that you don\u2019t have to go overboard and spend too much money though.\u201dAnother reason to buy one? Your friends and anyone who comes into your home will thank you (seriously)!

His reasoning for choosing Anker is clear: The company makes solid, lasting products that work well \u2014 both inside and out. (Wirecutter even had an electrical engineer tear apart lightning and micro-USB cables to make sure they were up to par.)

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Some red flags to watch at Symantec\u2022 David Tepper close to an agreement to purchase Carolina Panthers.\u2022 AT&T\u2019s C.E.O. said he regretted hiring Michael Cohen.\u2022 Symantec\u2019s stock plunges on news of an internal investigation.\u2022 What China\u2019s crackdown on debt means.\u2022 The latest on potential economic warning signs.Symantec, the cybersecurity software company, late Thursday said its audit committee had started an internal investigation related to concerns raised by a former employeeThe company provided no details about what those concerns were and did not hold a question and answer session with analysts on its conference call following the release of its earnings late Thursday. It did warn that its financial results may be affected, depending on the outcome of the investigation.The announcement helped drive Symantec\u2019s shares down by a third in Friday\u2019s trading.The fact that the audit committee is involved and that Symantec said its annual financial filing might now be delayed, suggests the company\u2019s book-keeping is under the spotlight. The issue may, of course, end up being minor. But until Symantec, which declined to comment, provides details, outsiders will look for red flags. Here are some:\u2014 Peter EavisThe deal could come as early as next week, Bloomberg reports. The N.F.L. owners would have to approve the transaction, and Mr. Tepper would have to sell his stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers.Add Randall Stephenson, the telecom giant\u2019s C.E.O., as another corporate chieftain who regretted getting involved with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.Mr. Stephenson sent out a memo to employees about the company\u2019s $600,000 contract with Essential Consultants, the shell company that Mr. Cohen had created (and which was also used to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels).In the memo, the AT&T C.E.O. said, \u201cThere is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\u201d though he added that the company followed the law.Yet it also said that its legislative affairs team would now report to the telecom\u2019s general counsel, David McAtee. The team\u2019s senior executive vice president, Bob Quinn, will be \u201cretiring.\u201dHere\u2019s the full text of the memo, which was obtained by DealBook:Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged. There is no other way to say it \u2013 AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate. But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment. In this instance, our Washington D.C. team\u2019s vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that. Here is more information on this issue, if you\u2019re interested.For the foreseeable future, the External & Legislative Affairs (E&LA) group will report to our General Counsel David McAtee. Bob Quinn, Senior Executive Vice President - E&LA, will be retiring.David\u2019s number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T.To all of you who work tirelessly every day to serve customers and represent the brand proudly, thank you. My personal commitment to you is \u2013 we will do better.RandallIn a separate document, the company discussed several other points about the hiring of Essential Consultants\u2014 including the fact that Mr. Cohen approached AT&T:Michael Cohen approached our External Affairs organization during the post-election transition period and said he was going to leave the Trump Organization and do consulting for a select few companies that wanted his opinion on the new President and his administration \u2013 the key players, their priorities, and how they think.The company also noted that it had hired \u201cpolitical consultants\u201d in the past, especially at the beginning of new administrations.\u2014 Michael de la MercedSymantec said the investigation was in its early stages and warned its \u201cfinancial results and guidance may be subject to change based on the outcome.\u201dIf Symantec\u2019s stock closes at its current levels, it would mark its worst single-day decline in 17 years and second worst fall in its history.First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final regulatory approvals, we will be offering free rides to the public in a few months.Super huge thanks to everyone that helped with this project. Strong support from public, elected officials & regulators is critical to success.As mentioned in prior posts, once fully operational (demo system rides will be free), the system will always give priority to pods for pedestrians & cyclists for less than the cost of a bus ticket.\u201cSome financial risks are longstanding, lurking sources of infection that are concealed very deep but may erupt in a flash. The United States subprime crisis erupted in a night. If we\u2019re going to have big trouble in the future, it could well be in this area, and this demands high vigilance.\u201d(Another of his worries: losing a tech race to the West.)But reducing debt will be difficult, as Christopher Lee of S.&P. Global told the NYT: \u201cLike any deleveraging campaign, it is not painless.\u201dThe push into credit cards is fraught for Goldman, whose track record in consumer finance is scarcely two years old. Credit cards are a cutthroat business dominated by larger rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Yields are falling. And Goldman lacks much of the infrastructure to be able to issue credit cards and process payments to merchants.An earlier version of this briefing incorrectly said China\u2019s debt was 256 times the country\u2019s gross domestic product. China\u2019s debt is 256 percent of its G.D.P.

{"Headline": "As Google Feeds Cats, Owl Lovers Cry Foul ", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "Supported byDeath strikes hard at Shoreline. The remains of an owl \u2014 a leg, a wing, a few scattered feathers \u2014 were found here in 2015, shortly after a feral cat was seen stalking it. Another owl was discovered dead near its burrow, and a third disappeared that year and was presumed killed. That was fully half the owls nesting in the park.Environmentalists have been alarmed for a long time about the number of cats at Shoreline, but they could not determine where they were coming from. Gradually, public records requests and old-fashioned snooping uncovered a trail. It led southwest from the sun-burnished slopes of the park, up Permanente Creek and into the ever-expanding empire of Google.Google never set out to threaten biodiversity in its front yard, of course. Like so many stories these days about Big Tech, this is a tale about how attempts to do good often produce unexpected consequences, and how even smart people (especially, perhaps, smart people) can be reluctant to rethink their convictions.Google is famous for feeding its employees well, and the cats are no different. Every night, all night, dinner is served from cat-feeding stations. The cat community calls this approach \u201ccolony care.\u201d\u201cNeutering and colony care,\u201d GCat Rescue maintains, \u201calso stop nuisance behaviors like fighting, screaming, spraying, roaming, hunting, etc.\u201d The cats that are released are implanted with tracking chips, and an ear is notched so they can be identified. GCat\u2019s website says it has placed 148 cats for adoption. It does not say how many have been released around the company\u2019s campus.\u201cCats that are fed still hunt,\u201d said Mr. Longcore, assistant professor of architecture, spatial sciences and biological sciences at the University of Southern California. \u201cEven neutered cats and spayed cats hunt.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you have an outdoor cat sanctuary, you can expect there to be consequences to the native wildlife.\u201dEmails to GCat Rescue at meow@google.com were not answered. A Google spokeswoman said the GCat group was fewer than 10 people but otherwise declined to discuss it.Environmental groups said Google was generally an excellent partner and had made aggressive efforts to support the burrowing owls at Moffett Field, its leased property a few miles south of the Googleplex, but was consistently unhelpful on the cat issue.\u201cThey told us it was something their employees were doing and they couldn\u2019t interfere,\u201d said Eileen McLaughlin, a board member with a group trying to protect and expand the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. She and the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society asked Google to remove the cat feeding stations in 2012.Cats have stalked birds forever, but in Shoreline Park a final victory is at hand. The number of cat sightings there last year was 318, according to the City of Mountain View\u2019s official count. And 2017 was the first time in 20 years of record-keeping that no owl fledglings were observed in the park. As recently as 2011, there were 10.\u201cWe lose the owls, we lose something else next, and then something else,\u201d Ms. McLaughlin said. \u201cWe need biodiversity.\u201dGoogle is far from the only company with a cat colony. If employees are not providing the food, cat lovers from the community take up the task.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Shani Kleinhaus, an environmental advocate with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. \u201cMany of the avian species around the Bay breed on or close to the ground, and the cats prey on them at their most vulnerable moments \u2014 sitting on their eggs or caring for their young.\u201dSome tech companies have changed their approach. Facebook, whose nearby campus abuts a marsh with endangered species, stopped allowing cat feeding several years ago. Intuit, which like Google borders Shoreline, said it has no employee cat programs.Johanna van de Woestijne, a retired medical researcher, began taking a midmorning spin through Shoreline Park a decade ago, first on foot and then on her bicycle. \u201cWhen I see something worth photographing, usually birds, I jump off and grab my camera,\u201d she said. Soon Ms. van de Woestijne was seeing a lot of cats, and photographed those, too. She became passionate about the issue and filed a documents request from the city, but it didn\u2019t reveal much.Ms. McLaughlin recently offered a tour of the sprawling Google campus from a cat\u2019s point of view. In a patch of trash-strewn woods next to a parking lot, there was a worn but elaborate feeding station, with straw beds for sleepy cats. A sign identified it as a GCat venture.A feeding station on the other side of campus was on the edge of Shoreline, next to a designated owl nesting area. A third station, hidden in the underbrush, was mere feet from a park entrance for walkers and bikers. A fourth station was in a parking lot.Late last year, Ms. McLaughlin submitted a public records request to Mountain View. Unlike earlier requests, this one was revelatory.It showed city employees discussing how they were trapping Google-chipped cats in the park. The city\u2019s wildlife preservation biologist said he was worried about the cats\u2019 \u201csignificant impacts\u201d on protected species, \u201cespecially burrowing owls.\u201d One of the cats was trapped, turned over to the Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority, released to Google, trapped again in the park and released again to Google. Last August, it was found dead in the park.Janet Alexander, a spokeswoman for the animal control group, said, \u201cGoogle understands the cats are not supposed to cross the line into the park.\u201dThe cats seem to have a different understanding.One recent evening, as dusk yielded to darkness, a cat came up the path from Google. It was heading straight into the owls\u2019 domain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emergency Braking Was Disabled When Self-Driving Uber Killed Woman, Report Says", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe initial findings, released on Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board, confirmed early police reports about the episode, which was the first known pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous car.The report also affirmed what many experts on self-driving cars said in the days after the crash: Uber\u2019s cars are loaded with sensors and cameras that should have detected a pedestrian with plenty of time to stop. But this one failed through a combination of a computer system not responding properly to the pedestrian\u2019s presence and a distracted safety driver.The fatal crash has raised questions about the safety of testing self-driving cars on public roads and whether companies, in their rush to be among the first to deploy this breakthrough technology, are taking enough precautions to prevent harm to other drivers and pedestrians. It has also dampened some enthusiasm for self-driving cars as a technology that researchers believe could eventually save lives because robot drivers, unlike humans, don\u2019t get distracted or tired and obey traffic rules.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle equipped with Uber\u2019s sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer.But Uber disabled that function as well as other safety features to \u201creduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,\u201d according to the report. This put the onus on the safety driver to intervene to avoid a crash if necessary. The agency said Uber\u2019s safety driver, who was not impaired, grabbed the steering wheel in an attempt to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact.The vehicle\u2019s operator, who was seen on dashboard cameras looking down and away from the road before the crash, told investigators that she had been monitoring the self-driving car system in the center of the car\u2019s dashboard. A toxicology report for the victim came back positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, investigators said, though they did not say drugs played a factor in the crash.While the safety board\u2019s preliminary report did not determine fault, it pointed to instances where Uber\u2019s testing system failed to prevent the crash.\u201cThe circumstances of the crash was certainly damning, and this report documents it,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina, who specializes in technology and law. \u201cMany of the issues raised in the report lead right back to Uber and Uber\u2019s testing program as a legitimate target of criticism.\u201dMary Cummings, an engineering professor at Duke University who studies the interaction between humans and autonomous vehicles, said there was \u201ca lack of maturity\u201d in Uber\u2019s testing program because it was asking the drivers to do too much. The company made it hard for them to focus on their primary task: ensuring safety.Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said the company had worked closely with investigators over the last two months. It has started a review of its self-driving car program and plans to announce changes to its safety procedures in the coming weeks. Uber has brought on Christopher A. Hart, a former chairman of the safety board, as an adviser on its \u201coverall safety culture.\u201dImmediately after the crash, Uber suspended testing of its self-driving cars and has not yet returned to the road.On Wednesday, the company said it was shutting down its testing operations in Arizona and laying off 300 employees, saying it wanted to move testing closer to its engineering hubs in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uber also said it hoped to return to the road in Pittsburgh by the summer. The company has not said when it hopes the autonomous cars will return to San Francisco.But even politicians who once welcomed self-driving cars onto their roads are striking a more cautious tone. William Peduto, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor, said the city would require Uber\u2019s cars stay under 25 miles per hour, regardless of the road\u2019s speed limit.Still, the crash hasn\u2019t significantly altered the deployment or testing plans for Uber\u2019s rivals.Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out from Google, has been testing cars without a safety driver in Arizona, where it is also picking up passengers as part of a test deployment of an autonomous taxi service. Waymo said it expected to start accepting fares for its self-driving taxis this year. And Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, has continued testing in California.An earlier version of the article misstated when the safety driver in an autonomous Uber vehicle that fatally struck a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz., tried to start braking. It was less than a second after impact, not less than a second before.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Did Ireland Go? Abortion Vote Stuns Those on Both Sides", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Some were joyous. Others were devastated. But most of all, in the hours after Irish voters swept away a ban on abortion, many were simply astonished.However they felt about the result of the referendum, they were witnessing, they knew, the culmination of a fundamental shift in Irish society \u2014 and one that has come about with stunning speed.In a remarkably compact span of time, the country has gone from being a bastion of social conservatism in the West to a place that wholeheartedly embraces positions that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago.The culture of silence and deference to religious authority that long dominated Ireland is gone. The country that has emerged is an unlikely leader of liberal values.\u201cIreland has changed 180 degrees on everything,\u201d said Adam Tyrrell, 24, struggling to take it all in as he smoked a cigarette outside a pub and watched the street fill up with crowds of cheering yes supporters after the results were announced.The nation of 4.8 million people has experienced some of the fastest social and economic change in the world. In a matter of 30 years, Ireland has gone from being a poor and deeply Roman Catholic country to one that is seeing high growth rates and has installed a gay man as prime minister.Long associated with exporting cheap labor, it has accepted a sizable number of immigrants and is home to foreign tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.In 2015, in another popular vote, Ireland approved same-sex marriage by a landslide.\u201cIreland has gone from criminalizing gays, having just one television channel and priests running the show, to now a liberal, European society,\u201d said Mark Neiland, a business owner in his 60s.When he was growing up, Mr. Neiland recalled, Irish families had to decide between cooking dinner on the stove or watching television because electricity was scarce. \u201cIreland was a really poor country,\u201d he said.When Mr. Neiland graduated from high school, he said, every classmate, including him, left for the United States, Canada or Australia.\u201cI would never think of leaving this place for America now,\u201d he said.While the landslide result of the abortion referendum may have surprised much of the world, many Irish were less shocked. They have seen the changes in the country building over time.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who is half Indian, spoke of a \u201cquiet revolution that has been taking place in Ireland over the last couple of decades.\u201dIreland\u2019s impoverished past, as well as the outsize role of the Catholic Church, had set it apart from much of the rest of Europe. Many saw the referendum as the final step in aligning the country with the rest of the continent.The vote, said Mr. Tyrrell, \u201ccements us as a progressive nation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the optics of how people view us after these two landslide victories,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Ireland.\u201dAlan Barrett, director of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said the results of the abortion referendum indicated a \u201cconvergence with European norms.\u201d\u201cIf you take the standard mainstream views in continental Europe, Ireland was the outlier, and it was always economically behind Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Catholic Church being moved aside, you\u2019ve got the Irish accumulating their values and views the same way that the French, the Germans or the British get theirs.\u201dThere are many factors behind Ireland\u2019s dramatic makeover. The most dominant reason is the collapse of the Catholic Church\u2019s influence in most spheres of Irish life. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to know that Ireland has been secularizing for a long time,\u201d said Diane Negra, a professor of cultural studies at University College Dublin.The credibility of the church has been battered by a string of scandals, some involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes.Another major factor driving the change: an economic transformation.As recently as the 1980s, Ireland was a very different place.With a weak economy in that decade, many young Irish left the country to look for jobs abroad, leaving behind an older, more conservative population that was loyal to the church. It was during this period that Ireland voted for restrictive rules on abortion and marriage.In 1983, Ireland voted in favor of the Eighth Amendment in the Constitution, which effectively banned abortion \u2014 the amendment that the Irish voted to repeal on Friday. Three years later, the Irish rejected a proposed amendment to remove a ban on divorce.Attitudes shifted notably in the 1990s with the first revelations of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, and the beginning of an economic boom.From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, Ireland was proclaimed the \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d The decade of prosperity attracted multinationals, increased living standards and brought back Irish expatriates who carried with them new ideas and values.The economy soured for a few years, but then recovered. Last year, Ireland posted a 7.8 percent growth rate, the highest in the European Union \u2014 though many Irish say that inequality has also risen.Ireland\u2019s decision to make secondary schools free improved education, and the introduction of contraception significantly reduced the number of children per family. That helped more women enter the paid work force.Anthony Fannin, 70, a retired engineer, said the economic boom \u201cgave self-confidence to the Irish that they had lacked.\u201d\u201cThey felt equal to the rest of the world, that they could get a share of the luxuries of life,\u201d he said.Pointing to the church sex abuse scandals, he said, Ireland\u2019s changing fortunes also meant that \u201cinstead of people bowing their heads whenever a priest passed by, they could actually stand up and say, \u2018Hang on, Father, what happened back then?\u2019\u201dLuke Hussey, 25, who comes from a working-class family, said his family had jumped into the middle class almost overnight during the boom, buying a car and going on vacations to Spain.\u201cIt was weird, almost perverse that we were now a middle-class family,\u201d he said.It was during the boom years, in 1993, that Ireland decriminalized homosexuality. Two years later, the country finally voted to allow divorce.The referendum on abortion, many Irish said, was the final crack in the foundation of the old Ireland.The debate in the days and months before the referendum released, for some, decades of pent-up emotions and anger against the church. Mr. Barrett described it as \u201cnational therapy.\u201d The referendum also forced a national debate on subjects that were long taboo, especially around sex.\u201cIreland had a culture of silence and that\u2019s broken now,\u201d Mr. Tyrrell said.\u201cTo be Irish now means to be open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sick of being quiet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patagonia v. Trump", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "The outdoor retailer has supported grass-roots environmental activists for decades. Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument.Supported byVENTURA, Calif. \u2014 The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot, day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach, where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts, where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year.But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December, Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company\u2019s home page.It wasn\u2019t a business crisis that had mobilized the company, however. It was politics.Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. \u201cSome people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd guess what. They\u2019re wrong.\u201dYet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation, including Patagonia, the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands, and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining.Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years, the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days \u2014 and many do so uncomfortably \u2014 Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s.It bills itself \u201cthe Activist Company\u201d and publicly advocates for environmental protection, fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists, and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December, Patagonia had never tangled with a president.That Monday morning, about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The mood was somber. Then, within an hour of the president\u2019s remarks, Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products, there was a stark message against a black background: \u201cThe President Stole Your Land.\u201dAt the same time, Patagonia\u2019s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president.Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells, Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the secretary of agriculture, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them.\u201cFor as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments, Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cCongress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.\u201dThe barbs only stiffened Patagonia\u2019s resolve. The company\u2019s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration \u201cevil.\u201d And Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s chief executive officer, made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities.\u201cWe\u2019ve always given to grass-roots organizations; it\u2019s part of our D.N.A.,\u201d she said in a recent interview at company headquarters, an American flag flying outside her window. \u201cBut the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.\u201dIt would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula, Calif., a small community not far from Patagonia\u2019s headquarters.The hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno, and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president, its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes.\u201cWe did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit,\u201d said Corley Kenna, Patagonia\u2019s head of communications. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.\u201dPatagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard, an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith, and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park.Within a few years, he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia, a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America, where he had recently traveled.Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part, the company was a means to an end, a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf, climb and travel their way around the world.That changed in 1972, when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered, the flow of the river would have been changed, and a prized surf break could have been ruined.At the meeting, it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist, Mark Capelli, took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds, water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted, the river was protected, and the surf break was preserved.Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work, giving free office space to his nascent organization, Friends of the Ventura River, and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river.That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists, give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy, and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia\u2019s sales to support environmental activism.\u201cPatagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem, and are willing to be very public about their advocacy,\u201d said Neil Kornze, who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. \u201cThey are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.\u201dBusiness is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years, Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer, drawn to the company\u2019s environmental activism.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of worried about the planet.\u201dShe was named chief executive in 2014, and has overseen Patagonia\u2019s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the company.And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes.\u201cScience without activism is dead science,\u201d Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. \u201cWe want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines, the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.\u201dIn 2012, one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa, a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah, including the area that would become Bears Ears.At the time, Republicans in Utah, notably Representative Rob Bishop, were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining, bringing in additional state tax revenue.\u201cPatagonia has been interested in this area for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cMore than any company I\u2019ve ever seen, they put their money where their mouth is.\u201dAs Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears, which was a favorite of rock climbers, it came to appreciate the area\u2019s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls, it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining.\u201cAs we got more involved, we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place,\u201d said Lisa Pike Sheehy, Patagonia\u2019s vice president of environmental activism. \u201cThis was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.\u201dIn total, Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears, including making grants to nonprofit groups, producing films and other marketing materials, and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment, they worked.\u201cWe never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created,\u201d Mr. Ewing said. \u201cThe writing was on the wall. There wasn\u2019t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.\u201dInside Patagonia, Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. \u201cDefending our air, soil and water has never been more important,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the last few years, our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger \u2026 we won\u2019t stop.\u201dDuring a monthslong public comment period, the Interior Department received more than two million submissions, the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150,000 comments.During the first months of the new administration, Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee, Hans Cole, made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations, according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place, but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff.Around this time, Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells, which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs.The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy, spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed.That evening, Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast, returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia\u2019s headquarters, she could see flames encircling Ventura.\u201cI saw the whole ridge line on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized we wouldn\u2019t be able to go back to the office.\u201dPatagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus, and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate.A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia, putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread, surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town.\u201cThere was ash falling like rain,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cIt was something I have never seen before.\u201dMr. Zinke hit back. \u201cYou mean Patagonia made in China?\u201d he said on a press call, accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.\u201dThen on Fox Business Network, Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia\u2019s activism. \u201cThey should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country, rather than lying to the public about losing federal land,\u201d he said.As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs, the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month, it destroyed more than 1,000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared, but five employees lost their homes.With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6, Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito, 30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her, though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate, too.\u201cThen in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse, across my inbox comes an email,\u201d she said. \u201cPatagonia versus Donald Trump, et al.\u201dMs. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president.Since that week in December, the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer.\u201cThe decision was nothing more than a political favor,\u201d Ms. Sheehy, the company\u2019s vice president of environmental activism, wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe redrawing of boundaries was deliberate, and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.\u201dThe Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were \u201cpatently and demonstrably false.\u201dMs. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire, which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change.\u201cThese are climate disasters, and they\u2019re going to get worse and worse,\u201d Ms. Marcario said. \u201cWe have an administration that isn\u2019t paying any attention to that.\u201dPatagonia\u2019s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups, and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision, and until then, all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells, which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis, has billed $1.7 million in hours to date.In the meantime, the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use, including drilling and mining, though there hasn\u2019t yet been any new development.At Patagonia, Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end, it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection.\u201cThese are all long fights,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for 50 years, 100 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.The researchers write:\u201cThe advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\u201d\u201cThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\u201dShares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions.

The activist hedge fund led by Paul Singer also said it may be \u201cable to substantially improve the proposed price with additional, private diligence.\u201dIn Monday\u2019s letter, Elliott said: \u201cAthenahealth\u2019s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we are faced now with the stark reality that Athenahealth as a public-company investment, despite all of its promise, has not worked for many years, is not working today and will not work in the future. Given Athenahealth\u2019s potential, this reality is deeply frustrating, but the fact remains that Athenahealth as a public company has not made the changes necessary to enable it to grow as it should and to create the kind of value its shareholders deserve.\u201dElliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.\u201cThe letter doesn\u2019t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,\u201d The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct\u2019s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the \u201cWoodstock of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett \u2014 and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question \u2014 which they rarely do \u2014 that was critical of Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Wells Fargo.

{"Headline": "One Test Could Exonerate Him. Why Won't California Do It?", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "\nThe first sign that something was wrong was a continuous busy signal on the home phone of Doug and Peggy Ryen.Bill Hughes, who lived nearby, wasn\u2019t initially concerned. His 11-year-old son, Chris, had slept over at the Ryens\u2019 and he thought maybe they had all gone out for breakfast. But finally at noon Hughes drove over to pick Chris up and, when no one answered the Ryens\u2019 door, he peered through the sliding glass doors \u2014 and his brain couldn\u2019t process all the red. \u201cThis is paint, makeup,\u201d he thought wildly.Then reality sank in, and he kicked the kitchen door in. Blood from the five victims was splattered everywhere. Hughes rushed to his son, but the body was cold. Doug and Peggy Ryen, both nude, had also been stabbed to death, and the bloody corpse of their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica, was in a doorway. But Josh Ryen, 8 years old, was moving feebly on the floor even though his throat had been slashed and his skull fractured.JoshRyenWounded, 8 years oldDoug ryenMurdered, 41 years oldPeggy RyenMurdered, 41 years oldJessicaRyenMurdered, 10 years oldChrisHughesMurdered, 11 years oldSource: Inland Valley Daily BulletinFrom left to right:Jessica Ryen, murdered, 10 years old. Josh Ryen, wounded, 8 years old. Doug Ryen, murdered, 41 years old. Peggy Ryen, murdered, 41 years old. Christopher Hughes, murdered, 11 years old.Source: Inland Valley Daily BulletinSoon sheriff\u2019s deputies were swarming all over the Ryen house in affluent, suburban Chino Hills, east of Los Angeles, that day in June 1983. Several signs, including Josh\u2019s personal account, pointed to three white attackers, and blond or brown hairs were found in the victims\u2019 hands, as if torn off in a struggle.Sheriff\u2019s deputies were also contacted by the woman whose boyfriend was a convicted murderer, recently released from prison, whom she suspected of involvement in the Ryen killings. She not only gave deputies his bloody coveralls but also told them that his hatchet was missing from his tool rack and resembled one of the  weapons reportedly used in the attacks.But instead of testing the coveralls for the Ryens\u2019 blood, the deputies threw them away\u2013and pursued Cooper. After a racially charged trial, he was convicted of murdering the Ryens and Chris Hughes and is now on death row at San Quentin Prison.This is the story of a broken justice system. It appears that an innocent man was framed by sheriff\u2019s deputies and is on death row in part because of dishonest cops, sensational media coverage and flawed political leaders \u2014 including Democrats like Brown and Kamala Harris, the state attorney general before becoming a U.S. senator, who refused to allow newly available  DNA testing for a black man convicted of hacking to death a beautiful white family and young neighbor. This was a failure at every level, and it should prompt reflection not just about one man on death row but also about profound inequities in our entire system of justice.I\u2019m using strong language, I know. But I went to San Quentin to interview Cooper, reviewed trial transcripts and other documents, spoke to innumerable people on and off the record, and in 34 years at The New York Times, I\u2019ve never come across a case in America as outrageous as Kevin Cooper\u2019s. So hear me out.Smarter people than me have come to the same conclusion. \u201cThis guy is innocent,\u201d said  Thomas R. Parker, a 30-year law enforcement veteran who was deputy head of the F.B.I.\u2019s office in Los Angeles. \u201cThe evidence was planted, he was framed, the cops lied on the stand.\u201dParker said the case involved \u201cabject racism,\u201d and he has volunteered his time investigating the case for the last seven years because he is horrified that a man he believes was framed is nearing execution.How did we get here?Initially, the authorities searched for three white men, which fit the evidence from the crime.DOUG RYENPEGGY RYEN37 inflictedwounds33 inflictedwoundsJESSICA RYENCHRIS HUGHES46 inflictedwounds25 inflictedwoundsDOUG RYENPEGGY RYEN33 inflictedwounds37 inflictedwoundsJESSICA RYENCHRIS HUGHES46 inflictedwounds25 inflictedwoundsThe evidence from the Ryen home and testimony from Josh pointed to three white perpetrators.Over the course of the investigation, several witnesses claimed they had seen three white men in a car resembling the station wagon stolen from the Ryens\u2019 home the night of the murders.Several other witnesses said they saw three disorderly white patrons at the Canyon Corral Bar late on the evening of the killings wearing bloody clothing, in a car that may have been the Ryens\u2019.The men were surprised when the blood was pointed out \u2014 and afterward two bloody shirts were found nearby.But none of this ultimately mattered to the sheriff\u2019s office after deputies made what they thought was a breakthrough discovery: A 25-year-old black man convicted of burglary had escaped from a minimum-security Chino prison by walking through a fence.And he had holed up for two days in an empty house \u2026... just 125 yards from the Ryens\u2019 home.Source: Google (satellite imagery)That was Cooper, and deputies who examined his file and mug shot saw a black man with a huge Afro who fit their narrative of an incorrigible criminal. He had a long arrest record dating back to when he was 7 years old.The sheriff\u2019s deputies were sure they had their man: an escaped felon, one who they thought looked suitably evil. The authorities pivoted and focused on Cooper, ignoring other threads.Still, the authorities had a problem: Although they were sure Cooper was the killer, they couldn\u2019t find fingerprints, hairs or other evidence implicating him.So evidence began to turn up in mysterious ways.Two deputies searched Cooper\u2019s hide-out on June 6, a day after the Ryens\u2019 bodies had been found. The police didn\u2019t find anything suspicious in the house.The next day, deputies searched the hide-out again, now having identified Cooper as their primary suspect. A bloody green button from a prison uniform materialized on the floor along with a hatchet sheath. (Eventually, it turned out that Cooper had been wearing a brown jacket, not green.)Deputies claimed they had not entered that room before. But later, one deputy's fingerprints were found inside the closet, indicating he had been in the room \u2014 and had lied about it.A thorough search of the station wagon found no evidence that Cooper had used the car. That problem was remedied when a second search of the vehicle  turned up some of Cooper\u2019s cigarette butts; sheriff\u2019s deputies had found such cigarette butts in the empty house where he had stayed, but the butts had vanished.The prosecution suggested that Cooper wanted to steal the station wagon. But the Ryens kept the keys in the car; there was no need to enter the house.Nevertheless, four days after the discovery of the murders, the sheriff announced the crime had been solved: Cooper was being sought for murder.While the police were desperately trying to connect Cooper to the crime, another man who should have been a prime suspect was not being investigated.That\u2019s a remarkable element of this case: Not only has the evidence against Cooper largely been discredited, but evidence has accumulated against another individual, who happens also to be a convicted murderer.  Fletcher, the federal judge, wrote  a long section in a judicial opinion implicating this man, whom I\u2019ll identify only by his first name, Lee.It was his girlfriend,  Diana Roper, who had alerted deputies after the murders made the news to the reasons she believed that he  had participated in the Ryen murders.Roper and her sister said that Lee came home late on the night of the killings in a station wagon like that of the Ryens, wearing blood-drenched coveralls, and that his hatchet was missing from his tool rack and resembled one of the murder weapons described by authorities. She said that on the day of the killing she had laid out for Lee a medium-size tan Fruit of the Loom T-shirt with a pocket; she remembered because she had just bought it for Lee at Kmart. It was exactly like a Fruit of the Loom T-shirt found by the bar with blood on it; testing showed it was the Ryens\u2019 blood.Roper gave deputies the bloody coveralls. But instead of testing them to see if the blood was from the Ryens, the sheriff\u2019s office threw them out.Roper said she cannot be sure that Lee\u2019s missing hatchet is the same as the one used in the murders, but she added that \u201cthe curvature of the handle is the same\u201d and it had a similar \u201cAmerican Indian pattern to it.\u201d Her sister, Karee Kellison, who was with Roper, confirmed much of her story.Then there was the peculiar matter of the recovery of the Ryens\u2019 station wagon.The station wagon didn\u2019t turn up until a week after the killings \u2014 near the home of Lee\u2019s stepmother in Long Beach.Ryen homeCarfoundCALIFORNIANorthPacificOceanLee\u2019s stepmother\u2019s homeBut Cooper had made his way south to Tijuana, Mexico.

He arrived there the evening after the killings.Kevin Cooperspotted in TijuanaMEXICO20 milesSource: Planet (satellite imagery)The sheriff\u2019s office claimed that Cooper took the Ryens\u2019 station wagon, but aside from the witnesses who reported seeing several white men driving it on the night of the murders, a new witness has emerged who saw the car the next day.The woman, who is scared of being identified as a witness for now but says she  will testify under oath if necessary, said three white people in the Ryens\u2019 car were driving crazily and almost crashed into her vehicle.Her grandmother, who was with her that day, wrote down the license plate number. Hours later, after the murder was discovered, the authorities broadcast a description of the missing car with its license plate number.\u201cI ran out to the car and got the slip of paper on which my grandmother had written the license number,\u201d the woman wrote in a formal declaration. \u201cIt was exactly the same.\u201d She said  that she wrote to the police with her information, but the authorities did not follow up or share it with the defense.Shown an old photo of Lee, this woman said that it resembled the driver but that she couldn\u2019t  be sure it was the same man.If there\u2019s no apparent motive for Cooper, there are only hints of one for Lee. His previous murder, of a 17-year-old girl, was at the behest of a gang leader, Clarence Ray Allen, who raised the same kind of Arabian horses as the Ryens. There\u2019s some \u2014 very squishy, unconfirmed \u2014 evidence that Allen may have previously threatened to kill Peggy Ryen, that they had a quarrel over a horse sale gone sour, and that she was terrified of him.All this said, let\u2019s be clear that if there\u2019s one lesson from the Cooper case, it\u2019s that we should be very wary of assuming guilt on the basis of fragmentary evidence.  I tracked down Lee, now 68, and he strongly denied any involvement in the case. However, he did not want to discuss it and asked not to be contacted again.One point in Lee\u2019s favor: He has avoided serious tangles with the law in the decades since the Ryen killings.With all these uninvestigated threads, it\u2019s worth considering the motives of the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s office, which handled the investigation.Sheriff Floyd Tidwell had recently been appointed to his position and was facing election that year, adding to the pressure to solve the most brutal crime in the county\u2019s memory.It\u2019s clear that the sheriff\u2019s office  wasn\u2019t a stickler for rules. Tidwell was later convicted for stealing more than 500 guns from county evidence rooms. A lab technician who \u201cfound\u201d shoe print evidence against Cooper was later fired for stealing heroin from the evidence room.Then, a day after the bodies were discovered, the district attorney closed the on-scene investigation for fear, he said, of gathering so much evidence that defense experts could spin complicated theories.Concerns with the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s deputies have continued since then.Almost exactly 10 years after the Ryen murders, there was another terrible murder in San Bernardino County, and a man named William Richards was convicted in part based on evidence \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the same sheriff\u2019s office lab technician who earlier had \u201cfound\u201d evidence against Cooper. Later, it turned out that this evidence was planted, and Richards was eventually exonerated. (The sheriff\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.)The only witness to the murders themselves, of course, was Josh Ryen, who endured a physical and emotional trauma that is unimaginable. By the time of the trial, he had no clear memory of what happened or of seeing an intruder.Yet his first memories were clearer. I tracked down Don Gamundoy, who at the time of the murders was a social worker at the hospital to which Josh was rushed. \u201cHe was awake and alert,\u201d Gamundoy recalled.Josh could hear but couldn\u2019t speak because of the wound to his throat, so Gamundoy wrote the alphabet, the numbers and the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d on a piece of paper and asked Josh to point to the letters to spell his name, phone number and birth date. Josh did so correctly, showing that the method worked.Then Gamundoy asked Josh if the people who did this were black.\u201cHe pointed to \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Gamundoy told me. Communicating in the same way, Josh said that the attackers were white, and that there were three or four of them.This was a chaotic scene unfolding as doctors were struggling to treat the boy, but Gamundoy said he had asked each question twice to make sure the answers were not a mistake. Sheriff\u2019s deputies were present and observing, he said, and in interviews with deputies later, Josh referred to the attackers as \u201cthey,\u201d saying that \u201cthey\u201d had chased him.With a good defense, Cooper might have prevailed. But his county public defender was overwhelmed and made a series of practical legal mistakes.\u201cKevin got convicted because they framed him and because he didn\u2019t have a half-decent defense,\u201d said Norman C. Hile, his current lawyer. Hile, now retired as a partner in the international law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, has volunteered on the case for the last 14 years because he fiercely believes in Cooper\u2019s innocence.This is a familiar pattern: Inmates have third-rate defenders at trial, but after they are sentenced to death they get the help of brilliant free counsel; by then it is often too late to undo the damage.Cooper\u2019s trial unfolded amid the ugliest racism. At a hearing, a crowd displayed signs reading \u201cHang the Nigger.\u201d One man displayed a noose around a stuffed gorilla.Newspapers carried inaccurate reports, apparently based on prosecution leaks, that tied Cooper to the murder scene and suggested falsely that he was gay (seizing upon 1980s homophobia as well as racism).The San Bernardino Sun, June 29, 1983The San Bernardino Sun, June 29, 1983The San Bernardino Sun, June 29, 1983Still, the trial outcome was close.  The jury took a week to convict Cooper, and one juror told reporters that there would have been no conviction \u201cif there had been one less piece of evidence.\u201dCooper was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. on Feb. 10, 2004. On Feb. 9, he was offered a last meal (he turned it down), and led on the \u201cdead man walking\u201d path to a holding area beside the execution cell. He was strip-searched, given new clothes to die in, and guards searched his arms for veins that could be used to administer lethal injections. A pastor visited to pray with him.Yet on what was supposed to be his last day, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of execution, and a few hours before the end, the warden halted the machinery of death.Cooper was now permitted to conduct a new test on the tan T-shirt, and this time the labs found something extraordinary. Yes, that may have been Cooper\u2019s blood on it \u2014 but the blood had a chemical preservative called EDTA in it. That suggested that the blood came not from Cooper directly but from a test tube of his blood. Sure enough, the sheriff\u2019s deputies had taken a sample of Cooper\u2019s blood and had kept it in a test tube with EDTA.This indicated that the sheriff\u2019s office may have used the test tube of Cooper\u2019s blood to frame him, and then topped off the test tube with someone else\u2019s blood.\u201cHow could there be blood from two people? Well, I ask you to remember the teenager\u2019s trick. Drink liquor from mom and dad\u2019s bottle, and then you put some water back in to bring it back up to the line. How do we have blood from two people? Well how do you bring it back up to the line after you\u2019ve taken blood from it?\u201d\u2014 William A. FletcherA United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, speaking about Kevin Cooper\u2019s caseCooper\u2019s case began to get traction. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals en banc refused to hear an appeal by Cooper, but Fletcher wrote a remarkable 100-page dissent, concluding, \u201cThe State of California may be about to execute an innocent man.\u201d Four judges joined in this extraordinary judicial opinion.Cooper\u2019s lawyers ask above all for new \u201ctouch DNA\u201d testing \u2014 capable of detecting microscopic residues  \u2014 of the tan T-shirt, the hatchet and the blond or brown hairs found in the victims\u2019 hands. This might determine who wore the tan T-shirt or handled the hatchet, and whom the hairs came from. Was it Kevin Cooper? Or was it Lee?One reason Brown may be hesitant to weigh in: For four years before becoming governor, he was attorney general, and during that time he suggested that no one on death row was innocent. I hope that this won\u2019t keep him from allowing advanced DNA testing.California voters in 2016 approved a ballot measure to hasten executions. So, depending on how litigation unfolds, Cooper could again be led to the execution chamber sometime in the next year or so \u2014 and even if he delays execution, he feels he is wasting away.\u201cLook at how white my hair is,\u201d Cooper told me, bending over to show how his hair is graying. \u201cI don\u2019t have as much time left. Every day is one I won\u2019t get back.\u201dI was speaking to him in San Quentin Prison, in a cage where inmates are allowed to meet outsiders. Cooper lives on death row in San Quentin, in a 4.5-foot-by-11-foot cell.Cooper told me about his abusive and troubled childhood in Pennsylvania, where he was adopted as a baby. When prosecutors said that Cooper had tangled with the law since the age of 7, they were right, but he says that the reason is that he was running away from home to escape beatings.  His childhood involved shoplifting, marijuana smoking, juvenile detention and negligible education; he never graduated from high school.These days in prison, Cooper has remedied his lack of education with a G.E.D. diploma and comes across as smart, passionate and articulate. But he\u2019s not optimistic that the governor or courts will block his execution.\u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the system.\u201d He also spends his time writing a memoir, which now stands at more than 300 pages. \u201cThat\u2019s my motivating factor to get out of here, to tell my story and tell the truth about this rotten-ass system,\u201d he said.I asked Cooper whom he blamed. The sheriff? The jury? \u201cI blame myself first and foremost, for walking out of Chino prison, for letting those people get their hands on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret that every day of my life.\u201dTime and again, Cooper came back to a larger point: The criminal justice system is unfair to poor people and members of minorities.\u201cI\u2019m frameable, because I\u2019m an uneducated black man in America,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s race, and sometimes it\u2019s class.\u201d\u201cThe only people here on death row to my understanding are the poor,\u201d he added. \u201cEven the white people on death row, they\u2019re poor. If they\u2019re white, racism goes away and classism jumps in and takes its place.\u201dAlthough Cooper\u2019s defenders note that before the murders he had never been convicted of a violent offense, or even charged with one, it\u2019s a bit more complicated: He has been accused of rape without being charged.I\u2019m particularly troubled by one episode. Cooper admits forcing a 17-year-old girl into a vehicle in 1982. She says that he also hit her, threatened to kill her and raped her, and she went afterward to a hospital to seek treatment; he flatly denies hitting or raping her. Hile says that if the evidence had been strong, Cooper would have been charged with rape. For my part, I can\u2019t think why the girl would have lied, and although it\u2019s impossible to know after 36 years what happened, it bothers me.It\u2019s obvious to you by now that this is not a usual column \u2014 I\u2019m not sure The Times has ever published a column of this length \u2014 so why am I exploring the case with such passion? I became interested primarily because Fletcher and other respected federal appeals judges had said he was framed. That just doesn\u2019t happen.Death Row Exonerations By State Since 1973Each shape representsone person releasedfrom death rowCalif.Ill.Fla.Tex.La.Okla.Ariz.N.C.OhioAla.Ga.Penn.Miss.Mass.N.M.Mo.Tenn.Del.Ark.Ind.S.C.Ida.Ky.Md.Neb.Sources: Death Penalty Information Center, news reportsDecades after Cooper\u2019s trial, many of the people involved have died or didn\u2019t want to talk to me. Some who were willing to talk insist that the trial was fair and Cooper was properly convicted.William Baird, the sheriff\u2019s office lab expert who in 1983 found suspicious shoe print evidence supposedly linking Cooper to the crime scene, told me that the evidence was real. He acknowledged having stolen heroin from the evidence room but said that had nothing to do with the evidence against Cooper.I also spoke to Bill Hughes, who discovered the bodies of the Ryens and of his son, Chris. He is certain that Cooper is responsible: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that he did that.\u201d His wife, Mary Ann, is equally passionate: She spoke of her family\u2019s suffering as the case drags on without closure, of her certainty that Cooper is simply trying to distract from overwhelming evidence against him, of her frustration at calls for further testing when there has already been forensic testing for 35 years.I told Bill and Mary Ann Hughes that my heart breaks for them. And of course, I can\u2019t be sure that Kevin Cooper is innocent. One lesson to absorb from the criminal justice system\u2019s past mistakes is that we need some humility about our own ability to ferret out truth.That\u2019s why the governor  should allow advanced DNA testing, especially of the hairs and of the T-shirt and hatchet, and why Dianne Feinstein, Gavin Newsom and other California politicians should back the call.Maybe in the grand scheme of things, the fate of one man on death row doesn\u2019t seem so important; innumerable people die tragically every day. Yet we aspire to be a nation where we are all equal before the law, and if we execute a man in so flawed a case without even bothering to test the evidence rigorously, then a piece of our justice system dies along with Kevin Cooper.Governor Brown, if you\u2019re reading this, I understand that you may believe that Cooper is guilty. But other smart people, including federal judges and law school deans, believe him innocent. So how can you possibly execute him without even allowing advanced DNA testing, at the defense\u2019s expense, to resolve the doubt? What\u2019s your argument for refusing to allow testing?The former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor once wrote that \u201cthe execution of a legally and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event.\u201d She\u2019s right: It is not just Cooper\u2019s life that is at stake, but also the legitimacy of our system of laws. This is a test of Governor Brown, of our justice system, of our politicians, and of us.\u201cThis is bigger than me,\u201d Cooper told me in our prison meeting. \u201cThis is bigger than any one person.\u201dAn interview with San Bernardino County Inmate, Kevin Cooper, edited for clarityAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.S.A. Triples Collection of Data From U.S. Phone Companies", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIntelligence analysts are also more frequently searching for information about Americans within the agency\u2019s expanding collection of so-called call detail records \u2014 telecom metadata logging who contacted whom and when, but not the contents of what they said.He cited a variety of factors that might have contributed to the increase, potentially including changes in the amount of historical data companies are choosing to keep, the number of phone accounts used by each target and changes to how the telecommunications industry creates records based on constantly shifting technology and practices.\u201cBased on what we have learned from this data, we expect it will continue to fluctuate from year to year,\u201d Mr. Joel said.Still, the large and growing volume of data gathered shows that the N.S.A. continues to collect significant amounts of information about Americans\u2019 phone and text messages after changes made by Congress in a 2015 law, the USA Freedom Act, which overhauled how the N.S.A. can gain access to domestic telecom data.That law ended a once-secret program by which the N.S.A. had systematically collected Americans\u2019 domestic phone logs in bulk \u2014 billions of records per day. The program traced back to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and was revealed in 2013 by leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, setting off a wide debate over surveillance and privacy.Though Congress ended that program, lawmakers still wanted the N.S.A. to retain its function: the ability to analyze links between people in search of hidden associates of terrorism suspects. So it authorized a new system in which the bulk records stay with the phone companies but the N.S.A. can get copies of all records of a target and everyone with whom a target has been in contact.The phone companies turn over both whatever historical records they have for targets and for their associates, as well as new logs from calls and texts after the order. The system requires the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to agree that there is \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d that the seed target is linked to terrorism.In 2016, the first full year for which that replacement system was in operation, the government obtained orders to target 42 people and collected just over 151 million call detail records. In 2017, the government obtained orders for 40 targets. (The orders generate data for 180 days, so some of the 2016 orders kept generating additional data in 2017, and some of the 2017 orders may have been reauthorizations of expiring 2016 orders pegged to the same targets.)After the N.S.A. put the record sets obtained from the telecoms into its databases, intelligence analysts queried that data using 31,196 search terms associated with Americans last year, up from 22,360 a year earlier.The large volume of records generated from a relatively small number of targets is attributable to several factors. One is the exponential math associated with gathering the communications logs not just of targets, but of every person with whom a target has been in contact.Another is that some conversations generate more than one record at phone companies. These apparently include back-and-forths via text messages, as well as calls involving cellphone users on the move, whose calls are handled by different cellphone towers.Officials have also cautioned that some records gathered by the N.S.A. are duplicates: A call between an AT&T customer and a Verizon customer, for example, generates records at both companies.The report listed several other notable statistics about surveillance activities. For example, it showed that the number of people whom the surveillance court granted approval to target with wiretaps for national-security purposes dropped somewhat, from 1,687 in 2016 to 1,337 last year.By contrast, the number of targets for the N.S.A.\u2019s warrantless surveillance program \u2014 noncitizens abroad whose communications are collected from American companies like Google \u2014 grew significantly, from 106,469 in 2016 to 129,080 last year.The report contains several statistics about how the government has used Americans\u2019 information that it gathered without a warrant under Section 702. Analysts queried metadata harvested from that program for information about an American 16,924 times in 2017. That was down from 30,355 times the previous year; the report did not explain the drop.F.B.I. agents did not open any criminal investigations into an American that had no connection to national security in 2017 based on Section 702 data, the report said. Nor did they scrutinize any communications in the Section 702 database that came up in response to queries for an American\u2019s information when agents were working on a criminal case that had no connection to foreign intelligence.But the report did not disclose how many times the bureau did either of those things when agents did deem their work to have a foreign intelligence or security link.It also did not disclose the volume of Americans\u2019 communications or metadata gathered by the N.S.A.\u2019s work abroad, where its activities are regulated by Executive Order 12333, not the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and it is permitted to engage in bulk collection.Advertisement"}

On the day she was nominated for a Drama League award, she wondered, \u201cShould I be excited?\u201d as she searched for information about the contest. A week later, glancing at a phone at home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, she beamed as she saw that she had been nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award. And then came the Tony nomination, on a rough morning when her 6-year-old had woken her at 5 a.m., demanding a bath.It\u2019s been a long journey in a short time for this 40-year-old former kindergarten teacher who has been deaf since birth, has no professional stage acting experience, and who describes herself on her Google Plus bio as a \u201cstay at home mama.\u201d As the play\u2019s run nears its end, she is taking meetings with casting directors, posing for photographers, signing autographs at the stage door, saying good night to her two boys (the younger son is now 4; both are deaf) via FaceTime.\u201cMy life has changed in every way,\u201d she said in one of several interviews conducted with the assistance of an American Sign Language interpreter.By now, Ms. Ridloff\u2019s unusual path to Broadway has become a part of the revival\u2019s lore. She had left teaching to take care of her boys when the director Kenny Leon reached out, looking for a sign language tutor. They met in a coffee shop and practiced signs for foodstuffs; they went to a museum to learn colors; they walked under a bridge to study transportation. Every Tuesday for a year, she taught him about sign language, and, in the process, about deafness.Mr. Leon, in the early stages of developing a revival of \u201cChildren of a Lesser God,\u201d had lined up a leading man \u2014 Joshua Jackson, best known for television work including \u201cThe Affair\u201d \u2014 but no leading lady, so he asked Ms. Ridloff to pinch-hit at an early table read. And just like that, without even auditioning, she won the role.\u201cI\u2019m sad that this production is shuttering just when it was picking up speed and force,\u201d Ms. Ridloff said. \u201cI feel that everybody who has been involved in this story \u2014 cast, crew, even audience members \u2014 has changed and emerged better people. We listened.\u201dThe role of Sarah Norman, a cleaning woman who falls for a teacher at a school for the deaf, is a plum one for deaf actresses. Phyllis Frelich won a Tony Award playing the part in the original Broadway production, which opened in 1980, and Marlee Matlin won an Academy Award for the 1986 film adaptation.\u201cThe play had a huge impact on the growing awareness of the deaf community, its culture and American Sign Language,\u201d Ms. Matlin said by email. And Ms. Ridloff, she said, \u201cbrings a fluidity and lightness to the role that I hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201dSome critics have objected to the sexual politics of the play \u2014 a teacher getting involved with a woman he is supposed to be educating \u2014 and its traditionalism \u2014 Sarah\u2019s fantasies are domestic, including a microwave and a blender. \u201cThat\u2019s where you can see, perhaps, the time period the play comes from, and if the play was rewritten now she might be excited about different things,\u201d Ms. Ridloff acknowledged. \u201cBut, in her defense, I got really excited about having a Vitamix.\u201dFor Ms. Ridloff, the most jarring aspect of doing the play has been that it requires her, in one brief, angry scene, to use her voice, which she had ceased doing at age 13 to prevent people from unfairly assessing her intelligence based on her vocal intelligibility. \u201cWhen she gets to that part, that rawness is real,\u201d said Julie Hochgesang, a childhood friend who teaches linguistics at Gallaudet University. \u201cAnd the rest of it \u2014 the woman learning to be her own and being so freaking graceful and strong through all of it \u2014 that\u2019s real too.\u201dMs. Ridloff compares the experience of using her voice during the play to a crotch shot, saying that at first she felt exposed, and vulnerable, and ugly. \u201cI cried thinking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived in fear of that part.\u201d Now, she said, after nearly a year with the role and help from a vocal coach, \u201cit feels empowering to me \u2014 like finally I own every part of myself.\u201d But she said, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever using my voice on a conversational level \u2014 that\u2019s just not who I am.\u201dMr. Jackson, who learned sign language for the play, said Ms. Ridloff demonstrated an unusual fierceness. \u201cThe bravery to unleash that voice, in a room full of strangers, after 20-plus years of not using it, spoke to me about the caliber of that person who was willing to dive into that dark and scary place,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant, and it would be truly stupid of our business not to make a space for a talent like that.\u201dMs. Ridloff grew up in Chicago, where she was born into a hearing family. Her father is Mexican-American, and her mother is African-American. She parries a question about her identity, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cFor me, culturally, I\u2019m deaf,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a deaf woman, and my life choices are made because of my experience of growing up as a deaf person.\u201d\u201cThat was an awesome, amazing experience,\u201d Ms. Ridloff said. \u201cI was just like everybody else.\u201dShe started to pursue the arts, but tentatively. \u201cI was so scared to be around other people, I selected the least popular activity, and that was ceramics,\u201d she said. She went on to explore drama \u2014 she was Dorothy in a production of \u201cThe Wiz\u201d \u2014 and to embrace cheerleading, becoming one of the first deaf cheerleaders to represent the United States in an international competition.Hoping to become a children\u2019s author (still an aspiration), she moved to New York to study education at Hunter College, and took a job teaching kindergarten and first grade at Public School 347, a Manhattan school for children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or born to deaf parents.\u201cOther teachers would come down, just to see her sign a book, because of the beauty of how she would read,\u201d said Gary Wellbrock, her co-teacher. \u201cWhat she did in the classroom is very much what she is doing onstage \u2014 even if you don\u2019t know sign language, she is setting something up that is drawing people in to her, and you want to watch.\u201dThe role of Sarah has proved to be unexpectedly exhausting. Just as singers tax their vocal cords doing eight shows a week, Ms. Ridloff is experiencing strain on her arms and shoulders as she works to make sure her signing is visible toward the back of the theater. And then there is the furious argument her character has with an apprentice teacher over whether to challenge the school\u2019s hiring practices \u2014 a stunning scene in which the characters\u2019 signing, which is not translated for the audience, becomes both faster and bigger. \u201cI\u2019m getting a total workout,\u201d Ms. Ridloff said.To maintain her strength, and calm, Ms. Ridloff runs daily, between three and five miles, generally over the Williamsburg Bridge or into Greenpoint, reviewing lines in her head, or trying to meditate. On two-show days, she runs in Central Park between performances.\u201cSometimes I\u2019m inside this black box all day, and I forget what people are like,\u201d she said, noting that, unlike hearing performers, she can\u2019t tell when the audience is laughing or crying, restless or rapt, except by watching Mr. Jackson\u2019s pacing for cues. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to go out and look at people, to think about their movements and interactions, and I can bring all that with me.\u201dShe\u2019s not sure what\u2019s next \u2014 after \u201cChildren\u201d wraps up, she plans to make homemade (lavender-scented) playdough with her boys, and, she hopes, to take a vacation. But, ultimately, she said, \u201cI feel like acting is a study of humanity, and I am loving that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if casting directors are ready to look at me and think that this woman could be someone that\u2019s more than just deaf,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to be a superhero.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many \u201cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,\u201d he said, and the \u201cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.\u201dIn this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, \u201cPatterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century\u201d:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations \u2014 a factor of about 200,000 difference \u2014 and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots \u2014 and of other methods of replacing workers with machines \u2014 has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.The authors note that \u201cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.\u201d\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.The history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals \u2014 some underwhelming or undoable \u2014 find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant \u2014 not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants \u201ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.\u201dIn other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval \u2014 and the success of this strategy to date \u2014 suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics \u2014 if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday. Walmart is on board.He didn\u2019t join the White House.

The Apple Pay card will be the first credit card issued by Goldman.Sturm Ruger\u2019s C.E.O., Christopher Kilroy, played down the significance of the move, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s it, a report.\u201d And a former N.R.A. executive, Sandra Froman, won re-election to the board.Advertisement"}

Apple finds itself caught between the interests of encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal, which want to prevent anybody from intercepting communications between users, and governments, which want access to messages to identify security risks and other issues.The Russian authorities have repeatedly said Telegram is a threat, claiming that extremists use it to coordinate their efforts. Russian human rights activists and many otherwise apolitical users, however, saw the move as an attempt by the Kremlin to curtail freedoms and as only the first step in a broader plan to introduce online censorship.So far, the attempts to shut Telegram down have been clumsy, with the app remaining available on many devices in Russia, including some that began to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to hide their geographic location from authorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Is Harder Than You Think", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Marcus is a professor of psychology and neural science. Mr. Davis is a professor of computer science.The field of artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t lack for ambition. In January, Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, claimed in an interview that A.I. \u201cis more profound than, I dunno, electricity or fire.\u201dDay-to-day developments, though, are more mundane. Last week, Mr. Pichai stood onstage in front of a cheering audience and proudly showed a video in which a new Google program, Google Duplex, made a phone call and scheduled a hair salon appointment. The program performed those tasks well enough that a human at the other end of the call didn\u2019t suspect she was talking to a computer.Assuming the demonstration is legitimate, that\u2019s an impressive (if somewhat creepy) accomplishment. But Google Duplex is not the advance toward meaningful A.I. that many people seem to think.If you read Google\u2019s public statement about Google Duplex, you\u2019ll discover that the initial scope of the project is surprisingly limited. It encompasses just three tasks: helping users \u201cmake restaurant reservations, schedule hair salon appointments, and get holiday hours.\u201dSchedule hair salon appointments? The dream of artificial intelligence was supposed to be grander than this \u2014 to help revolutionize medicine, say, or to produce trustworthy robot helpers for the home.The reason Google Duplex is so narrow in scope isn\u2019t that it represents a small but important first step toward such goals. The reason is that the field of A.I. doesn\u2019t yet have a clue how to do any better.As Google concedes, the trick to making Google Duplex work was to limit it to \u201cclosed domains,\u201d or highly constrained types of data (like conversations about making hair salon appointments), \u201cwhich are narrow enough to explore extensively.\u201d Google Duplex can have a human-sounding conversation only \u201cafter being deeply trained in such domains.\u201d Open-ended conversation on a wide range of topics is nowhere in sight.The limitations of Google Duplex are not just a result of its being announced prematurely and with too much fanfare; they are also a vivid reminder that genuine A.I. is far beyond the field\u2019s current capabilities, even at a company with perhaps the largest collection of A.I. researchers in the world, vast amounts of computing power and enormous quantities of data.The crux of the problem is that the field of artificial intelligence has not come to grips with the infinite complexity of language. Just as you can make infinitely many arithmetic equations by combining a few mathematical symbols and following a small set of rules, you can make infinitely many sentences by combining a modest set of words and a modest set of rules. A genuine, human-level A.I. will need to be able to cope with all of those possible sentences, not just a small fragment of them.The narrower the scope of a conversation, the easier it is to have. If your interlocutor is more or less following a script, it is not hard to build a computer program that, with the help of simple phrase-book-like templates, can recognize a few variations on a theme. (\u201cWhat time does your establishment close?\u201d \u201cI would like a reservation for four people at 7 p.m.\u201d) But mastering a Berlitz phrase book doesn\u2019t make you a fluent speaker of a foreign language. Sooner or later the non sequiturs start flowing.To be fair, Google Duplex doesn\u2019t literally use phrase-book-like templates. It uses \u201cmachine learning\u201d techniques to extract a range of possible phrases drawn from an enormous data set of recordings of human conversations. But the basic problem remains the same: No matter how much data you have and how many patterns you discern, your data will never match the creativity of human beings or the fluidity of the real world. The universe of possible sentences is too complex. There is no end to the variety of life \u2014 or to the ways in which we can talk about that variety.So what should the field of artificial intelligence do instead? Once upon a time, before the fashionable rise of machine learning and \u201cbig data,\u201d A.I. researchers tried to understand how complex knowledge could be encoded and processed in computers. This project, known as knowledge engineering, aimed not to create programs that would detect statistical patterns in huge data sets but to formalize, in a system of rules, the fundamental elements of human understanding, so that those rules could be applied in computer programs. Rather than merely imitating the results of our thinking, machines would actually share some of our core cognitive abilities.That job proved difficult and was never finished. But \u201cdifficult and unfinished\u201d doesn\u2019t mean misguided. A.I. researchers need to return to that project sooner rather than later, ideally enlisting the help of cognitive psychologists who study the question of how human cognition manages to be endlessly flexible.Today\u2019s dominant approach to A.I. has not worked out. Yes, some remarkable applications have been built from it, including Google Translate and Google Duplex. But the limitations of these applications as a form of intelligence should be a wake-up call. If machine learning and big data can\u2019t get us any further than a restaurant reservation, even in the hands of the world\u2019s most capable A.I. company, it is time to reconsider that strategy.Gary Marcus is a professor of psychology and neural science and Ernest Davis is a professor of computer science, both at New York University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. vs. U.S.: How Much of Your Personal Data Can You Get?", "Date": "2018-05-20", "News": "Advertisement\nThat is a sweeping right to data access that Americans don\u2019t have.So we decided to conduct a privacy experiment: Request our data in both Britain and the United States, to get a sense of how easy it will be for people in Europe to access their personal information compared with American users.The results were not what we expected.It showed that I had used OpenTable to make a dinner reservation in March at a \u201ccasual\u201d Indian restaurant in London, that I had read a CNN article on President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, that I was looking to buy a new cellphone and was considering a trip to Stellenbosch, South Africa.Then there were the 343 marketing classifications Quantcast had obtained about me from data brokers, companies that sell consumers\u2019 details for marketing purposes.The categorizations had me pegged as a \u201cheavy spender\u201d on pet food (I have a cat), an owner of a flat-screen TV, and part of a \u201clikely nonsmoking household.\u201d My colleagues in London will be unsurprised to learn that among my \u201cinterests\u201d are biscuits and chocolate.But the report also suggested there was a 3 percent likelihood that I am a woman above the age of 65, and that I own a car. (I am, to be clear, a man in my 30s. I got my first driver\u2019s license a few months ago and do not own a car.)The Quantcast spokesman added that the company responded to data access requests under European law. So sending me any data at all had been an error \u2014 because consumers in the United States do not have a comprehensive right to obtain copies of the data held by American companies.Order history.Amazon sent lists of the items my wife and I had bought through the site, the credit cards we used to buy them, the addresses the items were shipped to and the devices we had used to access Amazon services.But we had expected to receive a more substantial data trove from Amazon. So I wrote back to Amazon asking again for all of the details the company had on me, including our household\u2019s video-viewing data.The company said it was \u201cinvestigating\u201d and would send the missing data when it was ready. There is still no sign of it. An Amazon spokesman added that the company was committed to complying with the new European privacy law.But I wanted the complete history of my account, such as my Amazon searches.Amazon responded to my email request by telling me to call the company \u2014 because it was \u201cnot safe to get account details via email due to security reasons.\u201d Then I called Amazon customer service and was put on hold for 15 minutes while an agent scrambled to figure out a response.Finally, the agent came back on the line only to tell me that Amazon was keeping records on me for business purposes \u2014 but would not share them with me. \u201cIt\u2019s all private,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI don\u2019t have access to that information to provide you, unfortunately.\u201dThe standard public information, but not everything I asked for.The standard public information, but not everything I asked for.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, recently testified in a Senate hearing that his company\u2019s download tool contains \u201call of the information\u201d that users have \u201cput into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them.\u201dWe were unable to obtain that kind of information, however.None provided us with copies of that raw information.Instead, from LinkedIn, we each received emails directing us to use the company\u2019s self-service tool. Among other things, our LinkedIn downloads included the email addresses of our connections.Facebook told Natasha that its self-service data download tool \u201chas been reviewed by our data protection regulator\u201d and would allow her \u201cto access all of your Facebook data.\u201d The company told Prashant that the self-service tool would allow him to access only \u201cthe Facebook information available to you\u201d and that the company \u201cisn\u2019t able to provide additional information.\u201dAfter we contacted LinkedIn\u2019s press department, we received emails the next day saying that the company was working on our requests. A LinkedIn spokeswoman said that users could automatically download \u201cthe most commonly requested data\u201d and that the company did not currently plan to change its data request process.As we all become more aware of fraudulent news and online voter influence campaigns, researchers, journalists and consumers have been seeking their personal details from companies to try to understand how we might be manipulated.

When he contacted the company as a reporter, Three said it could not give details on the particular case for privacy reasons, but added that it would typically send a letter asking for proof of identity before proceeding with a data request.

{"Headline": "Women on the Allure of Driving the Rallye des Princesses", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe concept reads like a dream: five days spent driving classic cars from Paris to Southern France, stopping off along the way for leisurely lunches and nights in four- and five-star hotels.Some 90 women will take part in the six-day race starting on Saturday in Paris and will travel some 1,000 miles of meandering roads in France and northern Spain, before crossing the finish line in Biarritz on the Atlantic coast of France.The first Rallye des Princesses in 2000 even included actual royalty: it counted among its entrants Princess Helene of Yugoslavia. She competed again in 2002 and 2006.The rally\u2019s appeal extends beyond European royalty, and many of the 180 entrants this year are simply women who are passionate about cars and racing. Anne Sampeur of France, who first took part in 2014, came across the event by accident, when she stumbled across the start of the race in Paris.\u201cI discovered the Rallye des Princesses while strolling Place Vend\u00f4me with friends about 10 years ago,\u201d Sampeur recalled. \u201cAt the time, we had an HMC \u2014 an Austin-Healey replica, but my husband didn\u2019t want to lend me his car. When I was ready to register, we bought a silver gray 1979 convertible Beetle.\u201dSince 2014, Sampeur has entered the rally with friends and family, and in 2017 competed alongside her 14-year-old daughter, Matisse, who served as navigator. The pair entered a navy blue 1979 Alfa Romeo Spider 1600. \u201cIt was great,\u201d Sampeur said.While the vintage cars add to the glamour, open-top vehicles running at an average of 25 to 30 miles per hour along glorious country roads, the drive is often not smooth because of the age of the vehicles.\u201cWe place a particular premium on comfort, as the performance involved in driving a vintage car for 350 kilometers per day on country roads is one that ought to be paired with a well-earned rest,\u201d said Viviane Zaniroli, the founder of the event.That well-earned rest includes spa treatments, luxury hotels, Champagne receptions and fine dining every evening, with a party at the finish line to round off the adventure.One regular participant is Coralie Chehab of Switzerland, entering her fifth Rallye des Princesses this year. Chehab is passionate about the event. \u201cSo many anecdotes, so many crazy laughs, so many memories to tell. Rallye des Princesses is not just a rally, it\u2019s a vacation with 200 friends and cars.\u201dThe Rallye des Princesses is open only to vintage cars \u2014 those registered before 1989 \u2014 split into groups roughly by decade. Some entrants own the cars, while others borrow from friends or drive cars furnished by sponsors.Chehab shares \u201can amazing 1967 gray convertible Mercedes-Benz 250SL Pagoda\u201d with her co-driver and friend Ga\u00eblle Wacziarg. The car is provided by a sponsor.\u201cThis beauty is definitely part of our team; she even has a name now \u2014 we call her Titine,\u201d Chehab said. \u201cDriving this car is a real pleasure, even though she is 50 years old. She is very comfortable and super easy to drive. A dream for this kind of rally.\u201dChehab entered the rally at the urging of Wacziarg, who returned from her first event full of enthusiasm.\u201cI always had an interest in cars and always loved driving, but never thought I could participate in something so exceptional as the Rallye des Princesses,\u201d Chehab said. \u201cIn the end, it didn\u2019t take much to convince me to take part in this great adventure.\u201dOne of the advantages of driving a loaner vehicle at a rally is that maintenance is taken care of by the car\u2019s owner.\u201cWe are pretty lucky with Titine; we never had serious mechanical problems,\u201d Chebab said. \u201cShe is very well maintained by our sponsor \u2014 he always makes a check before and after every rally.\u201cThe car suffers a lot during the week, with the changes of temperature \u2014 Paris during the spring is not always sunny, while in the South of France the weather is already warm \u2014 and I think the worst for the Pagoda is when the road book takes us into the mountains,\u201d she said about the route map. \u201cShe is a heavy car and not really made for climbing.\u201dSampeur struggled in 2015, breaking the clutch on her 1968 MGC at the end of the first day.\u201cWith the help of the MG club, I managed to find a garage to repair it with a clutch disc for an old car \u2014 47 years old! So we didn\u2019t run one day and took 7,000 penalty points,\u201d she said.\u201cOn Tuesday, the hose was drilled. We saw the problem before departing for a regularity trial. We parked the car, and with rags and Scotch tape we fixed it to keep it going until lunch, where the great team of mechanics repaired it with real tools.\u201cOn Wednesday, the reverse gear decided to collapse, so we couldn\u2019t make U-turns \u2014 to park the car we needed the help of mechanics to push us. And to finish the rally, before arriving in Saint-Tropez, our rearview mirror fell off. We laughed for a long time.\u201dMaking her Rallye des Princesses debut this year is Susan Fesmire of Texas, who will be driving a 1970 Triumph convertible.\u201cThis is my first R.D.P., but I suspect not my last, and this may all sound over the top, but I have had more fun getting ready for this event than anything I have ever done,\u201d she said.\u201cI first learned about the rally from a friend of mine in 2014. Her adventure sounded so glamorous and challenging,\u201d she said.\u201cOver the next two years I thought of the race often. I frequently checked the race website and Googled images from past races. I was fascinated by the idea of a race for nonracers, the gorgeous French countryside, sleek historic cars and chateaus all with your best girlfriend. When I pored over Rallye pictures, they showed beautiful women of all ages, from all countries, who seemed not unlike me. They looked amazing, but also real.\u201cThe idea of participating stayed in the back of my mind,\u201d Fesmire said. \u201cThen one Sunday morning in August 2016, I was looking at the Rallye website and decided that I was going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I had to do was convince my best friend to go with me.\u201d\u201cThat Sunday morning was over a year and a half ago, and the allure of the race has not waned for Suzanne or me,\u201d she said of her friend and co-driver Suzanne Swaner, also of Texas. \u201cThe 19th Rallye des Princesses has given us almost two years of planning, strategizing and daydreaming about six amazing days spent behind the wheel of a gorgeous red convertible, laughing with my best friend while participating in the most glamorous all-women car rally in the world. It just doesn\u2019t get any better.\u201dNazanin Lankarani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 CBS continues its insurrection against its controlling shareholder.\u2022 The chief executive of Campbell Soup retired abruptly.\u2022 Is Qualcomm\u2019s purchase of NXP more likely now?\u2022 Why to be skeptical of China\u2019s reported trade concession.\u2022 The issues behind a bailout of 666 Fifth Ave.The details\u2022 Mr. Blankfein\u2019s exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm\u2019s annual dinner for retired partners in December. Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that.That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April\u2019s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a \u201creal\u201d mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level.Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that \u201cspread\u201d would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent.Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal.Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisBoth sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court.Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes.ContextMany have pushed back against Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. They point out that Amazon, the largest single shipper of packages, has been a boon for the agency at a time when it has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships.Denise M. Morrison, the chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., retired abruptly on Friday after nearly seven years in the job. Keith R. McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis.\u2022 Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison\u2019s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent.\u2022 With Ms. Morrison\u2019s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin.\u2022 Campbell\u2019s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company\u2019s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell\u2019s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year.\u2014 Tiffany HsuContext\u2022 Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm\u2019s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba.\u2022 On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba.Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase.Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn\u2019t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right. But Mr. Kushner remains financially tied to Kushner Companies, which has sought to do business with Anbang of China and Qatar.

{"Headline": "In the Dance Lab With Martha Graham", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "There were hits and misses, and a spirit of exploration, as the Graham company tried out new technologies during a two-week Google residency.Supported byAt Google\u2019s New York offices, a tiny room with bright green walls and a maze of wires had been transformed into something resembling a science lab, by way of a Danny Kaye movie. But instead of microscopes and white coats, there were dancers and leotards.The dancers\u2019 bodies were wired to move, though not just for movement\u2019s sake: This was a laboratory for dance experiments.Google \u2014 through Google Arts and Culture \u2014 is on a mission to find new ways of braiding technology with culture. For two weeks in May it partnered with the Martha Graham Dance Company for a residency in which members of the Graham team worked with artists and Google technologists on several experiments. (Google has held several artist residencies in its lab in Paris, but this is the first time dance has been featured.)Why the Graham company? For M J. Newman, the project lead at Google, the relationship with the Graham organization is, in part, because of its forward-thinking mentality. \u201cThe Graham center has always been very eager about being on the cutting-edge of technology and looking for what\u2019s new,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were the first ones that jumped into my head.\u201d It\u2019s fitting: The company\u2019s founder, Martha Graham (1894-1991), was a revolutionary. Considered the mother of modern dance, she transformed her art form by stripping her movement, rooted in the pelvis, down to its purest essence.During the recent residency, some projects were more successful than others, but all were well worth watching: Dancers moved silkily inside 3D environments that were then projected onto screens for mixed-reality experiences. Graham\u2019s \u201cLamentation,\u201d from 1930, was reimagined using archival imagery of the solo projected onto a moving dancer. And a Graham dance was captured in 3D, transforming Anne Souder, in a motion-capture suit, into an avatar \u2014 like a figure in a video game \u2014 when her performance was transferred to the screen.\u201cWe have discovered that the essential Graham canon \u2014 the very best of Graham \u2014 is so pure that it can be dressed up in a whole variety of ways and still speak clearly,\u201d Ms. Eilber said in an interview. \u201cYou can decorate it in many different ways or use it as a springboard for many different things.\u201d For Ms. Eilber, technology is a tool with which to do that.Would Graham approve? \u201cShe, if anyone, understood and desired new ways of getting to audiences,\u201d Ms. Eilber said. \u201cMartha wanted those techniques.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do the pelvis,\u201d the visual artist SoHyun Bae said in one of the sessions. As the Graham dancer Natasha Diamond-Walker put on a virtual-reality headset, Ms. Bae said, \u201cJust think of yourself as water.\u201d Gradually, Ms. Diamond-Walker began to move, stretching ribbonlike arms as she carved through the space. Ms. Eilber asked three other dancers, Laurel Dalley-Smith, Xin Ying and Ms. Souder, to enter the performance area, one by one. \u201cYou decide when to come in,\u201d she said. \u201cBuild off the nymph that goes in before you.\u201d It\u2019s a sensorial shift for dancers to enter virtual reality, one that has changed their relationship with their bodies and with their dancing. \u201cYou become so absorbed in your world that it\u2019s almost freer,\u201d Ms. Dalley-Smith said. \u201cYou\u2019re not so self-conscious; you\u2019re not thinking or just feeling about what\u2019s coming next. You\u2019re fed by this world.\u201d Before the residency, Ms. Bae spent months making charcoal sketches of the Graham dancers at the company\u2019s studios simply because, as she put it, \u201cI feel so alive watching them.\u201dShe became proficient with Tilt Brush, which aided her in creating 3D performance landscapes, but she also painted while the dancers performed \u2014 essentially tracing their shapes and moving with them as they did sections from Graham works or Graham-inspired improvisations. She often finished those sessions as out of breath as they were.Of these experiments, Ms. Eilber said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t transcend, but they did tell us what the potential was going to be.\u201d And they gave her ideas for the future: In other words, Ms. Eilber said, you could have an artist create a virtual set and a choreographer create for that virtual world: \u201cHow that would serve us, where it would live? Those are all questions we have.\u201dAs Ms. Diamond-Walker performed it \u2014 with her body half-obscured behind a scrim \u2014 archival images from past performances flashed by, mirroring her positions as the Kinect camera pulled photographs from a database that Mr. Henry had created.\u201cWith our dancer dancing behind the scrim and then the rapid-fire harrowing poses from other generations overlaid on top of her,\u201d Ms. Eilber said, \u201cit transformed and transcended into being a real work of art.\u201d For Ms. Diamond-Walker, the process was eerie. She could see the images of past dancers, including Graham, go by \u2014 their poses revealing profound pain and grief \u2014 as she moved through the choreography in slow-motion. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of seduced by the technology,\u201d Ms. Eilber said. \u201cBut pretty quickly I realized, wait a minute \u2014 why us? Why dancers, and why Martha Graham dancers? That has to be part of the equation. Otherwise, you\u2019re just playing around like you\u2019re at a kid\u2019s birthday party.\u201d In the coming weeks, the company will discuss how the experiments that worked \u2014 namely Mr. Henry\u2019s \u201cLamentation\u201d \u2014 can make their way into the real world. A couple of presenters, Ms. Eilber said, including Jacob\u2019s Pillow and Carolina Performing Arts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, are interested. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together something that is substantial enough to install somewhere, and we think we have a lot of the elements,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the time to think about next steps.\u201d And the question remains: Is it better than just dancing? \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re trying to make \u2018Lamentation\u2019 better, by any means,\u201d Ms. Eilber said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find new ways to consider Graham\u2019s art form.\u201d Collaborating with Google has allowed that to happen. \u201cMy main revelation was that Graham had to be about Graham being integrated with technology,\u201d she said, \u201cnot just playing around with technology. We don\u2019t feel like we reached the end of the journey, but we found potential.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Single-Payer Health Care in California: Here\u2019s What It Would Take", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf wholesale opposition to President Trump is one litmus test for progressive Democrats, another \u2014 as the governor\u2019s race in California is proving \u2014 is health care.All the leading Democratic contenders in the June 5 primary have pledged support for a single-payer system run by the state. The front-runner, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, has made it the centerpiece of his campaign.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to wait around on universal health care and single-payer in California,\u201d he has declared.\u201cVoters are thinking about the fundamental values associated with single-payer,\u201d said Kelly Hall, an independent health consultant who works with the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers in California, which has endorsed Mr. Newsom. \u201cAlmost zero voters have thought about the policy implications.\u201dIn this case, \u201cimplications\u201d could be another word for booby traps. Even a state as big, wealthy and liberal as California \u2014 with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and nearly 40 million people \u2014 would find itself hamstrung by money, a legal and regulatory thicket, and highly motivated opposition.Visionary thinking is needed to create an independent, state-run system that\u2019s responsible for every resident\u2019s health care and prescription drugs \u2014 but so is getting the authority, financing and political support.Any state trying a go-it-alone strategy will face challenges possibly more vexing than the ones Congress would confront in passing a nationwide law.To redirect Medicare funds, California would require a federal waiver \u2014 something unlikely to be granted by any administration.Medicare is popular, and federal officials are unlikely to allow a state to engineer a wholesale Medicare takeover. Californians might not be too happy, either. Once California \u2014 and not the federal government \u2014 were to be the single payer, then the current Medicare program would no longer be an option. If would be replaced by a new California version.A bigger stumbling block comes from employer plans, which cover roughly 43 percent of Californians. Federal law, in effect, prohibits states and localities from dictating how private employers that self-insure should structure their plans. So employers unwilling to take part in a California-run insurance system wouldn\u2019t have to.Officials could try to persuade them by offering cheaper coverage and fewer administrative headaches. But if, say, Google and Disney want to stick with the coverage they have, they can. Changing that law would require an act of Congress.Let\u2019s, for the moment, magically eliminate the legal and regulatory roadblocks: Poof! California transfers its share of Medicaid and Medicare money to its own single-payer system, and it convinces every private employer to drop its existing coverage and join.Broader health coverage could also help reduce pricey emergency-room visits and improve preventive care, which could head off more serious illnesses and higher costs down the road.About half that sum could come from existing Medicare and Medicaid dollars, according to the analysis. What employees and employers currently spend would cover another $100 billion to $150 billion.

{"Headline": "\u2018I Don\u2019t Feel Superhuman. I Feel Like a Mom Who Has a Career.\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Rebecca Slaughter\u2019s recent Monday morning started out in a pretty typical way for a working mother of a newborn. She woke at 2 a.m. to feed, burp and change the diaper on her then-7-week-old daughter, Pippa. She repeated the routine three hours later.By 6:30 a.m., Ms. Slaughter checked her email and schedule while fixing breakfast for her two older children, ages 3 and 5. Her commute started at 8, driving her Honda minivan from her home in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, while hooked up to a hands-free electric breast pump.It was when she arrived at the office about a half-hour later that her day took an unusual turn. She checked into the neoclassical Federal Trade Commission Building in the nation\u2019s capital, with Pippa in tow, as one of the country\u2019s top business regulators \u2014 and the first to do the job with a baby in the office.For the next several weeks, until Pippa goes to day care as a slightly older baby, she will join Ms. Slaughter on the fifth floor, either in a gray bouncy seat behind a desk or nestled in a wrap attached to her mother\u2019s chest. It was the imperfect but best solution for Ms. Slaughter, whose appointment in March to serve as an F.T.C. commissioner just happened to coincide with the birth of her third child.\u201cI am tired,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said as she put on a nursing cover for a late morning feeding. \u201cI don\u2019t feel superhuman. I feel like a mom who has a career about which she cares very much and a family about which she cares very much. And I\u2019m trying to navigate the two.\u201dMs. Slaughter, a longtime legal adviser to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, didn\u2019t think about turning down the job offer. She did have some doubts about how she could pull off the schedule of raising three children and taking a senior position in government, but the opportunity was too good to pass up.The work culture for families has been stubbornly slow to change in Washington. To take a position of leadership in federal agencies, on Capitol Hill or in the White House requires long and unpredictable hours. Modest pay, demanding travel and meager family leave benefits also deter many women from rising in the government ranks.Such considerations have held back female representation in every corner of government. Women comprise 20 percent of Congress. They hold a quarter of the cabinet posts in the Trump administration.But recently, there have been signs of change. The federal government has slowly reconfigured buildings to accommodate new moms, with lactation rooms at most agencies and in Congress. In April, Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, became the first member of the Senate to deliver a baby during her tenure. Shortly after, lawmakers changed the rules to allow children on the Senate floor.But Ms. Slaughter does have an office that allows her to nurse the baby and pump in private, and for Pippa to nap in quiet. She divides most household duties with her husband, Justin Slaughter, a political and business consultant.\u201cBringing a baby to work is not the right choice for every mom or dad, nor do many have that option,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said.Three months ago, Ms. Slaughter, who goes by Becca, was working as the top lawyer for Mr. Schumer. After a decade working in his office, she was asked to consider filling an empty Democratic slot at the trade commission.Pippa was born on April 2. Ideally, Ms. Slaughter would have had a longer maternity leave, like she did with her two older children when working for Mr. Schumer. Each day since her nomination in April has felt like a \u201cconfluence of high-intensity events\u201d that she approaches day by day, she said.As part of her nomination, she testified before senators nine days after giving birth to Pippa. She made sure to feed the baby minutes before the hearing in case it ran extra long. Her husband held Pippa in the carrier during the hearing.\u201cI kept telling myself the only way out is through. I have to get through it if I want to be on the other side of this,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said of the two-hour hearing. \u201cIf I want to have this amazing baby and job then I need to put my head down and get through it.\u201dBefore her first day, she informed the four other F.T.C. commissioners about her plan to bring Pippa to the office and received their unanimous support. She organizes her days accordingly, only accepting meetings and speaking engagements where she can take the baby. Two weeks ago, she appeared onstage at a privacy conference hosted by the Future of Privacy Forum for a question-and-answer session. Pippa shared the stage, asleep in her carrier.\u201cBoth Becca and Pippa are wonderful additions to the F.T.C. family,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman, Joe Simons, a Republican, said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Becca made the decision to begin her tenure as a commissioner so soon after the birth of her daughter.\u201dThe work itself is right in her sweet spot. Ms. Slaughter spent much of her time in Mr. Schumer\u2019s office working on consumer protection and antitrust issues, and is now on the F.T.C. amid an uproar of the practices of Silicon Valley giants. The agency is investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy practices and Equifax\u2019s massive data breach. Consumer groups and smaller tech rivals have called on the F.T.C. to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon amid growing antitrust concerns.It is unclear whether Ms. Slaughter\u2019s decision to bring Pippa to the F.T.C. will pave the way for other high-level government officials to combine work and motherhood. Some \u2014 but not all \u2014 agencies have day care on-site, and government employees aren\u2019t guaranteed spots for their children.But Ms. Slaughter\u2019s male colleagues say her decision helps all working parents. Noah Phillips, a Republican commissioner and parent of young children, said it was important for the F.T.C. staff to know that Pippa would be a daily fixture.\u201cIt sends good signals in a lot of different ways,\u201d he said.Three weeks into the job at the F.T.C., some of the adrenaline has begun to wear off. Sleep deprivation was setting in.Ms. Slaughter is trying to spend more time with her older children as they adjust to her job change and their new younger sibling. She\u2019s determined to attend a baby and me yoga class at least once a week during the lunch hour. For now, she isn\u2019t planning to attend out-of-town speeches and conferences or the dinners and cocktail parties that typically attract government officials.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anyone when you try to make it look easy,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, a former chief counsel for Mr. Schumer who is also a mother of three children and a close confidant of Ms. Slaughter\u2019s. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go on that trip to Europe. And you need to conquer your doubts.\u201dOn the recent Monday morning, Ms. Slaughter walked with Pippa in the carrier to a nearby restaurant for a business lunch. Then mother and baby were back in the office for several meetings and a block of time to go over papers on cases pending before the F.T.C. She kept her promise to leave the office by 5 p.m. to have dinner with family at home. But she was online again after the two older children were asleep around 8 p.m.By 10 p.m., she was in bed.\u201cIt\u2019s like a marathon,\u201d she said of her day. The race would begin again in about four hours.An earlier version of this article misidentified Senator Tammy Duckworth as the first member of Congress to deliver a baby during her tenure. She was the first senator to do so.Advertisement"}

Minh Uong, a visual editor for The Times\u2019s business section, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Can you explain your creative process for making and planning illustrations for The Times?Being the visual editor for the business section, I\u2019m responsible for providing artwork that illuminates stories that are hard to photograph. It\u2019s a challenging task at times, since our section features articles with topics that are difficult to visualize. Try to think of images that relate to private equity, net neutrality or the trade deficit.I doodled my first thought in my sketchbook using a black Paper Mate pen showing people stealing and running away with images of Mark and Sheryl. Then I sketched a different concept showing a group of scammers hiding behind Mark and Sheryl masks.My second sketch got approved. To finish the illustration would require some time to draw the masks of Mark and Sheryl. I was planning to use Adobe\u2019s drawing program, Illustrator, and my old 10-inch Wacom tablet. But with only a few hours before our print deadline, I decided to pursue creating the art with photography instead, and needed to create props for people to hold during a photo shoot.So I printed out 10 full-size faces of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on our color Canon copier-printer combo. I trimmed them with my X-Acto knife. Luckily, I had saved disposable chopsticks from my Chinese takeout orders, and they made perfect handles for the masks. I proceeded to Scotch tape all the chopsticks to the back of each mask.After I finished with the props, I wrangled eight colleagues to be in our photo shoot. We went to our in-house photo studio in the basement, where our staff photographer tried several lighting techniques to capture the moody and surreal picture.You also hire illustrators for The Times. Have tech tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil, or Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablets, made it easier for people to draw things and lowered the barrier to entry for becoming a professional illustrator?But I believe you still need certain artistic skills to become an illustrator. You need to have a discerning eye and to be able to communicate by creating a visual vocabulary that\u2019s uniquely your own. As an illustrator, you have to establish your point of view to solve problems and to go beyond just tracing a picture.Are the works by illustrators you commission created by pen and paper or on the computer?Time is of the essence when dealing with editorial illustration. Today, most artists are tech savvy. Some will start their project using traditional techniques like drawing in ink or painting with acrylics. Then they finalize it in Photoshop or a graphics program. This ultimately will save a lot of time.Working digitally makes it even easier to send in the final artwork. Before, I used to wait for overnight packages from FedEx or U.P.S. Now artists can take work right until the deadline and then just send their projects by email.The beauty of that is the artists get to keep their original work. And since The Times buys only the first-time printing rights, original artwork has to be sent back to its creators. I don\u2019t miss having to repackage artwork to send back to people in the mail.Have you tried doing your entire workflow on a tech product such as the iPad or a drawing tablet? Is there anything that tech companies could do to improve their products to get you to adopt a completely digital workflow?I wish there were a better tablet out there that could convert my sketches into editable vector images while I am drawing. There could be one out there that I\u2019m not aware of.Outside of work, what tech products do you and your family use heavily? As for me, I stare at my monitor at work all day. When I\u2019m home, I try to limit my time playing with other devices. But I\u2019m perfectly content with my iPhone. Every day, I enjoy using the usual apps, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Words With Friends, Pinterest \u2014 and of course The Times\u2019s app!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Traditional TV Is in Trouble", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision networks will draw hordes of advertisers to New York City this week for their annual bonanza of presentations and parties, a decades-old tradition known as the upfronts that is meant to dazzle marketers and loosen their purse strings.But beneath the sparkle and the canap\u00e9s, the networks are also navigating a serious advertising upheaval. Ratings are on the decline, especially among young people, some of whom don\u2019t even own televisions. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the many devices and apps people now use to watch shows. And there is a host of material from Silicon Valley that is competing for viewers\u2019 attention, including Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Netflix. It all adds up to a precarious situation for broadcast TV.Advertising on TV has long been the best way for marketers to reach a large number of people at one time. And it is still a formidable medium. But cracks are showing.National TV ad sales peaked in 2016, when they exceeded $43 billion, according to data from Magna, the ad-buying and media intelligence arm of IPG Mediabrands. Sales fell 2.2 percent last year, and the firm estimates that they will fall at least 2 percent each year through 2022.Some of the decline could be mitigated through new business with platforms like Hulu, but \u201cit\u2019s not yet enough to upset the decrease of traditional sales,\u201d said Vincent Letang, Magna\u2019s executive vice president of global market intelligence. At the same time, he said, while networks have raised the cost of advertising on their airwaves in recent years, ratings have declined sharply, including some in unexpected areas like the National Football League.TV is still a good value for plenty of advertisers. Mr. Letang said pharmaceuticals and personal care products were increasing their presences on TV. But the combination of rising prices and falling viewership is giving some big brands pause.As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have increasingly focused on expanding their video \u2014 and video ad \u2014 business.Old Navy has long been a prominent TV advertiser, and television remains crucial to the company\u2019s marketing. But the way Old Navy defines TV advertising has evolved, said Jamie Gersch, its chief marketing officer.Those opting out of traditional TV packages are watching Netflix and videos on Amazon Prime, and to a lesser extent, paying for services like Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence.As networks navigate these changes, they are moving to reduce the number of ads they show. Ads, after all, make money, but they also annoy viewers. Last year, the average number of commercial minutes during an hour of broadcast TV was 13.6, according to Nielsen data.So if there are fewer commercials, how do companies market their products?Ralph Heim, vice president of media and sponsorships at Sonic Drive-In, said he was intrigued by several of the new data targeting products for television ads. But he remains concerned about how the announcements on limited ads fit with a declining audience.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a more premium advertising experience for advertisers, and they\u2019re hoping that people will pay more,\u201d even though the audience is smaller, Mr. Heim said.He added, \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re following the eyeballs, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Keep Track of the Trade Fights: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Italy\u2019s political chaos could rock Europe\u2019s finances.\u2022 Congress doesn\u2019t want to go easy on ZTE.\u2022 Silicon Valley founders still want total control of their start-ups.A word of advice: Dates are your friend.So why would the Trump administration bring back the threat of tariffs now? One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote:Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up.This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China.Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs.So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible.\u2014 Peter EavisThe $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval.What\u2019s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department\u2019s antitrust chief. They emphasize \u201cstructural\u201d changes to the company \u2014 as in sales of businesses \u2014 rather than \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct.To Mr. Delrahim\u2019s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That\u2019s something that he has said the department would not do.What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday\u2019s agreement:\u201cThis comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns\u2014the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States\u2014preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \u201cWe commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedHis suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led \u201cMarshall Plan for Africa\u201d that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration.But that runs counter to the E.U.\u2019s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more:Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases.Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it\u2019s attractive to belong to:Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project.All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation\u2019s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out.But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating \u2014 and postnatally influential \u2014 around the world.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMaking smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more \u2014 and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.)The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple\u2019s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020.Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don\u2019t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones.Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of? Certainly.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u201cWith more than 10,000 customers and 6,000 employees, BMC is a global leader in managing digital and I.T. infrastructure with a broad portfolio of software solutions,\u201d Herald Chen, the head of KKR\u2019s technology, media and telecom team, and John Park, another KKR executive, said in a statement.In this case, KKR is buying BMC from Bain Capital, Golden Gate Capital, Singapore\u2019s G.I.C. sovereign wealth fund, Insight Venture Partners and Elliott Management.The advisers on the deal: For BMC: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.For KKR: Macquarie Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Financing will come from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCTRL-Labs, a three-year-old start-up whose co-founders include the creator of Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, has a vision of how humans could one day interact with computers: It\u2019s making an armband that reads electrical impulses sent from users\u2019 brains to their fingers.\u201cIf we can recreate virtually what the hand is doing, then we\u2019ve captured all the information that\u2019s coming out of the muscles themselves,\u201d Thomas Reardon, a CTRL-Labs co-founder and the Internet Explorer creator, told me in an interview. (Mr. Reardon argued that smartphones actually represented a step backward, introducing an imperfect way to control computers even as it let consumers gobble up more information.)And the start-up has signed up some heavyweight investors. In this round: Lux Capital and Google\u2019s GV venture arm, as well as Paul Allen\u2019s Vulcan Capital, Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, and Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund.Josh Wolfe of Lux Capital told me, \u201cThe gap between sci-fi and sci-fact keeps shrinking.\u201dThe big questionI saw a demo of the device, where Patrick Kaifosh, another CTRL-Labs co-founder played Asteroids by just thinking. And another employee sent a somewhat creepy-looking spider robot across a table without moving a finger.But brain-computer interfaces are notoriously hard to push out of prototype. Can CTRL-Labs do it? And will developers and consumers buy in if they can?\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe coffee shop giant will close 8,000 stores for four hours this afternoon. Why? To put employees through racial bias training. The move has drawn jeers, but Andrew argues it\u2019s a laudable effort \u2014 if only because so few American corporations have been willing to tackle race issues.Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.All eyes have been on the E.U.\u2019s sweeping new digital privacy rules. But an even stricter set of laws known as ePrivacy \u2014 meant to come in at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation, but slowed down by disagreements among officials \u2014 could give tech companies still larger headaches.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.Unsurprisingly, companies and trade associations are trying to derail those rules.C.E.O. Adam Neumann, who has 65 percent voting control, is one of two members of his board\u2019s compensation committee, along with longtime company investor Benchmark, according to WeWork\u2019s recent bond-offering documents.Venture capitalists have surrendered some oversight of many companies they\u2019ve invested in just to maintain relationships with them.\u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Must Go to War", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Kirchhoff helped lead a Pentagon group that integrates technology from startups into military missions.Should technologists prevent their tools from being used to wage war?Other critics of Silicon Valley-Pentagon partnerships have made a different argument: not that collaboration risks compromising Silicon Valley values, but that contact with the military\u2019s inefficient processes would contaminate the fast-moving culture of Silicon Valley.Both arguments misunderstand the nature of technology and the military\u2019s role in accelerating the commercial ascendancy of the United States. A closer relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon is good for industry and for national security \u2014 as well as for the debate we as American citizens must have about how technology is used, especially in war.Google\u2019s engineers should be applauded for raising questions about how the machine-learning algorithms they invented are employed in Project Maven. Their aspiration that Google never \u201cbuild warfare technology\u201d or \u201coutsource the moral responsibility\u201d for using technology is a noble goal. It would be morally convenient if technology for war could be cleaved so cleanly from technology for everything else. But it can\u2019t be.Silicon Valley is already at war in the sense that the broad classes of technology it invents for search, storage and pattern recognition have inherent military uses. The same machine-learning algorithms developed to categorize images on the internet can be used to identity terrorist activity. Technology circulates between government and industry, between times of peace and war, in ways no corporate policy can turn on or off.Engineers in Silicon Valley are learning what students of history have long known: Technology often springs forth in unforeseen ways, wreaking havoc in some cases and providing salvation in others. Those who uncork the proverbial genie cannot control its future by decree.But all hope for accountability is not lost. The controversy over Project Maven is teaching us an important civics lesson about who governs technology. Google exists in a democracy whose elected representatives ultimately decide whether to use force and through what means. The best way to influence how the United States fights wars is not through company policy; it is by the ballot box.Because the United States military is a product of our democracy, it aims to fight with precision and a focus on limiting harm to innocent civilians \u2014 to a far greater extent than is the case with other, less democratic major powers. The technology behind Project Maven promises to reduce collateral damage still further, making any decision by Google to withhold it morally complex.Since 2015, the Pentagon\u2019s engagement with Silicon Valley has been conducted through a group called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, which I helped lead from 2016 until last year, that integrates technology from start-ups into military missions. The group arose not from the paranoid war room of \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d but rather from the more prosaic reality that most innovation today \u2014 unlike that of two generations ago \u2014 takes place in the commercial sector, not government labs.Apple and Google each have a market capitalization twice as large as that of the entire United States defense industry. The only way the military can continue protecting our nation and preserving the relative peace the world has enjoyed since World War II is by integrating the newest technology into its systems. Denying the military access to this technology would over time cripple it, which would be calamitous for the nation and the world.A partnership with the Pentagon is also in companies\u2019 interest. Working on important, tough military problems helps refine their products, improving the global competitiveness of American industry. Even beyond the usual incentives created by federal research and development, which helped spur innovations like Siri and the internet, there is value to the industry in having access to the military\u2019s operational testing and unique data sets.The debate at Google is vital and timely. Engineers everywhere should closely follow how the military uses new classes of technology and object if those uses violate our values. But if the goal of Silicon Valley technologists is to wall themselves off from the Pentagon\u2019s most pressing needs, they must concede that this will hurt both our security and industrial strength.Moving past the current debate requires all sides to focus on the values we hold in common. Those in uniform working to protect the nation from a threatening world are just as worried by how novel technologies could be misused as the engineers who create them.They also hold dear a motto of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d Their commitment to this ideal goes beyond a corporate code of conduct. It begins with an oath to uphold the Constitution and a duty that may require the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our form of self-government. That is a powerful basis for shared concern about the new technologies that will ineluctably figure in peace and in war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Metrics Are Everywhere in Media. Here\u2019s How They Help.", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kathy Zhang, a newsroom and product analytics manager, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Your team helps Times reporters analyze data about stories and readers. What kind of tech do you use to do that, and what information do you review? The Times uses a few different technologies to measure readership and behavior within our website and apps. The primary tool we use is an internal analytics system that powers the bulk of our analysis and dashboards. This system also underpins a newsroom tool called Stela, which provides story- and department-level analytics snapshots.We also use tools like Chartbeat and Google Analytics for the same purposes, because they have user interfaces that non-analysts can also use to inform their work. Editors use Chartbeat to understand real-time readership of our stories and Google Analytics to pull trends and reports over a longer period of time.What do you like about the tools, and what could be better?All of these tools hold essentially the same information, so it really comes down to personal preference and familiarity with the data and functions. Some of these tools may be better to use, depending on the questions I\u2019m trying to answer.I run Google Analytics training sessions for the newsroom, and something I try to make clear is that learning how to use the tool \u2014 in terms of which buttons to click and which settings to modify \u2014 is going to get us only so far. Understanding the underlying data and which pieces of it will answer your question will always be more important. Simply figuring out the number of pageviews any story received is easy. Trying to place that metric in context of what we might expect for that story is more difficult, because many factors play into the pageviews and reach of what any one story achieves.We need to consider the promotion strategy behind the story. Did we give the story prominent placement on the home screen? Did our social media team post it to Facebook? Did we share it in any newsletters? We also need to consider the kind of story it is. Is it breaking news? Is it an investigative story? Is it a movie review? The timeliness of the story is another consideration. Is the story pegged to a news event where we would expect nearly all of the traffic to come in on the first day? Or is it a story we would expect more of a long tail for because it\u2019s service journalism or a piece that would sustain steady search traffic?The tools we use all have their pros and cons. As frustrated as I sometimes get navigating suboptimal user interfaces, they\u2019re all solid tools for the work we do and serve different (although often overlapping) purposes.Do analytics help the Times better serve readers, or do they just make us obsessed with pageviews?Several of the masthead editors like to say that The Times strives to be data informed rather than data driven, which I think is an important distinction. We don\u2019t let pageviews dictate our coverage or approach, but we do use data to understand reader engagement and the reach of our stories. Our reporters\u2019 and editors\u2019 news judgment remains the driving force behind the decisions we make for story promotion and distribution. If the story is important, we get it out in front of our readers through prominent home screen placement, push alerts, social media posts and more.But analytics allow us to serve our audience better. Seeing our online readership shift from a predominantly desktop audience to a much larger smartphone audience underscored the need for our product and technology teams to prioritize mobile-first story forms. Looking at page speed allows us to prioritize making our pages load faster so people don\u2019t need to wait to read our stories.Editors are some of our best analytics consumers. They constantly monitor our dashboards to make real-time judgments about how best to engage our readers. News desk editors modify headlines and packaging to draw attention to stories. Search specialists take advantage of trending search terms to expose our stories to a wider audience. Social media editors follow the conversation and find the best moments to showcase our journalism. Analytics are crucial to the full life cycle of our coverage.Though many lament that access to analytics can make a publication hyper-focused on pageview volume to the detriment of reader engagement, at The Times we\u2019re cognizant of those pitfalls, and we structure our analyses to avoid them. The close partnership our newsroom editors have with the analytics team makes both our editors and our analysts think smarter about what our data tells us and how we can best deliver our journalism.Outside of work, what tech product are you using a lot?I was very late to the e-reader wave, but I purchased a Kindle at the beginning of the year and I absolutely love it. After a bit of research, I settled on the Paperwhite and find it incredibly convenient. I can use it one-handed, so it\u2019s easier to read on the train than a physical book. It\u2019s small enough to fit in my coat pocket, so I can get a bit of reading in when I\u2019m standing in line at the grocery store.One of the best things about the Kindle and e-readers in general is their integration with public libraries. Nearly all libraries give their patrons the ability to borrow e-books through an app like Overdrive, Libby or Hoopla. Before I bought my Kindle, I would borrow books from the New York Public Library\u2019s digital library to read on my phone. It\u2019s even better with a dedicated e-reader, because the screen is easier on my eyes and I don\u2019t have other apps to distract me.I credit the Kindle for getting me to read more than I used to. For pre-Kindle me, selecting the next book seemed like such a commitment. If I chose something heavy and serious but I wasn\u2019t in the mood for it, I would carry the book around in my bag for weeks, avoiding it like an email from an ex I had assured we\u2019d stay friends. But now I can carry several books at once and choose something lighthearted or somber or anywhere in between.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hire Interstate Movers Without Getting Scammed", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo, if you\u2019re planning to move across the country (or even just across a bridge to a new state), take these steps to hire movers who can do the job, get your belongings there safely \u2014 and not rip you off in the process.Start your search as soon as you know you\u2019ll be moving. Ideally you can book your shippers at least 30 days in advance, while some companies will let you do it as early as 90 days ahead of time. Your first line of defense is to ask around for recommendations from friends, family and colleagues.Once you have a list of recommendations, look deeper into each one. You will need the company\u2019s name, its U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) number and its Motor Carrier (M.C.) number. If they\u2019re missing either number, cross them off the list \u2014 it means they\u2019re not licensed to move property across state lines.Call three to five companies for estimates. A reputable company will send a representative to do an on-site inspection.Anecdotally, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s hard to get in-person estimates for small moves, like one out of an apartment, so be prepared to call a few more places. Ideally, an in-person estimate will give you a clear idea of how much it will cost to move your things, rather than a vague one based on your number of bedrooms.As you go through your home, flag items of extraordinary value, like artwork or antiques, that should be handled differently or insured at a higher rate. Many movers recommend you personally transport items of high personal value, like medical files, photo albums or car keys. And be aware that the mover will not transport hazardous or perishable items, including plants, pantry goods, cleaning supplies and alcohol; they should supply you with a detailed list. You\u2019ll want to use these up, donate them or transport them yourself.While the agent is taking inventory of your belongings, ask how the estimate will be calculated. Also ask: Are there any base fees, will the total fee be calculated by weight, volume or time, and what do they charge for additional services like packing, transporting your goods up or down stairs, or moving heavy items like appliances or a piano?Find out if the moving company will have their own movers do the packing and driving, or whether they will subcontract to someone else, and whether your things will have to share a truck with other households. Find out whether you will be a \u201cdirect\u201d move, where the same crew loads and unloads your belongings, or an \u201cindirect\u201d one, where your things may switch trucks and moving crews before getting to your new home.The agent should also explain how your goods can be insured. Released value protection is the minimum standard, which recoups up to 60 cents per pound if something is lost or damaged. Some companies also offer full value protection for an additional fee. Be sure to read the fine print on this insurance to note any exclusions and what the shipper\u2019s idea of \u201creplacement\u201d is \u2014 they might repair a damaged item, replace it with a like item, or give you cash to replace it.Separately, look into your own insurance to see if you\u2019re covered by your renter\u2019s or homeowner\u2019s insurance, and compare that cost to the movers\u2019 coverage.After the inspection, you will receive a written estimate, which can be binding or nonbinding. A binding estimate means that they cannot charge more or less than the stated amount, unless the mover determines at the time of pickup that there are more items or services than originally estimated. (If this is the case, the movers would revise the estimate on-site for you to sign before packing up). A nonbinding estimate is typically based on weight, and they can charge up to 10 percent more once they get the official weight on your goods after packing them into the vehicle and stopping at a weigh station. You can ask to be present when they weigh the goods.Once you\u2019ve accepted an estimate, you\u2019ll receive an order for service, which will have all the carrier and pickup/drop-off information, as well as terms for payment, insurance and delivery dates. Do not sign any blank or incomplete documents.As you approach the pickup date, check in with your carrier to confirm the details or make any adjustments in writing. Pack up any items you will be moving yourself, as well as everything you\u2019ll need to live in your new space for up to two weeks before the rest of your household goods arrive.Plan to supervise the entire pickup, which could take one or more days, and plan to do the same for drop-off. On moving day, you will be handed a bill of lading as well as an inventory list; read them thoroughly before signing and hold on to them to compare at delivery.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA relationship between a young man and woman with similar illnesses presents unusual challenges. For starters, he can\u2019t speak. This is our reality. I can\u2019t talk to Shannon about anything \u2014 not the weather or her day or how beautiful she is. Worst of all, I can\u2019t tell her I love her.This was never a problem in my previous relationships with women I thought I loved or perhaps didn\u2019t love at all. These women knew my voice; they heard it every day. But they never knew what I was actually thinking.They never knew how miserable my body felt because, back then, I was able to function at a relatively normal level and hide my illness well enough to seem healthy. I could go on dates, talk on the phone and even drive to my girlfriend\u2019s house to spend the night.But over time my condition worsened. Lyme disease had exacerbated my existing case of myalgic encephalomyelitis, an inflammatory multisystem disease that can leave patients unable to speak or eat for years at a time.I\u2019m now 29 and have been sick for eight years, the last three of which I have spent bedridden, mostly speechless and unable to eat solid food. I used to be a bodybuilder who worked out for hours every day, and I was blindsided by the rapid deterioration of my health. I couldn\u2019t care for myself. I had to delay love and many other things while I waited for my health to stabilize.That\u2019s when Shannon came into my life.She lives in Ottawa, about 2,000 miles from my house in California. We met online, which is common, but otherwise our relationship has no precedent or guide. We are two people very much in love but also very sick.Shannon has the same condition I do. She has been sick longer, since adolescence, but thankfully has never lost her ability to speak. Instead, she struggles with unrelenting nausea and has trouble digesting food. She is often malnourished and her weight drops below 100 pounds \u2014 too thin for someone 5 foot 5 inches tall.We both have low blood volume, which makes it difficult for her to walk without fainting and impossible for me to sit up in bed without intense pain and weakness.Since I am bedridden, the only way we can be together is for her to travel across the continent to see me. But even with her willingness to jeopardize her health by traveling so far, we are often away from each other for months at a time.When we are together, we spend weeks in bed, mostly holding each other, our bodies aligned like two pieces of a broken plate glued back together. Because I can\u2019t speak, we often resort to communicating by text messages while cuddling in bed.It\u2019s like a monthlong sleepover and feels surreal, being stuck in a situation so miserable that it could make your skin crawl, but finding comfort knowing that your soul mate is next to you going through something similar. But our experiences differ. Shannon can briefly get up to use the toilet, bathe and, on a good day, make herself a meal. I, on the other hand, have to do everything in bed \u2014 brush my teeth, bathe and use the \u201cbathroom\u201d \u2014 a plastic bag for bowel movements and, for urinating, a dubious-looking plastic container attached to a tube feeding into a bucket on the floor. These are not sexy things but are part of life \u2014 my life and ours together.I was embarrassed at first to ask Shannon to avert her eyes and try not to think of me urinating inches from where we had been kissing just seconds earlier. But I have since come to realize that it\u2019s all part of sharing our lives. It may be far from the bedroom romps we each had experienced before getting sick, but knowing that nothing about my bedridden life makes Shannon uncomfortable endears her to me.In contrast, I have had relationships with women who became upset at the first sign of anything inconvenient \u2014 one girlfriend who threatened to break up with me because she thought my beard trimmings were clogging the bathroom sink, and another who blamed our problems on my insomnia. These failed romances remind me of the baffling incompatibilities two people can have, but also how love can transcend even the most insurmountable obstacles when you find the right person.Before we started our relationship, when we were just two friends with the same illness texting for hours, I asked Shannon, \u201cDo you think two sick people can be together?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think when you\u2019re both sick it makes it easier and harder at the same time.\u201d\u201cI guess the downside,\u201d I said, \u201cis there\u2019s no healthy person to take care of you.\u201d\u201cBut when you\u2019re alone there\u2019s no healthy person to take care of you either,\u201d she said.I had never thought about it like that \u2014 the possibility of two sick people being in a successful relationship together. I have always assumed that one person in the couple would need to be healthy. Two sick people can\u2019t take care of each other.But Shannon and I take care of each other in ways I never thought possible. I may not be able to make a meal for her, but I can have takeout delivered. And she may not be able to be my caregiver, but she can post an ad looking for one. We have done these things and many others for each other, from opposite ends of North America.We share an empathy that only two people with the same condition can feel. We know what the other person is going through on bad days; we know how exasperating it is to explain invisible symptoms to doctors only to face skepticism. And we know all too well what it\u2019s like to be immobile in an ever-moving world.Even so, we don\u2019t know everything about each other. We don\u2019t know what we were like as healthy people. We don\u2019t know what differences lie between our current selves and the people we were before getting sick \u2014 what maturation and emotional hardening have occurred during that transformation. Most fundamentally, we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a vocal conversation with each other. Shannon has never heard my voice. She has never heard me berate a telemarketer or mumble to myself after making a typo. She has never heard me mess up a dinner toast or tell a corny joke. She has never heard me whisper into her ear or come up with a witty reply. She has never heard me ask a question or speak my mind, to anyone.And she may never get to hear me do any of these things, but that\u2019s O.K. Here is this lovely woman, devoid of judgment, who loves me for the words I type to her on my phone.I never loved any of my previous girlfriends the way I love Shannon. I wanted to tell her how much her companionship means to me. I had tried before, many times, without success. Still, I felt I had to try again. Somehow I had to convey, without typing, what I was feeling. My text messages were inadequate, and I thought about using hand signals, but the heart-shaped hand gesture felt far too clich\u00e9d.So I tried to use my voice. To my surprise, for the first time in months, I heard actual sounds coming from my mouth. With my jaw locked, I whispered through clenched teeth, \u201cI \u2026 love \u2026 you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, startled.I took a deep breath and fought back the nearly unbearable pain in my throat and jaw. Tears began to well up in my eyes. I whispered again, this time using all the strength I had: \u201cI \u2026 love \u2026 you.\u201d\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure what was worse: the emotional torment of not being able to speak or the physical pain of trying. After everything I had been through \u2014 the months of struggling to stay alive in my sickbed \u2014 and finally finding the love of my life, I couldn\u2019t tell Shannon that I loved her.Lucky for me, I didn\u2019t have to. As if straight from a heart-wrenching scene in \u201cLove Story,\u201d Shannon took my hand, gave me a soft kiss and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I love you!\u201dNow, months later, it still holds true: For us, love means never having to say anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the People Who Can\u2019t Get Enough Hotel Points (You\u2019ll Learn Something)", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the Marriott Rewards Insiders get together (at a Marriott property, of course), the conversation is about tips, trips and how their internet forum led to new friendships.\u201cDid you see who just walked in?\u201d Brian Jacob asked in an earnest blend of excitement, triumph and urgency.\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of Marriott loyalists, a bunch of Marriott travel geeks,\u201d said Roger Nicholson, a 49-year-old operations executive from Texas who has more than 3 million lifetime points to his name.\u201cIt\u2019s probably no different than a group that meets on a forum for Comic-Con,\u201d interjected Angelena Culotta, 35, who lives in Louisiana and inherited her Marriott allegiance from her parents.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a lot of similarities,\u201d Mr. Nicholson, known on the Marriott Rewards Insiders forum as \u201cnationwide,\u201d said before he and Ms. Culotta, perhaps better known as \u201cseatexan,\u201d broke into laughter.But that undersells what is an unwitting wider influence: With every answered question and shared strategy, they act as screen-named guides to a lucrative world governed by \u201cMegabonus\u201d promotions and fine print, category changes and free night certificates. Their insights \u2014 fueled by a mix of practice, speculation and maybe a bit of projection \u2014 are an open-ended Google search away.I know from experience. Since I joined the National desk of The New York Times in 2013, I have amassed more than 2 million Marriott points, the bounty of about two dozen sunrises at the Renaissance St. Louis Airport, several nights at the Courtyard near Interstate 20 in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and hundreds of nights elsewhere.So I get it, or I thought I did. Then, when my wife, Meredith, and I were searching the internet for advice on where to spend our stockpile, we stumbled upon talk of this merry gathering. It turned out that in an ecosystem of some 110 million Marriott Rewards members, there were decidedly serious independent students of points science like Brian Jacob and Angelena Culotta.\u201cThere are people here tonight who will know more about our portfolio than I will,\u201d Mr. Flueck said.A conservative estimate of the aggregate number of lifetime points in the room \u2014 70 million, by Mr. Jacob\u2019s count \u2014 would offer the equivalent of more than five years of free nights at some of the most sought-after properties in Marriott\u2019s empire.They earned their points through a variety of pursuits. Mr. Jacob, a government accountant in Ohio, does not travel for work but is a Marriott regular as a part of his quest to visit every county seat in America. Ms. Culotta is also a leisure traveler, but Mr. Nicholson picks up his points when he is on the road for business, sometimes passing a tempting Hilton that is 20 minutes closer than one of the 6,500 or so hotels that are part of Marriott.In turn, Insiders have vacationed from Maui to Moscow. One man spoke movingly of a gilded visit to Paris with his mother, who had lived there as a child.\u201cRelationships, that\u2019s the heart of this thing,\u201d said Mr. Nicholson, who first logged on to the website in 2009 and browsed, without posting a word, for five or six years. \u201cYou\u2019re rooting for people to have great trips. You share ideas and thoughts and the bad things. You share that, and over time, those stories become friendships.\u201dAnd so the Insiders began to get together, away from their laptops and smartphones. An initial meeting, in 2016 in Houston, was a hit, and Mr. Jacob soon began planning for another. But TIPPLE remains a mostly informal gathering: Aside from the reception that starred Mr. Flueck, the Marriott Rewards Insiders were left to craft their own agendas of sightseeing and drinking.\u201cIt is a nerd convention, and I don\u2019t totally understand it,\u201d Sonya Nicholson, Mr. Nicholson\u2019s wife, said somewhat admiringly as she surveyed the scene a few months before a points-paid anniversary trip to Italy. \u201cBut what is fascinating is that they bounce ideas off of each other.\u201dThey have plenty. Do not redeem unless you are getting at least 1 cent in value per point. For Platinum Elite members, remember that Fairfield Inns offer a mere 200-point arrival gift, not the 400 points you get at a Courtyard. Steer clear of Residence Inns for paid stays because they offer fewer points per dollar.\u201cWe certainly do talk about points,\u201d said Bob Pape, a Hawaiian shirt-wearing lawyer from England. \u201cIt does tend to be about areas where there is proper debate: where are good redemptions, how to get reduced rates, how to make the most of the points you\u2019re spending and where the soft points are of a promo that they\u2019re running. There\u2019s a lot to talk about.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to read some of your posts,\u201d Mr. Flueck told the group in a tone that set off a roar of laughter.\u201cWe were just kidding,\u201d a woman called out.Except they almost certainly weren\u2019t.A gathering of self-educated points experts \u2014 and the notion that Marriott would send an executive to spend Saturday night at it \u2014 is a reflection of simultaneous eras: one in which travel loyalty currencies have come to stand as both a hobby and cottage industry, and one in which the internet has seemingly transformed everyone into an airline, hotel or restaurant critic.\u201cWe simply didn\u2019t anticipate that interest would be as deep, as widespread and as sustained as it has proven to be,\u201d said Robert L. Crandall, who was president of American Airlines when the carrier introduced its AAdvantage program \u2014 and who is now credited with kick-starting a trend that changed travel.\u201cWhat has actually happened was simply outside the scope of our imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were ambitious, but we didn\u2019t anticipate it would turn into the kind of obsession that it has turned into for some people.\u201dFrequent flier miles add up. So do hotel points. Car rental companies are in on the scheme, too, luring the young and old alike.But experience and a near-lawyerly attention to detail are what make the Arlington crowd particularly powerful: They are travelers who can write with authority about properties and perks at Marriott-branded hotels around the world.\u201cThey understand travel at a level differently than the average person who makes four or five trips a year,\u201d said Thom Kozik, a former Marriott executive who attended the first TIPPLE. \u201cIf I could communicate to a handful of those members the true value of the program or the true capabilities the program afforded them, they were going to be a far better ambassador to their friends and families than my emails or websites ever would be.\u201dTo Mr. Kozik, who said he had learned the value of a free breakfast benefit from reading posts from the Insiders, the website was a low-cost focus group of unmatched authenticity, and its gatherings a delightful meetup of passionate travelers.\u201cMarriott could not have manufactured this group,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they could do is set up the forum, but the group itself had to come together.\u201dBut Ms. Culotta seemed as surprised as most everyone else in Arlington about how they were spending their weekends: at TIPPLE, wearing name tags where their usernames were printed larger than their real-life names.\u201cWe have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have more of a good time in person than we do on the forum, and many of us have a relationship outside the forum where we talk almost daily.\u201dFor many contributors, the forum is their only social media.Mr. Jacob and Mr. Pape are constant, easygoing presences. Ms. Culotta, who credits the information she learned online with helping her to reach Marriott\u2019s highest level of elite status, checks in five or six times a day, but never on weekends. Mr. Nicholson normally logs on as early as his first cup of tea.The Starwood merger, which will lead to a reconfigured program this summer, has been \u201clike Christmas\u201d on the forum, he said, because \u201cyou get a whole lot of content.\u201dIndeed.Mrs. Nicholson will sometimes wake up in the night and see her husband still awake, browsing and posting in the darkness.Advertisement"}

You probably don\u2019t want to spend thousands upgrading your kitchen, for example, only to move out in a few years \u2014 and risk losing your deposit. Your landlord might not want you tearing out that bathroom tile, even if it is terribly outdated.\u201cReplace and match the hardware on your cabinets, doors and furniture with unusual alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201c Try leather pulls, stone, glass pulls, or classy acrylic and metal combos for a unique alternative to the stainless steel everyone gets.\u201dFor an even easier project, simply swap out the light bulbs. Changing the brightness and temperature of your bulbs can completely change the look of a room, and you can find information about both brightness and temperature directly on the bulb box.While you\u2019re thinking about changing the bulbs, consider upgrading to smart lighting. You get the benefit of light bulbs you can change to different colors, control with an app on your phone or tablet, or even by voice control like Alexa on the Amazon Echo, or by saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d to your Google Home.He also explained that even if you use lamps, smart lights can be set up in groups that give you the ability to turn off all the lights in a room \u2014 or your whole home \u2014 before bed. Best of all, you can get all of those features and then take them with you when it\u2019s time to move.If your rental comes with old, outdated electrical and light switch plates, it\u2019s easy enough to replace those, and most plates will cost you less than $5 apiece.Keep the old outlets on hand and replace them when you move out. Along with the other fixtures you replace, you can take them with you to the next place you rent.Most kitchen and bathroom sink faucets are also relatively easy to replace. When replacing a faucet, first identify the mounting type:Once you find another faucet you like that fits that mounting type, the box should include instructions to replace your old one. You\u2019ll need to shut off the water flowing to the sink, remove the water lines, and connect them to the new sink.While you\u2019re upgrading your bathroom, shower heads are even easier to install. Using a pair of pliers, remove the old shower head and the Teflon tape around it, apply new tape, then use the pliers to thread on your new shower head fixture.Check with your landlord on this one, but if your rental doesn\u2019t come with crown molding or you just want to replace what you have, you can install this yourself and completely change the look of a room.\u201cAdding border trim as a baseboard, crown molding, or a chair rail (wall trim) can subtly add a refined look to any room without breaking the bank,\u201d Ms. Reiner said. \u201cEven adding trim and building out the frame and depth of your window frames or the face of your doors will instantly upgrade the look and feel of a space.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be a gaudy, Victorian style molding; a simple and single shape, single depth piece of molding will do the trick,\u201d Ms. Reiner added.\u201cThe renovation project is quick, mess-free and only takes a couple of minutes,\u201d Ms. Bowker said. \u201cThe stickers are easy to clean and can be efficiently removed by using some heat with a hair dryer and they peel off.\u201dYou can add some uniqueness to a cookie-cutter apartment with a feature wall: a wall that\u2019s decorated in such a way that it stands out and immediately catches your attention. You can achieve this with a simple coat of paint in a bold color or a gallery of photos, for example.For less than $50 and 60 minutes, you can replace your rental\u2019s well-worn toilet seat. That said, it\u2019s easier and more affordable than you might think to swap out the entire toilet, and it will instantly make your bathroom feel just a little less lived-in (always a good thing).Check with your landlord to make sure it\u2019s O.K., but chances are, they\u2019ll be happy to have you upgrade their rental. You might even try haggling this upgrade into your lease \u2014 save yourself some work and ask your landlord if the toilet can be replaced before you move in.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Battle for Control of CBS, With Far-Reaching Consequences", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s no secret that the proposed reunion of CBS and Viacom hasn\u2019t been a Hollywood romance. But simmering tensions erupted into open warfare this week, with far more at stake than control of two legendary entertainment companies.No matter who emerges the victor in what promises to be a prolonged series of courtroom showdowns, both companies will be profoundly affected, and the broader media landscape fundamentally transformed.The CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves and the company\u2019s board launched the opening salvo on Monday, filing suit to prevent Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both CBS and Viacom, from firing CBS directors before they could dilute her voting rights and strip her of control \u2014 a step they plan to take Thursday, provided that a judge in Delaware allows it.Although the two sides had been negotiating over how much CBS should pay for Viacom, and who should be in charge after the merger, control is the real issue. The CBS board and management \u201chave simply become uncomfortable with the reality that CBS has a controlling stockholder,\u201d Ms. Redstone asserted in a response to the suit.For its part, CBS said it\u2019s simply adhering to the principle that the company \u201cshould be and would be governed for the benefit of the company and all its shareholders, not just the controlling stockholder.\u201d It is a principle CBS said had been endorsed by Sumner Redstone, Shari\u2019s 94-year-old father, who long controlled both CBS and Viacom.The interests of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone might well include considering a takeover offer, especially in light of a rapidly consolidating media and communications landscape. Since talk of reuniting Viacom and CBS first surfaced two years ago, AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (a deal awaiting a court ruling on an antitrust challenge), Disney has reached a deal to buy much of 21st Century Fox, and Netflix and Amazon have emerged as fully integrated distributors and content producers.CBS executives were incensed that Ms. Redstone rebuffed an approach from Lloyd C. McAdam, chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications, roughly a year ago, thereby \u201cdepriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity,\u201d CBS said in its complaint.While the exact nature of that conversation remains in dispute, the Redstone entity that controls CBS, National Amusements, has made clear its categorical opposition to any takeover. As said in a 2016 letter to the boards of both CBS and Viacom, \u201cTo avoid any doubt, National Amusements is not willing to accept or support (i) any acquisition by a third party of either company or (ii) any transaction that would result in National Amusements surrendering its controlling position in either company or not controlling the combined company.\u201dThe issue of control often looms large at companies with dual-class share systems. Controlling shareholders often want to maintain managerial control \u2014 that\u2019s often why they establish the dual-class structure in the first place \u2014 while public shareholders often hope to sell to the highest bidder.Although dual-class share structures are controversial and have long been opposed by shareholder-rights advocates, they have been growing in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurial founders are often reluctant to cede control; Facebook, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and Snap are all dual-class share companies. But so are Berkshire Hathaway, Ford Motor, Comcast and The New York Times Company.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws.The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the Redstones have a clear conflict of interest in this situation,\u201d said Margaret Blair, a professor and expert in corporate governance at Vanderbilt University School of Law. \u201cThe law is very clear that the authority for running the corporation lies with the board. If the board feels the controlling shareholder is interfering with the best interest of the other shareholders, courts will defer to the board, and I think they should.\u201d(At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in Delaware granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.)Such cases are rare, because directors who dare to defy a controlling shareholder\u2019s wishes, as the CBS directors have done, can simply be replaced. There was widespread amazement on Wall Street this week that Ms. Redstone hadn\u2019t sensed the rebellion coming, and moved to replace the CBS directors or curtail their powers. Now her hands are tied, at least temporarily.Ms. Redstone has been at the center of a drawn-out soap opera over control of the media empire forged by her father, the ailing Mr. Redstone.After years of being estranged from her father and isolated from the family business, Ms. Redstone was thrust unexpectedly into the role of media mogul after she reconciled with her father, ousted his two girlfriends from his Beverly Hills mansion, and gained control of the family trust that controls National Amusements and, in turn, CBS and Viacom.Ms. Redstone has gone on a crash course in media management, lunching with other media executives and showing up at the Sun Valley conference and other media watering holes. By all accounts, she\u2019s taken on the task with a level of enthusiasm and determination that rivals her father. Still, there\u2019s nothing in her experience that would typically qualify her to run major media companies.The Harvard Law School professor Lucian A. Bebchuk used the Redstone example in an argument that dual-share class structures typically outlive their utility, and should be phased out by a company at some point. \u201cConcerns about the emergence of inferior leadership over time are further aggravated when the dual-class structure enables a transfer of the founder\u2019s lock on control to an heir who might be unfit to lead the company,\u201d he wrote last year in an article titled \u201cThe Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock\u201d in Virginia Law Review. He cited a \u201cwide range of distorted choices\u201d that are \u201caimed at increasing private benefits of control at the expense of the value received by other shareholders.\u201dCBS hasn\u2019t said exactly why the special committee formed to evaluate and negotiate the potential merger with Viacom finally decided this past weekend that such a deal wasn\u2019t in the best interest of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone, but it isn\u2019t hard to see what their objections might be.Investors other than the Redstones have long opposed the idea \u2014 every time there were reports the deal was off, including this week, CBS shares jumped. A chorus of analysts has criticized the deal. One called the merger a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d for CBS.People close to CBS told me this week that the company was never enthusiastic about the potential combination, and agreed to consider it largely as a courtesy to Ms. Redstone. They said CBS alone is a very attractive company, either as a takeover candidate for a large telecom company like Verizon, or as a stand-alone content creator.Though CBS faces the same advertising challenges as the other broadcast networks, analysts have praised Mr. Moonves for positioning CBS for the digital era. He\u2019s not only kept CBS the No. 1 broadcast network in prime time for the past nine years, but also executed a successful direct-to-consumer streaming strategy.\u201cFrom CBS\u2019s perspective, you\u2019ve got to be pretty happy with your business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. \u201cWhy would you want to complicate it?\u201dFor its part, Viacom, after years of turmoil, seems to have stabilized under the leadership of its new chief executive, Robert M. Bakish, who has emerged as a favorite of Ms. Redstone\u2019s. (Ms. Redstone has pushed to have him play a meaningful role in the merged companies, either as a high-level executive or as a board member.) But so far this year, Viacom\u2019s Paramount movie studio accounted for less than 6 percent of the domestic box office. Disney, the market leader, had over 34 percent.Still, people at CBS told me that while they wouldn\u2019t mind gaining control of the Paramount studio, they have little or no interest in Viacom\u2019s traditional cable networks, including MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Those are suffering acutely from the cord cutting that is afflicting the entire cable industry. (Mr. Creutz, the analyst, described Viacom\u2019s cable assets as a \u201cmelting ice cube.\u201d)Given the level of acrimony that has erupted this week from CBS\u2019s move \u2014 National Amusements said it was \u201coutraged\u201d and Ms. Redstone was described as \u201cshocked, disappointed and upset\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine any amicable settlement. That leaves two potential outcomes: If Ms. Redstone prevails, Mr. Moonves and his team would be out, marking the end of an era at CBS. It would presumably fall to the relatively untested Mr. Bakish to merge the two companies and soldier on at a perilous time for cable and broadcasting operations.If CBS wins, and Ms. Redstone\u2019s control is diluted, the Redstone era will come to an end, and with it the likelihood that either CBS or Viacom will last long as independent companies. Viacom is so small and weak that it would need a rescuer, probably at a lower price than CBS was being asked to pay. And CBS would be free to pursue a merger with someone like Verizon, or go it alone.Advertisement"}

The two creators crafted a grand soap opera with characters who felt very human: Changeling was insecure; Raven had daddy issues; Kid Flash debated heroism versus college; Robin and Starfire struggled with whether they could be teammates and romantic partners; and more. (I could relate to the insecurity and father issues.)The Titans made me an eager reader, counting down the time between monthly installments. My love for them encouraged me to write letters to the editors of comics, which were sometimes printed with my address (and sparked a handful of pen pals).One of those letters led me to TitanTalk, an amateur press association. It was a labor of love by and for fans, who would make copies of their commentary, stories or original artwork and send them to a central mailer, who would collate everything and mail the submissions to each member. I joined that group around 1987, made friends I still have and got to meet Mr. P\u00e9rez, one of the nicest creators in comics, when I was still a teenager.All of this, I should add, was fairly secret.Growing up as a fan of comics equaled being a nerd. This was long before today\u2019s renaissance when comic book characters, particularly superheroes, dominate television and the box office.

{"Headline": "What Advertising History Says About the Future of Fake News", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIt showed President Barack Obama giving a speech he never gave, and uttering sentences that he didn\u2019t actually say. The video demonstrated how easy it is to use current technology to create powerful and persuasive lies, now also known as fake news.When this video magic is coupled with the ability of companies like Facebook to micro-target each of us and select the news we see, the implications for the future of our democracy seem dire. Fake news and microtargeting can be combined to create a kind of advertising that\u2019s like an evil version of Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, and we are being exposed to more of these pernicious morsels every year.But two lessons from the history of advertising suggest that the fake news phenomenon is likely to change significantly in the years to come. Prospects are gloomy for the near future, as this kind of advertising extends beyond politics. History also suggests, though, that the danger will probably recede over time as people grow accustomed to the ads, which will cease to work as effectively.First, in all likelihood, fake news will spread, despite efforts to rein it in. So far, most attention has focused on efforts to meddle in American elections. That is no small threat.Yet, based on the historical record, far more effort goes into persuading Americans to buy things than to elect politicians.We are already seeing technology being used to shade the truth in advertising that targets consumers.I did a Google search for \u201cbest inflatable kayak\u201d and was confronted by a blend of results that can be hard for a consumer to decipher. As expected, the choices that popped up included paid ads for kayaks that were being sold and some real reviews of kayaks. But there were also as a series of seemingly objective product-review sites that, on closer inspection, mainly contained product descriptions and links to buy items like kayaks from Amazon and other vendors.Such blurring of the distinctions between expert reviews and explicit ads provides a ripe circumstance for the rise of advertising that is less than totally transparent.The fake expert recommended that students try to refinance their loans, which was helpful to the business of LendEDU. Drew Cloud has disappeared, and LendEDU has apologized for its deception, but the problem is certain to continue.Expect to hear from the Drew Clouds of kayaks, mutual funds, laundry detergent and anything you might spend money on. Fake celebrity endorsements, altered product videos, bogus reviews and testimonials can\u2019t be far off.We have relied on the law to protect us from advertising fraud but, as we learned after the last election cycle, the more numerous and micro-targeted the ads become, the harder they are to monitor. That\u2019s a recipe for more trouble.Voters get lots of robocalls around election time, but the volume is modest compared with the number of calls about credit cards, vacation deals and loans.Given the trends, the future looks grim. But before abandoning hope, remember that the history of advertising also teaches that when people get used to ads, the ads stop working.As with special effects in movies, consumers become desensitized to ads the more they see them. The scary creatures from 1950s films, the shark in \u201cJaws\u201d or the spaceships from science-fiction movies of the 1990s now often look like jokes.That\u2019s why political consultants say straightforward TV ads no longer work. People tune them out.As technology develops, the same wearout effect is likely to occur with advertising based on fake news. As we are inundated with new, targeted, deceptive ads, we may get sick of them and, perhaps, stop finding them persuasive. For now, it\u2019s the best hope we have.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.Advertisement"}

Here are excerpts from some of the responses, edited for length and clarity:\u201cI am heartsick and outraged by what appears to be a pattern of failed leadership and cover-up by President Max Nikias and his administration. Concern about the University\u2019s reputation trumped the leadership\u2019s responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The board of trustees should clean house and establish new leadership without delay.\u201d\u201cThere are several investigations underway, and if they show that President Nikias knew what was happening and failed to act, that will be when he should resign. However, if the investigations show that the failures occurred at levels lower than the office of the president, then those responsible should be held liable. I believe it is premature to ask Max Nikias to resign.\u201d\u201cAs an alumna of U.S.C. and one of three generations of Trojans, I think Mr. Nikias should resign. Whether or not he was personally responsible for the inaction concerning Dr. Tyndall, the buck stops with him as the leader and face of the university, and he is ultimately the person who needs to be held accountable.\u201d\u201cI definitely think that Mr. Nikias should resign. I think they should hire a person who is more forthright and willing to do the right things even when it hurts. There should not be any more of the \u201cback room dealing\u201d that has occurred previously.

Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those. But it shows that the company is engaging in the debate on social issues all the same.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2014 Michael de la MercedOne day you\u2019re earning $1.5 million per year, the next the figure has $10.9 million. According to the WSJ, that\u2019s what happened to David King, the C.E.O. of the health care diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America.At least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10 percent for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows.Many changes, like LabCorp\u2019s, are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others can reflect changes in how the company decides to present the perks it has provided. In at least one case, the revised figure was the result of a retroactive pay cut.Microsoft\u2019s leapfrogging Alphabet in market value and new hardware from Nvidia are the latest signs that democratizing artificial intelligence tools is a lucrative business.The world is rapt by A.I. and the way it could be used to transform all kinds of industries. The problem: The technology requires stacks of computing power and significant expertise. So some companies have been creating A.I. software that\u2019s easier to use, then hosting it on their own cloud servers so people can pay for just the processing that they need to do, rather than shelling out for their own exotic hardware.That will allow other organizations to build more capable cloud A.I. systems and benefit from the wind filling Microsoft\u2019s sails.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeInvestors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.Elsewhere in tradeThe bottom line from the Justice Department\u2019s approval of Bayer\u2019s $66 billion deal for Monsanto: The department wants asset sales, not behavioral changes, in exchange for approving mergers.The question now: Will the cancellation lead to a big conservative backlash \u2014 perhaps led by President Trump, a supporter of Ms. Barr?\u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Foreign Activists Sway Ireland\u2019s Abortion Vote?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr.\u00a0Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.This Friday, Irish voters will decide whether to change their constitution to legalize abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The debate itself contains few new arguments; instead it circles around a question most other European countries have asked themselves over the past 40 years: What is the proper balance between the mother\u2019s right to self-determination and the unborn child\u2019s right to life?But there\u2019s another question, less about the substance of the issue and more about the campaign around it: In an era of global social media and well-funded foreign activists, what does it mean for a country to hold a vote at all? And if a democracy is no longer insulated from foreign influence, what integrity can any referendum claim?Forget hacking and illegal vote-buying. What\u2019s happening in Ireland is more transparent, but also, for that reason, more troubling.The vote, Ireland\u2019s fifth referendum in five years, is over whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which bans abortion except in cases where the mother\u2019s life is in danger. For such a small country, the vote has attracted enormous global attention, perhaps because Ireland remains a bastion of Catholicism in Europe.But Ireland is also a place that should be relatively safe from outside influence. Given its long history in the shadow of Britain, the country has long held its sovereignty and self-determination especially dear. Also, as a relatively small country, voters are used to personally knowing their political representatives, who spend a lot of time campaigning door to door.Ireland also has rules and laws in place to check undue influence: The Broadcast Authority of Ireland ensures balanced reporting on radio and television, and many of the country\u2019s major newspapers and magazines have followed. What\u2019s more, it is illegal to take money from abroad for political purposes: The government has ordered Amnesty International Ireland to return 137,000 euros (about $160,000) donated by George Soros, the American billionaire, allegedly to promote the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.None of these safeguards, however, can protect Ireland when it comes to social media. And, in fact, Ireland\u2019s experience is demonstrating just how vulnerable voters are to online influence.Abortion is, of course, an issue that is far from unique to Ireland; it is part of a larger cultural struggle, being fought around the world, over the conviction that liberalism has gone too far. For anyone in the world anxious to defend \u2014 or destroy \u2014 that status quo, the next battleground is Ireland. No wonder many Irish feel as comfortable in this referendum campaign as a fly under a magnifying glass.In many cases, those ads traced back to foreign activist groups, like Live Action and the Radiance Foundation, both American organizations.Or consider that Save the 8th, the most prominent organization against repealing the amendment, has hired a former online manager for the Brexit campaign in Britain, who used to work with Cambridge Analytica.John McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, rejected the notion that there was anything amiss in such cross-border activism, or in using data analysis to microtarget voters. But he also warned that outside activists might have limited success in a place like Ireland. \u201cThey think what works in Alabama will work here,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I wish they\u2019d leave.\u201dHe also said that the growing concern in Ireland over foreign influence was a diversion. \u201cThe media and the yes side are so obsessed with the online ads, because when the political establishment loses, they will need an explanation for the defeat,\u201d he said.Calls are growing in Ireland for new regulations on social-media advertising targeted at voters, but if anything is done, it will come too late for this Friday\u2019s vote.In any event, experienced campaigners on both sides here believe they will win or lose the argument the old-fashioned way: walking the neighborhood, knocking on people\u2019s doors, engaging in real-life conversation and showing how much politicians and campaigners actually care about their cause.Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re right.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.\u201dIt is the type of meaningful breakthrough that Google executives love to promote, but it has little to do with Google\u2019s core web products or the way it makes money. But even those services are getting an artificially intelligent makeover.The company demonstrated how its Google Assistant computer software is now capable of calling a person at a hair salon or a restaurant to make a reservation. Google said artificial intelligence had allowed the computer\u2019s voice to sound more human \u2014 complete with \u201cuhs\u201d and natural pauses, as well as logical follow-up questions \u2014 so the person at the other end does not know that he or she is speaking to a computer.Improvements in A.I. have allowed Google\u2019s computer assistant to have different voices and accents, including the ability later this year to have the singer John Legend tell you the day\u2019s weather.The company also demonstrated a new artificially intelligent feature in Gmail, called Smart Compose, that starts to suggest complete sentences in email as you type. Google said this would help users complete emails more quickly with fewer spelling and grammar mistakes. It plans to add this feature over the next few weeks.Mark Hung, a research vice president at the research firm Gartner, said the conference demonstrated how much Google relied on A.I. to make its products stand out.\u201cAlmost everything Google is announcing now is A.I. related,\u201d he said. \u201cGoogle has a lead on artificial intelligence over many of its competitors, and it\u2019s going to use that as a weapon to advance their products forward.\u201dIn keeping with a theme of a more responsible Google, the company also introduced features aimed at addressing how technology is burrowing deeper into our lives \u2014 sometimes in negative ways.Google unveiled a series of \u201cdigital well-being\u201d updates in the next version of its Android smartphone software. They include a timer that allows a person to limit time spent on certain apps each day and a Do Not Disturb feature that silences phone calls and notifications, and that can be turned on by placing the smartphone screen face down on a table.Advertisement"}

The first casualty of the high-tech cold war between the United States and China might be the biggest electronics maker you\u2019ve never heard of.Trading in the company\u2019s shares has been suspended for weeks. Staff members have been instructed, in new guidelines reviewed by The New York Times, to reassure anxious clients, while being sure to avoid discussing with them the American technology from which the firm is cut off for the next seven years.\u201cBy tightening our belts and gritting our teeth, we built \u2018two bombs and one satellite,\u2019\u201d Mr. Xi said, referring to a Mao-era weapons development program. \u201cThis was because we made best use of the socialist system \u2014 we concentrated our efforts to get great things done. The next step is to do the same with science and technology. We must cast away false hopes and rely on ourselves.\u201dZTE\u2019s moment of crisis, if it leads to the company\u2019s collapse, could also show how the tech cold war might ripple around the world.Several employees described the situation inside ZTE on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from their employer. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.In response to the sanctions issued last month, ZTE said it had worked to improve its compliance practices. It has requested a stay on the export ban and has sent additional information to the Commerce Department in support of its argument.\u201cZhongxing\u201d means \u201cChina Prospers.\u201d The company\u2019s controlling shareholder is Shenzhen Zhongxingxin Telecommunications Equipment, which is nearly half-owned by two Chinese state entities. Several members of the firm\u2019s board also have leadership roles at Zhongxingxin. ZTE says Zhongxingxin does not interfere in its business decisions. Unlike China\u2019s state-controlled enterprises, which are often run by Communist Party officials who jump from company to company, most of the top executives at ZTE are veterans with technical backgrounds.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily impressive, what they\u2019ve done in the U.S.,\u201d said Avi Greengart, a consumer tech analyst with the research firm GlobalData. \u201cSo many Asian companies either said they would come to the U.S. and then had to pull back \u2014 like Xiaomi, like Huawei. Or they invested in the U.S. and weren\u2019t able to make it work.\u201dZTE\u2019s secret, Mr. Greengart said, was a light touch. The company\u2019s American managers have had significant leeway in tailoring their products to the local market. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way many of its competitors work,\u201d he said.The company was, for instance, quick to spot that Americans were gravitating toward larger phones. It offered inexpensive devices with big screens \u2014 if not those with the highest resolution \u2014 and fingerprint readers at a time when such features were considered premium.Some of the company\u2019s deals with cash-stricken governments have attracted accusations of corruption and overbilling. On the whole, though, ZTE is known in Africa for high quality and good service, said Dobek Pater, a telecom expert at the research firm Africa Analysis.\u201cThe initial perception \u2014 of Chinese companies coming in and being very secretive and not wanting to have much to do with the locals \u2014 has changed over the past decade,\u201d he said.In Iran, it was secrecy of another kind that got ZTE into trouble.\u201cAt home, they might have been doing some things not according to standards, and then, when it came time to internationalize, they might not have done so entirely properly,\u201d said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at ICwise, a semiconductor market research firm in Shanghai.\u201cFor other companies thinking about how to follow the rules and manage internal risks, I think this is going to serve as a wakeup call,\u201d Mr. Gu said.At the very least, the sanctions against ZTE appear to be supercharging Beijing\u2019s determination to upgrade China\u2019s microchip makers, which have struggled to keep up with global industry leaders despite state support.Chris Lane, a telecom analyst in Hong Kong with Sanford C. Bernstein, believes that China now has the resolve to whip its semiconductor industry into world-leading shape, even if it takes a decade to do so.\u201cThey\u2019re going to pour billions of dollars into preventing this from ever happening again,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long run, strategically, this might be worse for the U.S. than the current situation.\u201dLate last Friday, ZTE management sent an email to staff members updating them on the company\u2019s efforts to reconcile with Washington.\u201cEven the longest road has an end,\u201d the email concluded. \u201cEven the longest night ends in day.

Then Morocco Hired the Lobbyist.", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, allowed a lobbyist friend to play an unusually influential role in setting his agenda during a visit in December to Morocco, according to internal communications related to the scheduling of meetings reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Smotkin had worked as a lobbyist for Comcast when he first came to know Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, where Mr. Pruitt served as attorney general before joining the Trump administration.Mr. Pruitt is facing at least 11 investigations examining his first-class travel, pay raises given to his staff, money spent on security and office furnishings, and frequent trips he took to his home in Oklahoma after he was confirmed, at taxpayer expense.Members of Congress had questioned whether there was a legitimate government reason for Mr. Pruitt to travel to Morocco and also questioned the cost of the trip. Moreover, the swiftness with which Mr. Smotkin then received the Morocco contract raises questions about whether the trip helped Mr. Smotkin secure the deal.\u201cIt makes it almost look like it was part of a business cultivation effort,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, executive director of IssueOne, a nonprofit government ethics group.Mr. Smotkin, who has not publicly disclosed his role in planning the Morocco trip, did not respond to requests for comment. There is no evidence that he has business before the E.P.A.Jahan Wilcox, an E.P.A. spokesman, did not dispute that Mr. Smotkin participated in the Morocco trip, or some of the meetings that involved Mr. Pruitt. But he said that the visit was organized by agency staff members.\u201cEPA\u2019s Office of International and Tribal Affairs organized and led the effort around Administrator Pruitt\u2019s official meetings with the Moroccan government,\u201d Mr. Wilcox said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAdditionally, Mr. Smotkin did not attend or participate in any official meetings with the Moroccan government.\u201dMr. Pruitt last week faced pointed questions from two congressional oversight committees about his spending and management of the E.P.A., with some lawmakers demanding additional information about his travel and security spending. Mr. Pruitt has often flown on first-class flights, with the airfare alone to Morocco costing more than $16,000.On Tuesday, two of his top aides, including his head of his security detail, resigned.Mr. Pruitt has also faced questions about why he focused on the trip on promoting liquefied natural gas exports, an issue that is not part of the E.P.A.\u2019s mission. Mr. Pruitt testified that the Moroccan ambassador invited him to the country to negotiate the environment portion of a free-trade agreement. He said the ambassador, Lalla Joumala, asked him to raise the issue of liquefied natural gas when he was in Morocco.In April, Mr. Smotkin signed the lobbying contract with the embassy of Morocco to \u201ccraft an outreach program\u201d that includes promoting Morocco as a film destination, with the start date of this contract backdated to January. His connection to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s Morocco trip was first reported over the weekend in Le Desk, a Moroccan news outlet, and on Tuesday in The Washington Post.During his time in Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt and Mr. Smotkin developed a friendship as they repeatedly met up at resort destinations, including at an elite mountainside lodge in Park City, Utah, and the Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs for meetings of Republican attorneys general, attendance lists of the events show.\u201cHe has a good relationship with Scott Pruitt,\u201d said Walter Cohen, the former Pennsylvania attorney general, who has also worked as a lawyer for Comcast, and who was present at several of the social and campaign-fund-raising events. \u201cSome of these meetings we would go out to have dinner with Scott and his wife and Rick and a couple of other people.\u201dMr. Smotkin organized several of the meetings Mr. Pruitt held in Marrakesh and Rabat, according to people familiar with the arrangements. Among the meetings was a Dec. 12 discussion with Mostafa Terrab, the chairman of Morocco\u2019s state-owned phosphate mining company, OCP Group, which Mr. Smotkin attended. Mr. Pruitt during the trip stayed at the luxury H\u00f4tel Sofitel Marrakech, one agency official on the trip said.The day after the meeting, Mr. Smotkin attended a conference sponsored by the OCP Policy Center, a think tank funded by the phosphate giant.A representative for OCP, which originally stood for Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates, did not respond to a request for comment.Maria Bensaid, a spokeswoman for the Moroccan Embassy, said in a statement that the embassy issued the invitation to Mr. Pruitt \u201cto further our partnership and deepen certain sectors of cooperation.\u201d She said all working visits there were organized through official diplomatic channels.Mr. Smotkin was among the Comcast executives who made a contribution in 2013 to Mr. Pruitt as he prepared to run for a second term as attorney general. During Mr. Pruitt\u2019s tenure in Oklahoma, Mr. Smotkin joined with other movie industry executives to reach out to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office, emails show, to seek help in urging an investigation into Google, which NBCUniversal and other companies believed was not doing enough to combat the illegal distribution of bootlegged films on the internet.A spokeswoman for Comcast said that Mr. Smotkin left the company last July and that Comcast was not involved in the Morocco trip.On Mr. Pruitt\u2019s other foreign trip as E.P.A. administrator \u2014 to Italy in June \u2014 he also granted unusual access to a friend, Leonard A. Leo, who heads a conservative judicial group, the Federalist Society, according to three people involved in that trip. Mr. Leo was involved in some aspects of planning the trip and also joined Mr. Pruitt during a visit to the Vatican for a private Mass.Two people involved in the travel arrangements said Mr. Leo\u2019s involvement was unusual because outside personnel do not typically help plan international trips for E.P.A. administrators and because his name was not listed on any publicly released documents.Like Mr. Smotkin, Mr. Leo has enjoyed privileged status at the E.P.A., according to a former agency official, who said that requests made by them were treated as a priority. If either called Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office \u201cand asked for something, we did it, it doesn\u2019t matter what it was,\u201d said the former official, who requested anonymity for fear of running afoul of Mr. Leo, who is powerful among conservatives in Washington.The relationship between Mr. Leo and Mr. Pruitt stems from their involvement in conservative legal fights at the state level.In Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt led the way in legal challenges brought by Republican-led states to Obama administration policies. He also was active in nonprofit groups that sought to spur such fights, including the Republican Attorneys General Association and the Rule of Law Defense Fund. Mr. Pruitt helped create the Rule of Law Defense Fund to assist conservatives who then were using the federal court system to try to block President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental efforts, such as the Clean Power Plan.Mr. Leo, email records from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s Oklahoma office show, joined with Mr. Pruitt to help coordinate some of these efforts, and to raise money for them.Mr. Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff at the time emailed Devon Energy, saying that \u201cthis will be an amazing resource for the AGs and for industry.\u201dMr. Leo was a director of a nonprofit group called the Rule of Law Project that donated $145,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund in 2014.Mr. Leo also joined Mr. Pruitt and his top aides at a top restaurant in Rome, where the bill for the meal totaled several hundred dollars per participant, according to one of the officials. The official said that Mr. Leo traveled with Mr. Pruitt in his motorcade to the Vatican and to the restaurant over the objections of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s aides, according to the official.Government ethics officials said that at a minimum, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar \u2014 an official government document that has been released after Freedom of Information requests by The Times \u2014 should have included details related to the role that Mr. Leo and Mr. Smotkin played in these trips, or their presence as part of the delegation. Neither is mentioned.\u201cWith transparency comes accountability,\u201d said Ms. McGehee of IssueOne, the nonprofit government ethics group.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the title of Aziz Rabbah.

{"Headline": "Winnipeg Looks for Respect, on the Ice and Off It", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 Of course this would happen to Winnipeg.For once, Manitoba is Canada\u2019s hockey epicenter. The Winnipeg Jets have turned the city upside down with their bid to capture the country\u2019s first Stanley Cup since the Montreal Canadiens won 25 years ago.But it is perhaps the sad fate of that overlooked, underdog prairie city that while it is enjoying the biggest moment in its hockey history, an expansion franchise from the American desert \u2014 the Vegas Golden Knights \u2014 is the talk of the hockey world, even in Canada.Sports talk radio in Toronto, Canada\u2019s largest city, often leads with the Golden Knights or the Toronto Blue Jays. In the past 30 days, Google searches for the Blue Jays across Canada outpaced searches for the Jets.And after a rousing home win in Game 1, the Jets are having trouble finding an answer to the Golden Knights in the Western Conference finals, which resume on Sunday with Game 5 in Winnipeg and Vegas holding a 3-1 series lead.Winnipeg is no stranger to doubters, pain or loss. When the Jets left in the mid-1990s for Arizona, their departure compounded the grim outlook for the city. (The N.H.L. returned to Winnipeg in 2011 when the Thrashers moved from Atlanta.)\u201cIt was really a kick in the gut,\u201d Mayor Brian Bowman said.At the same time, the city was losing residents to cities like Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. Then, in 1997, Winnipeg was struck by the worst flood in a century, and it scarred the psyche of its citizens.Winnipeggers need a thick skin. People across the country like to poke fun at their city\u2019s punishing winters, which have been fertile ground for jabs like this one: \u201cIf you have more miles on your snow blower than your car, you may live in Winnipeg.\u201dIn early January, the \u201cWinterpeg\u201d put-downs got national attention when a few San Jose Sharks were asked which N.H.L. city was the worst to play in.Defenseman Justin Braun said: \u201cWinnipeg. Dark, cold, internet a little questionable. Internet doesn\u2019t work ever. I don\u2019t know if they have Wi-Fi there yet.\u201dLike a father whose kids had been bullied, Jets Coach Paul Maurice put everything in perspective.\u201cThat happens in Canada, occasionally,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cPretty regularly every winter. It\u2019s dark at night. Yeah. That happens pretty much around the world.\u201dMaurice added: \u201cI don\u2019t think any coach, any player, trainer, referee should ever complain about a day in the National Hockey League. We got a sold-out building. Pretty sure that goes into hockey-related revenue and everybody cashes their check.\u201dAs the smallest market in the N.H.L., Winnipeg cannot claim the natural beauty of Vancouver, the cowboy cool of Calgary, the vibrancy and prestige of Toronto or the French charm of Montreal.Winnipeg\u2019s claim to fame is that it is a key railway and transportation hub connecting the eastern and western parts of the country.Some of the city\u2019s expatriates in Toronto are starting to learn about Motel Bar, a 40-seat tavern called Little Winnipeg because it shows nothing but Jets games.Daniel Greaves, a Winnipeg native and the lead singer of the band the Watchmen, opened the bar in 2011 to showcase live music. The Jets returned to Winnipeg two months later, and he started putting on their games, though the bar has only one TV and a couple of projection screens.At first, hockey fans would pop in and ask to watch the Maple Leafs\u2019 game. To which Greaves replied: \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll put the Leafs game on when they\u2019re playing the Jets. So twice a year it\u2019s a great spot for Leafs fans.\u201dDrew Gourdie, another Winnipeg native, came for Game 3 against the Golden Knights because his Toronto neighbors showed no interest in the Jets.\u201cI want to be here with my people,\u201d he said.Michal Grajewski has been there from the beginning, earning him a reserved seat at the bar and the title Mayor of Little Winnipeg.\u201cThis bar is like the city of Winnipeg,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best-kept secret that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight. Like Winnipeg has a great arts scene and a great music scene. It\u2019s there for all to see, but for the longest time Winnipeg was one of those places you flew over to get somewhere else.\u201dIn Winnipeg, the intensity over the Jets is fueled by the \u201cwhiteout,\u201d with fans clad all in white along with face paint, costumes and wigs. What began as a marketing gimmick in 1987 has turned into a unifying force for the city. Bowman, the mayor, describes the festive, gritty street parties as \u201cHalloween meets Mardi Gras in a blizzard in January.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that surpasses this in my lifetime,\u201d Bowman, 46, said of the buzz going around town.While people joke about Winnipeg\u2019s winters, the city is strong enough that it can laugh at itself.\u201cWe\u2019re the only city where you can enjoy the best whiteout in the rink and then also on the drive home from the game,\u201d Bowman said.This season, the Jets began using the tagline \u201cRise Together,\u201d which has come to symbolize something bigger than the team. Since 2013, Winnipeg\u2019s population has jumped to 750,000 from 698,000, and the city is promoting itself as a four-season destination.The success of the Jets is changing people\u2019s perception of their own city. No longer a small town, Winnipeg sees itself as a major player.That has led to a newfound confidence and swagger in the city, Bowman said, \u201cand the Jets are taking this to a whole new level.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why A.I. and Cryptocurrency Are Making One Type of Computer Chip Scarce", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two technology booms \u2014 some people might call them frenzies \u2014 are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity.Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin.With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers.\u201cThe chips are simply going out of stock,\u201d said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Beijing in 2014. \u201cAnd the problem is getting worse.\u201dMalong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip.When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier.\u201cWe need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThere is a tangible impact to our research work.\u201dBut he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. \u201cWe have never had this problem before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.\u201dG.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips.Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining.Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards \u2014 flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers \u2014 worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades.That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners \u2014 not to mention gamers \u2014 has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day.\u201cIt is a tough moment,\u201d said Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWe could do more if we had more of these\u201d chips in data centers. \u201cThere are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.\u201dAMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company\u2019s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough.This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I.Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices.\u201cYou want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,\u201d said Mr. Scott of Microsoft.The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year.Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia\u2019s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing.Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless.Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow.Mr. Zeiler said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures.\u201cThe demand,\u201d he said, \u201cis definitely crazy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a researcher who tracks graphics processing units. He is Jon Peddie, not Joe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Free Speech Will Not Save Us", "Date": "2018-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThis argument asks conservatives to recognize that their defense of intellectual diversity on campus is hollow unless they also defend the rights of black athletes to publicly protest. It asks left-wingers to recognize that shouting down right-wing speakers or getting Google engineers fired for \u201cwrongthink\u201d involves the same tactics that they deplore when they\u2019re used against progressives. It asks everyone to commit not just to the letter of the First Amendment but to a broader culture of free speech.I admire the principle of this position, and to some extent I share it: There is no doubt that tolerance and magnanimity are virtues that our society\u2019s warring factions need to cultivate. But it\u2019s also important to recognize that these virtues depend on deeper forms of wisdom and consensus, and they can\u2019t always sustain themselves in cultures and institutions that are simply going bad. Like everything associated with \u201cclassical liberalism\u201d \u2014 to borrow a label claimed by some of the shouted-down academic dissidents \u2014 the idea of free speech is part of a superstructure that can easily be pulled apart from below by contending factions, or crumble when its cultural foundation disappears.Consider the N.F.L. protests first. Yes, it would be good if there were a stronger commitment to free speech from team owners, and if they weren\u2019t so willing to collude against their players\u2019 activism.The reasons for that counterprotest include an admirable patriotism and an understandable weariness with the politicization of sports and entertainment. But they also include a typical conservative cluelessness about black grievances, a performative and commercialized Americanism that parodies healthy civic life, and the toxic identity politics that Donald Trump is constantly encouraging. And then, of course, the N.F.L. is particularly vulnerable to Trump\u2019s demagogy because its business model depends on gladiatorial combat whose medical risks it has been desperate to hush up.So the N.F.L. owners have a multilayered problem, cultural and financial and political and medical, to which a simple why-don\u2019t-they-respect-free-speech solution seems woefully insufficient. Everything about the intersection of sports and race relations and the Trump presidency is simply toxic, and expecting free speech to flourish where those rivers meet is like suggesting that a Superfund site cleanup begin by planting daffodils in the most polluted stretch.Meritocracy, materialism and smartphones would still induce mental breakdowns among bright young climbers. The humanities would still be in existential crisis and possibly terminal decline. A \u201chedge fund with a library attached\u201d model of administration would still prevail. An incoherent mix of ambitious scientism and post-Protestant moralism and simple greed would still be the ruling spirit.Much of recent left-wing campus activism has to be understood in this depressing context \u2014 as a response to a pre-existing crisis, an attempt to infuse morality and purpose into institutions that employ many brilliant minds but mostly promote incurious ambition and secular conformity.Yes, this makes the problem sound insanely big; the advantage of free speech as common ground is that you don\u2019t have to solve the \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with academia\u201d problem or the equally daunting \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with big-time sports and race relations.\u201dBut sometimes the problems are bad enough that the procedural approach isn\u2019t a solution. And with due respect to the First Amendment, I think this is one of those times.Advertisement"}

The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers.Now they\u2019re trying to join forces.Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing.The product would be Goldman\u2019s first credit card offering and could help the bank\u2019s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant\u2019s digital payment service.The two companies have been talking for months and haven\u2019t settled on all the details, said one of the people.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment.The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come.The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer.\u201cThis seems to make sense,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, \u201cIt\u2019s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer finance business.\u201dPart of Goldman\u2019s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times.Apple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products.Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple\u2019s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don\u2019t yet accept digital payments, the person said.\u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,\u201d said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. \u201cThe Apple Barclays card isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to turn that person\u2019s head, in terms of making them want to get a card. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what these two brands can do to create something that might make more of a splash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Stockton Tries Free Cash to Fight Income Inequality", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In the national consciousness, Stockton has had a run of bad associations. It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy.Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself.That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state\u2019s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality.The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city\u2019s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations \u2014 a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income\u2019s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor.The idea is that single mothers might use cash to go back to school, while poor families add fruit and vegetables to their diets.Basic income confronts potent skepticism. Some argue it will undermine the work ethic. Others contend that it will compete with \u2014 and siphon funding from \u2014 existing government relief programs for the poor and jobless. A national program could cost trillions of dollars a year.But the Stockton trial is engineered as an test of how an unconditional cash grant program can operate.Which means that a Central Valley City that has long represented scarcity will now be used to convey how life can change when struggling people get a little more.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Google\u2019s work for the Defense Department has touched off an existential crisis in Mountain View.It recently won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used for drone strikes.By reviewing emails and documents and interviewing Google insiders, Times reporters got a detailed picture of how the news fractured its work force, fueling heated staff meetings and prompting employees with moral objections to resign.Executives now face this dilemma: Proceeding with defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; rejecting such work would deprive the company of a potentially huge business.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Faces Regulatory Fight on Its Home Turf", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The staging ground for one of the biggest regulatory fights facing the technology industry is far removed from Washington or Brussels, tucked into an alley next to a wine and cheese shop about 30 miles from Silicon Valley.A barely furnished real estate office in an upscale Oakland neighborhood is the headquarters for backers of a proposed California ballot measure that would provide consumers with increased privacy rights, including the ability to demand that companies do not sell their personal data.The proposed ballot measure is the passion project of an unlikely trio: a real estate developer, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and a financial industry executive. They say they have no political aspirations. They\u2019re not techies and they aren\u2019t your run-of-the-mill privacy zealots. Instead, they say they are like many internet consumers \u2014 a little freaked out about tech firms gobbling up people\u2019s personal data.\u201cPeople want some basic rights,\u201d said Alastair Mactaggart, the 51-year-old real estate developer who has put more than $2 million of his own money to get the measure off the ground. \u201cPeople are resentful but accepting because there isn\u2019t any sense of control about their data.\u201dThe California measure has three major components: It gives consumers the right to ask companies to disclose what data they have collected on them; the right to demand that they not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes; and the right to sue or fine companies that violate the law.Google, Facebook, major telecommunications companies and California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have already come out against the initiative, saying it is flawed and a threat to the economic model supporting the internet. They\u2019ve created an organization to fight the measure with a decidedly populist name, \u201cThe Committee to Protect California Jobs.\u201dPolitical consultants have told the initiative\u2019s backers that they should prepare for the opposition campaign to spend $100 million. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the opposition, declined to put a number on the campaign spending, but acknowledged that there is a lot at stake. \u201cIt\u2019s California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s privacy initiative hasn\u2019t been certified yet by state officials for the November election, but it is expected to appear on the ballot. The measure\u2019s backers said they have submitted over 600,000 signatures, far eclipsing the 366,000 minimum requirement.Mr. Mactaggart said he first became concerned about data privacy when he asked a Google engineer at a cocktail party if he should be worried about all the information companies were collecting about users. The engineer\u2019s response surprised him: Mr. Mactaggart was right to be worried.Mr. Mactaggart said he then reached out to Rick Arney, a finance industry executive who had worked in the California State Senate as a legislative analyst 20 years ago. Their children go to the same school, and Mr. Mactaggart knew that Mr. Arney was a supporter of ballot measures as a way for ordinary citizens to get something done outside of the political system.\u201cOne of the reasons why it\u2019s brought as a ballot initiative is that there is consensus that Silicon Valley owns Sacramento,\u201d said Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and an adviser for the initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s no prospect of any consequential consumer privacy legislation.\u201dBut there was a small problem: neither Mr. Mactaggart nor Mr. Arney was a privacy expert or policy wonk. So they hired Mary Stone Ross, another neighborhood friend, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and had been legal counsel for the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to oversee the effort.They spent months talking to technologists, academics and lawyers. They conducted polls and focus groups to understand what people wanted.After considering various options, they decided against taking a hard-line approach. Companies can still use personal data for their own purposes to sell advertising or improve products. They would be restricted, however, from selling or disclosing that data to someone else for \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d upon a consumer\u2019s request.Mr. Hoofnagle said, however, that the measure\u2019s financial punishments for violators give the law teeth that previous attempts at privacy regulation lacked. It also takes a broader view of what constitutes personal information beyond real names and Social Security numbers \u2014 including biometric data and numbers that identify the devices people use.Opponents of the measure say that those broad definitions of personal data are excessive and that companies can adopt their own privacy rules faster and more effectively.\u201cSomething that takes such a sledgehammer approach to regulating data is extraordinarily concerning,\u201d said Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs at the Internet Association, an industry trade group. \u201cWe think the initiative is filled with flaws and it will have really dangerous consequences for the California economy.\u201dThe initiative\u2019s backers said they were raising money for their campaign using a crowdfunding approach. But to get their message out and raise awareness of the measure, they are advertising on \u2014 where else? \u2014 Facebook.Reflecting on his transformation from wealthy real estate developer to privacy activist, Mr. Mactaggart said that after devoting two years and millions of dollars, he\u2019s more certain than ever that this initiative is important and necessary \u2014 a point brought home during a focus group session that took place in Sunnyvale, a city in the heart of Silicon Valley, with a room full of engineers.\u201cOf all the focus groups we did around the state, that was the one most vehement about the need for this,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said. \u201cThat was really one of the catalyzing moments for me when I was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re onto something here.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

What kinds of responses are you looking for?Whatever the subject, you\u2019ll see that the best pieces year after year make both personal connections to the news and go beyond the personal to discuss the broader questions and ideas that the topic raises.Q. What are the rules?\u2014 We will post the same questions every Friday, starting June 15. Each week we will ask, \u201cWhat interested you most in The Times this week? Why?\u201d That is where you should post your picks (and reasons) any time until the next Friday. Then we will close that post to comments and open a new one with the same questions. That means that students can write in on any day until Friday, Aug. 24, at 7 a.m. Eastern when the contest ends.As soon as the contest starts, we will keep an up-to-date link to that week\u2019s question at the top of this page.\u2014 Our commenting system allows responses up to 1,500 characters, which is somewhere between 250 and 300 words.\u2014 Make sure to provide us with the full URL or headline (for example, \u201cReview: \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 Raises the Bar for Broadway Magic\u201d or https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/theater/review-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-raises-the-bar-for-broadway-magic.html).Q.

How can teachers, librarians and parents use this challenge?What interested me this week in the Times? There was a lot to reflect on, as usual: Barcelona, Charlottesville, and, on a more cheerful note, the solar eclipse. Despite the plethora of options, I am writing about the Summer Reading Contest itself and how it has interested, and transformed, me over the past ten weeks.Prior to this summer, the only writing I did was for school assignments or Google searches. And if I did get around to it, I never reread what I wrote. That\u2019s why, as the weeks went on, I surprised myself when I began double and triple checking my comments for mistakes, of which there were far more than expected!Another transformation is my newfound interest in the news. I used to be the kind of person who opened a newspaper and went straight to the puzzles section, and though that may be unchanged, I now feel compelled to read a few articles that catch my eye too. In return, exposing myself to current affairs has fine-tuned my political opinions, and through consistent writing I learned to express them in a way that accentuates them.The result? I feel grounded in my views and understand what\u2019s going on in the world. It\u2019s amazing what a change 1,500 characters a week make.Thank you for making this contest a hit year after year, and please spread the word that it\u2019s back for a ninth season.Good luck!__________Questions?

But today, there is a Walmart within 10 miles of 90 percent of the population of the United States, leaving little room for expansion.A historically frugal company that has done very few deals of significance, Walmart is now spending billions as it seeks new overseas markets, tries to capture different demographics and bolsters its grocery offerings.Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said he worried about the wisdom of Walmart\u2019s desire to attack Amazon\u2019s strongholds.\u201cThey seem to be somewhat Amazon obsessed,\u201d he said.July 2016JD.com PartnershipJan. 2018Rakuten PartnershipApril 2018ASDA SaleMay 2018Flipkart AcquisitionIndia is the golden frontier of digital retailing to Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon. The country is home to 443 million millennials, and smartphone penetration is expected to double in the next three years.\u201cWhen you step back and look at the world and look at all of the countries \u2014 their size, their growth rate, their potential \u2014 there just aren\u2019t opportunities like the one we are looking at,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in a conference call from India on Wednesday.Investors did not necessarily share his enthusiasm. After the Flipkart deal, the company shares sank more than 3 percent.Walmart is begging for Wall Street\u2019s patience. The company has been reordering its international business to free up cash and resources so that it can focus on high-growth markets and leave those that are lagging.In China, Walmart is deepening its ties and taking a small stake in JD.com, which competes with Amazon and the country\u2019s own e-commerce giant, Alibaba.While such moves make sense on the grand chessboard of global retailing, Walmart will need to deliver. It is going to cost billions for Walmart to turn Flipkart into a profitable business.The deal will cut into Walmart\u2019s overall earnings by about 60 cents per share next year.Oct. 2017Parcel AcquisitionMarch 2018Grocery DeliveryEverybody has to eat, and that essential truth is embedded in Walmart\u2019s growth strategy.Walmart is the largest grocery store in the United States and when it comes to fresh food it has a major head start on Amazon, which has been ramping up its efforts after acquiring Whole Foods last June.But mastering food delivery is a steep challenge for Walmart.The company has experimented with partnerships with Uber, and store workers are making deliveries on their way home from work.\u201cThe grocery business is hard,\u201d said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cOnline grocery is even harder.\u201dAug. 2016Jet AcquisitionMarch 2017Modcloth AcquisitionJune 2017Bonobos AcquisitionKelly green golf pants. Pink linen shirts. Vintage spring dresses.The Bonobos and Modcloth brands are quite different from what you typically find on the clothing racks at a Walmart Supercenter.And that appears to be the point of those acquisitions last year.Many of Walmart\u2019s shoppers in its stores tend to be in the lower- and lower-middle income brackets.Walmart\u2019s biggest online bet on urban shoppers was its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com in August 2016. But that deal has shown signs of trouble. Last quarter, analysts said Jet\u2019s growth had slowed and the company said it would focus its efforts on finding new customers through its flagship website, Walmart.com.\u201cA lot of the e-commerce push has been trying to appeal to higher income demographics,\u201d said Mr. Mushkin. \u201cThe problem is that the Walmart brand doesn\u2019t always translate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Privacy Lawyer Giving Big Tech an $8.8 Billion Headache", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftForty-eight minutes later, Facebook and Google got their first taste of how troublesome the new European privacy regime could be.At 12:48 a.m. Brussels time, an Austrian privacy advocacy group filed the first of its four complaints against the Silicon Valley tech giants. The nonprofit organization NOYB \u2014 short for \u201cnone of your business\u201d \u2014 claimed that Google and Facebook, along with two of Facebook\u2019s subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules.Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic \u2014 the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebook and Google for months \u2014 its substance was very real.\u201cIt was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,\u201d Mr. Schrems told me. Facebook and Google, he said, have \u201cfundamentally tried to ignore or redefine\u201d the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used.\u201cAll of these cases should be absolutely won,\u201d he added.Tech companies never thought that Europe\u2019s data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law\u2019s complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies.As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced.As global companies, Facebook and Google don\u2019t have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations.\u201cWe have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\u201dA Google spokesman, Al Verney, said, \u201cWe build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation.\u201dAt the core of Mr. Schrems\u2019s complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used.Like many companies, Facebook and Google, which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebook members who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn\u2019t agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones.Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirement that consent be particularized and \u201cfreely given.\u201d To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others.Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook.\u201dMr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like Google and Facebook to abandon, he said. And he doesn\u2019t believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads.\u201cYou can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,\u201d he said.But if these types of complaints succeed \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them \u2014 it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies.\u201cMassive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,\u201d said Courtney M. Bowman, a lawyer at the firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in international privacy law. \u201cIt would be a strong signal from the E.U. authorities that this isn\u2019t just a law that\u2019s on the books that isn\u2019t going to be enforced,\u201d she said.Whether or not Facebook and Google end up paying billion-dollar fines, it\u2019s clear that the G.D.P.R. has already introduced a new, scary variable into Silicon Valley\u2019s privacy calculations. If tech giants know that privacy wonks like Mr. Schrems are watching their moves carefully, probing for openings to file complaints against them \u2014 and now, they undoubtedly do \u2014 they will need to think twice before adding new, privacy-invading features.\u201cIt\u2019s about who has control over information in an information age,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. \u201cWho has power over all this stuff?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 CBS takes its biggest step yet to block a Viacom deal.\u2022 Tim Armstrong looks like he\u2019s staying put at Oath.\u2022 The complexities of President Trump moving to save ZTE.\u2022 What\u2019s in store for Xerox?\u2022 How the White House is warning Europe over Iran.For Les Moonves and his team at CBS, Monday meant war against Shari Redstone and her desire to merge the media company with its corporate sibling, Viacom.Let\u2019s break down what happened:\u2022 In the lawsuit, CBS accused Ms. Redstone of presenting \u201ca significant threat of irreparable and irreversible harm to the company and its stockholders.\u201d\u2022 CBS also asserts in its lawsuit, \u201cMs. Redstone told the C.E.O. of a potential acquirer of CBS that he should not make such an offer, thereby depriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity that the board or the special committee should have been free to evaluate.\u201d That chief executive was Lowell C. McAdam of Verizon, according to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly.The lawsuit was pre-emptive, given that Ms. Redstone has considered replacing CBS\u2019s board if it continued to resist a merger with Viacom. CBS has wanted Les Moonves to become the combined company\u2019s C.E.O. and his C.O.O., Joe Ianniello, to take the No. 2 position. Viacom has pressed for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish, to hold that spot, and Ms. Redstone had largely sided with Viacom.CBS added that its board believes it is acting out of a fiduciary duty to all of its shareholders, and not just Ms. Redstone.\u2014 Michael de la MercedAfter CBS essentially declared war against its controlling shareholder and her desire to combine the company with Viacom, Ms. Redstone dropped a bombshell of her own.From a statement by National Amusements, the vehicle through which the Redstones control CBS and Viacom:NAI believes CBS\u2019s action today was precipitated following NAI raising specific concerns about incidents of bullying and intimidation in relation to one CBS director, dating back to 2016. NAI has made every effort to deal with this matter privately and confidentially. Unfortunately, CBS\u2019s action today continues to enable and empower such conduct.In meetings and informal discussions during the week of May 7, 2018 and continuing over the weekend of May 11\u201313, 2018, the CBS Special Committee finally determined that a CBS/Viacom merger is not in the best interests of CBS stockholders (other than NAI).CBS asserted that it filed suit because it was worried about Ms. Redstone blocking a meeting of the special committee taking place on Thursday. At the meeting, the committee is set to consider issuing a special dividend to all shareholders that could effectively neuter Ms. Redstone\u2019s 79 percent voting stake in the media company.National Amusement also said that CBS and Viacom had even reached a provisional agreement on valuation. Viacom\u2019s investors would receive 0.6135 CBS shares for each Viacom share they own, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. The valuation marked a compromise for both sides and is a sign that CBS had previously supported exploring a merger of the two companies.Symantec, a cybersecurity software company, on Monday released details about an internal investigation that arose from concerns of a former employee.Symantec announced the investigation late on Thursday but provided scant details. On Monday, the company said the employee had drawn attention to certain financial measures and the company\u2019s public disclosures, including commentary on its historical financial results. The measures included those that might affect executive compensation, the company said in a statement released after the close of regular trading on Monday. Retaliation was another issue the former employee raised, the statement said, without going into detail.Symantec said it \u201cdid not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements.\u201dShares of Symantec lost a third of their value in Friday but recovered somewhat on Monday. The stock finished up nearly 10 percent and added another 2.6 percent after the close.Symantec executives on Thursday did not hold a question and answer session with analysts to discuss the quarterly results it put out that day. It held such a session on Monday, but the executives declined to answer questions about the audit committee\u2019s investigation.\u2014 Peter EavisThe betting law, called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling. It exempted Nevada, where sports betting has long been legal, along with sports lotteries in Delaware, Montana and Oregon.

In Monday\u2019s decision in the case, Murphy v.

From the FT\u2019s story:Mr. Armstrong, who also declined to comment, ran AOL until its $4.4bn sale to Verizon in 2015. He is chief executive of Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns AOL and Yahoo. One person close to the search process said Mr. Armstrong would be a good choice as \u201che knows all about restructuring\u201d.A former Google executive, Mr. Armstrong was appointed to the helm of AOL in 2009 to revive a company that had fallen from the dizzying heights it had reached during the dot-com bubble.Since the FT article was published, I\u2019ve heard arguments that Mr. Armstrong would have made sense as WPP\u2019s next C.E.O., given his commercial and digital savvy.

The proceedings will not be televised. A spokesman for Mr. Tajani said lawmakers in attendance will be able to speak freely about it, and a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be released afterward.The format of the meeting was the result of weeks of tense negotiations between Mr. Tajani\u2019s office and Facebook, according to Pedro L\u00f3pez de Pablo, a spokesman for the European People\u2019s Party, the biggest party in parliament, which endorsed Mr. Tajani\u2019s proposed format.Still, one European lawmaker who was invited to the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg said he would not attend if it was not made public. \u201cIt must be a public hearing \u2014 why not a Facebook Live?\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a liberal group in the European Parliament.The prospect of Mr. Zuckerberg publicly testifying before the European Parliament would have raised the profile of an institution whose 751 members rarely make international headlines. The body does not directly regulate Facebook or other technology companies.Yet Europe has won a reputation in recent years as the technology industry\u2019s toughest watchdog. Officials in the region have investigated Facebook for the improper handling of customer data, fined Amazon and other companies over their tax practices and penalized firms like Google for antitrust violations.\u201cIt shows Zuckerberg really is worried about the effects of regulation and the potential for more,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University who focuses on antitrust issues and intellectual property law. Mr. Carrier added that the trip demonstrated the leading role Europe plays in regulating the tech sector.Most concerning for Mr. Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley, Mr. Carrier said, was a broader skepticism of the industry. \u201cBig tech is under the public microscope from the left and the right,\u201d he said.Facebook has also announced new privacy and security settings that give people more control over their data. This week, the company said it had suspended 200 third-party apps pending a further review of how they had handled Facebook data.Prashant S.

{"Headline": "We Are the Original Lifehackers", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisabilityMs. Jackson is a disability design advocate.Betsey and her husband, Sam, began to scour local hardware stores and weekend markets for better kitchen tools. But kitchen supply offerings were limited to slender, pointed, gripless products. What Betsey was hoping to find were more like the hand tools that New England Shakers had crafted a century before, with their beautifully and purposeful tactile handles. Sam, who had started a successful housewares business in 1960, began to plan a new line of kitchen tools with Betsey that would feel good, not just in her hand but in anyone\u2019s hand. That was the genesis of the cooking tools and housewares company OXO, established in 1990.Since then OXO has become a nearly universal example of universal design, a concept that strives to produce products and spaces accessible to everyone, disabled or not. It produces more that 1,000 products sold globally.As a disabled designer, I have come to believe that products are a manifestation of relationships. Disabled people have long been integral to design processes, though we\u2019re frequently viewed as \u201cinspiration\u201d rather than active participants. When I discovered Betsey was a talented architect in her own right, I began to wonder about her relationship to OXO. And so I reached out to ask.Our conversation left me wondering when a hack becomes more than a hack and turns into something of commercial value. And moreover, I wanted to know why these inventions aren\u2019t routinely written into disability history.Such stories reach back centuries and continue on to the present day, but they often go untold. For instance, you probably have not heard of Stephan Farffler, the Nuremberg-based watchmaker and paraplegic who in 1655 created what he called the manumotive carriage. Farffler accomplished two things with his invention; he created the first self-propelled wheelchair, and unbeknown to him, it became the precursor for the modern-day bicycle.These stories exemplify what it means to be an original lifehacker; our unique experiences and insights enable us to use what\u2019s available to make things accessible. Yet, despite this history of creating elegant solutions for ourselves, our contributions are often overshadowed or misrepresented, favoring instead a story with a savior as its protagonist.This was the case with OXO. \u201cThe general understanding,\u201d Betsey told me, \u201cwas of the brilliance and kindness of Sam who made these tools for his poor crippled wife so she could function in the kitchen. I will probably go down in history as having arthritis rather than having the conceptual idea of making these comfortable for your hand.\u201dWhen people like Betsey take credit for their contributions, it allows someone like me to take ownership of mine. This is how we attract disabled people to design.Betsey now lives in what she calls an elder community. A group of designers recently asked her and a few of her neighbors to test a gripping tool prototype. As Betsey was trying it out, she thought of her OXO Jar Opener and told the designers, \u201cYou know, if you put the grip on one side instead of both, it will be lighter and more efficient.\u201d They took her advice. I asked Betsey if they had any idea who she was. Laughing, she said no.It is my hope that they know now, and that one day everyone will know what we do.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is a Dumber Phone a Better Phone?", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIf you\u2019re one of those people, it seems likely that your smartphone doubles as your alarm clock, meaning it\u2019s the very first thing you hear every day, rousing you from your sleep before spilling a night\u2019s worth of inbound information into view the moment it is silenced. From that point, it is hungry for attention: In the bathroom, in the kitchen and at the table, it is a constant accomplice, as helpful or unhelpful as you want or allow it to be.The smartphone is half of a strained and intimate relationship, one that we never could have imagined would become so serious, but which we now can\u2019t imagine leaving. This portrait of discontent would seem to suggest a need \u2014 or at least some demand \u2014 for smartphone alternatives. But the market has yet to signal that it\u2019s sick of smartphones, only that it is running out of people who haven\u2019t owned at least one. Sales are still growing; they\u2019re just accelerating less. The obvious demand is still for more.There are newly designed less-smart phones that better split the difference: the Light Phone 2 and the Unihertz Jelly, a full-fledged but strategically miniaturized Android handset. Each is well equipped for the moment, gesturing, in some element of its design, to the contradictory and possibly unresolvable feelings of the disaffected smartphone user. Each also got off to a strong start, identifying at least a sliver of demand with viral crowdfunding campaigns: The Light Phone raised more than $1.5 million on Indiegogo for its second iteration; the Jelly raised $1.7 million on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.The Light Phone promised detoxification and escape, taking and encouraging a performative approach to smartphone anxiety \u2014 a conspicuously consumed juice cleanse, a loudly anticipated fast, a week away \u201coff the grid.\u201d It was, in its first iteration, capable only of making calls. (The 2 will allow texting and might include basic mapping and ride-hailing. Social media, the company says, is a \u201cno go.\u201d) In essence, it\u2019s a luxurious protest, a wellness-oriented alternative to powering up an old flip phone or strutting out the door devil-free.If the Light Phone suggests that the problem with your iPhone is that it does too much, the Jelly instead proposes that it\u2019s too good at doing what it does: too easy to get lost in, like a TV; too easy to do work on, like a laptop; too easy to turn to in a moment of silence or inactivity. The Jelly has all the basic stuff: It runs a version of Google\u2019s Android, it has high-speed data and it supports the same apps available to any other smartphone user. But its anti-innovation is brutal: It has a tiny, 2.45-inch screen. Its approach to smartphone moderation is to make the process of using it difficult enough that, in more marginal cases, it\u2019s simply not worth it. It\u2019s an engagement machine with the resistance turned up as high as possible. Messages become shorter. Reading becomes more deliberate. An idle check of the phone is associated less with the rush of refreshing an app than with the tedious process of opening one in the first place. As an individual strategy, the device supposes that helplessness might be solved, or at least replaced, with frustration.They are the products the tech giants haven\u2019t given us and probably never will. But they illustrate, at least, how narrow the industry\u2019s imagination has become, and how much we wish for its expansion in any direction but directly, inevitably forward. They may also suggest a need to adjust our collective sense of what smartphones are, and why they bother us when they do.Another world-altering technology offers a good comparison point: the automobile. We might enjoy driving, and we are miserable in traffic. We buy cars because we need them, and we might buy specific cars because we want them, and the best ones can make a bad commute more bearable. But the problem isn\u2019t our car. It\u2019s all the other cars; the cities designed around them; the roads created for and now clogged by them. Smartphones are now trapped inside the world we\u2019ve constructed around them, and so are we. If we want to escape, it won\u2019t be another phone that gets us out./\u2022/An earlier version of this article misstated the amount raised by the Jelly on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. It was $1.7 million, not close to $3 million.John Herrman is a technology reporter at The Times. Next Week: On Photography, by Teju ColeAdvertisement"}

Marriage connects two families, each with their own language, customs and way of chopping onions. Uniting the differences can be like trying to piece Pangea back together. Further complication: I have a mother-shaped hole in my heart.The story of my childhood in rural Missouri is not a tidy one. My mother basically abandoned me as a young child, sending me from the constant chaos of her domestic situations to live with others again and again. My father wasn\u2019t around at all. The burden of raising me fell upon my wonderful extended family; grandparents, aunts, uncles and older siblings all took turns. But no one can take the place of a mother. The mother-daughter relationship is one of the most fundamental, informative and complex relationships of a woman\u2019s life. I longed for it as a child and expressed my frustration as a child would \u2014 by being needy, annoying, attention seeking.The desire is no less strong now as an adult woman, longing for the voice at the end of a late night phone call or an authority on how to thicken soup or remove a stain. People are not handing out mothers on the street. I have not yet managed to achieve, please or bargain my way into having one. And I still sometimes express this lack by being needy, annoying and attention seeking. My poor, long-suffering husband.Though I have cobbled together some answers from experience, Google and good friends, my mother wound remains. I cry at movies about mothers. I cry at the trailers of movies about mothers. I cry if someone I know has a fight with her mother. I cry if I even think about becoming a mother. How would I know how without having had a model? Meanwhile, my own fecund uterine years are slipping by.Then comes along my mother-in-law.When I first met my partner\u2019s parents 12 years ago, I spent three hours deciding on the most capable and love-deserving outfit in my closet, settling on a baby-pink sweater under a black blazer. We decided to meet in Manhattan for Italian food since they would be taking the train in from Connecticut.I had so many questions for them. Did my husband always love to read? When did you know he had a gift for music? What was he like as a little boy?I wanted to understand the years I had missed in his life, the years that shaped him into the wonderful human being he had become.They shifted in their seats and answered each question with short replies: \u201cHe did.\u201d \u201cAround 5.\u201d \u201cHe was like a little boy.\u201dNo questions seemed to be forthcoming from them about me, so when the evening ended we parted ways without me knowing them or them knowing me and I walked away feeling completely crushed. They obviously hated me.Then my husband put his arm around me and said, \u201cThat went great.\u201d He wasn\u2019t being sarcastic.When he flew home with me for the first time, my two sisters grilled him with questions about his family and past. \u201cHow many siblings do you have?\u201d \u201cWhat are your parents like?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite kind of pie?\u201d I kept thinking smugly: \u201cNow this is how you welcome someone into your family.\u201dMinutes later, however, I found him hiding on the back patio. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I said.\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust taking a break from the interrogation.\u201dMy husband and I come from families that are so culturally different that in the beginning we did not know how to be in each other\u2019s families. Mine is huge and southern and gregarious, full of drama and closeness. His is reserved, East Coast Catholics of Irish descent.I thought they were cold and vowed to wear them down. Every year for the last 12, I have written his parents a thank-you note on his birthday, expressing my gratitude for the person they raised. Not once have they acknowledged these notes.Every time I saw them, I hugged them close and said, \u201cI love you, guys.\u201d And they never said it back. Not for a decade.I tried hard not to take this personally. Demonstrative, verbalized love was simply not their thing. Fine. Even so, I wanted them to know how much I loved them and appreciated their son. So I chose to tell them. Over and over.And somewhere along the way, we started to meet in the middle. I began to understand that his family did show love but in a different way. They do table arrangements. They move furniture. They support the goals of those they care about. They show love by showing up, and I came to respect that.Slowly, after many years, they also started to say it, responding to my stubborn affection with \u201cI love you, too.\u201d I nearly did a victory dance the first time they said it. I suppose it\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t say it for so many years because they didn\u2019t love me, but that\u2019s not the conclusion I came to. I think it\u2019s more that outward displays of affection were uncomfortable for them. After a while, though, they understood that hearing \u201cI love you\u201d was something I needed.Now they throw the phrase around with the ease of people who have been saying it their entire lives \u2014 at arrivals and departures and sometimes dropped into the middle of conversations.My mother-in-law is a gardener. She knows the name of every plant and flower, both the common and scientific names. She has fully outfitted me with gardening clothes and tools that I don\u2019t know how to use with the hope of instilling this enthusiasm in me. I find this endearing, and I confess that I feign interest so we have more reasons to talk.In person, she is stoic, intelligent and polite. But in her emails she is effusive, warm, enthusiastic and expansive. I\u2019m not sure why there\u2019s a difference. Maybe because this avenue of communication is private and makes her feel safe. But I choose this version of her as the real one.We regularly exchange lengthy, unabashedly loving emails, full of the mundane and the profound: \u201cDid you get the tulip catalog I sent you?\u201d \u201cI looked at that mural and I just knew centuries haven\u2019t changed humans. We\u2019re still the same.\u201dIn person, we discuss books and writing and art because these are safe and distant topics. But I tune my heart to hers and deliver secret messages that I love her and I hope she loves me, too. Because excessive displays of emotion are still not natural to her, I try my best to play it cool.Often, I have failed. I cry easily. I laugh easily. I say things without calculating their effect. She has a long fuse for me, and this quality \u2014 her endless patience \u2014 is also a form of love.She has given me support, encouragement and gentle reprimands to let go, to resist pettiness, to forgive. She explains which plants need what in order to survive, and she has, at times, applied an annoying amount of pressure on me to do what she believes is best for my life. I have come to realize this is what having a mother may be like.If there were an intelligence quotient that measured empathy, I\u2019m certain she would test in the highest percentile. On the city streets, she gives her dollars to every homeless person who asks. She sees everyone as someone\u2019s child. Even my mother is someone\u2019s child. I am too.For my entire life, motherhood has felt like a vast, impossible terrain I dare not tread upon. But after more than a decade of watching my mother-in-law gracefully traverse this ground, I feel as if for the first time I have what I needed all along. There\u2019s more than one way to love in this world and no one family owns the correct way.A few months ago, my entire in-law clan celebrated my mother-in-law\u2019s 70th birthday with her at a restaurant over osso buco and tiramis\u00f9. I cried myself to sleep that night, afraid of when I will lose her. After all this time, I had finally found her.She emailed me the other day to check on the daffodils.I wrote back to say they have indeed bloomed and are growing toward the light. Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa and Siri Can Hear This Hidden Command. You Can\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "Researchers can now send secret audio instructions undetectable to the human ear to Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant.Supported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Many people have grown accustomed to talking to their smart devices, asking them to read a text, play a song or set an alarm. But someone else might be secretly talking to them, too.A group of students from University of California, Berkeley, and Georgetown University showed in 2016 that they could hide commands in white noise played over loudspeakers and through YouTube videos to get smart devices to turn on airplane mode or open a website.This month, some of those Berkeley researchers published a research paper that went further, saying they could embed commands directly into recordings of music or spoken text. So while a human listener hears someone talking or an orchestra playing, Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker might hear an instruction to add something to your shopping list.\u201cWe wanted to see if we could make it even more stealthy,\u201d said Nicholas Carlini, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in computer security at U.C. Berkeley and one of the paper\u2019s authors.Mr. Carlini added that while there was no evidence that these techniques have left the lab, it may only be a matter of time before someone starts exploiting them. \u201cMy assumption is that the malicious people already employ people to do what I do,\u201d he said.These deceptions illustrate how artificial intelligence \u2014 even as it is making great strides \u2014 can still be tricked and manipulated. Computers can be fooled into identifying an airplane as a cat just by changing a few pixels of a digital image, while researchers can make a self-driving car swerve or speed up simply by pasting small stickers on road signs and confusing the vehicle\u2019s computer vision system.With audio attacks, the researchers are exploiting the gap between human and machine speech recognition. Speech recognition systems typically translate each sound to a letter, eventually compiling those into words and phrases. By making slight changes to audio files, researchers were able to cancel out the sound that the speech recognition system was supposed to hear and replace it with a sound that would be transcribed differently by machines while being nearly undetectable to the human ear.Amazon said that it doesn\u2019t disclose specific security measures, but it has taken steps to ensure its Echo smart speaker is secure. Google said security is an ongoing focus and that its Assistant has features to mitigate undetectable audio commands. Both companies\u2019 assistants employ voice recognition technology to prevent devices from acting on certain commands unless they recognize the user\u2019s voice.Apple said its smart speaker, HomePod, is designed to prevent commands from doing things like unlocking doors, and it noted that iPhones and iPads must be unlocked before Siri will act on commands that access sensitive data or open apps and websites, among other measures.There is already a history of smart devices being exploited for commercial gains through spoken commands.There is no American law against broadcasting subliminal messages to humans, let alone machines. The Federal Communications Commission discourages the practice as \u201ccounter to the public interest,\u201d and the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters bans \u201ctransmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness.\u201d Neither say anything about subliminal stimuli for smart devices.Courts have ruled that subliminal messages may constitute an invasion of privacy, but the law has not extended the concept of privacy to machines.Now the technology is racing even further ahead of the law. Last year, researchers at Princeton University and China\u2019s Zhejiang University demonstrated that voice-recognition systems could be activated by using frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The attack first muted the phone so the owner wouldn\u2019t hear the system\u2019s responses, either.The technique, which the Chinese researchers called DolphinAttack, can instruct smart devices to visit malicious websites, initiate phone calls, take a picture or send text messages. While DolphinAttack has its limitations \u2014 the transmitter must be close to the receiving device \u2014 experts warned that more powerful ultrasonic systems were possible.That warning was borne out in April, when researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign demonstrated ultrasound attacks from 25 feet away. While the commands couldn\u2019t penetrate walls, they could control smart devices through open windows from outside a building.The Berkeley group also embedded the command in music files, including a four-second clip from Verdi\u2019s \u201cRequiem.\u201dHow device makers respond will differ, especially as they balance security with ease of use.Mr. Carlini said he was confident that in time he and his colleagues could mount successful adversarial attacks against any smart device system on the market.\u201cWe want to demonstrate that it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, \u201cand then hope that other people will say, \u2018O.K. this is possible, now let\u2019s try and fix it.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiaomi, Chinese Gadget Maker, Opens Floodgates for Hong Kong I.P.O.s", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A gadget maker. An online delivery service. And the electronic payment company tied to the tech giant Alibaba.These are among a spate of Chinese companies expected to open their doors to ordinary investors in Hong Kong over the next year through public listings, after a loosening of rules by the city\u2019s stock exchange. If many of them end up listing in Hong Kong, then China will have accomplished a major goal: keeping its hugely successful tech boom at home.The flurry of big-name Chinese companies potentially choosing to stay home, rather than go abroad, in search of funding is part of a broader push by China, which has sought to develop homegrown champions in an array of sectors. But the new regulations, which allow companies to retain more control, have also been criticized as an encroachment by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s legal system and corporate governance standards.Xiaomi, the gadget maker, announced on Thursday that it would list in Hong Kong, the first company to do so after the rule changes.\u201cThere has been somewhat of a campaign to bring companies home and remove them from foreign jurisdictions,\u201d Mr. Webb said.While Hong Kong is officially a special administrative region within the People\u2019s Republic of China, and has a separate legal and financial system, Beijing sees it as a part of the mainland. Some of China\u2019s biggest and most exciting technology start-ups, like Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing rival to Uber, and Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba, are making plans to go public over the next year.In the past, Chinese entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba chose to list their shares in markets, like New York, where they could operate as if their companies were still private. They were able to offer so-called dual-class shares, which give shareholders little say in the operations of the business.Until last week, Hong Kong, which has stricter rules than New York, had not allowed such listings. In its filing on Thursday with Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, Xiaomi appeared to be taking advantage of the new rules.The company, whose low-cost smartphones have won a loyal following not just in China but in other emerging markets like India as well, said it would raise an unspecified amount from the public in order to fund the development of new smartphones and other devices like household gadgets. The money will also help Xiaomi pursue expansion overseas.It could raise as much as $10 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record. That would make it the second-largest listing by a Chinese technology company since Alibaba in 2014.As part of the listing, which could come as soon as June, Xiaomi will offer dual-class shares, which allow for weighted voting rights. This will mean that Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and chief executive, will have the ultimate say over the company\u2019s operations, rather than investors who buy its shares, even if they end up owning more stock than he decides to hold on to.This share structure will allow the company to benefit from Mr. Lei\u2019s \u201cvision and leadership\u201d while allowing him to maintain its \u201clong-term prospects and strategy,\u201d Xiaomi said in its filing.The decision by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares just one week ago has sparked fierce debate here. For the exchange, not allowing companies to list with such a structure meant it missed out on lucrative listings like Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba opted to list in New York, where several large technology companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, operate with dual-class shares.But some in the city\u2019s investor community had pushed hard to prevent Hong Kong from changing its rules, arguing that it will mean less rigorous corporate governance.\u201cThere should not be unequal voting rights as they could allow management or minority share owners to override the wishes or best interests of majority shareholders for personal benefit and compromise accountability, leading to potential entrenchment issues,\u201d Mary Leung, head of advocacy for Asia at CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals, said in a statement.Some big institutional investors have criticized Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange for throwing out tighter regulations in a bid to compete with rivals.There are also longer-term concerns that companies will not be as closely scrutinized in the future in Hong Kong, which was once a British colony. As part of the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory was promised 50 years of self-administration. But in recent years, the city has experienced encroachment on its independence, and investors have raised concerns that its strong regulatory and legal institutions are slowly being eroded by Beijing.To these critics, Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow dual-class shares is further evidence of that erosion.\u201cBeijing is much happier raising capital in a city that they can partially control rather than handing over all the listings to U.S. markets,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hong Kong stock market is going to be creeping slowly toward Chinese-style regulation.\u201dMr. Li did not respond to a request for comment. But in his blog post he said the exchange was \u201cintroducing additional safeguards to protect investors against the potential misuse of power,\u201d including more corporate governance requirements and certain limits on founding shareholders in these structures.The exchange\u2019s move to loosen its requirements is expected to trigger a spurt of initial public offerings this year and next amid growing appetite across global public markets for new technology companies.Meituan-Dianping, an online delivery service for food and consumer products, is making preparations for an initial public offering in Hong Kong this year, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record.Ant Financial, the electronic financial services firm tied to Alibaba, is going through one final fund-raising round before it also decides whether to list its shares publicly late this year or early next year, according to these people.And the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing is in talks for its own listing, according to one of these people. It is not clear where it would choose to list.Despite the criticism about corporate governance in Hong Kong, its rules remain stricter than New York\u2019s \u2014 for now.Tencent Music, the streaming service owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, is in talks with various banks to help it go public. It is expected to choose New York, where companies can use the dual-class share structure even if the founding shareholder is a company and not an individual. This would allow Tencent, the parent of Tencent Music, to maintain control.In Hong Kong, the dual-class share structure is available only for individuals. But the city\u2019s stock exchange has already begun seeking feedback from the investor community about loosening this rule, too.An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship between Alibaba and Ant Financial. They are both controlled by Jack Ma; Alibaba does not own Ant Financial. The article also misstated the given name of the chief executive of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange. He is Charles Li, not Richard Li.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trying to Put a Value on the Doctor-Patient Relationship", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEBy KIM TINGLEYIn its push for profits, the U.S. health care system has made it difficult for patients to get personal attention from doctors. But what if hands-on medicine actually saves money \u2014 and lives?More than a decade later, my grandfather, who was 78 by then and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, developed pneumonia. When he was admitted to the county hospital, it was the same doctor \u2014 now my doctor, too \u2014 who came to his room to describe his options: go on a ventilator and go home, where he would most likely remain bedridden for the remainder of his life (probably months), or let the illness run its course and die within a few days. My grandfather asked if the latter would hurt much. The doctor said no, he could make him comfortable. All right, then, my grandfather replied.By the time the doctor abruptly tendered his retirement notice, I had long since moved away. I had lived with high-deductible health insurance for years and, after a few surprise bills I could not afford, I avoided medical professionals whenever possible. Often, when I didn\u2019t have a primary-care physician or couldn\u2019t remember his or her name (which changed with my ever-changing insurance policy), I filled out forms with my hometown doctor\u2019s name instead: George P. Fitzgerald III, M.D. But until my father told me about his letter, I had not reflected on his role in my life. I\u2019d rarely seen him more than once a year, and any problems I did have were unremarkable, easily treatable by someone else. And yet his departure felt like a loss.My father, after his final checkup, reported why the doctor was leaving: He objected to the increasing industrialization of medical care, in particular a new Medicare mandate that he update patients\u2019 medical histories electronically \u2014 not because he was old-fashioned or contrary (though he was both), but because the idea of dividing his attention between a computer screen and a patient offended him. This shift to electronic health records, intended to improve communication between a patient\u2019s various physicians as well as \u201cautomate and streamline provider workflow,\u201d was the latest in a series of incentives that the health-insurance market created over the past 20 years to maximize efficiency. In this payment system, the time-consuming process of cultivating a relationship with a patient is essentially worthless, because doing so is not a finite, billable procedure. For the doctor, however, the fourth generation of his family to practice medicine, it was vital to his craft.The question of what the role of a primary-care physician should be, and how it should be valued, has perhaps never been more urgent. That figure, typically a general practitioner, family doctor or internist, is a patient\u2019s first and often most personal connection to the rest of the health care system. But well-known corporations are betting that Americans would prefer to have health care \u201cdelivered\u201d by a trusted brand rather than a trusted physician. At least 10 of the nation\u2019s largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have designed tools and software for medical use and increased their involvement in health care start-up deals in recent years; the size of those deals went to nearly $3 billion in 2017 from under $300 million in 2012. Amazon, in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, has announced its intent to disrupt the industry \u2014 among other ways, by reinventing primary-care delivery. Walmart now offers primary-care services in some of its stores.Surprisingly little is known, though, about what the relationship between a patient and his or her primary-care doctor is actually worth, in terms of that patient\u2019s overall well-being or medical costs, regardless of who bears them. In fact, David Meltzer, an economist and a primary-care physician at the University of Chicago, may be the first and only researcher in the country trying to quantify that relationship\u2019s value in a randomized clinical trial, the most rigorous scientific method.\u201cI\u2019m a complete believer that it\u2019s going to change health care in America,\u201d he told me nearly two years ago. Meltzer continues to believe as much, now that his trial has produced preliminary results, which he plans to present at the end of June at the annual research meeting of AcademyHealth, a health-policy organization. His experiment suggests that strengthening the patient-doctor relationship can significantly reduce patients\u2019 hospitalizations and expenses (to hospitals and Medicare) and improve their mental health; it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to influence the plans that corporations, drawing on their expertise in efficiency and customer service, have to redesign the health care system.In 2016, I spent three weeks over four months at the University of Chicago Medical Center observing Meltzer\u2019s experiment. Its centerpiece was a primary-care practice that consisted of five physicians, a small staff and, at its peak, 1,000 high-risk Medicare patients. I saw more than 90 patient-doctor interactions there; in every instance, the university\u2019s media-relations manager made sure that the patients understood they could quite reasonably refuse me access. Yet almost everyone allowed me to sit in and write about whatever took place. The receptiveness to the presence of a stranger \u2014 potentially representing millions of other strangers \u2014 in these private moments puzzled me but did not seem to surprise Meltzer. Only much later did the question of why they said yes come to seem central to both his project and mine.But not long after physicians coalesced into a professional class, advances in research and technology made it increasingly untenable for any practitioner to master the entire medical canon. At the same time, many experienced physicians argued that medical schools were churning out experts in ever-narrower portions of the body who lacked empathy for the whole person. In 1927, Francis Peabody, a professor at Harvard Medical School, famously defined the trade-off in The Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe treatment of a disease may be entirely impersonal; the care of a patient must be completely personal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe significance of the intimate personal relationship between physician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it.\u201dUltimately, these unique relationships empowered physicians to reject intervention by any regulatory third party, including national government. But doctors\u2019 control over pricing gave rise to inflated costs and gradually sowed anger and mistrust among the public. Demand for reform led to the passage of Medicare in 1965, but the program, eager to avoid angering doctors and hospitals, embraced the same reimbursement practices of most private insurance plans, arbitrarily assigning flat fees to services, like outpatient checkups, regardless of the benefit to patients. For primary-care doctors \u2014 paid the same for a simple exam of a relatively healthy patient as for a more involved consultation with a chronically ill one \u2014 this created a perverse incentive: see as many healthy people and as few sick people as possible.As health-insurance providers prompted physicians to reorganize their patient pools, they simultaneously pushed patients to switch doctors by creating \u201cnetworks\u201d of physicians whose services were covered. (Those physicians, in turn, agreed to care for patients in accordance with the insurance companies\u2019 policies.) Consequently, and as a result of shifting benefits, as more working Americans signed up for employer-sponsored health insurance, many of them \u2014 41 percent, in one survey \u2014 \u201csevered established relationships with their physicians in order to seek new providers,\u201d according to a 1996 study in The American Journal of Public Health. The same study estimated that more than a third of Americans on Medicare who were 65 and older and who had a regular physician had been seeing him or her for a decade or more \u2014 and those with the longest ties had lower medical costs and were less likely to be hospitalized than those with the shortest.Yet concrete proof that the patient-doctor relationship was responsible for these better circumstances remained elusive. \u201cDespite a consensus that longitudinal care is important,\u201d the study\u2019s authors, Linda J. Weiss and Jan Blustein, then of the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, wrote, \u201cremarkably little is known about the actual value \u2014 in terms of health care processes, outcomes or costs \u2014 of long-term provider-patient relationships.\u201d Reliable data on such relationships simply didn\u2019t exist.One afternoon I watched one doctor, Ram Krishnamoorthi, examine L.A. Kizer, who had just turned 70. He was wearing a new-looking ball cap with a trout on it and pulling an oxygen tank. \u201cDid you go fishing?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked. He had been Kizer\u2019s doctor for more than two years, but he could never tell when such an innocuous question might turn out to be significant: If Kizer said yes, Krishnamoorthi could try using the activity to motivate healthful behavior, or he might find out that someone who could be tapped as a source of support had accompanied Kizer on the outing.\u201cUsed to,\u201d Kizer said. He suffered from congestive heart failure and was still breathing heavily from the trip down the hall.\u201cLet me see you walk over,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cThis is a lot worse than before. What happened?\u201d\u201cI saw you two weeks ago,\u201d Kizer said, \u201cand it feels like I woke up and I can\u2019t move.\u201d He added that he had gained four pounds. Krishnamoorthi rolled up his pants legs and probed his ankles. He pressed a stethoscope to his back. A doctor who had not seen Kizer so recently would have no reason to investigate his sudden decline (and Kizer, who said he didn\u2019t like doctors, might not have told an unfamiliar doctor that anything had changed). \u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked.\u201cBus.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fluid,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said, referring to Kizer\u2019s added weight and difficulty walking and breathing. He asked if Kizer wanted to be admitted to the hospital, where he could get additional medications; Kizer declined. Krishnamoorthi eventually agreed to let him go home if he turned off his tank, waited for 10 minutes and had his blood-oxygen level checked. This would take up more of Krishnamoorthi\u2019s time \u2014 without generating additional reimbursement \u2014 but it would mean vast savings for the health care system if it helped him prevent Kizer from having an emergency on the bus later. Heeding Kizer\u2019s preference probably made him more likely to keep future appointments.\u201cWhy am I doing so bad?\u201d Kizer asked as Krishnamoorthi clipped an oxygen meter to his finger. \u201cIs it all the meds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d Krishnamoorthi read the meter display: \u201c98 percent. I think you\u2019re safe. Don\u2019t croak on the bus.\u201d\u201cIf I do, you won\u2019t find out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find out. They call the doctor first. What\u2019d you do for your birthday?\u201d A physician in a hurry might not have noticed the date \u2014 or accepted his first answer.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing now. Nothing.\u201d\u201cDid you have guests over?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cPlayed cards.\u201d\u201cDid you eat chips while you were playing cards?\u201d\u201cA couple. You know I do.\u201d\u201cDo you think that might be part of the reason for the weight?\u201d Extra sodium can cause fluid buildup.What I couldn\u2019t quite believe was that these lengthy conversations were economically sustainable. Nationwide, primary-care physicians often can\u2019t afford to spend more than 15 minutes with each patient, because of the way the health care system values their time. I had seen Krishnamoorthi and colleagues take that long to sort through patients\u2019 medications, often more than a dozen, which they asked patients to gather up and bring to appointments. During one visit, Grace Berry, another doctor, Google-mapped a patient\u2019s new address to locate a nearby pharmacy, transferring her prescriptions there and helping her secure reliable transportation to and from the clinic.Meltzer insists that doctors spending more time with their patients actually saves money. After a year in his clinic, for instance, patients have 20 percent fewer hospitalizations than their control-group counterparts. Because hospitalizations make up the greatest portion of these patients\u2019 annual cost to Medicare, which averages $50,000 to $75,000 each, that reduction is worth several thousand dollars per person in the first year, or a combined several million dollars; by comparison, the doctors\u2019 annual salaries add up to less than $1 million.In a traditional primary-care clinic, patients\u2019 medication \u2014 prescribed to them by multiple specialists who are not in communication with one another \u2014 might not have been systematically sorted by a single person. Or if it had been, it might have been checked by a professional-care coordinator in consultation with doctors. In Meltzer\u2019s view, that increases labor costs, introduces inevitable miscommunications, as in a game of \u201ctelephone,\u201d and runs the risk of not seeming as important to the patient as instructions personally delivered by the physician.By contrast, Meltzer\u2019s doctors run their clinic in partnership with two nurses, a social worker and a project manager; the leanness of the staff means that most of its internal communication can take place during a 30-minute group meeting each morning. That permits more face time between doctors and patients, according to Meltzer. \u201cAnd face time is possible if you decrease back-room time,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople fail to recognize that when you have a $200 person here and a $200 person here and a $100 person communicating between them, the real cost of that is all of their time.\u201d In this setup, which describes a coordinator relaying a message from a doctor in one setting to a doctor in another, the cost is $300 per hour of conversation, or $600 total. What Meltzer has done, in effect, is consolidate the first two physicians into one, simultaneously doubling their time with patients and eliminating the need for a go-between, cutting out that $600 cost altogether. To accomplish this feat, he employs the oldest, slowest, least-innovative health care delivery model imaginable: general practitioners who oversee almost all aspects of their patients\u2019 care and, in doing so, come to know them personally.In the early 1990s, primary-care doctors typically made daily rounds at their hospitals to oversee the treatment of their patients there. But this was about to change. In 1996, an influential article in The New England Journal of Medicine by Robert M. Wachter and Lee Goldman, then physicians at the University of California, San Francisco, predicted that the \u201cexplosive growth of managed care\u201d emphasizing efficiency would lead to \u201cthe rapid growth of a new breed of physicians we call \u2018hospitalists\u2019 \u2014 specialists in inpatient medicine \u2014 who will be responsible for managing the care of hospitalized patients in the same way that primary-care physicians are responsible for managing the care of outpatients.\u201dAs an economist, Meltzer read their forecast with interest. The appearance of hospitalists was, he recognized, a textbook example of specialization or \u201cdivision of labor,\u201d whereby a task is split into simpler ones that workers can perform more quickly, as on an assembly line. In this case, the split eliminated the need for a primary-care doctor to travel to and from the hospital, enabling him to move patients through his clinic faster; meanwhile, the hospitalist, with his experience treating acute illness and getting the most out of his hospital\u2019s unique facilities, would presumably be able to care for patients admitted there more efficiently and effectively. When, soon after the publication of the article, the University of Chicago Medical Center hired its first two hospitalists, Meltzer volunteered to study their impact. His plan was to compare how patients fared when they were cared for by a specialist (a hospitalist) versus a generalist. He began keeping records \u2014 which physicians treated which patients, for example \u2014 and hired two students to interview patients in the hospital and then again over the phone a month after they were discharged to learn about their health.On its face, Meltzer\u2019s research and that of others seemed to show that hospitalists were a great boon. They reduced patients\u2019 medical expenses (by nearly $800, he as well as Wachter, Goldman and their colleagues found), shortened their hospital stays (by about half a day) and modestly decreased mortality rates. But the effects of the nascent hospitalist specialty were only being analyzed rigorously at teaching hospitals like Chicago\u2019s, where the attendings (supervising doctors who spend most of their time caring for ambulatory patients) did not know the patients any better than the hospitalists did. No one was investigating how the hospitalist model performed beyond academic settings, where it was replacing patients\u2019 primary-care doctors. Meltzer noticed, though, that when the Chicago hospitalists got the weekend off and an attending took over their patients for just 48 hours, the handoff completely erased the cost benefits the model otherwise seemed to generate. It stood to reason, then, that separating patients in community hospitals from their longtime doctors might be having a significant negative impact.But running a clinical trial in a community hospital to directly compare the hospitalist model to the primary-care model it was rapidly replacing was widely considered impossible. How many longtime patients of a general practitioner who was still making hospital rounds would agree to swap her for a hospitalist so that researchers could see whether doing so was good for them?By 2010, the hospitalist model had become the norm. That year, Meltzer published a theorem describing why the model had taken hold so quickly; in the past 15 years, the number of practicing hospitalists had jumped from several hundred to 30,000. (Meltzer practices as a hospitalist himself.) The math itself was basic. But, staring at his final equation, Meltzer had a revelation: increasing one variable \u2014 the likelihood that a primary-care physician\u2019s patients would be hospitalized \u2014 would decrease the odds that the physician would cede his hospital duties to a hospitalist out of financial necessity, halting, at least mathematically, the specialty\u2019s rapid spread.This gave Meltzer an idea. In 2012 he won a grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an organization created by the Affordable Care Act to test novel \u201cpayment and service-delivery models,\u201d to set up an experimental outpatient clinic at the university medical center. For patients, he recruited Medicare recipients who had been hospitalized in the past year and were therefore statistically likely to require future hospitalization. In practice this meant that most of them, like half of Americans, were managing at least one chronic illness; most were also from the impoverished and violent neighborhoods of Chicago\u2019s South Side. Their average annual income at the time of enrollment was $10,000 to $15,000.If they volunteered, they were told, they would be randomly assigned to either a primary-care doctor for outpatient needs and a hospitalist in the hospital, or they would join Meltzer\u2019s new clinic, which he called the Comprehensive Care Program, and receive inpatient and outpatient care from the same doctor. Meltzer\u2019s team would directly compare the two groups using a medley of metrics: how often patients were hospitalized and for how long; whether they did not refill their prescription medications because of expense; and their total costs to Medicare. A standard survey would assess their overall health. Finally, to try to understand how patients\u2019 relationships with their doctors might differ between the two groups and affect the outcomes, the team devised a survey in which patients rated their doctors in categories like trust and interpersonal relationships. Did he or she know their values and responsibilities? Give clear instructions? Seem caring and kind?Meltzer\u2019s biggest fear, at first, was that the patients\u2019 existing primary-care physicians would accuse him of stealing them. It turned out that many hospital patients his team approached did not have one. Within four years, the researchers had signed up 2,000 subjects. \u201cIn a funny way, the study that we\u2019re doing now was the same study that should have been done in 1999,\u201d Meltzer told me. \u201cThe difference is that we could never have gotten people out of having their own doctor until now, when they don\u2019t have it, and we offer it back.\u201dThat Monday morning, his first patient had head and neck cancer and needed an M.R.I. Krishnamoorthi had him practice lying flat and slid pillows under his head and adjusted the bed angle until they found a position the man could tolerate in the scanner that afternoon. (If the patient balked, he would have to be hospitalized longer, increasing his risk of developing an infection and reducing the potential profit for the hospital, which earns money when it admits a patient and loses it for every additional day that patient stays.)Then, Krishnamoorthi jogged upstairs to check on Jamal Johnson, a 34-year-old with cystic fibrosis. Johnson was sitting on the edge of his bed, hunched over his lunch tray. Krishnamoorthi dragged a footstool over and plopped down on it, stretching out his legs. \u201cWhen I woke up, I felt kind of draggy,\u201d Johnson said. But physical therapy, which consisted of wearing a vest that vibrated his chest to break up sputum, had helped. \u201cSee?\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cIt always works.\u201d\u201cIt hurts like hell, though. That\u2019s something I can say.\u201d Five years earlier, Johnson broke a rib playing basketball, making therapy treatments for his cystic fibrosis excruciating and initiating a cascade of hospitalizations. When he met Krishnamoorthi a year ago, he hated him instantly. Krishnamoorthi wanted him to consider a lung transplant; Johnson refused. He didn\u2019t want to hear about further treatment options. When Krishnamoorthi broached the subject of staying in a nursing facility, Johnson told him that the doctors and nurses there were \u201cjust paid to like you.\u201d The remark stuck. Krishnamoorthi asked around until he found a nurse he thought Johnson might connect with; eventually, Johnson agreed to enter her facility and came less frequently to the hospital. On occasions when he was admitted, Krishnamoorthi would, with his permission, call his mother with updates \u2014 an overture, she later told me, that none of the countless doctors who had treated her son over the years had ever made and for which she was especially grateful. Johnson never wanted to worry her.The new arrangement was more beneficial for Johnson, less stressful for his mother, less expensive for Medicare and less expensive for the hospital, but it had taken Krishnamoorthi weeks to orchestrate. It was increasingly clear to him how rewarding \u2014 but equally taxing \u2014 it was to try to do more for his patients than what was absolutely required. \u201cLast year, I would go home worried whether he liked me or not, if he would \u2018fire\u2019 me,\u201d he told me after we left Johnson\u2019s room. \u201cIt would have affected me a lot.\u201dThe next major test of the model will be whether it can be implemented in different sets of financial, geographic and demographic circumstances. Already, more than half a dozen organizations, from a senior-living community in Florida to the National University Health System of Singapore, have consulted Meltzer about creating versions of his program. One of them is the health-insurance company Kaiser Permanente. The Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, an organization of more than 1,400 primary-care physicians who serve members of Kaiser\u2019s health plan, ran a pilot of the program in 2015. Two physicians were assigned to its 400 sickest patients. Unlike Meltzer\u2019s team, which relies on hospitalists for after-hours care, Kaiser made the doctors available 24/7 and were surprised to find that patients very rarely called late or on holidays and weekends. Still, the number of times they were admitted to the hospital or E.R. fell drastically, by 80 percent, prompting Kaiser to expand the program to seven doctors and 800 patients. In the summer of 2016, Vanderbilt University Hospital started a similar pilot and observed a 20 percent decrease in hospital admissions. The school is also expanding its program.\u201cAll of us, I think, are struggling with how we can provide care to an aging population with resources drying up left and right,\u201d Bernadette Loftus, a clinician and the executive medical director of the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, told me. \u201cDavid and I both came of age at the birth of the hospitalist movement. It\u2019s a great efficiency movement, but it takes about two decades of living in that environment to see the flaws in it.\u201dMeltzer has broadened his experiment, with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to offer additional resources with the hopes of reaching his clinic\u2019s patients who rarely engage with its services; the clinic can now refer them to an additional community-health worker and a neighborhood arts-and-culture program designed with Urban Labs, a center at the university that studies approaches to combating health problems and other social challenges. But he believes versions of the model could also apply to primary-care practices with patients who have a more traditional range of incomes and health issues. For instance, to increase patient-doctor familiarity and streamline communication, a practice might partner with a single hospitalist who takes care of all of its hospitalized patients. In Meltzer\u2019s view, his model\u2019s key mechanism, the prioritizing of the patient-doctor relationship, makes it flexible enough to export anywhere. \u201cTo have a relationship,\u201d Meltzer says, \u201cis to mean that the big incentive is to want them to do well because you care about them and to have the time to really understand what that means and deal with it, because sometimes figuring that out just takes time. When price is the only lever you have, you\u2019re either paying people to do something or paying them not to do something. And it goes only one way or the other, more or less. Whereas when you have a relationship, there\u2019s just so many more nuances.\u201dCurrent metrics are still too crude to capture the intricate effects of these relationships, however, even as they point to their collective impact being quite large. By contrast, day-to-day, patient-to-patient progress has often seemed glacial at best and demanded considerable energy from the clinic doctors and staff. As I observed Meltzer\u2019s team at work, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how long its young, idealistic caregivers would last. Unknown to Meltzer, several of them had lent patients cash for bus money or delivered medications on their way home \u2014 gestures they hadn\u2019t felt inspired (or pressured) to make in previous jobs. When, that October, Jamal Johnson passed away, Krishnamoorthi, upon visiting his bedside to say goodbye, was surprised to find he couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t feel finished,\u201d Lauren Wiklund, the project manager, told me one particularly hectic morning. \u201cI just feel like I have to carry on with the rest of my life or I will die.\u201dWhy, then, did they do it? \u201cI became disenchanted with primary care because I was constantly having to cut people short,\u201d Joyce Tang, who spent seven years at her previous practice, told me. \u201cI was always an hour late. Always. My patients just knew to expect that.\u201d One morning, I watched her examine a man who seemed to prefer the accommodations of the hospital to those of his assisted-living facility and habitually took a cab to the emergency room. Tang had brainstormed with him, his sister, his insurance company and a nurse at the facility, about possible solutions. She was carrying a housing application for a faith-based facility she thought he might like better, but so far, nothing had worked to change his patterns. In cases like his, how did she measure success?\u201cThere are traditional metrics: fewer hospitalizations, better compliance with medicines,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then for patients there are more specific goals \u2014 so understanding those.\u201d She gave the example of a patient who was immobilized by her weight. \u201cFor her, the big intervention was I got her a motorized wheelchair, and the next time I saw her she was just smiling. She said it totally transformed her outlook just to be able to get outside and get some fresh air.\u201d Another woman had been on large doses of opioids. For a year she and Tang saw each other every two weeks and gradually reduced her dose until, recently, she flushed the rest of her pills down the toilet. \u201cNow when she comes to the hospital, she doesn\u2019t want IV pain meds,\u201d Tang said. \u201cShe\u2019s so happy. She\u2019s really proud of herself. That\u2019s a big success story. A lot of people don\u2019t come back when we say \u2018taper.\u2019 I asked her, \u2018What made you come back?\u2019 She hated me when I said that. But she said: \u2018I trusted you. I knew you wanted what\u2019s best for me.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe morning after Winslow\u2019s death, Meltzer hosted a weekly meeting with the clinic and research teams. Once everyone had settled in with a paper-wrapped sandwich, he said, \u201cCase of the week?\u201d and the conversation turned to Winslow. She had been hospitalized with minor injuries after a fall and developed an infection; together, her son and Verma had wrestled with when to stop treating it. \u201cHer son last night asked: \u2018Do you think I\u2019m doing the right thing? What do you think I should do?\u2019 He said, \u2018I know you care about her, so I trust you.\u2019 Not, \u2018I trust you because I know you\u2019re a doctor, or I know you\u2019re a professional\u2019 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t happen with a hospitalist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing that the struggle was more with your own feelings,\u201d Meltzer said, and Verma agreed.By then, I had watched her and her colleagues confront a breathtaking variety of indignities that age and sickness force upon human beings: impotence, incontinence, immobility, dementia, death. It occurred to me that perhaps the explanation for patients\u2019 allowing me to witness these conversations was as simple as wanting, even at their most vulnerable \u2014 perhaps especially then \u2014 to be seen and heard, and that this was also precisely what they prized in Meltzer\u2019s doctors. What both doctors and patients were after, it seemed, was not just an assignation of \u201cvalue\u201d but of meaning. The better they knew one another, the harder their relationship was to define wholly in medical terms. \u201cEverything\u2019s just too late sometimes, and then what do you do?\u201d a farmer who had recently learned he had metastatic cancer told Tang one morning. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of sad to me and the wife, too. It\u2019s just like a death sentence.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Tang said softly, \u201cI know.\u201d There was little else she could do medically. And yet, it was difficult to imagine the farmer saying the same to a friend or a relative or a social worker or a priest and receiving the same affirmation.Meltzer characterized this singular connection for me one afternoon. \u201cBeing able to even just touch in for a little bit, have the conversation and talk about it, there\u2019s an intimacy to it,\u201d he said, shortly after telling one of his own primary-care patients in the hospital that she had cancer. The subconscious swap of \u201ctouch in\u201d for \u201ccheck in\u201d evoked the laying on of hands \u2014 an antiquated, unbillable and, in the face of cancer, useless gesture, but quite possibly not a worthless one.Source photographs from ClassicStock/Alamy.By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland\u2019s Abortion Referendum Becomes a Test for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "Major tech companies took steps to prevent foreign meddling online before voters in Ireland cast ballots on Friday. Here\u2019s how those efforts are working out.Supported byMr. Dwyer, who co-founded an election transparency group, pulled up one anti-abortion YouTube video that had only a few views when it was posted last year. After the video was republished as a referendum campaign ad on Facebook by a group from an unknown location, it attracted more than 1.2 million views, he said. He also showed an anti-abortion ad on Facebook that purported to be from an unbiased organization, but was also purchased by a buyer who couldn\u2019t be traced.\u201cWith social media in this campaign, our democracy is up for sale to the highest bidder and we\u2019re blindfolded at the auction,\u201d said Mr. Dwyer, 28, who runs the Transparent Referendum Initiative, which is pushing for new campaign disclosure laws for digital advertising.Critics warn that if Facebook and Google cannot minimize their negative influence in a country the size of Ireland, which has a population of 4.8 million, far bigger challenges will loom with the midterm elections in the United States this November.Even so, the effectiveness of the companies\u2019 actions in Ireland has not been clear cut \u2014 and it may take months, if not years, to know whether any disinformation campaigns broke through their efforts. That\u2019s especially so since ads are only one part of a larger misinformation problem that also includes organic posts.Mr. Dwyer said Facebook\u2019s ban of abortion ads financed by foreign groups had reduced such ads on the social network. Yet abortion ads from international groups continued to make their way online through other digital platforms, and campaign materials were still being posted and shared on Facebook by users, he said.\u201cThe broader question is what information is flowing through the system and how much of that information is pollution and what is not,\u201d said Gavin Sheridan, a co-founder of the online news outlet Storyful, who tracked foreign ad spending for the Irish vote. \u201cWe can\u2019t really know.\u201dNiamh Sweeney, Facebook\u2019s head of public policy for Ireland, said the company blocked foreign political ads on May 8 after finding some worrisome activity. In one instance, she said, the company found a foreign group paying to increase the visibility of Facebook posts created by Irish campaigners. That violated the spirit of Irish law that bans international campaign contributions. Facebook declined to identify the groups involved.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a small thing to do, but we felt it was the right move to make,\u201d Ms. Sweeney said, adding that Facebook\u2019s team in Ireland recommended the action to the company\u2019s Silicon Valley leadership.Google, which banned all referendum-related ads in Ireland on May 9, declined to comment. The company said in a statement this month that it had stopped running the ads to protect the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the vote.The Irish government committed in January to holding a referendum on whether to repeal a 35-year-old constitutional ban \u2014 known as the Eighth Amendment \u2014 on abortion. If a majority of voters approve the repeal, the amendment would be replaced with a new clause stating the Irish Parliament has the power to make laws regulating abortion.Since then, the issue has been hotly debated, with campaign placards taking over downtown Dublin and the referendum dominating conversation. The vote\u2019s outcome appears too close to call.Mr. Dwyer said he began noticing the flood of online abortion ads almost immediately after starting the Transparent Referendum Initiative in February. The ads came from groups with names like Women Betrayed by Abortion, Chicago for Repeal and Eighth Debate.In one ad that Mr. Dwyer traced as coming from a British religious organization, the message read: \u201cDon\u2019t allow more children to be lost to legalized abortion.\u201d Another Facebook ad, posted by a group from an untraceable location, showed the image of a fetus in a toilet.The pileup of such ads helped lead to Facebook\u2019s blockage of political advertising from groups based outside Ireland. In addition, the company introduced a transparency tool so people can see all the ads an organization is airing across the site.Facebook also deployed an artificial intelligence system developed after the 2016 United States presidential campaign to spot foreign ads. The system flags ads that are suspected of coming from outside Ireland by analyzing billing information, where a website originated, what kind of ad-targeting specifications are used, and if the ad host is using a virtual private network to hide where it is based.The system will play a critical role in the company\u2019s future election efforts. Ms. Sweeney said it was still improving and occasionally produced false positives and other inaccuracies.While many Irish are split on the abortion vote, they have been united in their criticism of Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s roles in the referendum.\u201cFacebook and Google are deciding what to do with our referendum,\u201d said Mr. Sheridan, the chief executive of Vizlegal, a maker of legal software, who supports lifting the abortion ban.Mr. Sheridan is part of a volunteer army that uncovered suspicious ads coming from groups outside Ireland. \u201cWe didn\u2019t elect Mark Zuckerberg to make decisions about how our referendum should be run,\u201d he said, referring to Facebook\u2019s chief executive.Others involved in the campaign said they were upset at the internet companies\u2019 ban of political ads because it deprived them of an avenue of influence.

{"Headline": "Why \u2018Fahrenheit 451\u2019 Is the Book for Our Social Media Age", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayBut now I was making a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury\u2019s seminal novel, \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d which presents a future America where books are outlawed and firemen burn them. The protagonist, a fireman named Guy Montag, begins to doubt his actions and turns against his mentor, Captain Beatty. When I set out to adapt the novel early in 2016, I was faced with a big question: Do people still care about physical books?I asked an 82-year-old friend for advice. \u201cGo ahead and burn books,\u201d he said. \u201cThey mean nothing to me. I can read anything on my tablet, from the \u2018Epic of Gilgamesh\u2019 to Jo Nesbo, and I can read them in bed, on a plane or next to the ocean, because it\u2019s all in the cloud, safe from your firemen\u2019s torches.\u201dIf he felt this way, what would teenagers think? Bradbury\u2019s novel is a classic taught in high schools across America. But the more I thought about it, the more relevant the novel seemed. For Bradbury, books were repositories of knowledge and ideas. He feared a future in which those things would be endangered, and now that future was here: The internet and new social-media platforms \u2014 and their potential threat to serious thought \u2014 would be at the heart of my adaptation.I had never adapted a book, let alone one so important. Altering a work so brilliant and beloved always upsets some fans. I knew Bradbury had supported Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s 1966 film adaptation. More important, Bradbury himself had reimagined \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d first as a stage play and then as a musical, changing many elements, including letting Montag\u2019s neighbor Clarisse McClellan live. (In the novel, she dies early on.) With Bradbury as my guide, and a vow to stay true to his ideas, I began working on the script.\u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d was written in the early 1950s, not long after Nazis burned books and, eventually, human beings. America was living under a cloud of fear created by the House Un-American Activities Committee and McCarthyism, which brought political repression, blacklists and censorship of literature and art. These anxieties permeate the novel.But Bradbury\u2019s key inspiration was the invasion of seven-inch black-and-white televisions into people\u2019s homes. Bradbury was no Luddite. He wrote screenplays, including one for an adaptation of \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d He also wrote 65 episodes of a television series, \u201cThe Ray Bradbury Theater.\u201d But in \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d Bradbury was warning us about the threat of mass media to reading, about the bombardment of digital sensations that could substitute for critical thinking.In the novel, he imagined a world where people are entertained day and night by staring at giant wall screens in their homes. They interact with their \u201cfriends\u201d through these screens, listening to them via \u201cSeashells\u201d \u2014 Bradbury\u2019s version of Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods \u2014 inserted in their ears. In this world, people would be crammed \u201cfull of noncombustible data\u201d \u2014 words to popular songs, the names of state capitals, the amount of \u201ccorn Iowa grew last year.\u201d They will \u201cfeel they\u2019re thinking,\u201d Bradbury wrote, \u201cand they\u2019ll be happy, because facts of that sort don\u2019t change.\u201dBradbury was worried about the advent of Reader\u2019s Digest. Today we have Wikipedia and tweets. He worried that people would read only headlines. Today it seems that half the words online have been replaced with emojis. The more we erode language, the more we erode complex thought and the easier we are to control.Bradbury feared memory loss. Today we have designated Google and our social-media accounts as the guardians of our memories, emotions, dreams and facts. As tech companies consolidate power, imagine how easy it could be to rewrite Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Wiki entry to match what the firemen in Bradbury\u2019s novel learn about the history of the fire department: \u201cEstablished, 1790, to burn English-influenced books in the Colonies. First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin.\u201d In his way, Bradbury predicted the rise of \u201calternative facts\u201d and an era of \u201cpost-truth.\u201dAs the virtual world becomes more dominant, owning books becomes an act of rebellion. When a printed book is in your possession, no one can track, alter or hack it. The characters in my film have never seen a book. When they first encounter a library, the books are like water in a vast digital desert. Seeing, touching and smelling a book is as alien to the firemen as milking a cow by hand would be for most of us. The firemen are transfixed by the books \u2014 but they still have to burn them.Burning books in the film posed a legal challenge. The cover art of most books is protected by copyright, and in most cases we were unable to obtain permission to display it \u2014 let alone burn it on camera. So the art directors for my film designed countless original book covers that we could burn.The question was: Which books? There were always more I wanted to burn than we had time to film. I knew I wanted to include some of my favorites, like \u201cCrime and Punishment,\u201d \u201cSong of Solomon\u201d and the works of Franz Kafka. But we had to burn more than just fiction. Herodotus\u2019 \u201cHistories\u201d \u2014 history itself \u2014 was incinerated. Pages of Emily Dickinson, Tagore and Ferdowsi\u2019s poetry crumbled into black ash. Hegel, Plato and Grace Lee Boggs\u2019s philosophy were set on fire. The firemen discriminate against no one: Texts in Chinese, Hindi, Persian and Spanish all burned. A Mozart score, an Edvard Munch painting, magazines, newspapers, photographs of Sitting Bull, Frederick Douglass and the 1969 moon landing went up in smoke.Watching the books burn was an otherworldly experience. The hiss of incinerating pages sounded like the final gasps of hundreds of dying souls. The more we burned, the more hypnotic it became \u2014 a mesmerizing spectacle of pages curling and embers dancing into the void.Bradbury believed that we wanted the world to become this way. That we asked for the firemen to burn books. That we wanted entertainment to replace reading and thinking. That we voted for political and economic systems to keep us happy rather than thoughtfully informed. He would say that we chose to give up our privacy and freedom to tech companies. That we decided to entrust our cultural heritage and knowledge to digital archives. The greatest army of firemen will be irrelevant in the digital world. They will be as powerless as spitting babies next to whoever controls a consolidated internet. How could they stop one person, hiding in his parents\u2019 basement with a laptop, from hacking into thousands of years of humanity\u2019s collective history, literature and culture, and then rewriting all of it \u2026 or just hitting delete?And who would notice?Ramin Bahrani is a writer, director and Guggenheim fellowship recipient whose films include \u201cChop Shop\u201d and \u201c99 Homes.\u201d His adaptation of \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d will air on HBO on May 19.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Royal Rumble: 7 Meghan and Harry Specials Face Off, and We All Lose", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookKensington Palace actually tweeted this detail in March \u2014 it escaped my notice until I saw it in \u201cInside the Royal Wedding: Harry and Meghan,\u201d debuting Wednesday on NBC. It is probably the classiest and most informative of the specials, but not all that classy or informative, strictly speaking. In a scene meant to convey insider bona fides, one of Ms. Markle\u2019s friends, the actress Janina Gavankar, holds up her phone to show off a selfie of the two of them. Except the Google URL is plainly visible; Ms. Gavankar has image-searched the photo that would ostensibly be on her own phone. This is the inside scoop? I have Google, too.But still, it was more enlightening than \u201cWhen Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Engagement\u201d (TLC); \u201cMeghan Markle: American Princess\u201d (CBS); \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s Story: Four Royal Weddings\u201d (NatGeo); \u201cMeghan Markle: An American Princess\u201d (Fox); \u201cHarry and Meghan: A Very Modern Romance\u201d (BBC America); and Lifetime\u2019s fictionalized film version, \u201cHarry & Meghan: A Royal Romance.\u201d (These shows already debuted on television but are available to stream on network sites and elsewhere.)What time is the royal wedding? Can you attend? How much will it cost? What name will be on Meghan Markle's driver's license? And dozens of your other really important royal wedding questions answered.The convergence of history, celebrity and glamour should be a fertile area for one-off TV specials, and there\u2019s plenty of genuine information \u2014 about rituals, about rites, about politics, about tiaras, about dads \u2014 worth acknowledging or exploring. Also, come on: Weddings are fun! At times, these shows are giddy and fizzy and dorky, and I learned a few historical tidbits along the way. But the claims to personal intimacy ranged from visibly untrue to quietly sad, and the shows all used many of the same talking heads, the same clips and the same dumb, dubious claims (no, \u201cSuits\u201d is not a celebrity-making show).A boring tabloid is a sin. Worse, the contrived narrative that the shows collectively push \u2014 the idea that Harry and Meghan\u2019s romance is \u201ca fairy tale\u201d \u2014 is jarringly backward.Instead, it\u2019s actually Harry whose life bears the trappings of a fairy tale: His mother dies when he\u2019s a child, and he\u2019s thrust into the cold and dangerous media woods, where vile forces seduce him into, say, smoking weed and, uh, once dressing up in a Nazi uniform. (This is mentioned, but not dwelled on, in most of the specials.) His return to righteousness, first through military service then through high-profile philanthropic endeavors, is rewarded with a loving romantic relationship. Unlike in a fairy tale, though, all that conflict has already occurred once Ms. Markle appears \u2014 her mere presence is the happily ever after.Which is how a story as unusual as royalty marrying a biracial foreign commoner winds up feeling awfully dull. In an effort to juice things up a bit, Lifetime found its Prince Harry angrily defending his girlfriend\u2019s now-shuttered blog. \u201cIt\u2019s a community of inspiration!\u201d he shouts.This lack of self-awareness would be less galling if anything meaningful was being communicated, which it is not. \u201cIf the people do not feel that the monarchy is relevant, we will no longer have a monarchy,\u201d according to \u201cA Very Modern Romance.\u201d (If only we\u2019d known; colonialism could have been so different.) Princess Diana\u2019s death was, maybe, especially hard on Harry because he was going through \u201call kinds of hormonal changes,\u201d according to \u201cFour Royal Weddings.\u201d A viscountess on \u201cAn American Princess\u201d informs us that Ms. Markle may be unfamiliar with the ultra-fancy place settings at her wedding because \u201cin America, we use one fork, and occasionally we use a knife, you know, when we gotta cut through a piece of meat.\u201d This is true. Here in America we put butter on bread one stick at a time, and we cut our cakes with guns.These interviews are rather staid, but that\u2019s the point: All of this is rather staid, and the attempts to make it somehow livelier by having Gayle King sagely mention (in \u201cMeghan Markle: American Princess\u201d) that Shakespeare\u2019s plays were performed a mere 22 miles from where Harry and Meghan will exchange their vows feel hopelessly irrelevant.Royalty is built on the ability to perpetuate one\u2019s own ongoing story. In matters like this, of so little consequence, let them have it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Drove a Man to Set Himself on Fire in Brooklyn?", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySometime before dawn on April 14, David Buckel left his small brick house on the edge of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, pulling a shopping cart. He passed the magnolia tree in the garden, the stone sculptures he had made. Then instead of walking to work, as he usually did on Saturdays, he went into the park.He turned onto the road that loops around the meadows and ball fields, and after less than a quarter of a mile, he veered onto the grass. The place he chose would surprise people later, when they came with flowers: It wasn\u2019t a plaza or a spot where crowds gathered \u2014 just a stretch of patchy lawn on the shoulder of the road.It\u2019s not clear how long Mr. Buckel stood there, or when he doused himself with gas, but at 5:55 a.m., as the light began to gather before sunrise, he sent an email to the news media explaining what he was about to do. The first 911 call came at 6:08 a.m.: man on fire.When responders arrived, the flames were going out. Mr. Buckel, a prominent civil rights lawyer turned environmental advocate, was dead. He was 60.It is impossible to know all the reasons a person commits suicide. Mr. Buckel suggested one: He was trying to call attention to pollution and global warming. \u201cMy early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves,\u201d he wrote in his email.His suicide is one of the few known cases of political self-immolation in the United States since the 1960s \u2014 when demonstrators set themselves on fire to protest the war in Vietnam \u2014 and perhaps the first one anywhere in the name of climate change.But his political message still left Mr. Buckel\u2019s friends and family at a loss: Why would someone in his position resort to such a drastic measure to make his message heard? Why would someone who was committed to the quiet, daily work of making change \u2014 and who was notoriously private \u2014 stage a dramatic public suicide? He told no one of his plan, not his husband and partner of 34 years, Terry Kaelber, nor the lesbian couple with whom they raised their college-age daughter. He did not say goodbye to them.News reports of his death featured photos of Mr. Buckel in his prime \u2014 a serious-looking lawyer who not long ago was at the forefront of the fight for marriage equality. A teacher who came across his body early that April morning described it as \u201cmummified\u201d by the fire.\u201cHow do you get from that, to this?\u201d said Adam Aronson, a lawyer and former colleague.In the days after he died, Mr. Buckel was remembered for his work at Lambda Legal, a national organization that defends the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. From about 1995 to 2008 he argued cases for L.G.B.T. youth and was a director of the marriage project, strategizing cases in Iowa and New Jersey.He brought an intense commitment to all that he did that could border on obsession. \u201cDavid\u2019s personality was such that anything he wanted to do, he would work really hard to understand it, more so than the average person,\u201d said his husband, Mr. Kaelber.Evan Wolfson worked with Mr. Buckel at Lambda Legal. \u201cHe was very passionate, very idealistic,\u201d he said. Then he paused, searching for the right word. \u201cBut he could be absolute. He could be absolutist. He might sometimes take a position that I would challenge as not being realistic or strategic.\u201dWhen Mr. Buckel went to court, \u201che was impeccably color-coordinated and there was never a wrinkle or a crease in the wrong place,\u201d Mr. Aronson said. His office was tidy to the point of seeming sterile. Before snapping a binder clip on a document, he folded a piece of paper over the pages, so it wouldn\u2019t leave a mark, a former legal assistant remembered.For the last decade, Mr. Buckel applied that intensity to running a compost site in Red Hook, on the Brooklyn waterfront.He had grown up around soil and flowers in Batavia, N.Y. His mother worked in her family\u2019s flower shop, Stroh\u2019s Flowers; his father helped local farmers improve their operations. As a child, Mr. Buckel \u2014 the second-youngest of five boys \u2014 played in the family\u2019s greenhouses and worked on an aunt\u2019s chicken farm.After Mr. Buckel left Lambda in late 2008, he was inspired by President Barack Obama\u2019s call to volunteerism and took a composting class at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. He was captivated by the idea of community composting, which involves locals in the process of turning orange rinds and coffee grounds and flower stems into enriched soil, while reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gases.In just a few years, Mr. Buckel created one of the largest compost sites in the country operated without heavy machinery \u2014 using only solar power, wind power and the labor of volunteers.Brenda Platt, co-director of the Institute for Local Reliance, in Washington, D.C., visited Mr. Buckel\u2019s site at Red Hook Community Farm in 2014 after meeting him at a composting convention. \u201cIt was meticulously organized,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boots were lined up, hanging upside down \u2014 you know, like wine glasses? The tools were lined up.\u201d The buckets were divided by color and stacked into pyramids.At night, Mr. Buckel would lie in bed staring at the ceiling, he later told his assistant, picturing the compost piles in their various states of decomposition, planning which ones had to go where.\u201cHis skill was instructing volunteers like a symphony conductor,\u201d said Alexander Jagiello, who works for the NYC Compost Project hosted by the Queens Botanical Garden. \u201cYou had people showing up to turn a windrow \u2014 which is a compost pile \u2014 week after week.\u201dIt\u2019s about efficiency, he said, but also about the humans involved.Mr. Buckel had been helping people from early on. After he graduated from the University of Rochester in 1980, he started working with hospice patients as a home health attendant \u2014 a job that seemed connected to events in his own life.Two of his brothers had gone to Vietnam when he was a child and were injured. Around the time he was finishing college, his mother learned she had lung cancer, and after a torturous but swift decline, she died. She was some months shy of 60.\u201cIt just devastated the family,\u201d said a cousin, John Marr. \u201cThe father just kind of drifted away after that. He got in his car and drove and drove.\u201dAs their father spent ever longer periods in Florida, Mr. Buckel and his brothers \u2014 once known as the Buckel brothers, as close as could be \u2014 went their separate ways. When Mr. Buckel\u2019s father died in his 80s, the family found their old photographs ruined in the trunk of his car.Mr. Buckel changed his middle name after his mother died to Stroh, her maiden name. \u201cHe was always a more sensitive and gentle soul,\u201d said a niece, Kristi Buckel H\u00e9bert.He met his husband in Rochester in the mid-1980s, and after he earned his law degree from Cornell University in 1987, the two moved to New York. Eventually, they found the house off Prospect Park, in Windsor Terrace, where they moved with the two women with whom they raised their daughter, and Mr. Buckel grew his garden.\u201cWe were an odd couple working for marriage equality, the talkative Jew and the buttoned-up WASP,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.Mr. Buckel resigned from Lambda Legal a few years later, just as the movement for marriage equality was gaining momentum nationwide. Former colleagues remembered there being disagreements over direction and strategy at the time, and some said he may have left sooner than he would have wished.In Mr. Buckel\u2019s new role as compost guru, people sought him out. They came after growing disillusioned with corporate jobs, they came to him with ideas: What about carting compost on bikes? Compostable silverware? Mr. Jagiello, the Queens composter, came looking for guidance after working as a paralegal for the police department. \u201cHe was very willing to teach,\u201d he said \u2014 with one condition, you had to shovel.On a recent morning, Mr. Morales stood on the compost site as a cold wind blew in off the water. \u201cThis is David\u2019s baby,\u201d said Mr. Morales, with an open, gaptoothed smile. He wore tall rubber boots, soil-flecked gloves and a wool cap. Mr. Buckel\u2019s hat was still hanging from a nail on the compost shed.\u201cHe was my mentor, my father figure,\u201d Mr. Morales said.In these years, Mr. Buckel pursued another longstanding interest \u2014 Buddhism. \u201cHe believed in things like being mindful, right action, thought and speech,\u201d said his husband, Mr. Kaelber, noting they traveled to the Himalayas and Bhutan.In his suicide letter, Mr. Buckel alluded to recent cases of self-immolation in Tibet. The letter was also laced through with phrases used by Buddhist monks to explain the spiritual roots of the protest tactic.Mr. Buckel used to end every day with a routine: thanking volunteers for doing something good for the earth. But around February, that ritual changed. When volunteers circled, he shared grim news. \u201cMore than 90 percent of the world\u2019s population breathes polluted air,\u201d Mr. Morales recalled him saying. \u201cThe Arctic Circle is experiencing record-breaking temperatures.\u201dLater, as they left, Mr. Buckel said about climate change, \u201cNobody cares, why does nobody believe it?\u201dTwo weeks before he died, Mr. Buckel seemed particularly agitated when he came to work one day. \u201cI asked if he was stressed,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cHe dismissed it.\u201d Then Mr. Buckel started sending him emails \u2014 lists of contacts, instructions for how to complete annual reports, forms to be turned over to officials. He began labeling everything on the site, every switch and key, and showed him how to work the solar panels, the lights.\u201cWhat, you going to retire on me?\u201d Mr. Morales remembered saying. \u201cNaw, you\u2019re stuck with me forever.\u201dIf the agency rolled back the rules on emissions, it would wipe out all the efforts made by people like Mr. Buckel \u2014 walking to work, processing hundreds of tons of food waste without a drop of gas.Mr. Buckel\u2019s husband and the women with whom they lived said he had been increasingly distressed over the environment and the state of the national debate, but had not been ill or shown signs of depression. To honor his wishes, they said in brief telephone interviews that they wanted to focus on the message he left behind.Mr. Buckel\u2019s suicide letter was a few pages long and touched on many subjects, revealing a man who had grown deeply despondent. But it made his cause clear: \u201cPollution ravages our planet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMost humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result.\u201dHe concluded: \u201cHere is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the need for expanded action.\u201dThe last time that Mr. Morales saw him, Mr. Buckel looked exhausted. The next morning he said nothing to his family before leaving home.Later, when Mr. Kaelber was asked what had precipitated his husband\u2019s suicide, he said, \u201cI think a lot of it, unfortunately, was all that\u2019s going on with the Trump administration and the rollback by Pruitt.\u201dThe day Mr. Buckel died, Mr. Morales received a text from him at 5:25 a.m. saying he wouldn\u2019t be at work. At 5:55 a.m., he got the letter Mr. Buckel emailed to several news organizations. He was arriving at the Red Hook site and dismissed it at first, taking it for one of the news stories they\u2019d exchange.\u201cI sent him a text at 6:40 saying, \u2018Please tell me that email is just a joke.\u2019\u201dAbove Mr. Buckel\u2019s letter, there was a note. \u201cI apologize for leaving this world early and leaving you with some big challenges to tackle,\u201d it said. \u201cYou are ready. I am so proud of you and what you have accomplished, both in your professional and your personal life. It was an honor and a pleasure to serve the Earth with you.\u201dMr. Morales, not wanting to believe what he had read, showed it to a few other workers later that morning. He did a Google search for \u201cself-immolation.\u201d\u201cIt popped up \u2014 Prospect Park,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just dropped to the ground.\u201dMr. Buckel chose to die not before thousands, but alone. He chose to do it at an early hour, perhaps so the sight of a burning man would be less likely to traumatize children, or be caught on video.Even the location, that forgettable strip of grass just off the road, seemed intended to disrupt life as little as possible. \u201cI apologize to you for the mess,\u201d he wrote in a note to the police, which was found with his letter in the shopping cart. He had stapled his business card to the letter, and left his identification on a lanyard nearby, to remove any doubt.He kept his cellphone with him, which was found in melted pieces by his body, along with a knife and some keys.Among the many unanswered questions about the death of David Buckel was why he had a folding shopping cart with him. There was no fuel canister in it, nothing but an empty black plastic bag \u2014 the kind he and Mr. Morales filled with the rich new soil made on their compost site.The earth around Mr. Buckel was burned in a nearly perfect circle. The police said the ground was too scorched to tell, but it is possible that when he went to Prospect Park that day, he took some soil with him, hauling it in the cart. It is possible Mr. Buckel\u2019s last moments were spent spreading it out, making a ring around himself, so the flames wouldn\u2019t spread.Jan Ransom and Liz Robbins contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "New Privacy Rules Could Make This Woman One of Tech\u2019s Most Important Regulators", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "With Europe\u2019s sweeping new data privacy law, Ireland is in the middle of a standoff between regulators and tech companies.Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 If Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t know who Helen Dixon is, he will soon.From an unassuming townhouse in the Irish capital, Ms. Dixon, the country\u2019s data protection commissioner, leads an agency that was once a bureaucratic backwater. Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook\u2019s building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea.Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world\u2019s most consequential regulators.She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThere\u2019s a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,\u201d Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview.Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That\u2019s roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations.Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science.Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved.But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland\u2019s financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater.\u201cThe question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?\u201d said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. \u201cWe need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.\u201dBudgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley.Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland\u2019s history of lax oversight of the technology industry.Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints \u2014 not as common in Europe as the United States \u2014 that could result in sizable damages against businesses.\u201cWe should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you\u2019re not mandated by the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cEither they don\u2019t care or they actively oppose what we\u2019re doing.\u201dRepresentatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon\u2019s team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law.\u201cWe\u2019ve really leapt into explaining what we\u2019ve done and the thinking that\u2019s gone into that,\u201d said Stephen Deadman, Facebook\u2019s global deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cI\u2019ve got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon\u2019s office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media.\u201dGoogle and Twitter declined to comment.Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers \u201cto the fullest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank\u2019s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis.The nation\u2019s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests \u201cperiodically.\u201d These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks\u2019 risk management.

They mock us for our so-called \u201caddiction,\u201d calling us a self-involved, attention-starved generation. But if you ask any intelligent young person \u2014 two adjectives that are not mutually exclusive \u2014 they\u2019ll tell you all about what the information superhighway really means to us.Today\u2019s youth have come of age in an atmosphere where encroaching problems of climate change, global terrorism, economic crises and mass shootings \u2014 to name a few \u2014 have opened our eyes to the reality we\u2019re living in, the weight of fixing it all resting on our shoulders. But we\u2019ve also grown up in a world where we can type into Google anything we want to learn more about; we can engage with millions of people from all walks of life, come to understand perspectives at every angle. Knowledge is powerful, and we have all that we could want available at our fingertips.The reality is I follow news pages on my Instagram. I can\u2019t go a day on Twitter without seeing profound statements concerning the political climate. I have discussions with people over gun control and women\u2019s rights based on what I\u2019ve posted on my Snapchat story. Like it or not, social media has given us a way not only to speak out, but to educate ourselves and expand our minds in a way that is unprecedented.We\u2019ve become the most tolerant and conscious generation to date, with 76 percent of Gen Zers concerned about humanity\u2019s influence on the Earth and 60 percent hoping the job they choose impacts the world. Race, religion, sexuality, gender identity and anything differing from what has so long been deemed normal are all topics we don\u2019t write off, with a revolutionary 37 percent and 21 percent not identifying as 100 percent straight or 100 percent one gender, respectively. We get to experience the world from everyone\u2019s point of view; we\u2019re not limited by the danger of the single story, aren\u2019t held back by our own ignorance.So, I urge adults to back off, to encourage young people to use the internet to their advantage. Because while it\u2019s easy to understand the mental and emotional drawbacks that can be associated with the cyberworld, this connection to a diverse plethora of information has given us the opportunity to reach our own conclusions about the world, to make our beliefs known, to mobilize in efforts and take a stand \u2014 from protests and marches planned by students, to educating others on registering to vote \u2014 and it has created a socially and politically aware, opinionated and unafraid youth, who are wholly prepared to change the world.Works CitedAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Founders Embraced Control Over Companies. This One Is Giving It Up.", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, it was a way to protect themselves from pesky investors interested in short-term gains, even as shareholder advocates blasted the arrangements for creating unaccountable leaders.The founder-empowered structure at the heart of many tech companies is known as a multiclass stock structure, under which those who started the company own a certain class of stock that gives them outsize voting power even after it goes public.At Zynga, Mark Pincus, the company\u2019s founder, has now converted some of his shares that carry more voting clout \u2014 known as Class B and C shares \u2014 into common Class A shares. The conversion reduces his overall voting power at Zynga to about 10 percent from about 70 percent. Mr. Pincus will not see any change in his economic interest in the company from the conversion.In a phone interview, Mr. Pincus said his divorce, which he described as amicable, was \u201cnot part of or relevant to the announcement\u201d of his conversion of his stock.Rather, Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga\u2019s board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee \u2014 he was executive chairman \u2014 and become nonexecutive chairman of the company\u2019s board of directors.\u201cWe think the company doesn\u2019t benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,\u201d Mr. Pincus said.Dual-class voting structures have been around for decades and have been especially popular at media companies, such as News Corporation and The New York Times Company.The vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors.Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically.\u201cIt\u2019s quite an unusual move, but it\u2019s a welcome move,\u201d Mr. Elson said.Multiclass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. \u201cIf a C.E.O. does a poor job, he\u2019s not going to fire himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.\u201dIn response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision.Mr. Pincus said his voting control at Zynga had not given him veto power over outside offers to acquire the company, though it did give him the ability to replace board members. He said he had never exercised that right.When asked if Zynga could consider acquisition offers more easily now that Mr. Pincus had relinquished most of his voting power, Mr. Gibeau said, \u201cThat\u2019s not our mission \u2014 our focus is to grow the company.\u201dMr. Pincus said he intended to devote more time to investing in start-ups. He said he was particularly interested in companies focused on the blockchain, the technology that\u2019s behind electronic currencies like Bitcoin, but could also have broader applications.Giving up his control of Zynga, Mr. Pincus said, will \u201ccreate more space between me and the company whenever I go launch new products.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We tend to think that the smug, smart people who run companies like Google and Uber have some secret knowledge; we even give them our personal information, uneasily, but ultimately with a bit of a shrug. We\u2019re seduced by similar smug, smart, supposed innovators hawking data\u2019s potential to revolutionize health care and education. We assume technology and the information it yields is making everyone\u2019s life easier, freer and more comfortable.Virginia Eubanks begs to differ, with the authority to do so. For the poor, she argues, government data and its abuses have imposed a new regime of surveillance, profiling, punishment, containment and exclusion, which she evocatively calls the \u201cdigital poorhouse.\u201d While technology is often touted by researchers and policymakers as a way to deliver services to the poor more efficiently, Eubanks shows that more often, it worsens inequality. Data can\u2019t provide what poor people need, which is more resources. Indeed, as with the 19th-century poorhouse, she argues, the shiny new digital one allows us to \u201cmanage the individual poor in order to escape our shared responsibility for eradicating poverty.\u201dAlthough Eubanks is an activist and a political-science professor (at the University of Albany, SUNY), \u201cAutomating Inequality\u201d is a work of investigative journalism. She travels to Indiana, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, conducting illuminating interviews with administrators, social services staff and, most powerfully, people unlucky enough to reside in the digital poorhouse.The book is dedicated to a severely disabled little girl named Sophie. At the age of 6, during Indiana\u2019s experiment with welfare eligibility automation, Sophie received a letter (addressed directly to her) informing her that she was losing her Medicaid benefits because of a \u201cfailure to cooperate\u201d in establishing her eligibility for the program. This happened just as she was gaining weight, thanks to a lifesaving feeding tube, and learning to walk for the first time. Many Hoosiers lost vital assistance because of such computer \u201cmistakes.\u201dIn Pittsburgh, Eubanks meets Patrick and Angel. Though they are caring and vigilant parents to their own children, as well as generous volunteers helping other children in their community, this couple has been repeatedly flagged by social service databases for child neglect. It turns out, along with many other parents under suspicion by Pittsburgh child welfare authorities, their crime is being poor. In one instance, Patrick was investigated for \u201cmedical neglect\u201d when he couldn\u2019t afford an antibiotic prescription for his daughter.Technology allows the government to harass and punish the poor, but Eubanks adeptly shows that what they need instead is help. Assistance may cost more than technology, at least in the short run, but as countries that are more generous with housing, cash and health care have learned, it\u2019s the only effective way to fight poverty, along with poverty\u2019s associated ills, from child abuse to drug addiction to homelessness.\u201cAutomating Inequality\u201d is riveting (an accomplishment for a book on technology and policy). Its argument should be widely circulated, to poor people, social service workers and policymakers, but also throughout the professional classes. Everyone needs to understand that technology is no substitute for justice.Liza Featherstone is the author, most recently, of \u201cDivining Desire: Focus Groups and the Culture of Consultation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are My Friends Really My Friends?", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byfuture tenseThe quantity of human interactions has increased, but the quality is arguably diminished.The two-decade-old reference may feel dated, but consider the period the film was set in and the ways its characters interact. Landline conversations are routine. Lengthy answering-machine messages and postal mail play a significant emotional role. Friends gather at bars with no external distractions and little chance of making plans with other people on the fly.In hindsight, the movie\u2019s time \u2014 the \u201990s \u2014 was the last decade that had relatively few technological obstacles to traditional levels of friendship \u201cthickness.\u201d Social media and smartphones spread affection around more easily; friendships may run thin.\u201cMy net is cast wider\u201d now than in the past, said Lucy Schiller, 29, a recent graduate of the nonfiction writing program at the University of Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for me to engage casually with a greater number of people. I don\u2019t know if this is a byproduct of aging, but it seems like the parameters of friendships have changed. I\u2019d like to think they involve long walks and talking at length in person and involving yourself in shared activities, but at this point it feels like those structures have been relegated to the past and we\u2019re skating along through very fun but very lightweight interactions.\u201dTwo statistics from the General Social Survey in 1985 and 2004 are often invoked regarding the influence of new technology on close friendships and social isolation. The average number of confidants people said they had dropped from 2.94 to 2.08 over that time, and the number of those who had none at all went from one-tenth to nearly one-quarter.Taken on their own, these numbers are a damning indictment of internet-era connections, even if social networking was in its MySpace-Friendster infancy in 2004 and the iPhone did not exist. The researchers also determined that the network size of \u201ccore discussion confidants\u201d is most strongly associated with two popular social media activities: instant messaging and uploading photos. People who have a mobile phone and engage in these activities have a network 34 percent larger than those who don\u2019t.The oft-cited \u201cDunbar\u2019s number\u201d is an average of 150 casual friends for humans (really, a range of 100 to 200). These are the people who might come to your wedding or funeral. However, digital media channels \u201cdon\u2019t distinguish between quality of relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cThey allow you to maintain relationships that would otherwise decay. Our data shows that if you don\u2019t meet people at the requisite frequencies, you\u2019ll drop down through the layers until eventually you drop out of the 150 and become \u2018somebody you once knew.\u2019 What we think is happening is that, if you don\u2019t meet sometime face to face, social media is slowing down the rate of decay.\u201dThe result, then, can be a glut of old acquaintances that are not as easily forgotten online and which therefore stifle the development of newer, in-person friendships.\u201cYour available social time is limited, and you can either spend it face to face or on the internet,\u201d Dr. Dunbar said. If it\u2019s spent with people who are \u201cremote,\u201d whether geographically or just because they\u2019re represented digitally, \u201cyou don\u2019t have time to invest in new relationships where you are.\u201d \u201cIf my high-school friend posts frequently about her life, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s celebrity gossip, or it\u2019s akin to me watching a reality show about her,\u201d Ms. Flora said. \u201cOur brains get confused about whether we know celebrities; if we see someone a lot, our brain thinks we know them.\u201dOf course, thinking we know people through status updates (or paparazzi photos) is not the same as spending time with them, just as dashing off \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d on someone\u2019s Facebook wall has less emotional impact than saying it in person or over the phone. Ms. Flora did note the advantages of digital media for introverts and people susceptible to loneliness, namely that it is less risky and enervating to make contact through a text or post than through a phone call or an invitation to meet.With this lower threshold for maintaining friendships, some people strongly favor mediated interactions over in-person interactions, especially millennials accustomed to constant communication via devices. Ms. Schiller, the Iowa graduate, goes out often with friends at night but also subsists on a digital diet of texting (heavily enough that she recently strained her thumb), Google Chat and social media. She said she finds conversation on Google Chat banal, likely because she tends to use it as she multitasks on her computer, but sometimes opens up more to people via the confessional space of a text message than she might across a table. As with many millennials, talking on the phone was never a big part of her routine and is now reserved for the rarest of occasions. \u201cI\u2019ve asked people over Gchat if they want to talk on the phone, and they hem and haw,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can feel draining \u2014 there isn\u2019t a casual component to it.\u201dThere are physiological benefits to face-to-face encounters, however, that do not accrue to digital interactions or the phone. \u201cYour blood pressure goes down, you have synchrony, you mimic your friend\u2019s posture unconsciously,\u201d Ms. Flora said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rapport humans have developed over thousands of years, and you don\u2019t get that when you only follow someone on social media.\u201d (Skype et al. can be comparable, though, Dr. Dunbar observed.)\u201cIf there\u2019s a bunch of guys at a bar together and they\u2019re all on their phones,\u201d Dr. Dunbar said, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing much to trigger the endorphin system to create the sense of bondedness.\u201dBecause members of Generation X such as Ms. Flora based the passionate friendships of their youth primarily on in-person interactions or \u201crambling\u201d phone calls, when they \u201cmake the transfer\u201d to digital friendships they \u201ccan take advantage of the benefits of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for younger people, I would worry about them compromising that precious face-to-face time, not sensing or adjusting to what their friends are really thinking or feeling.\u201dSpeaking of her generation\u2019s possibly diminished capacity for deep friendships, Ms. Schiller issued an unintentionally resonant qualification.\u201cIt might just be me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Getting a Flood of G.D.P.R.-Related Privacy Policy Updates? Read Them", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou have probably noticed a flood of emails and alerts from companies in the last few weeks informing you about changes to their privacy policies.Don\u2019t ignore them.The data regulation law centers on two main principles. The first is that companies need your consent to collect your data. The second is that you should be required to share only data that is necessary to make their services work.Danny O\u2019Brien, a director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, offered this analogy: \u201cA birthday cake company needs your name to put on the birthday cake. If it isn\u2019t essential information, you can deny them consent to use that data and you still have to get the service.\u201dIf companies don\u2019t comply with the new rules, they can be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue. But you should expect businesses that rely on advertising revenue to work hard to persuade as many of us as possible to give our consent for them to collect as much data as possible. Companies can do that by making it easy for people to give permission, and immensely complicated to opt out.So to ensure you benefit from the new law, it helps to examine the revamped privacy policies we are all getting. Here is what to look for.Let\u2019s start with those pesky emails and notifications. Don\u2019t gloss over them \u2014 some sites are using the emails not only to inform you of their updated privacy policies, but also to \u201cask\u201d for your consent.A Quora spokeswoman said the company complied with the new data law by seeking affirmative consent from users when required. The company said the email explaining the particular changes in its privacy policy was an informational email and did not require consent, but that it would update the language in its email to be less ambiguous. The language has since been updated.Other sites are using pop-up notifications to seek consent. The clothing retailer Taylor Stitch, for example, recently started showing a banner ad that explains how cookies are used for web tracking. The note added that by closing the banner ad or interacting with its website, you were agreeing with the site\u2019s data collection terms. The company did not respond to requests for comment.Here\u2019s the problem: Companies clearly know that we rarely (if ever) read privacy policies. They also know that we find notifications to be annoying, because they pop up just as we are in the middle of another task.But if we ignore them, we may be unintentionally giving consent to more of our data being shared than we actually want to give out.\u201cThat pop-up fatigue is definitely something I\u2019m worried about, now that these pop-ups are really more important than ever,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher who follows privacy issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.If you skipped reading the emails and notifications, you may have missed out on the new privacy controls that internet companies recently introduced. These typically are not very easy to find, but they are worth exploring because there may be new methods to minimize the amount of data you share.Consider Twitter. The social media company\u2019s recent privacy-related email mentioned that people can now more clearly see and control how their data is shared with its business partners.Here\u2019s how: Near the very bottom of Twitter\u2019s settings menu, there is now a button called Your Twitter data. Here, you can see the number of advertisers that are trying to target you based on your interests. You can also opt out of this so-called interest-based advertising. When I used the tool, I found out that more than 600 advertisers had my contact information, and I chose to no longer share data with the ads program.For example, you can opt out of being shown ads based on information like your relationship status, employer, job title and education history. You can also opt out of being shown ads based on your activity on other Facebook-owned products like the messaging app WhatsApp or the virtual reality system Oculus.Those are just two examples of big social networking sites. What tech products do you use the most? Take a moment to poke around in your privacy settings to see if there are any new restrictions you can put on your data.A big part of the new data law is that it requires companies to offer ways for you to pull your data out and take it to a new service. Google, Facebook and Twitter each offer the ability to download your own data, and some of those capabilities have been expanded ahead of the new data law\u2019s going into effect.Be aware that other internet products you use should soon be offering similar tools to pull out your data. If you disagree with a company\u2019s new data collection policy, try downloading your information to see if you can exercise your right of taking your data to a better product.And if porting your data doesn\u2019t work out, keep in mind that you can delete your account. The new data law requires companies to offer ways for European users to permanently delete their accounts and all their data along with it. Companies may choose not to offer the same option for people outside Europe, but it won\u2019t hurt to try.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa? Please Ignore My Husband", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMarriage is long. Sometimes spouses stop listening to each other. Enter the virtual assistant.My husband and I were in Wabash, Ind., visiting my mother-in-law\u2019s hometown, when we had an argument. It was our second day there, and I\u2019d like to attribute the fight to the stress of travel, but Bruce and I can argue in a box, with a fox, on a stair or anywhere.The fight, as usual, was about how he doesn\u2019t listen to me. I don\u2019t remember the specifics, but what typically happens is he\u2019ll ask me about something I just told him minutes earlier, revealing that he wasn\u2019t listening. Or he\u2019ll start talking about a completely different topic while I\u2019m still speaking. Or I\u2019ll ask him a question \u2014 \u201cDo you want dessert?\u201d or \u201cAre the Knicks playing tonight?\u201d \u2014 and he won\u2019t answer.At least once a day, I find myself saying, \u201cI just told you that.\u201dIf it happened occasionally, O.K., but this is chronic. The passage of time tends to dissolve the discord like running warm water over a bucket of dried plaster, but sometimes the conflict feels insurmountable and I start to think I can\u2019t possibly spend the rest of my life with someone who doesn\u2019t hear me.That\u2019s how I felt that morning when I said, \u201cWell, I want to make this clear, for the record. I hate that you don\u2019t listen to me. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair, and if I one day leave you because of it, don\u2019t say I never warned you.\u201dAs soon as I said it, I knew I shouldn\u2019t have. My saving grace? He probably didn\u2019t hear me.My husband and I have argued for so long it has become part of the fabric of our relationship, like a bunion \u2014 though our squabbles don\u2019t stop us from having a relatively normal relationship. People can walk on bunions for years. We have family dinners, weekly dates, watch TV together, exchange Christmas gifts. In fact, this past Christmas he bought me Alexa, which I have just started using.\u201cAlexa, play holiday jazz music,\u201d I\u2019ll say. And she does.\u201cAlexa, what is the temperature outside?\u201d And she\u2019ll tell me.After a few days, I realized that Alexa hears everything I say and responds each time \u2014 something I have failed to get from my husband over the last 20 years.\u201cAsk her anything,\u201d my husband said. \u201cLike this. Alexa, what\u2019s 14,300 divided by 25?\u201dAlexa said nothing.So I said, \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s 14,300 divided by 25?\u201d\u201c14,300 divided by 25 is 572,\u201d she said.I looked at my husband. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t say it very nicely.\u201dAlexa not only listened to me, but she provided an added bonus: She didn\u2019t seem to listen to my husband. He got to feel how I have felt for most of our relationship.Even the cashier at the diner sympathized. \u201cI tell my husband a thousand times to do something, and he doesn\u2019t hear me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I bother. I wind up doing it myself.\u201dThat evening I was sitting in the living room listening to the jazz holiday music Alexa had put on for me, when I said, \u201cAlexa?\u201dThe music stopped. I paused. \u201cJust wanted to see if you were listening,\u201d I said.The light on the top of the machine turned bluish green and the speaker made a clunky sound, as if to say, \u201cIndeed.\u201dThe other day, as I sat in the dining room working, I could hear my husband in the kitchen sniffing as he made my son\u2019s lunch.\u201cSounds like you\u2019re getting sick,\u201d I said.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d he said, his voice trailing off as he moved to the far side of the kitchen.One might think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You can\u2019t fault someone for being too far away. But what\u2019s revealing to me is the matter-of-fact way he says it, the way he shows no curiosity to find out what I said. If real life had subtitles, his line from that exchange would read: \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, and I\u2019m absolutely fine with that.\u201dMy husband\u2019s inability to hear me takes all forms. The other day I wanted to tell him I would not be going to my son\u2019s soccer practice as I had said I would, and I tried calling him, texting him and leaving him a voice mail message, to no avail.At times like that, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s a fortress and no mode of communication \u2014 not swimming the moat, flying overhead, dropping a note nor sending a fiery missive over the fortress wall \u2014 will reach him.Sometimes when Bruce doesn\u2019t hear me these days, I look over at Alexa to see if her blue and green light will go on, an indication that she is listening \u2014 though in situations like that morning, I don\u2019t want her to be. I\u2019m embarrassed by my anger.A few months ago, Bruce and I went out to breakfast and began talking about where to take our six-year-old son for spring break.\u201cHow about Disney?\u201d I said.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right week for it,\u201d he said, and then he picked up his phone and began reading a text.\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe we should go in September.\u201dHe continued to read his phone as I spoke.\u201cOr maybe we should bring a dead dog to Disney,\u201d I said, to see if he was listening. Some people can multitask. My husband is not among them. He didn\u2019t even look up.\u201cAnd if the dog isn\u2019t dead, you can always kill one so you have a dead dog to bring. To Disney.\u201dNothing.Finally, without looking up, he said, \u201cMy father\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d\u201cOh my god,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cMy sister says he may have had a stroke.\u201dI felt like a self-centered heel. But that\u2019s the thing about relationships. When your partner does something chronically, like being a bad listener, we always think they are doing that annoying thing even when they\u2019re not. We\u2019re not seeing them. We\u2019re seeing who we think they are \u2014 which means that in those moments we\u2019re just seeing an extension of ourselves.When I was in analysis, I would sometimes say something to my therapist, ponder it, and then say, \u201cI think you think I\u2019m stupid\u201d \u2014 when in fact she had said nothing. If she were my husband, I would probably say, \u201cI think you think I\u2019m boring.\u201dIt turns out my father-in-law had suffered a stroke that day \u2014 two, actually, in a short period of time \u2014 but he has almost fully recovered and is as chipper as ever. My husband now calls him nearly every morning on his way to work, and if the conversations go as they always have, my father-in-law will listen intently for a couple of minutes and then move on to another topic, despite my husband being midsentence.While this pattern should have made my husband more empathetic to my plight \u2014 what Bruce\u2019s father does to him, he does to me \u2014 it has had the opposite effect, confirming for him that everyone gets interrupted, no one gets to be heard all the time \u2014 except bratty women who demand it.Which brings me back to Alexa. She listens better than any partner I have ever had, but that\u2019s not hard, because I thought all of them were poor listeners \u2014 especially the one who was hearing-impaired. He didn\u2019t hear a thing I said.It made me wonder: Do I seek out partners who don\u2019t hear me so I can keep having to deal with my problematic territory in order to fix it, like one might practice a skateboard jump over and over again until he masters it? Or were all my partners perfect, more or less, but because of my wound, I wind up not feeling heard?

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Continues to Test Regulators: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching: \u2022 What\u2019s next for CBS and Shari Redstone?\u2022 Kushners are near a deal for troubled 666 Fifth Avenue.\u2022 China\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.\u2022 How Michael Cohen\u2019s bank records emerged.\u2022 The splits in the Trump trade team.Wells Fargo\u2019s missteps are creating an important test for President Trump\u2019s regulators.In a statement included in the Journal report, Wells Fargo said: \u201cThis matter involves documents used for internal purposes. No customers were negatively impacted, no data left the company, and no products or services were sold as a result.\u201dBut a bank doesn\u2019t have to harm customers to get into trouble with its regulators. Much of what regulators do is aimed at ensuring banks have systems in place to make sure they are complying with regulations. As scandals have hit Wells Fargo over the past two years, regulators have been pressing the bank to tighten up its controls. But the missteps reported by the Journal occurred as recently as the early part of this year, suggesting Wells Fargo is still struggling to improve its compliance and its workplace culture.It is not clear how widespread the purported abuses are. But the documentation was reportedly related to controls aimed at spotting money-laundering, an area of compliance where regulators tend to hold a hard line. If the documentation missteps in the business bank are significant, regulators could be ready to take tough action. In its enforcement action, the O.C.C. stated that it:\u201c\u2026expressly reserves its right to assess future civil money penalties, or take other supervisory and/or enforcement actions, including in circumstances where the O.C.C. determines that the bank is not making sufficient and sustainable progress towards implementation of an effective and sustainable enterprise-wide compliance risk management program.\u201dIf more problems crop up at Wells Fargo, the public will be more likely to believe that the bank is too big to manage \u2014 and that regulators are not up to the task of reining it in.- Peter EavisChina\u2019s banks continue to dwarf those in the West.The only change from last year among the 10 largest banks came at the No. 10 spot, where France\u2019s Credit Agricole leapfrogged Wells Fargo. Here\u2019s a look at the top 25.Chancellor Andre Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery rescinded a temporary restraining order against Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements, handing her a victory in an unusually vicious battle between the broadcaster and its controlling shareholder.In his ruling, Chancellor Bouchard said that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the court to grant the restraining order \u2014 one CBS argued was necessary to prevent Ms. Redstone from replacing directors, to the harm of other shareholders \u2014 because Delaware law allows the company to challenge such board removals.From the ruling:I am not convinced that the harm plaintiffs fear would be irreparable. To the contrary, the court has extensive power to provide redress if Ms. Redstone takes action(s) inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations owed by a controlling stockholder\u2014 Michael de la MercedShares of CBS declined 6 percent after CBS\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Ms. Redstone was denied. The stock was recently down 4 percent.What could happen when Chancellor Bouchard rules, as soon as today:\u2022 He blocks Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw amendment; CBS\u2019s board proceeds to neuter its controlling shareholder; a big new precedent is set.\u2022 He lets Ms. Redstone\u2019s bylaw change stay; CBS\u2019s insurrection is defeated; and the fate of its board and its C.E.O., Les Moonves, becomes cloudy. (Ms. Redstone has said she doesn\u2019t want to oust the board.)\u2022 Something else we haven\u2019t thought of. Stay tuned.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws. The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.Charles Kushner, head of the Kushner Companies, is in advanced talks with Brookfield Properties over a partnership to take control of the 41-story aluminum-clad tower 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, according to two real estate executives who have been briefed on the pending deal but are not authorized to discuss it. Brookfield is a publicly traded company, headquartered in Canada, one of whose major investors is the Qatar Investment Authority.Mr. Kushner and his son Jared, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and one of his key advisers, bought the office tower, which is between 51st and 52nd Streets, 11 years ago for a record-setting $1.8 billion. But the building today only generates about half its annual mortgage payment, and 30 percent of the 41-story tower is vacant.In late 2016, Mr. Kushner and his son were close to a much different kind of deal with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company with ties to the country\u2019s ruling elite, and with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani. That plan involved demolishing the existing building at 666 Fifth and erecting a $7.5 billion luxury super tower.\u2014 Charles V. BagliFrom the WSJ:\u201cThe employees in Wells Fargo\u2019s so-called wholesale unit, which is separate from its retail bank, added or altered information without customers\u2019 knowledge, according to the people familiar with the matter. The information added varied from social security numbers to addresses to dates of birth for people associated with business-banking clients, the people said.\u201d\u201cThe behavior took place in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank\u2019s anti-money-laundering controls, the people said.\u201dFor investors, there was perhaps no number in Walmart\u2019s earnings report that mattered as much as the giant retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales, or more specifically the growth of those sales.Walmart said this morning that its digital sales grew 33 percent in its fiscal first quarter and that it expects online sales to grow 40 percent for the year.But the transformation has had its bumps. After three quarters of more than 50 percent growth, e-commerce sales increased just 23 percent in the fourth quarter. Jet was supposed to be Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon, but analysts said Jet\u2019s growth had slowed in the fourth quarter. And Walmart said it would focus on driving new customers through its main Walmart.com site.\u201cThat system is a safeguard for the bank. It\u2019s a stockpile of information.

{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Make France a \u2018Start-Up Nation.\u2019 Is It Getting There?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet a year after Mr. Macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn France into \u201ca start-up nation,\u201d it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric. While the country has quickly become one of the most talked-about destinations in Europe for tech companies and start-ups, France still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp London as the region\u2019s technology leader.The French president has carefully cultivated a tech-savvy image, promoted a steady drumbeat of high-profile events, and even pushed through a raft of economic and labor reforms to make his country more appealing to investors. But France continues to lag Britain in tech-related investments and in the business of artificial intelligence. Start-ups still face challenges in scaling up. And a lot of seed funding comes from the French government itself.Companies have been pledging to do more in France. In January, for example, the chief executives of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies announced 3.5 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, in new investments and the creation of at least 2,200 jobs in the next five years.Those figures are minuscule compared with investment in Silicon Valley, and even London. Mr. Macron nevertheless sought to build on France\u2019s momentum on Wednesday, when he convened 60 tech chief executives for meetings in Paris. The French president met individually with the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and with the leaders of IBM, Microsoft and Uber later Wednesday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Facebook has faced a barrage of public criticism over its handling of user data and vast powers, points Mr. Macron intends to press further on Wednesday. The president\u2019s office also said that Mr. Macron would have frank discussions with the various chief executives over the taxation of tech companies and fighting the proliferation of rumors and misinformation spreading online. The meetings come as French lawmakers are expected to debate additional transparency measures for social media companies like Facebook.But Mr. Macron president is also expected to seize the moment to announce more tech-related investments in France.\u201cClearly there has been a Macron effect,\u201d said Franck Sebag, a Paris-based partner at the professional services firm Ernst & Young, who has studied France\u2019s digital trajectory.\u201cFew people were even talking about France as a tech country a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Sebag said. \u201cHe\u2019s ignited a willingness to invest.\u201dAs President Trump pursues an increasingly protectionist agenda for the United States, and Britain veers away from the European Union, Mr. Macron has promoted a policy of open borders and being business-friendly in a country that has long had a reputation for being anything but. Multinationals are venturing to create more jobs in France as Mr. Macron overhauls French labor laws, despite protests by French workers.\u201cThe U.K. is no longer the undisputed capital of European venture capital,\u201d Dealroom said in a recent report. \u201cContinental Europe is catching up, while France is almost on par already.\u201dFor all the hype, France must confront a number of longstanding hurdles.The trend here is shifting, though.Big businesses are increasingly tallying the advantages, especially since Mr. Macron convened 140 chief executives of global companies at an ornate gathering at the Palace of Versailles in January. He told them that he was pursuing a strategy to make France more productive and competitive, and announced more than \u20ac3.5 billion in foreign investments, including a large chunk for tech.Fujitsu of Japan is one of several Asia-based companies that plan to invest in expanded artificial intelligence research here. After the gathering in Versailles, the Fujitsu president, Tatsuya Tanaka, was named a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur by the French government, one of France\u2019s highest honors.\u201cThe new image of France,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cis attracting foreign investors again.\u201dElian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority.

But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

{"Headline": "What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.\u00a0Mr. Wu is a law professor who who specializes in antitrust.Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.Microsoft, the world\u2019s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft\u2019s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.Yet it is worth remembering that at the time, challenging Microsoft was not a popular decision. Microsoft was a well-liked company and Mr. Gates was widely heralded as a visionary genius. Many, Microsoft most of all, argued that enforcing the antitrust laws against Microsoft would damage innovation and impede the economic growth fueled by the technology sector.This view turned out to be wrong. Innovation surged in the newly opened markets and the United States continued to spearhead growth in the technological world. The enduring lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trustbuster\u2019s courage to take decisive action against even a very popular monopolist.Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business. Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web. Google, the tiny start-up, would have faced an unfair fight against Bing. Microsoft-Myspace might have become the default social network instead of Facebook. And who knows whether Netflix or any other online video service would have been started?It took the power of law enforcement to rebut Microsoft\u2019s claims that everything it was doing was pro-competitive, innovative and innocent. The discovery of candid internal company memos, a famously revealing deposition of Bill Gates and a full trial made it clear that Microsoft saw the internet as a major threat to its monopoly rule and was seeking to tame it.The presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was right to propose that Microsoft be broken into two companies \u2014 one for the Windows operating system, one for other products. In the end, unfortunately, Microsoft was kept whole.Some limitations were placed on Microsoft\u2019s behavior, such as a requirement that it share certain programming information with third-party companies. The appropriateness of that remedy is still debated. But what we do know is that the remedy pushed Microsoft to act with more caution, creating an essential opening for a new generation of firms.It might seem like a cruel irony that the immediate beneficiaries of the Microsoft antitrust case \u2014 namely, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 have now become behemoths themselves. But this is how the innovation cycle works: It creates room for saplings to grow into giants, but then prevents the new giants from squashing the next generation of saplings. (Microsoft was itself, in the early 1980s, the beneficiary of another antitrust case, against IBM, the computing colossus of its time.)Which takes us to the present day. Unfortunately, ever since the Microsoft case there has been remarkably little oversight of the technology sector, despite the obvious signs of corporate consolidation and outsize market power. Enforcement of the antimonopoly laws has fallen: Between 1970 and 1999, the United States brought about 15 monopoly cases each year; between 2000 and 2014 that number went down to just three.Antitrust efforts have become too fixated on the idea that the only real harm consists of raising of prices for consumers. Yet in the Microsoft case, Internet Explorer was \u201cfree,\u201d even though Microsoft was bent on destroying competition with it. Today, both Google and Facebook offer products that are free. Society has grown to rely on them, but because they have no dollar price, antitrust regulators have been hesitant to take action.Any American can tell you that there is no free lunch. Everything has a price. We pay for these products and services with our time and our data. And like Microsoft, these firms have come to exert too much control over our shared technological future.At a hearing before the Senate, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was asked to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor \u2014 a company providing a similar service that consumers can go to if they are unhappy with Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg could not name one. Part of the reason for this is that Facebook bought its most obvious competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to acquire upstart companies before they can reach that point.The pattern is familiar. And if the Microsoft case showed us anything, it is that we should not trust any one company to decide our future.Richard Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

Notably, average growth in that period was slower than in the preceding 10 years, sometimes by a lot. The slowdowns were no doubt largely due to the negative impact of the financial crisis.

{"Headline": "SoftBank Fund Puts $2.25 Billion in G.M.\u2019s Driverless Unit", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-driving cars have increasingly figured in visions of the automotive future, and a big new investment is the latest signal that such a moment is close at hand.On Thursday, a fund affiliated with SoftBank Group of Japan said it planned to invest $2.25 billion in the driverless-technology division of General Motors to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service in select cities.The deal\u2019s magnitude reflects the growing confidence that commercial use of autonomous cars is in sight \u2014 despite recent setbacks to some other companies, including at least two fatal accidents, that have raised questions about the technology\u2019s safety.\u201cThis is a new source of capital to scale this business,\u201d Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, said in a conference call. \u201cWe think this fully funds our plan.\u201dAs part of the deal, G.M. said it would put an additional $1.1 billion of its own money into the unit, which is known as G.M. Cruise Holdings and is based in San Francisco. SoftBank\u2019s investment will be made through its Vision Fund, which focuses on the technology sector.Investors offered the move a vote of confidence, sending G.M.\u2019s shares up almost 13 percent on Thursday.In both Detroit and Silicon Valley, as well as overseas, the rush to build a foundation for autonomous-driving technology is gathering momentum. Waymo, the driverless-technology company spun out of Google, said Thursday that it had agreed to purchase as many as 62,000 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for a ride-hailing service that will start operating commercially in Phoenix by the end of this year.Waymo previously agreed to buy up to 20,000 compact cars from Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2019, giving it a potential fleet of more than 80,000 driverless vehicles within three or four years.\u201cThe volumes they are committing to is a clear signal these companies think they\u2019ve got it, that their technology is very close to commercial ready,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks autonomous technology.The determination of G.M. and Waymo to offer ride services within months also suggests a conviction that businesses that use driverless cars to ferry ordinary people from place to place will spread rapidly and \u2014 absent the cost of a driver \u2014 yield hefty profits.At the same time, Mr. Ramsey noted, \u201cit\u2019s a completely unproven business model,\u201d with costly technology that is bound to have growing pains. The first vehicles will probably be programmed to be so cautious in traffic that crosstown trips may initially take much longer than people are used to, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think safety will be the concern for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time it takes to get to your destination could be a turnoff, though.\u201dLike G.M., Ford is racing to put self-driving cars into ride and delivery fleets, but it has a longer timeline and is hoping to have its car in production by 2021.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the SoftBank investment validated the direction that G.M. and its Cruise division were taking. The investment gives SoftBank a 19.6 percent stake in G.M. Cruise and values the unit at more than $11 billion. That\u2019s well above the $1 billion that G.M. paid two years ago to acquire Cruise as a start-up company.\u201cThere\u2019s no other company in the world that has the technology chops and the experience to lead the industry on this front,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank\u2019s investment arm, SoftBank Investment Advisers.The investment highlights the ambition and seemingly bottomless wallet of SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son. It was Mr. Son who came up with the idea of raising nearly $100 billion from investors ranging from Saudi Arabia to Apple for the Vision Fund, which is now one of the world\u2019s biggest and boldest investors in tech companies.In a reflection of Mr. Son\u2019s personality, SoftBank and the Vision Fund have become known for moving quickly to invest in companies with products seen as crucial to the future of technology. They have been willing to pour large sums into early start-ups at enormous valuations, crowding out other potential investors.Ride-hailing has been a major focus for SoftBank, with investments in Uber, Didi Chuxing of China, Ola of India, Grab of Singapore and 99 of Brazil.At the time, the company said its vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be produced on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate. Likely spots for initial operations are San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz., where Cruise is already conducting tests.Waymo, on the other hand, does not intend to make cars but instead will rely on partners to produce vehicles that it will outfit with sensors, radar and other technology.A unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, it has been working on self-driving technology for nearly a decade, and is focusing on four potential lines of business. In addition to the ride service it intends to start, the company expects to put its autonomous-driving technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, and aims to license its technology to automakers like Fiat Chrysler. It sees a potential fourth business line in driverless shuttles that can ferry riders to mass transit systems.The company expects to begin buying Pacifica minivans for its ride service later this year. They will be produced at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Windsor, Ontario, and equipped with self-driving technology at a Waymo technical center in Novi, Mich.Waymo gave no details on how many minivans it expects to buy this year or next, the value of the deal, or the period covered by the purchase agreement.The companies said Thursday that they were in talks about licensing Waymo technology to Fiat Chrysler so the carmaker can at some point sell self-driving vehicles to consumers.Advertisement"}

Greater Israel is O.K. in the White House.Israel displays such high-handedness in part because it has carte blanche from the Trump administration to do what it will: view the West Bank as Israel proper, overreact at the Gaza fence, pass a 2017 law banning boycott supporters from the country. Habits of violent intolerance absorbed through a 50-year exercise in policing the lives of others no longer meet any semblance of American censure. Unbridled, Israel lurches rightward.Franke told me: \u201cThey were not interested in why I was there. They already had a story. I was a leader of Jewish Voice for Peace. I was there to promote the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement \u2014 all this untrue. It quickly ramped up to where the guy was yelling at me for lying. He Googled my name and came up with right-wing trolling sites like Canary Mission or AMCHA that push out ugly stuff about faculty held to be enemies of Israel.\u201d How is it, Franke asked, that \u201cIsrael delegates to right-wing trolls the job of determining who should be admitted to Israel?\u201dFranke has visited Israel a half-dozen times before. She supervises dissertations by graduate students there. She had meetings scheduled with civil rights advocates. She has worked on the Academic Advisory Council of Jewish Voice for Peace and generally she supports its aims but is not a leader of it. A critic of Israel\u2019s human rights record, she has boycotted conferences paid for by the Israeli government, but has participated in other academic conferences in Israel. Faculty members at Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University have told her they are going to write to express their outrage.In other words, she\u2019s the kind of tough critic a free and democratic society should welcome. Any healthy society is defined by its ability to accommodate civilized debate, not by cries of \u201ctraitor\u201d directed at dissenters. Sending her and Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, back to America was a measure of how far Israeli political culture has closed.Franke told me the reaction from Columbia had been \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Although she informed the law school dean and the provost of her detention, no one asked whether she got out the country safely, and no statement was issued from the university. The law school dean\u2019s chief of staff informed her, she told me, that \u201cbecause there are pro-Israeli centers at the law school\u201d the school \u201cwould not get involved in defending\u201d her.When I contacted Columbia, Lee Bollinger, the President, sent this statement to me: \u201cI think it is wrong for a country to deny entry to a visitor because of his or her political beliefs. I strongly disagree with the idea of boycotting Israeli academics and institutions \u2026but I also think that the government of Israel should not deny academics or others access to the country simply because they hold and express that viewpoint. The future of academic freedom is best secured through exchange of people and ideas, not by establishing barriers.\u201dBollinger was in Israel just before Franke. Columbia is in preliminary talks to establish a Global Center in Tel Aviv. It has opened others in Istanbul, Amman and Mumbai, among other locations. The Tel Aviv project should hinge on Israel\u2019s commitment to the open \u201cexchange of people and ideas,\u201d and its rejection of the nationalist intolerance Franke encountered and that Trump\u2019s carte blanche has encouraged.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Lost\u2019 Immigrant Children? That\u2019s a Different Story", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis, in and of itself, was not that unusual. What was unusual was that the article had been published nearly a month before. Still, I brushed it aside and didn\u2019t think about it again until I got to work. An editor there told me it had been seen hundreds of thousands of times.It was a month-old story! In my New York Times career, I have seen a stray retweet of a story a month later, or an email from a reader thanking me or to heap on belated criticism. But I had never seen a resurrection quite like this. Interest in my article was revived by a misunderstanding: It was read as evidence that children had arrived at the border with their parents, were separated from them by the Department of Homeland Security and then lost in government bureaucracy. It was a case of something I and other reporters often learn the hard way: Articles have a way of taking on a life of their own.So what happened? The report had been about the federal government\u2019s inability to locate nearly 1,500 children who had been placed with sponsors after the kids showed up alone at the border. But somehow, that story had been conflated with another: the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy at the border intended to deter new migrants with the threat of jail sentences. Migrant parents who are referred for criminal prosecution will be separated from their children.It all began in April, with a tip from a source that government officials were going to testify before a Senate homeland security subcommittee that they were unable to say with any degree of certainty the location of nearly 1,500 migrant children who had been placed with sponsors.Children who show up at the border alone are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. That had hit home for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. His staff had investigated the placement of migrant children with sponsors in 2016 and found that several had been placed with people who forced them to work on an egg farm in his state. Mr. Portman argued that the government has a responsibility to keep track of the children so that they are not abused or trafficked. The government argued that once it releases the children to a sponsor, its responsibility ends. We posted my article hours before a hearing on the matter. Afterward, I updated it to include questions and comments from the senators and testimony from witnesses. Then I moved on. That is, until last weekend.In this case, I\u2019m not sure what happened. But here\u2019s an educated guess: Several days before my story ran, my colleague Caitlin Dickerson discovered that the Trump administration had taken more than 700 children from adults claiming to be their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. The Department of Homeland Security initially denied those numbers, but later confirmed them.The mix-up, however, had an unexpected consequence: The coverage did force the Trump administration to address several issues surrounding its handling of migrant children. Senior officials held a call with reporters not only to address the separation of children from parents and the government\u2019s responsibility for them afterward; they also had to explain, or at least try to, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet putting the blame for the problem on a law that does not exist. When my original article ran, there was little to no comment from officials other than congressional testimony.In the end, I\u2019m not sure what could have been done to prevent a situation like this. But the ordeal did emphasize one thing: the value of digging as deeply as possible for the facts. I will continue to report on stories like this. For a hot-button topic like immigration, that\u2019s all I can do.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Audiobooks for Those Long Summer Drives, Without the Kids", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAudiobooksWe\u2019re barreling toward summer, with long drives and leisure hours ahead. It\u2019s the time of year when friends who know I\u2019m an audiobook nut ask for suggestions. Podcasts offer more flash and dazzle, but I still love the long arc of books \u201con tape\u201d as an antidote to the shattered attention span of a Twitter-fied society. Recommendations can be tricky (unless the friend hasn\u2019t heard my recent favorite, Amor Towles\u2019s wonderful novel \u201cA Gentleman in Moscow,\u201d read with wry sadness and perfect comic timing by Nicholas Guy Smith. You\u2019re welcome). What follows is an eclectic list of audiobooks that might provide ideas for your next summer drive.The mystery writer Clare Mackintosh\u2019s first book, \u201cI Let You Go,\u201d won an enthusiastic reception when it was published in 2016, and she has become known for her solid descriptions of police work, her previous profession. This third novel opens with Anna Johnson trapped in a fog of grief over the loss of her parents, who committed suicide at the same seaside cliff, months apart. But were they suicides? Is there a paranormal angle? Things are not as they seem.The twists and turns provide adequate entertainment, but Mackintosh plods until the last scenes of the book. The most satisfying thread concerns the private life of Murray Mackenzie, a retired detective who becomes involved in Anna\u2019s case, and who cares for a mentally ill wife. Their story alone would make a fine novel, even without the suicides. Or were they murders?The audiobook\u2019s narrator, Gemma Whelan (who also plays Yara Greyjoy on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d), goes for an even, steady delivery that suggests the protagonist may be a bit slow on the uptake. Her measured tone further hints at her knowledge that, while this book is a mystery, it is no thriller.Anthony Ray Hinton spent nearly three decades behind bars for murders he did not commit, railroaded through the legal system and landing on death row. When Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative and the man Hinton calls \u201cGod\u2019s best lawyer,\u201d finally won his release, Hinton\u2019s tearful statement as he left the prison was, \u201cThe sun does shine.\u201dHow Hinton survived those long years is a story of resilience and imagination, of faith and the support of his mother and friends. He speaks of his rage over his conviction, and of ultimately coming to forgive those who wronged him \u2014 including an inept defense lawyer and the prosecutor who locked him away even though the gun supposedly used in the crimes (which belonged to Hinton\u2019s mother) had not been fired in years, among other obvious flaws in the case. \u201cThey were a shameful lot of sad men, and I prayed for their souls.\u201dThe actor Kevin R. Free performs this work with flashes of anger cast over a deep humility, and captures the sense of humor that Hinton was, incredibly, able to hold on to during his long years in solitary confinement \u2014 his affability could get even prison guards to smile. This is a story that enrages and inspires.Justin Trudeau published this election memoir in 2014 on his way to becoming prime minister of Canada. As such, it has many of the flaws endemic to these hardcover sales brochures. Even so, it\u2019s not every national leader who writes about his tattoos, or his time in the boxing ring, or snowboarding. A celebrity since birth \u2014 the son of a groundbreaking prime minister and a flamboyant mother who struggles with bipolar disorder \u2014 Trudeau shares an engaging life story that would be worth reading whatever his aims. But it\u2019s worth noting that \u201cCommon Ground\u201d was written for a Canadian audience, so American listeners are going to have less familiarity with the politics of our northern neighbors; he assumes we are passionate about national issues like the 1992 Charlottetown Accord. You might Google. Or not.Trudeau reads an introduction to the book himself, but leaves the rest of the text to the capable Colm Feore, who gets across the author\u2019s essential likability and youthful energy. He seems, at times, not to know whether Trudeau\u2019s words should be performed as a political stump speech or an earnest sermon, but that is not surprising, since the prime minister\u2019s tone wobbles from one mode to the other, with a smidgen of TED Talk thrown in.H. Jon Benjamin is best known as a voice actor in two animated series, \u201cArcher\u201d and \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d He is, in other words, a successful purveyor of comedy. But he is also, by his own admission, a schlub. He frames this \u201cattempted memoir\u201d as a \u201cpolemic in favor of failure.\u201d He does not advise absolute, crushing failure, but appropriately lowered expectations that let us accept our limitations. \u201cThe task at hand is to bring failure into your life, accept it, and then find the right amount that suits you.\u201d With this facetious self-help framework in place, he runs through a string of hit-or-miss anecdotes about, for example, the sexual threesome he didn\u2019t actually end up taking part in, and the fajitas that he, a very bad waiter, could not deliver to tables while they were still sizzling. How hard you\u2019ll laugh at these stories will depend on whether you find things like colitis and diarrhea funny. I didn\u2019t think I would. I was wrong. I am ashamed to say that his entirely gross and unprintable recollection of driving from LAX Airport to Pasadena and unsuccessfully fighting off the effects of a colitis flare-up had me laughing out loud. Of course, it\u2019s that voice.Marcia Gay Harden, best known for her roles in films like \u201cMystic River,\u201d \u201cMiller\u2019s Crossing\u201d and \u201cPollock,\u201d opens this part-memoir, part-tribute to her mother by describing a different book the two had been collaborating on before Beverly Harden developed Alzheimer\u2019s. The book was going to be about ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging that became an enormous part of Beverly\u2019s life after her naval officer husband\u2019s tour of duty in Japan.The disease, and other tragedies in the women\u2019s lives, stole the project away. But flowers and their meaning run through this intergenerational story, organized around the seasons and the blooms they bring to mind, Marcia\u2019s childhood and her sometimes-spiky relationship with her parents. The description of her mother\u2019s drift into the limbo of Alzheimer\u2019s will be familiar to anyone dealing with a family member who has dementia, but the author sees through what has been lost. \u201cWhen all is said and done \u2014 even without memory \u2014 what still exists is love.\u201d There is beauty here, and tragedy, though the prose can be, forgive me, flowery. But as an actor, Harden uses the persuasive strength of her voice to inhabit every line.John Schwartz is a climate change reporter for The Times and the author of \u201cThis Year I Put My Financial Life in Order.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Luck Finding the Right Nursing Home? Maybe Yelp Can Help", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The New Old AgeCan you really select a quality nursing home by reading Yelp reviews?There\u2019s a nursing home the next town over from me, for instance. Nine reviewers have given the place both laudatory five-star ratings (\u201cShe has a far greater quality of life than she would have living at home\u201d) and outraged one-star complaints (\u201cThe nursing staff, RN\u2019s and CNA\u2019s are caring but overworked\u201d).Overall, the place gets three stars. It\u2019s a highly flawed measurement, of course. Nine reviewers for a 300-plus-bed facility? Over four years, in an industry known for such sky-high turnover that many of the hands-on staff have undoubtedly left since the first online critic weighed in? Reviewers can deplore the food, but can they know how often residents fall?Yet gerontologists at the University of Southern California have been looking into Yelp nursing home reviews and think they make a useful addition to the homework any prospective resident or family member needs to undertake.\u201cWe had a growing sense of how disappointing those measures have been,\u201d Dr. Rahman said of Nursing Home Compare. \u201cAfter 20 years and all the money spent to create it, it\u2019s become a marketing tool. But most people don\u2019t realize how little it measures. It\u2019s garbage in and garbage out.\u201dA primer: Nursing Home Compare made its online debut in 1998 and added the starred ranking system in 2009, after a senator complained at a congressional hearing that it was easier to shop for a washing machine than a nursing home.The site contains a trove of information about nursing homes, for those willing to click through to findings like hours of staff time per resident per day, deficiencies discovered during the most recent inspections, and how many residents have bedsores and other indications of poor care. This year, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services anticipates that the tool will be used 2.4 million times.Those on-site inspections, which Medicare requires every 12 to 15 months, constitute a key component of the ratings. But the two other categories contributing to the ratings \u2014 staffing and quality measures \u2014 are reported by the homes themselves. Critics have charged for years that the metrics are untrustworthy and prone to manipulation.\u201cI would never use it for quality measures because I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said John Schnelle, director of the Center for Quality Aging at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cI think they\u2019re distorted.\u201dDr. Schnelle, note, serves on the expert panel that advises C.M.S. on its nursing home rating system.Researchers also have discovered that even if the star ratings were accurate, they don\u2019t bear much relationship to how residents and families feel about these facilities.In Ohio, which conducts its own statewide nursing home surveys, \u201cplenty of times residents really liked a facility with a low star rating, and vice versa,\u201d said Robert Applebaum, a gerontologist at Miami University in Ohio.\u201cIt excludes the most important element,\u201d Dr. Applebaum said. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s really expensive to do. Collecting data from families and residents is no small task if you do it systematically.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not measuring the same things,\u201d Dr. Rahman said. In fact, they rather complement one another.You wouldn\u2019t want to rely too much on Yelp and other online platforms. Relatively few nursing homes, assisted living facilities and retirement communities have Yelp reviews at all. The 51 California nursing homes in Dr. Rahman\u2019s study had garnered just five reviews on average \u2014 a tiny, probably unrepresentative sample.And the great majority were polarized \u2014 either five-star reviews or one star. \u201cNursing homes inspire a lot of emotion,\u201d Dr. Rahman said.That bimodal response isn\u2019t typical in most Yelp categories, but \u201cyou\u2019d expect that to normalize over time\u201d as more users post reviews, said Luther Lowe, the company\u2019s senior vice president for public policy.For now, only 7 percent of Yelp\u2019s roughly 150 million total reviews concern health care: doctors, dentists, hospitals, acupuncturists and reiki practitioners, along with assisted living and nursing homes.Now, Yelp users see a small ProPublica box reporting each nursing home\u2019s size, how many serious deficiencies showed up on its most recent inspections, fines levied and whether the facility is so troubled that C.M.S. has suspended payments. The box also identifies \u201cspecial focus\u201d facilities flagged for serious quality problems.Nursing Home Compare is also making changes. Most importantly, C.M.S. now requires nursing homes to submit timecards quarterly, a more auditable staffing measure than annual self-reporting. \u201cA big improvement,\u201d Dr. Schnelle said.So experts advise starting your investigation online, using Yelp and other consumer reviews \u2014 and Nursing Home Compare and Nursing Home Inspect, and talking to friends and relatives who\u2019ve had recent experience with local facilities.Then, inescapably, you\u2019ve got to show up at the nursing home, walk around, talk to residents and family and staff, ask a zillion questions. Then, go back and do it again.Still, online consumer reviews can become part of the effort, and the more we post, the more useful they\u2019ll become.\u201cYou want to use as many sources as you can,\u201d Dr. Applebaum said. \u201cEverybody has a different piece of the elephant to touch.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even with his sideburns tinged gray, his face and name are instantly recognized back home.So how did Hakan Sukur end up here \u2014 wondering if he\u2019ll ever go home again, if his children will ever see his aging parents, if his country will turn back toward democracy and let him in again?\u201cIt\u2019s my country; I love my people, even though their ideas about me are distorted by controlled media,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cMaybe in the future we will go there and visit.\u201dHis English is good, and improving quickly, but when the conversation gets serious, Sukur starts a sentence in English and finishes deep, long stories in Turkish, letting an interpreter make sure the words come out right. It was his first interview since he left Turkey in 2015, nearly a year before the 2016 deadly coup that tried, and failed, to topple the authoritarian regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend and political ally.Sukur, his wife and their three children were already out of the country by the time of the coup attempt, sensing the deteriorating state of affairs there. But Sukur\u2019s political ties, fame and wealth made him a target of Erdogan\u2019s widespread distrust and accusations.Sukur had warrants out for his arrest, and his father was jailed for nearly a year. Sukur, as famous as anyone in Turkey, said his houses, businesses and bank accounts there had all been seized by Erdogan\u2019s government.Friends in Turkey secretly tell him that he could return and have it all back if only he would be publicly supportive of Erdogan and the Turkish government.\u201cI would have lived a very good life and become a minister if I had played the game accordingly, if I did what they say,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cBut now I am selling coffee.\u201dHe smiled, content on the high road, trying to be optimistic. Over meatballs, searching for a translatable metaphor, Sukur mentioned Norway, where the black winters are always followed by bright summers.\u201cThere is not always darkness,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cI believe one day the light will return. Darkness doesn\u2019t last forever.\u201dAnd in a few minutes, Turkey\u2019s most famous fugitive unfolded his body and stood from the chair, smiled and started to clear dishes from nearby tables. In Turkey, in the good years, he would have been mobbed by fans. Here, nobody paid him any attention.Sukur does not venture far from the goal. He is still tall and lean, if a bit more lumbering than he once was, but his feet retain their quickness. A pass comes. The ball dances at his toes, suddenly a blur. A defender makes a stab and leans too far one way. In an instant, the ball is in the net. Nobody cheers because there is no audience.Last week, Sukur scored 11 of his team\u2019s 15 goals. His teammates and opponents on Wednesday nights at a park near Google\u2019s headquarters are locals \u2014 tech workers, cooks, whatever \u2014 with professional soccer backgrounds and, in most cases, accents that echo a distant home.They all know who Sukur is. And was.\u201cI scored a lot of goals,\u201d Sukur said with a smile. \u201cNot just a fast goal.\u201dHe also played for Torino in Italy\u2019s Serie A, and later for Inter Milan. He played against Premier League competition with England\u2019s Blackburn Rovers. He retired from Galatasaray in 2008 as famous as anyone in Turkey, known as Kral (King) and the Bull of the Bosphorus, for the strait that cleaves Turkey in two, symbolically separating Europe and Asia.After some time as a television pundit, Sukur ventured fully into politics. He won a seat in Turkey\u2019s Parliament in 2011 as a member of the Justice and Development Party \u2014 Erdogan\u2019s party.Sukur was also a disciple of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania for nearly 20 years. Gulen\u2019s Hizmet movement has, for decades, infiltrated Turkey\u2019s institutions with a moderate strain of Islam, trying to nudge the country from the inside toward democracy, education and cultural openness more associated with Europe than much of today\u2019s Middle East.Erdogan, a former Istanbul mayor who became prime minister in 2003, was once an ally and businessman charting a course toward joining the European Union. He was credited with spurring Turkey\u2019s democratic reforms and its ascension as a global economic player.But Erdogan slowly and increasingly became wary of any who threatened his power. He took aim at the military with arrests and high-profile trials. In 2013, leery of Gulen\u2019s supporters throughout the police and judiciary, Erdogan closed a vast network of Gulen-backed preparatory schools.That was the last straw for Sukur, who quickly resigned from Erdogan\u2019s party. Tensions and hostilities quaked through Turkey as Erdogan clamped down on the areas of society he saw as threats, including the news media. Opponents were silenced and increasingly jailed. Sukur, with his popularity and influence, was among the most prominent of the new enemies.\u201cAfter I left the Parliament, I started to face administrative issues with my businesses there,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cWhatever I wanted to do, there was some problems and issues. I thought that maybe I will just take some time off, since the work was limited. Maybe I\u2019ll get peace of mind and see my opportunities.\u201dIn the fall of 2015, Sukur came to Palo Alto, where he had friends. It was close to world-famous Stanford University, the hub of tech innovation and a diverse home of people from all over the world. Sukur liked it.\u201cGood weather, good life,\u201d Sukur said.He spent a month in California, he said, while Turkey\u2019s upheaval worsened. He bought a share of the bakery and cafe that a friend was opening in 2016, secured an investor\u2019s visa and told his wife, Beyda, and their children (two daughters, now 18 and 16, and a son, age 12) to come.\u201cI want them to be free, to be independent people,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cBeing in Turkey, the children of a famous person, maybe they are treated differently. I wanted my kids to go to other countries, learn different cultures, meet different people and stand up as individuals. That was one reason we came here. And once things got worse in Turkey, we thought it was a good time.\u201dSukur knows he is vastly luckier than most people in Turkey who are unable or unwilling to speak their minds, or who have been imprisoned for doing so. Still, agreeing to be interviewed carried some anxiety, knowing his words will be parsed in Turkey and may be used against family and friends there.Sukur is mindful of his security in the United States but not overly so. He moves freely but preferred not to meet at home. He asked that the names of his children not be used in this article.\u201cLike LeBron James \u2014 he speaks about the president, the government,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to freedom. You can say anything. But in my country, I say anything, now it\u2019s a problem.\u201dSukur said recently he had a conversation with a friend, a Turkish television personality, and they agreed on how bad things were in Turkey. Then he saw an interview the friend gave to a Turkish newspaper, complimenting the government.\u201cI just talked to him the other night,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cHe said, \u2018What else can we say here?\u2019 He even said, \u2018If you keep silent, maybe you can return and they will not do anything.\u2019 \u201dThat is not possible, Sukur said.\u201cThere are thousands and thousands of people living in this situation,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so selfish to just defend my own rights, to just keep my benefits over everything else. I would lose all respect to myself.\u201dSukur and his family regularly speak to his parents through FaceTime. His father, 77, is out of jail but fighting cancer. His mother thanks God for the people who invented her phone so that she can see her son\u2019s face.\u201cLast Friday my father says to my son, \u2018I miss you,\u2019 \u201d Sukur said in English, before turning to Turkish to finish the story. \u201c \u2018I want to hug you.\u2019 And then my son started to cry, and my father was crying, and we were all crying. I know there are millions of people living in these conditions in the U.S. for a very long time, unable to go home and hug their loved ones.\u201dSukur sees himself as an immigrant, trying to build his own American dream for his family. His visa expires in 2020, he said, and he has applied for green cards for his family and himself. He is anxious about getting them. His long-term plan in the United States is not to run a cafe, but to coach and build a sports academy, like he thought he would do in Turkey. Turkish friends have considered supporting him but are nervous because of the politics a world away.\u201cAt the moment there are a couple of investors,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cBut now people are afraid to be seen with me. But I\u2019m also open to work with American investors and sportsmen. I feel like I can contribute. I have a lot of networks, in Europe and in the world. I think I can contribute a lot.\u201dLike most of Sukur\u2019s customers, not all the neighbors know who he is \u2014 or was. They see him and his family as people from Turkey, making a go of it here.\u201cOne of my neighbors came here to my bakery, and people were taking pictures with me,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cHe asked me: \u2018Why do they take pictures with you? You are not so handsome.\u2019 \u201dSukur laughed. The afternoon rush had ended, and he had time to relax.Advertisement"}

Some acknowledged the new privacy rules with large disclaimers and other information to explain what information was being gathered when a reader visits the site.\u201cWelcome to USA Today Network\u2019s European Union Experience,\u201d the news organization posted at the top of its website, explaining that the company would not collect personally identifiable information or other data commonly used to sell online advertising.Andrea Jelinek, chairwoman of the new European Data Protection Board, which will coordinate enforcement of the new law, criticized the blackout and said that companies had been given a long time to prepare. For weeks, businesses as varied as Uber, bike shops and restaurants have been sending notes to alert people to updated privacy policies as a result of the law, known as G.D.P.R.\u201cIt didn\u2019t just fall from heaven,\u201d Ms. Jelinek said in a statement. \u201cEveryone has had plenty of time to prepare.\u201dNews organizations were not alone in erecting barriers for European users. The American television broadcaster A&E Networks cut off the websites of its A&E, History and Lifetime channels. The digital advertising company Drawbridge, the social media tracker Klout and the save-it-for-later reading app Instapaper also stepped back.Europe\u2019s new privacy measures allow people to limit the information they leave behind when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Businesses must detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, and clear a higher bar to target advertising using personal information.The law had been seen as focusing on Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook and Google, but publishers and advertising companies have warned that it will harm their businesses in particular because it restricts how information is packaged and shared to sell advertising. It is common for websites to use tracking software to gather information about visitors in order to better target ads.Digital advertising is an important source of income for many news organizations, particularly as print readership and advertising fall, but policymakers in Europe argue the practices have become intrusive and ripe for abuse, with personal information shared far beyond what most people realize.\u201cAt least in the short term, it pushes publishers to these large platforms that dominate the market already,\u201d Ms. Shullman said in an interview.The law requires \u201cinformed\u201d consent from users, but Mr. Schrems, who has successfully sued Facebook in the past and leads the nonprofit group None Of Your Business, said the companies were using \u201cforced\u201d consent because users must accept a blanket privacy policy in order to continue using the service.The complaints were filed in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany, and will now be reviewed by the European data protection authorities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Profit Slips as It Spends to Expand Its Empire", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 Alibaba, the online shopping giant, is increasingly going offline. That is making some investors nervous.The Chinese company on Friday reported a fall in profit of nearly 30 percent in the latest quarter, the first such decline in a year and a half. One reason: Alibaba got a bump in profit last year from selling its shares in a social media app. Another culprit, however, was heavy spending on Alibaba\u2019s businesses outside of e-commerce, including cloud computing and brick-and-mortar retail \u2014 which the company, counterintuitively, likes to call \u201cnew retail.\u201dThey remain well above their level a year ago, however, thanks to strength in Alibaba\u2019s core online business. In the first three months of the year, total revenue increased by more than 60 percent over the same period last year, the company said Friday. It added that it expects a similar pace of sales growth for the coming financial year.Modest minimarts these are not. A typical store might feature tanks of live lobsters and crabs, a bar with beer on tap and a grill where steaks are cooked to order. Bags of groceries zip on conveyors above shoppers\u2019 heads on their way to being delivered to nearby homes.All of these could someday help turn Alibaba into the vast digital enabler of on- and offline commerce that it wishes to be. But for now, they are new and unfamiliar activities for a company that prides itself on not owning much in the way of merchandise, warehouses, delivery trucks or other physical assets.It does not help that the company\u2019s archrival in China, the internet conglomerate Tencent, is also storming into many of these same businesses, including traditional retail.\u201cI like Hema,\u201d said Tian X. Hou, founder of T.H. Data Capital, a research firm in Beijing. \u201cBut Alibaba management is going to have to do a lot of thinking, and go through a lot of trial and error.\u201dDespite investors\u2019 worries, Ms. Hou said, Alibaba executives are at least sounding more resolute about their commitment to this new, offline future for the company.\u201cThey are fully communicating with the Street: \u2018We\u2019re doing it. And we actually do not care what you think, because we think it\u2019s great, and it is the way to reach offline customers. It\u2019s the way to sell in product categories that are not sold online. It is the way for us to expand.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Settles With Russia\u2019s Gazprom Over Antitrust Charges", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Commission said on Thursday that it had reached a settlement with Gazprom, finally concluding a long-running antitrust investigation into the Russian energy giant\u2019s dominance in regional gas markets.Officials in Brussels said the company had accepted a series of concessions, but unlike with competition inquiries into other companies like Google and Intel, it declined to issue any financial penalties. That provoked criticism in countries like Poland, which say they have been squeezed by the energy company in the past, and fear that the deal between Gazprom and the European Commission does not go far enough to prevent similar behavior in the future.Still, the settlement could mark the end of a long legal tangle between the commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, and the Russian state-controlled company, which is the dominant supplier of natural gas in parts of Europe.\u201cThese obligations will significantly change the way Gazprom operates in central and Eastern Europe, to the benefit of millions of European consumers,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Gazprom has accepted measures, the commission said, to assure the free flow of gas among European member states. The aim is to clear away market barriers and contractual terms that analysts say allowed Gazprom to charge higher prices.The company, for instance, is required to remove any restrictions on customers\u2019 reselling gas across borders. It is also required to enable flows of the fuel to countries like the Baltic States, whose gas markets remain isolated from the rest of Europe. Gazprom customers will have a right to demand lower prices if what they are paying diverges from benchmark prices determined by major European trading hubs, like the TTF in the Netherlands.If the company breaks any of the rules, the commission can impose fines up to 10 percent of the company\u2019s world revenue.\u201cGazprom won\u2019t be able to play hardball,\u201d said Jonathan Stern, an analyst in the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, a research institution.That was not enough, however, to placate some Central and Eastern European countries.\u201cWe are disappointed that the yearslong proceedings have ended with no fine for Gazprom, no compensation for affected companies, and with hardly any meaningful concessions on Gazprom\u2019s side,\u201d Poland\u2019s minister for European affairs, Konrad Szymanski, said in a statement.Analysts said Ms. Vestager likely decided that it was preferable to obtain a clear set of concessions from Gazprom now, rather than impose fines that would likely trigger appeals from the company, and further years of legal battles.Still, the deal may yet serve both parties.Gazprom, as a result of the deal on Thursday, will be free to continue to do business with important customers like Germany and Italy. And the settlement will further the commission\u2019s goal of ensuring that energy prices in Europe are determined by market forces, not by big suppliers.\u201cWe believe that today\u2019s decision is the most reasonable outcome,\u201d Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom\u2019s deputy chairman, said in a statement.The agreement on Thursday comes with the gas market in a markedly different position than when the investigation began.The construction of interconnecting pipelines between countries, and the rise of gas trading particularly in Northern and Western Europe, have helped drive prices down. And Gazprom\u2019s market position has been further challenged by the prospect of increased supply from the United States, as well as a greater reliance on renewable energy sources that produce electricity, like wind and solar power.The settlement \u201cis actually recognizing what the status quo would have been in two or three years\u2019 time,\u201d Mr. Stern said.There may be other consequences, though.By accepting this de facto code of conduct, Gazprom may be helping one of its pet causes \u2014 the building of a controversial new pipeline between Russia and northern Germany called Nord Stream 2.The United States and other countries oppose the pipeline, partly on the grounds that it would tighten the company\u2019s hold on the European market. In fact, Poland\u2019s own antimonopoly office has launched proceedings against Gazprom and five European companies for financing the pipeline. The project is favored by Germany, though, on the grounds that it would provide another supply route.The settlement could set \u201cthe ground rules\u201d for getting wider acceptance for Nord Stream 2, according to Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm.\u201cIt makes it more difficult to oppose Nord Stream 2 on the basis of market dominance,\u201d he said.Marc Santora contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Hopper, Exclusive Flight Deals Sent Directly to Phones", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateWith the launch of Secret Fares, the app is promising discounted trips that travelers won\u2019t be able to find anywhere else. Users of the app have the option of receiving push notifications on their mobile devices which, according to Hopper, contain exclusive international airfare deals that could cost up to 35 percent less than rates listed on other online travel sites. \u201cI think fundamentally we\u2019re disrupting the category in the most traditional sense, we\u2019re creating something that the other guys can\u2019t do,\u201d said Fred Lalonde, the chief executive of Hopper. The rates come from the international airlines that Hopper has partnered with, including Air Canada, LATAM and Air China, and apply to roughly 60,000 routes to major destinations like Tokyo, Paris, Barcelona, Rio de Janeiro and Costa Rica. Hopper said it expects Secret Fares to mainly focus on international routes, though some domestic fares will be mixed in, and that more international airlines will join as partners later this year. \u201cFor the airline it makes a lot of sense because on Hopper people track for example their international travel up to 140 days before departure. So it gives the airlines a lot of time to give them exclusive pricing,\u201d Mr. Lalonde said. Hopper said airlines are interested in partnering with the company because the app maintains sole access to the rates, and if an airline were to offer these types of discounts on the open web, they would typically result in a fare war, as competitors can spot the discount and match the price. While beta testing Secret Fares in recent months, Hopper said feedback has been promising from both the airlines and its users.\u201cWhat the early data says is that when a user sees one of these fares they are twice as likely to purchase from us, even if they don\u2019t buy this fare. You see that, and then you price check it, because it sounds too good to be true,\u201d Mr. Lalonde said. Working to Hopper\u2019s advantage is that its users are already conditioned to respond well to push notifications, which generate 90 percent of its sales, and it has an extensive database of flight booking data that it uses to make its airfare predictions. \u201cYou need accurate forecasting for people to engage with you meaningfully on the phone.\u201d Mr. Lalonde said, adding: \u201cWe have a historic archive that has 7 trillion prices in it that we use to create our forecasting accuracy and people trust it.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple, Spurned by Others, Signs Deal With Volkswagen for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple once had grand aspirations to build its own electric self-driving car and lead the next generation of transportation. Over time, the tech giant\u2019s ambitions ran into reality.In recent years, Apple sought partnerships with the luxury carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz to develop an all-electric self-driving vehicle, according to five people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But on-again, off-again talks with those companies have ended after each rebuffed Apple\u2019s requirements to hand over control of the data and design, some of the people said.Instead, Apple has signed a deal with Volkswagen to turn some of the carmaker\u2019s new T6 Transporter vans into Apple\u2019s self-driving shuttles for employees \u2014 a project that is behind schedule and consuming nearly all of the Apple car team\u2019s attention, said three people familiar with the project.Apple\u2019s deal with Volkswagen, which has not been previously reported, and the failure of its talks with other automakers reflect the continuing travails and diminished scope of the company\u2019s four-year-old car program.Apple declined to comment.Apple originally began its car project \u2014 known internally as Titan and T172 \u2014 in 2014. At the time, Apple planned to build a single vehicle that would upend society and industry, in what would be the automotive version of the iPhone. The company set to work on an electric driverless car with a lush interior reminiscent of a lounge or living room, where passengers face one another instead of the road, according to two early employees of the project.Apple enlisted software programmers, automotive engineers, rocket scientists and the industrial-design team of Apple\u2019s design chief, Jonathan Ive, to reimagine the car. They entertained a series of unconventional concepts, including augmented-reality or holographic displays embedded in windshields and windows, a sunroof made of a special polymer that reduces heat from the sun, and windows with adjustable tints \u2014 like those on Boeing\u2019s new 787 Dreamliner jets.As recently as 2016, Apple planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build research and development labs around its Cupertino, Calif., campus, including a machine shop and labs for electric car batteries, according to interviews and documents about the plans viewed by The New York Times.Members of the car project soon found that even designing and building fundamental parts of a new car was not simple. Apple initially intended to build the car in-house, with preliminary discussions of an Apple automotive plant in the south of the United States, two former employees said. But those plans quickly shifted to finding a manufacturing partner to build \u2014 but not design \u2014 the cars.Two former employees said Apple\u2019s requests of partners gradually evolved. At first, the company asked for help building an Apple-designed vehicle. Then, it began asking potential partners to provide foundational car pieces like the chassis and wheels. Eventually, Apple requested that potential partners retrofit their own vehicles with Apple\u2019s sensors and software.In late 2015, Apple bought two Lexus S.U.V.s and hired a Virginia firm called Torc Robotics to retrofit the vehicles with sensors, a project known internally as Baja, one former employee said. The fleet has grown, and California regulators have authorized Apple to use 55 such S.U.V.s to run self-driving tests on public roads, the most of any company in the state after General Motors \u2014 but still fewer than Waymo has across six states.BMW was long Apple\u2019s top choice, given its focus on high-end but mainstream products, former employees said. Many Apple executives, including the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, also drive BMWs. Mr. Cook visited BMW as early as 2014 to discuss a partnership, and those on-and-off negotiations continued for years. But a person close to the talks said any deal now appeared dead because both Apple and BMW wanted to own the customer experience and relationship.Apple\u2019s other favored choice was Mercedes-Benz, internally code-named Bruce, according to one former employee. The two companies held partnership talks for more than a year, said three people familiar with the discussions. But those negotiations were halted because of similar disagreements over control of the experience and data, said one person close to the talks.Apple also met with Nissan in Japan, BYD Auto in China and sports-car maker McLaren in Britain, among other companies, one former employee said. None of the talks resulted in a deal because either the automaker was reluctant to give up control to Apple or Apple was holding out for a more attractive partner.Now, at a lab near Turin, Italy, run by a Volkswagen subsidiary called Italdesign, the companies plan to remake Volkswagen\u2019s T6 vans as electric self-driving shuttles, these people said.The frame, wheels and chassis of the T6 vans will remain, but Apple is replacing many components, including the dashboard and seats, said two people familiar with the project. Apple is also adding other computers, sensors and a large electric car battery, they said. The shuttles will ferry employees between two of Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley campuses, and will include a driver behind the wheel to take control if needed, as well as an operator in the passenger\u2019s seat tracking the van\u2019s performance.Executives leading Apple\u2019s car project had told Mr. Cook that the shuttle would be completed by the end of 2018, but that deadline will be missed, one former employee said. It is unclear whether Apple\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen will extend beyond the shuttle.Advertisement"}

A year later, there were warrants for his arrest for his longtime support of the Gulenist movement, believed by some to be behind the deadly, failed 2016 coup to topple the authoritarian regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former friend and political ally.No one, it seemed, knew where Mr. Sukur went. We found him hiding in plain sight near the Stanford campus, running a high-end cafe and bakery that features, among other items, a selection of Turkish food and coffees.In Turkey, during the good years, Mr. Sukur would be mobbed by fans. In Palo Alto, most customers do not recognize the man clearing dishes or bringing food and drinks to their table.A decade ago, about when Mr. Sukur retired from soccer, Mr. Erdogan was steering Turkey toward the European Union. Mr. Sukur was elected to Parliament in 2011 as part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party.But in recent years, Mr. Erdogan has clamped down on perceived threats \u2014 the military, courts, media, even the internet. Tens of thousands of journalists, academics and political opponents have been detained.Mr. Sukur left Parliament, quit the party and quietly came to California to visit friends, he said. He soon decided to build a life in the Bay Area. He bought a share of Tuts Cafe and Bakery, which was under construction in downtown Palo Alto, and his wife and their three children, now ages 12, 16 and 18, later joined him.After the coup, Mr. Sukur\u2019s houses and bank accounts in Turkey were seized, he said. His elderly father was jailed for months. Mr. Sukur presumes that he will never see his parents again. He does not know if he will ever return to Turkey.Still, he considers himself far luckier than the Turks who find themselves under the thumb of Mr. Erdogan and swept up by the political upheaval. His long-range plan is not to run bakeries, but to coach soccer and build sports academies \u2014 something he always thought he would do in Turkey, with his fame and wealth.\u201cLife is not where you live,\u201d Mr. Sukur said over a plate of Turkish meatballs. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do where you live.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cI wanted to be true to the spirit of graffiti and street art: vandalism, ambition, rebellion,\u201d Mr. Gastman said. \u201cWe hope this show continues to legitimize this art form and shines a light on the people who have dedicated and risked their lives for their passion.\u201d\u201cBeyond the Streets\u201d runs through July 6.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "And for His Next Act, Ev Williams Will Fix the Internet", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftFor years, Ev Williams was saddled with doubts.As a co-founder of Blogger and Twitter and, more recently, as the chief executive of the digital publishing platform Medium, Mr. Williams transformed the way millions of people publish and consume information online.But as his empire grew, he started to get a gnawing feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. High-quality publishers were losing out to sketchy clickbait factories. Users were spending tons of time on social media, but they weren\u2019t necessarily happier or better informed. Platforms built to empower the masses were rewarding extremists and attention seekers instead.\u201cI think I was a little bit ahead of some people in seeing the dark side,\u201d Mr. Williams told me recently.But while other tech leaders enter the confessional booth, Mr. Williams, 46, seems to be emerging with a new outlook \u2014 a blend of old-fashioned Silicon Valley optimism tempered with the caution of a tech veteran who has seen well-intended products hijacked by horrible people.Many of Mr. Williams\u2019s most recent thoughts have to do with how the digital advertising business, coupled with the rise of social media, has trapped publishers in a vicious competition for people\u2019s attention. That quest, which naturally favors loud and extreme voices, has in turn driven more media organizations to publish low-quality and sensational stories.\u201cWhen a publisher makes their money only from ads, they are incentivized to spend as little money as possible while maximizing attention,\u201d he wrote.Echoing Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony before Congress last month, Mr. Williams said he now believed that he had been too optimistic during social media\u2019s early days, and had failed to appreciate the risks of putting such powerful tools in users\u2019 hands with minimal oversight.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve seen in the past few years is that technology doesn\u2019t just accelerate and amplify human behavior,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote. \u201cIt creates feedback loops that can fundamentally change the nature of how people interact and societies move (in ways that probably none of us predicted).\u201d\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know my answer to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably right.\u201dBut if Mr. Williams isn\u2019t ready to denounce social media, he is at least muting its effects in his own life. He still uses Twitter, but he has turned off most mobile notifications, and he tries to leave his phone behind when he\u2019s with his friends or his kids. He is reading less daily news these days, he said, and more books and long-form articles.\u201cThat\u2019s been healthy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the effects of that.\u201dRight now, his focus is Medium, the digital publishing company he started in 2012. For years, Medium\u2019s strategy was to design a sleek blogging platform, attract a crowd by enticing celebrities and established writers to use it, and hope that advertising would pay the bills.Last year, after that strategy failed to catch on, Medium laid off a chunk of its staff and turned to a subscription model. Users can now pay $5 per month for access to premium stories, and writers can earn small amounts of money when their stories get positive feedback (known as \u201cclaps\u201d) from other users. (Disclosure: Several years ago, I wrote a few freelance stories on Medium, so I periodically get a few cents when someone \u201cclaps\u201d for one of my old posts.) The company has also hired human editors in order to elevate substance over fluff.\u201cThat\u2019s a very particular problem that was caused by the economic model of publishing on the internet,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem I\u2019m trying to fix.\u201dIn social media\u2019s early days, Mr. Williams said, \u201caddiction was the goal.\u201d\u201cNot in the cigarette sense \u2014 it wasn\u2019t as cynical,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was just a game, like: \u2018This is fun. How do we make it more fun and addictive?\u2019\u201dBut he is not convinced that the problems with social platforms can ever be fully solved, nor does he believe it\u2019s entirely incumbent upon tech companies to solve them. Ultimately, Mr. Williams said, it will be up to users to choose, and stick to, their own information diets.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge buffet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you eat whatever\u2019s put in front of you, you\u2019re not necessarily going to be making the best choices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.Microsoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.But while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201dSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Harvey Weinstein spent many years prosecuting his nefarious schemes against women before women ensured his prosecution.As Maria Konnikova wrote in her book, \u201cThe Confidence Game,\u201d \u201cThe whirlwind advance of technology heralds a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change\u201d when we are losing the old ways and open to the unexpected.We are easy marks for faux Nigerian princes now, when chaos rules, the American identity wobbles, and technology is transforming our lives in awe-inspiring and awful ways.Trump voters allowed themselves to believe they had a successful billionaire who knew the art of the deal when he only knew the art of the con. They bought his seductive campaign narrative, that the system was rigged and corrupt and only he could fix it. After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he\u2019s made them all suckers.Those who ignored whispers about Weinstein\u2019s grotesque behavior burned to believe that Hollywood was more than juvenile comic-book movies, that it could still make classy, sophisticated films with great roles for mature actresses like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench. And despite tales of misogyny and sickening transgressions, they wanted to buy Harvey\u2019s grand narrative, that he was a liberal feminist who could raise enough money to help elect the first woman president.High-minded elites like to scornfully say that Trump voters fell for his scam because they were ignorant and racist. But the high-minded elites fell for Holmes\u2019s scam, even the fake deep authoritative voice she put on. Her board had George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and David Boies; Rupert Murdoch and Robert Kraft were investors.Carreyrou says that Silicon Valley has always had \u201ca flimflam element\u201d and a \u201cfake it \u2019til you make it\u201d ethos, from the early \u201980s, when it was selling vaporware (hardware or software that was more of a concept or work in progress than a workable reality).\u201cWe\u2019ve been lionizing and revering these young tech entrepreneurs, treating them not just like princes and princesses but like heroes and icons,\u201d Carreyrou says. \u201cNow that there\u2019s a backlash to Silicon Valley, it will be interesting to see if we reconsider this view that just because you made a lot of money doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re a role model for boys and girls.\u201d\u201cAnytime people want to contact each other or have an awareness of each other, it can only be when it\u2019s financed by a third party who wants to manipulate us, to change us in some way or affect how we vote or what we buy,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the old days, to be in that unusual situation, you had to be in a cult or a volunteer in an experiment in a psychology building or be in an abusive relationship or at a bogus real estate seminar.\u201cBut now you just need to sign onto Facebook to find yourself in a behavior modification loop, which is the con. And this may destroy our civilization and even our species.\u201dLanier worries, now that tech has lost its halo, that there is nothing optimistic to replace it.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in government,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are pissed at media.

{"Headline": "Nordstrom Men: Choose Your Own Adventure", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical shopperFrom the street, you can\u2019t sense the war taking place inside the new Nordstrom Men\u2019s Store in Manhattan, which takes up three floors in a glossy building just south of Columbus Circle.And even when you step inside and come face to face with a charming, neon-colored installation that displays radical clothes from Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Gosha Rubchinskiy, the sorts of garments not usually found on 57th and Broadway, you may not gather that what you\u2019re seeing is a kind of mask, a Kabuki of avant-gardism.Take time to walk the entirety of the store, though, and you\u2019ll get whiplash. Just a few feet separate the chunky Balenciaga Triple S sneakers ($895) from the earth-tone Rainbow flip-flops ($54) favored by Malibu layabouts. A rack of piercingly bright swimsuits \u2014 say, the pink Peter Millar one covered in fish ($85) \u2014 is merely a tiny splash away from a mature black-and-blue MCM weekend bag ($1,170). But that\u2019s not the same as different ideologies. This new Nordstrom, the first in New York City that\u2019s not a Nordstrom Rack discount store, aims to be all things to one person but instead is more one thing to many different kinds of people.Perhaps at no other store in New York is there such a disorienting narrative: an intersection of brands I swoon over (Deveaux, Bedwin & the Heartbreakers), brands I accept as part of a balanced wardrobe (Norse Projects, Patagonia), brands I had to Google (Rodd & Gunn, G/Fore), brands I associate with discount stores but still have affection for (check out the joltingly colorful socks by Bugatchi Uomo).This being an actual physical store, with inventory that hasn\u2019t been shared with or gobbled up by eager internet buyers, you can find some especially coveted sneakers. J.W. Anderson\u2019s Converse collaboration and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 pink Air Max 180s. Those Balenciaga Triple S\u2019s and also the hard-to-find Dior Homme runners. If you were looking to fill in a hole in your collection, as I was, without navigating the traumatizing online resale ecosystem, you could just walk right in, try a pair on and walk out with it. It felt radical.Broadly speaking, though, the store\u2019s luxury offerings (Balenciaga, Christian Louboutin) aren\u2019t particularly remarkable, especially given the competition. Bergdorf is a few blocks to the east, Barneys a couple more. But those are stores for the dedicated and the knowledgeable; they require buy-in and a certain level of pre-existing confidence. You\u2019re probably pretty well dressed, and well capitalized, before you walk in.The barrier to entry at the Nordstrom Men\u2019s Store is lower. The supposition is that someone casually fingering a strategically bland Theory oxford shirt one minute may then get entranced by the flamboyant prints beaming out of the Valentino section.One can hope! Uniting all of these clothes under one roof is a byproduct of the broadening of the audience for high-end men\u2019s fashion and espouses a belief that the slope from casual to enthusiastic shopper is slippery (with the wallet to match).During a couple of midweek visits I made, one in the afternoon and one in the evening, the number of men shopping alone, especially for a store that had been open only a few weeks, was rather astonishing. Some carried briefcases, some looked jobless (the by-choice kind). One guy in a black and gray digital camouflage suit told a saleswoman he was looking for \u201cstyle inspo.\u201d She seemed keen to help, or at least listen. That was true throughout the store: I was attended to and asked after at a level I associate with the most genteel corners of the South.This was especially impressive because the store has a lot of densely packed ground to cover: The person who inquired whether I wanted to try the baby blue Corneliani sport coat with zip-in trompe l\u2019oeil vest ($1,395) was different from the person who asked if I needed help navigating the Juun.J rack of distended tops, who was different from the person who gamely tried to track down a Deveaux silk resort shirt in my size, to no avail. And that was only on one-third of the top floor.There is a cafe in the basement, a barber chair on the main floor. In addition to clothes, fragrances and electronic products are sold. The store is a mall unto itself. In that context, that ground-floor installation, designed by Olivia Kim of Nordstrom and the artist Marc Hundley, with an accompanying zine, feels like a kiosk designed to catch the eye \u2014 a diversion or a destination, depending on your mood. Placing these clothes near the main entrance, including the pink glitter shorts James Harden wears in the current issue of GQ ($1,723), ends up as an act of confidence, not alienation. If you want to push beyond that to the Shinola watches, the Saturdays NYC T-shirts, the Nike cargo pants, you\u2019re welcome to. But maybe you shouldn\u2019t.Advertisement"}
