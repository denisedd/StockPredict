{"Headline": "Leslie Moonves and Shari Redstone Dig In for a Long Legal War at CBS", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hostilities between two prominent media companies are unlikely to cool off any time soon.The legal maneuver was the latest in a series of steps taken by CBS to prevent Ms. Redstone, the president of National Amusements, which acquired CBS in 2000, from merging the company with Viacom, its corporate sibling.CBS amended the lawsuit in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.The amended suit also accuses Ms. Redstone of trying to \u201ccompel\u201d the merger of CBS and Viacom, which it described as \u201cnot in the best interests of CBS and its stockholders.\u201d While favoring a merger, Ms. Redstone has maintained that she has no intention of forcing one.The daughter of the ailing entertainment mogul Sumner M. Redstone, Ms. Redstone has been seeking a merger of CBS and Viacom since 2016. The two companies were one and the same, within the Redstones\u2019 company, between 2000 and 2005, when National Amusements split them apart. In recent months, CBS has resisted a reunification.On the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The showdown took place last Thursday on the 35th floor of the CBS Building, known as Black Rock, in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Moonves and Ms. Redstone, onetime allies, were both present as the board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power. But that result fell shy of 90 percent.Afterward, both sides declared victory, meaning that they are effectively deadlocked.Was the vote valid? Was National Amusements within its rights to change the CBS bylaws? Or, as the amended lawsuit filed by CBS suggests, should the CBS board operate independently of its main shareholder? These are questions for the Delaware Court chancellor to settle in the weeks or months ahead.\u201cNational Amusements exercised its legal right to amend CBS\u2019s bylaws, and this change was effective immediately,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident the court will uphold National Amusements\u2019 action.\u201dAt stake is whether Mr. Moonves will remain in power at the company where he has held significant sway for two decades.Viacom, the beleaguered media company that owns Paramount and cable networks like Comedy Central and MTV, has been in search of a turnaround in recent years. CBS, the owner of Showtime, Simon & Schuster and the broadcast network that is home to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cSurvivor,\u201d has had a run of success since it was split from Viacom in 2005.The two companies are operating as relatively small shops while many others are trying to bulk up to compete with upstart digital rivals like Netflix and Facebook.Analysts are divided over what they see as the likely outcome. The firm Bernstein Research said last week that there was a \u201cnear-zero chance\u201d that CBS would be forced to merge with Viacom.\u201cBy the way, if there is a company out there who is thinking about making a bid for CBS, now would be the perfect time to do so,\u201d the firm said in a statement to investors. \u201cThe stock price is low, and the controlling shareholder would have a particularly hard time rejecting a strong offer.\u201dThe Redstones are the controlling shareholders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201dThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201dIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201dWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201dWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201dPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.Advertisement"}

In place of mom\u2019s dive bar and low-rent apartments, the developer sees pricey condos. Who cares if her tenants, most of them undocumented, end up on the street? Not the developer, who, like Emma, is Mexican-American, and grew up in the neighborhood. \u201cLook at us, and look at them,\u201d he tells Emma. \u201cWe took off the nopal from our foreheads.\u201d\u201cNopal en la frente [literally, cactus on your forehead] is the most racist thing you can say,\u201d said Tanya Saracho, the show\u2019s creator and showrunner. \u201cHe\u2019s saying those people are indigenous, and we\u2019re closer to white.\u201d\u201dVida\u201d grew out of an assignment in early 2016, when she was tasked by Starz to develop a series about \u201cchipsters\u201d \u2014 a term for Chicano hipsters which can either be endearing or biting, depending on who\u2019s saying it \u2014 and the topic of gentefication (see previous note on \u201cchipsters\u201d).There was a lot to consider, Ms. Saracho said. Do Mexican Americans who return to their old neighborhoods still have a right to dictate what goes on there? Does wanting less crime and better roads automatically make you a chipster? Can one be simultaneously Latinx and vegan?\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have to see all the sides.\u201d\u201cThe hipster in TV narratives tend to be white, even though hipsters obviously come in all ethnicities,\u201d said Daniel Makagon, a communication studies professor at DePaul who has written extensively about gentrification and the media. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen many shows where the gentrifiers are minorities, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if that starts to become more of a narrative.\u201dOne major issue in \u201cVida\u201d is the impact that gentrification \u2014 or, in this case, gentefication \u2014 has on the locals. Chelsea Rendon plays Marisol, a fearless anti-gentrification vlogger and community activist who calls out injustice, hypocrisy or just plain bouginess wherever she sees it. For the role, Ms. Rendon drew from her own experiences growing up in East L.A.\u201cI was like, how would I react if El Mercadito was gone and they put up a Walmart?,\u201d she said. \u201cOr if Tamales Liliana\u2019s wasn\u2019t there anymore, and they put up a Starbucks. If those places were gone, it would be heartbreaking.\u201dIndeed, in many ways, Boyle Heights has become a character in the series, and Ms. Saracho has spoken with residents and community groups in the effort to get things right. She\u2019s also tackled several issues besides gentefication that haven\u2019t historically gotten a lot of play on series TV, including homophobia in the Mexican-American community and how Latinos can\u2019t tell Asians apart (the signage for mom\u2019s dive bar, \u201cLa Chinita,\u201d has a geisha on it).Even so, Ms. Saracho said, the series isn\u2019t a polemic. There are sisterly squabbles and hilarious trash talk, much of it in Spanish, as well as moments of extreme tenderness and jerks being jerks. \u201cThe show is about gentefication, but it shouldn\u2019t hit you over the head,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about the girls.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With \u2018The Weekly,\u2019 The New York Times Gets Serious About TV", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times is going Hollywood.The cable channel FX announced on Wednesday that it would be making a new weekly documentary series centered on stories that appear in The Times and the journalists who report them. The show, which will be called \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d builds on the success of the podcast \u201cThe Daily,\u201d which began last year and generally examines a story a day from the Times newsroom.FX has given \u201cThe Weekly\u201d a 30-week commitment and a Sunday night time slot. The show, at 30 minutes per episode, is expected to debut later this year, possibly in time for the midterm elections. Hulu has the rights to stream the new series, giving the program a dedicated streaming platform the day after it premieres on cable.Unlike \u201cThe Daily,\u201d which is hosted by Michael Barbaro, the television version will not have a dedicated host, FX said. But in keeping with the podcast\u2019s format, \u201cThe Weekly\u201d will follow a reporter or team of journalists as a Times story makes its way toward publication.Times leaders have been sending signals that this would be the year it would be aggressive in entering the crowded television space.\u201cWe think this could be a way both of directly generating revenue but also again of getting Times journalism in front of new audiences and further building the reputation and the influence of The New York Times,\u201d the Times Company chief executive, Mark Thompson, said on a quarterly earnings call last week.The Times receives most of its revenue from subscriptions, and has said in recent years that it is making a concerted effort to get its product in front as many potential subscribers as possible.In a statement, Meredith Kopit Levien, the chief operating officer of the Times Company, said: \u201cOur ambition with \u2018The Weekly\u2019 is to bring the authority and excellence of New York Times journalism to the largest possible television audience. Partnering with FX and Hulu together for distribution represents an entirely new and uniquely powerful way do just that.\u201dIn a memo to the staff, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, and Joseph Kahn, the newspaper\u2019s managing editor, said that the show \u201crepresents one of our big bets of the year.\u201d\u201cWith it,\u201d they added, \u201cwe expect to reach entirely new audiences, tap new revenue streams and gain entry into new parts of people\u2019s lives beyond the time reserved for reading news \u2014 all of which should give our journalism even greater impact.\u201dThe three Times people who worked on developing \u201cThe Weekly\u201d and finding distribution partners for it were Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor; Jake Silverstein, the editor in chief of the Times Magazine; and Stephanie Preiss, the director of strategy and business development.The planned series also breaks ground for FX, a cable network known for critically acclaimed scripted shows like \u201cThe Americans\u201d and \u201cAtlanta\u201d: It is the network\u2019s first foray into unscripted content in some time. Rivals like Showtime, Netflix and HBO have been making documentary series for years.FX, like nearly every other cable channel in the streaming and cord-cutting era, has had declining ratings in recent years, but is still available in 90 million homes. Hulu announced last week that it now has more than 20 million subscribers.Advertisement"}

With YouTube, you get what you\u2019re willing to sit through a pre-roll ad for. That\u2019s a fundamental reason the two are the alpha and omega of online streaming: neatly organized television-length (and TV-quality) programs versus an endless babel of mostly short bursts of video.On the head-to-head battlefield of TV-scale original programming, YouTube is starting from very far behind, as anyone would against Netflix and its estimated 700 exclusive series and movies this year. Red\u2019s active roster of original series, hard to pin down, is in the low double digits.It\u2019s a scrappy, entertaining little bunch of shows, though, with an underdog\u2019s energy and signs of an appealingly high-low, genre-smart curatorial sensibility. (It\u2019s way too soon to tell.) \u201cStep Up: High Water\u201d is a surprisingly mature and textured extension of the dance-movie franchise, \u201cFoursome\u201d an amusing iteration of the standard AwesomenessTV teenage sex comedy. Scheduled for this summer is a superpowered-teenager action show, \u201cImpulse,\u201d with Doug Liman (\u201cSuits,\u201d the \u201cBourne\u201d films), as executive producer.But \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d a clever blend of 1980s nostalgia and contemporary family drama, more than holds its own. Spearheaded by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg (writers and directors of the \u201cHarold & Kumar\u201d movies) and Josh Heald (a writer of \u201cHot Tub Time Machine\u201d movies), it finds inventive ways to incorporate the look, sound (Foreigner!) and spirit of the original without descending into kitsch or brainless hommage.The show\u2019s other idea, which works better than you\u2019d expect, is to make the story a variation on and critique of the MAGA narrative, with Johnny having aged into a Clint Eastwood character \u2014 disgruntled, underemployed, reflexively racist, quietly seething in the face of change. Daniel, meanwhile, has become a glib huckster who yells \u201cBanzai!\u201d in commercials for his chain of auto dealerships.The show knows better than to push that idea too hard \u2014 it\u2019s a framework for a familiar light drama, or serious comedy, about outsiders and cool kids that finds more room than usual for its adult characters. Mr. Zabka, who carries most of the dramatic weight, and Mr. Macchio are capable and comforting to watch. \u201cCobra Kai\u201d is about as guilt-free as nostalgia wallows get.Netflix has its own reboots and animated comedies, of course. A lot of them. If you\u2019re already paying for those, \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d \u201cDallas & Robo\u201d and the handful of other YouTube originals may not, at this point, merit a second subscription.

Ad money is drying up.Who\u2019s ready to party?With the annual upfront presentations beginning Monday, the broadcast networks will once again make their pitch to advertisers why they still matter in the era of Netflix and Hulu.The 2017-18 TV season gave hints about the answers to some of those questions. Here\u2019s a look at what it showed:Well, the little guy is still standing.\u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d was one of five rookie shows that smashed into this year\u2019s top-10-rated entertainment shows. The CBS series, a prequel to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d averaged 16.5 million viewers, finishing just a hair behind the CBS stalwart \u201cNCIS.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s ABC\u2019s \u201cRoseanne.\u201d The series will have broadcast just nine episodes by the time the season ends next week, but it\u2019s in a horse race with \u201cThis Is Us\u201d for being the top-rated entertainment show. Not a bad return after two decades off.But in somewhat of a surprise, Mr. Fallon has kept his narrow lead among 18-to-49-year-olds. It is a mere 80,000 viewers, but that number has held steady for roughly seven months, suggesting that his audience is staying put. And last week, Mr. Fallon saw his biggest win among adults under 50 since March, raising the question of if Mr. Colbert will ever be able to top him in that demographic.At 12:30 a.m., meanwhile, Seth Meyers and James Corden have almost precisely the same numbers they did a year ago. But although Mr. Corden follows Mr. Colbert and his larger audience, NBC\u2019s Mr. Meyers remains No. 1 at that hour.\u201cThis Is Us\u201d had no reason to worry.The NBC weepie had an impressive 14 percent growth in viewers in its second season, when it finally answered what exactly happened to Jack.\u201cThe Bachelor\u201d was the only series that had a bump in the ratings last season. But it went into reverse this year. Roughly a quarter of adults under 50 abandoned the show after the lead character, Arie Luyendyk Jr., was largely seen as a dud. \u201cDesignated Survivor,\u201d an ambitious ABC drama starring Kiefer Sutherland, lost a whopping 43 percent of its audience and was canceled this month.Shonda Rhimes\u2019s final offers at ABC may be struggling \u2014 her new court drama, \u201cFor The People\u201d has underwhelmed, despite being renewed for a second season \u2014 but \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is, 14 seasons deep, still a major hit, averaging better than 11 million viewers a week.And perhaps most surprising: Dick Wolf\u2019s suite of shows \u2014 \u201cLaw & Order: SVU,\u201d \u201cChicago Fire,\u201d \u201cChicago Med\u201d and \u201cChicago P.D.\u201d \u2014 all held steady.The Netflix effect is real.Even though networks have made a serious effort to avoid Netflix and instead sell their back libraries to Hulu in recent years \u2014 several media companies have an ownership stake in the smaller streaming service \u2014 there\u2019s an argument to be made against that.One season after the CW\u2019s slick-and-sexy young adult drama \u201cRiverdale\u201d appeared on Netflix, viewers flocked to its second season on the network.Though the series still has a relatively small audience \u2014 2.5 million viewers, and a relatively low 1.0 rating among 18-to-49-year-olds \u2014 it\u2019s one of the youngest in TV, with a median viewer age of 37. The Netflix boost was enough for the show to achieve an eye-opening 42 percent growth in viewers.The trend line for broadcast networks is not great in an on-demand world. But there is one thing they can still hold over everyone\u2019s head: big events, available to viewers without a cable or streaming subscription.Consider a three-day stretch in March.Just a couple of days later, \u201cRoseanne\u201d had its premiere to jaw-dropping numbers. With seven days of delayed viewing factored in, the premiere drew more than 25 million viewers, the biggest scripted TV event in years.Both moments provided some relief \u2014 and a much-needed reminder \u2014 to network executives that they still have some fight left.At least for now.Advertisement"}

Yes, the theater scene here was budding, but film and television opportunities were few and far between.Fast forward a decade, and Ms. Deadwyler is juggling roles and auditions for both stage and screen, while developing her passion projects. Like many of her fellow performers, she can thank the huge increase in movie and television filming in Georgia.\u201cAtlanta\u2019s film and television swell has enabled me to practice my craft in multiple mediums right at home,\u201d said Ms. Deadwyler, who also has appeared in \u201cGreenleaf\u201d on the Oprah Winfrey Network.It was practically impossible to make a full-time living as an actor in Atlanta, and performers often had to travel to New York for regional theater, television and film auditions. But in 2008, everything changed. The governor signed a new tax law, allowing for up to 30 percent of Georgia production spending to be transferred into tax credits.Everything from recording a film score to catering on a set can qualify for a credit, with no dollar amount limit, as long as a Georgia vendor is used. Yellow production signs started appearing all over the city, and beloved theater actors started appearing on the silver screen.\u201cMy OGs tell me stories of the days you had to drive two-plus hours for an audition every time, callbacks included,\u201d Ms. Deadwyler said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m able to take my son to school, go prep for my audition, do the audition and pick him up to be home to make dinner.\u201dAccording to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, the film and television industry made a $9.5 billion impact on the state in fiscal year 2017, making the state the top filming location in the world.Some 40 major movies and network television shows are now shooting in the state, and countless more independent projects. Among those recently filmed: \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and, of course, the Emmy-winning FX comedy \u201cAtlanta.\u201dThe flood started with a trickle, thanks to movies like \u201cDrumline\u201d and \u201cATL,\u201d which showcased the city\u2019s cultural landscape. The emergence of Tyler Perry Studios in 2008 marked a colossal turning point. The original studio was located in southwest Atlanta; in 2016 Mr. Perry completed construction on a facility that sits on more than 300 acres of an old army base near the airport. Mr. Perry has three shows on the Oprah Winfrey Network right now; and in the past year, 33 different productions have filmed at the studios.As opportunities expanded, actors in surrounding states took notice.Last year, she appeared on five episodes of \u201cOzark,\u201d the Netflix series with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney. She recently filmed \u201cLore\u201d for Amazon Prime, and this spring is working on two independent films.She also found time to star as Viola (the Gwyneth Paltrow role) in Alliance Theater\u2019s stage version of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d\u201cNo one can earn their living doing theater in Atlanta, because there\u2019s not enough work,\u201d Ms. Lind said bluntly. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to make a living as an actor, you have to be on camera.\u201d\u201cI think I got here at just the right time,\u201d she added. \u201cThree or four years ago, all of the agencies in town were swamped and couldn\u2019t keep up, but they\u2019re figuring it out now.\u201d\u201cI thought that my talent only translated in Atlanta, but film and television has shown me that I can do this anywhere,\u201d said Mr. King. \u201cIt\u2019s really invigorating.\u201dAlthough there are two dozen professional theater companies in metropolitan Atlanta, the 520 union members in the Atlanta area average 5.6 weeks of stage work per year. That leaves a lot of room for work in non-Equity stage productions, as well as film, television, commercials and industrials.Some actors try to balance it all by negotiating a \u201chard out\u201d that allows them to be released from the set of a TV shoot at a certain time.\u201cI was on set for 12 hours filming that day, left at 5:30 p.m., picked up some Chick-fil-A, cleared my head and did opening night of \u2018Crossing Delancey,\u2019\u201d he recalled.Even with the long hours, Mr. Benator, like most actors, enjoys the variety.\u201cIf I was doing a lot of TV, I\u2019d want to do a play and if I was doing a lot of theater, I\u2019d want to do film and TV,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like to do good writing.\u201dMs. Deadwyler is optimistic as well.\u201cI can do theater, film and TV in this city,\u201d she said. \u201cI can do indie, experimental and commercial film projects in this city. Atlanta has its limitations and challenges. However, with work and ingenuity, an artist can craft a creative life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, locals and visitors who aren\u2019t afraid to venture into un-air-conditioned areas will find a glut of free music performed in all corners of the city. A pioneer in bringing street dance to the concert stage, the choreographer Rennie Harris returns to the New Victory Theater with \u201cFunkedified,\u201d a new production exploring funk music as the foundation of hip-hop and as a force in his creative life. Mr. Harris, who grew up in Philadelphia, credits the dancer Don Campbell \u2014 as seen on \u201cSoul Train\u201d in the early 1970s \u2014 with piquing his interest in dance as a child.

Working with a razor blade and mostly found materials in Kinshasa, the capital of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, the artist Bodys Isek Kingelez (1948-2015) made elaborately ordered, irresistibly colored tabletop architectural fantasias.

A troupe from the more recent past, though also tinged with nostalgia, would soon take the stage: the cast of the cult TV show \u201cSCTV.\u201dThe afternoon of clips and conversation, hosted by the \u201cSCTV\u201d fan Jimmy Kimmel, will be part of a Netflix comedy special directed by Martin Scorsese, set for release in 2019. As a sellout crowd of 1,300 pushed by, the 40-year-old friends Jeff Maus and Eric Makila stood finishing their beers, having a fanboy moment about the show, which debuted more than 40 years ago.\u201cThis is hometown love,\u201d Mr. Makila said.\u201cI gave a speech to my class on \u2018SCTV\u2019 in Grade 3,\u201d said Mr. Maus, who grew up in nearby Paris, Ontario. \u201cIt was the only hip Canadian show we could lay our hands on back then.\u201dWell, \u201cThe Beachcombers\u201d \u2014 a show about a log salvager named Nick who looks for loose logs and also solves crimes on the coast of British Columbia \u2014 did start airing on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1972, but point taken. Clearly, there was room for another kind of TV in Canada when \u201cSCTV\u201d sprang from the Toronto outpost of Chicago\u2019s Second City improv club in 1976. Iterations bounced among broadcasters (first at Global in Toronto, then to CBC, NBC and Cinemax), critically adored and commercially ignored, until \u201cSCTV\u201d finally ended in 1984.Nonetheless, the show secured comedy touchstone status not just for the impressive number of stars it graduated \u2014 including John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O\u2019Hara \u2014 but because it was the weird Canadian cousin to the slicker \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d at a moment when sketch was becoming the strongest currency in comedy. The \u201cSCTV\u201d brand was much higher concept than that of \u201cS.N.L.\u201d The conceit was that the sketches were \u201cshows\u201d for a low-rent TV station set in the fictional town of Melonville, and traded in more absurdist, character-driven, pop-savvy satire.On stage, the group remained true to Canadian stereotypes (although Ms. Martin and Mr. Flaherty were born in the United States): unflaggingly polite, sharing the air and responding more enthusiastically to \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite character that someone else played?\u201d than \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite character that you played?\u201dMr. Moranis, in a bright yellow tie, graciously ensured that the hair, makeup and wardrobe people who worked on the show were pointed out in the crowd and acknowledged by name. Both Ms. Martin and Ms. O\u2019Hara brought a dash of movie stardom, high-heeled and glamorous, while their male castmates in suits and ties could have been a row of sixtysomething bankers. At one point, apropos of nothing, Ms. O\u2019Hara removed an annoying cushion from behind her back and flung it behind her, to Mr. Short\u2019s delight.Cutting the joy slightly were the much-noted absences of two alumni. Harold Ramis, the director and co-writer of \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d was the show\u2019s first head writer, for his experience selling jokes to Playboy magazine, Mr. Levy pointed out. Mr. Ramis left the show to write \u201cAnimal House.\u201d He died in 2014.Still, Netflix appears to believe the show will draw new fans. \u201cThis is a dream project,\u201d Lisa Nishimura, the vice president for original documentary and comedy programming, said via email. \u201c\u2018SCTV\u2019 is one of the most influential comedy series of all time.\u201dThe show\u2019s enduring mythos is largely drama-free. \u201cSCTV\u201d was always the underwatched underdog, highly collaborative show that ducked most of the debauchery and cutthroat competition that defined \u201cS.N.L.\u201d Both Mr. Levy and Mr. Short described it as the creative highlight of their careers.As the three-plus hours wound down, and the crowd readied itself to bookend the standing ovation, Mr. Flaherty looked out and said he\u2019d been unsure about the reunion at first, wondering: \u201cDoes anybody remember the show?

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Fourth Estate\u2019 Is a Competent but Incomplete Peek Inside The Times", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Fourth Estate,\u201d which chronicles 16 months in the life of The New York Times, is reasonably competent, but it\u2019s also superficial and oblivious a little more often than one might like. That said, as is the case with the Gray Lady, it\u2019s a good thing that \u201cThe Fourth Estate\u201d exists at all. When both the film and the publication are on their A-game, they\u2019re quite good \u2014 and occasionally gripping.The documentary, which debuts Sunday on Showtime, also has a lot in common with bloated Netflix dramas, padded and too easily distracted, especially in the first two of its four installments. (The premiere runs 87 minutes, and other segments are about an hour.) It has an irritating habit of darting toward an interesting story and then pivoting away again too quickly. Much of the documentary, which opens on the day Donald J. Trump was inaugurated into office, plods along like a dutiful recap of a show we watched not too long ago.The director Liz Garbus \u2014 a veteran documentary filmmaker who received an Oscar nomination for her 2015 film \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d \u2014 diligently shows what it\u2019s like to work inside a pressure-filled workplace that has no \u201coff\u201d switch. In doing so, she humanizes names like Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt, familiar from Twitter and blockbuster stories. It\u2019s odd, though, that so little conflict is on display; it comes as a jarring shock when a reporter talks about how he and some valued colleagues are \u201cat each other\u2019s throats\u201d now and then.It\u2019s hard to delve all that deeply into an institution filled with people who appear to be hyperaware of the scrutiny directed at their workplace, wary of the idea of becoming the story themselves. Add in another distancing factor \u2014 a defensive mind-set that often frames critiques of the publication as exercises undertaken in bad faith \u2014 and \u201cThe Fourth Estate\u201d at times comes off as a portrait of different kinds of awkwardness.The final episode, however, fulfills what was most likely part of the mission statement, as least as far as Times leadership was concerned: to be more accountable and even transparent to The Times\u2019s partisans and critics.In an era in which sexual harassment and other abuses of power have become high-profile stories \u2014 in large part due to reporting by The Times \u2014 \u201cit was not surprising that, you know, The Times would be in somebody\u2019s sights,\u201d the Washington bureau chief, Elisabeth Bumiller, says in an interview. She\u2019s referring to a November account in Vox of misconduct by the former White House reporter Glenn Thrush, who was suspended for two months after a Times investigation and then reassigned.I make every allowance for the fact that the situation involving Mr. Thrush was excruciating and distracting on many levels. But to characterize the revelations about him as an effort to wound the institution, rather than as a difficult but necessary truth shared in a way that was painful to those participating in that reporting, is unfortunate.Still, it\u2019s surprising and laudable that Times management allowed the crews managed by Ms. Garbus, who directs or co-directs every episode, to follow the Thrush situation so closely. It\u2019s by far the most substantial narrative in the documentary, which also follows the nonstop work lives of the Washington bureau staff, the departure of many White House aides, the publication of groundbreaking Times articles about James Comey and Robert Mueller and various Trump-related rallies, battles and investigations.At one point, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, tells the Washington bureau, via a conference call, that Mr. Thrush would be reassigned, as \u201cpunishment.\u201d An unidentified male voice on a speakerphone asks a simple question: Why wasn\u2019t Thrush fired? I won\u2019t spoil what happens next, but I will note that the women on the call didn\u2019t ask that question. Given that Ms. Bumiller herself later refers to pockets of discontent surrounding this resolution, one has to wonder, were the women on that call satisfied by that decision \u2014 or did they worry that they couldn\u2019t question it without ruffling the feathers of the powers that be?Presumably there are text chains, Slack groups and email threads about this topic and many others that affect The Times, but Ms. Garbus didn\u2019t have access to those channels. That is the biggest flaw of \u201cThe Fourth Estate\u201d: It leaves out too much. Ms. Garbus gives little screen time to the middle of the Times organization, those editors who help the bosses determine the tone, focus and framing of news coverage.In interviews that are too glancing to be truly illuminating, a few reporters are asked about the paper\u2019s coverage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, and about the Oct. 31, 2016, article that (depending on where you stand) minimized a connection between Russia and President Trump. The answers Ms. Garbus gets will no doubt fuel more conversations among the Times-obsessed.But not talking to higher-ups about gaps, blind spots and stumbles comes off as a missed opportunity. The things that really aggravate the paper\u2019s critics often have to do with emphasis, omissions and the sheer tonnage of certain kinds of coverage. There\u2019s almost no substantive examination of those topics, which may frustrate even fans of The Times, many of whom (present company included) simply want it to be even better than it already is. Like a reporter who came back with only 60 percent of a really good story, \u201cThe Fourth Estate\u201d somehow feels like it needed more legwork to truly shine.Early on, Mr. Baquet does note that both the left and the right \u201cdon\u2019t want to hear what the other side has to say,\u201d and both sides \u2014 a migraine-inducing phrase that actually appears in the documentary\u2019s opening credits \u2014 \u201care looking for places we fail.\u201dThe New York Times is not failing, of course. But \u201cThe Fourth Estate\u201d looks a lot like the start of a process \u2014 one that involves grappling with the public\u2019s desire to know how its news is gathered and molded, and contending deeply with some of the ways in which traditional models of journalism have let us down. It\u2019s an uneven, occasionally fascinating beginning, and it should by no means be the end.An earlier version of this review misstated the date of an article about a connection between Russia and President Trump. It was published Oct. 31, 2016, not Oct. 31, 2017.Maureen Ryan has worked as the chief TV critic at Variety, HuffPost and The Chicago Tribune.Advertisement"}

It was never clear whether Till actually whistled, but the truth mattered little: Four days later, he was kidnapped from his great-uncle\u2019s home, beaten, tortured and shot. His body was then dumped in the Tallahatchie River.Two men were arrested \u2014 Roy Bryant, Ms. Donham\u2019s husband, and his half brother, J.W. Milam \u2014 but they were acquitted of murder by an all-white jury. Later, both men admitted to the crime in an interview with Look Magazine, but could not be retried because of the law\u2019s double-jeopardy protections.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a conceptual overlap between Trayvon, Black Lives Matter and Emmett Till, but a very personal overlap,\u201d said Dave Tell, a professor at the University of Kansas who has studied Till extensively. \u201cThe Till family is very close to the family of Trayvon Martin. They see Emmett Till as the protohistory of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re at a moment right now where more are talking about Emmett Till than has been the case in 60-plus years.\u201dEric Holder, who was attorney general when a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., fatally shot Michael Brown in 2014, compared Mr. Brown\u2019s death to Till\u2019s at an event in Washington where a tree was planted in Till\u2019s memory.\u201cI think back to Emmett Till\u2019s mom actually, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America,\u201d Mr. James said.\u201cEmmett Till is just packed all in our heads,\u201d said Clenora Hudson-Weems, a professor at the University of Missouri and the author of \u201cEmmett Till: The Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t get rid of it. It\u2019s in our heads. It has indelibly impacted our American culture.\u201dBut for the Till family, his death is more than just a cultural landmark.\u201cI just hope that when people speak about Emmett in certain contexts, they need to remember that there are people who are still alive in my family that suffered and survived that horrific incident,\u201d his cousin, Ms. Gordon-Taylor, said. \u201cThey were in the house when that happened \u2014 I still have loved ones who relive that in their minds.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is also the continuation of a corporate marketing campaign for a soda company.An unusual integration of branded content and film, the movie is built around the N.B.A. star Kyrie Irving and is based entirely on a series of Pepsi commercials that went viral beginning in 2012. A heavily made-up Mr. Irving plays Uncle Drew, a septuagenarian driven to show up younger basketball players on the playground.

The collaboration went well and Pepsi signed him to a deal. Afterward, Pepsi\u2019s agency partner, Davie Brown Entertainment, and Mr. Irving conceived the idea of a geriatric character who would show young players what real basketball looked like. Pepsi executives were intrigued. They wanted to shift away from traditional advertising and toward storytelling.With Mr. Irving\u2019s character, Pepsi hopes to extend its brand while entertaining viewers at the same time.\u201cEveryone has so many marketing methods coming at them so often that it\u2019s tough to break through,\u201d said Lou Arbetter, the general manager of Pepsi Productions. He helped develop the original shorts. \u201cYou want to create things that people actually want to see.\u201dThis is in line with recent research showing that consumers have grown increasingly wary of traditional advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like ads; it\u2019s that people don\u2019t like being sold to,\u201d said Beth Egan, an associate advertising professor at Syracuse University. \u201cMillennials especially are really keen to have a relationship with brands, but that has to be a true, authentic and two-way relationship.\u201dIn preliminary findings from a recent study led by Ms. Egan, when subjects were exposed to branded content, prominent mention of the brand increased viewers\u2019 suspicion of the messaging.So how do you mostly remove the brand but keep the association?Pepsi filmed several videos, written and directed by Mr. Irving, featuring cameos from other N.B.A. names, including Mr. Irving\u2019s then-teammate, Kevin Love, and the retired Hall of Fame center Bill Russell. The Pepsi logo wasn\u2019t conspicuous other than a \u201cPepsi Max presents\u201d at the beginning and some shots of spectators drinking Pepsi.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong association now between Irving, \u2018Uncle Drew\u2019 and the Pepsi brand,\u201d Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cThis was just another chapter in how to bring the brand\u2019s story to life,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cNobody has done it before, but I would venture to take a guess that this won\u2019t be the last time.\u201dPrincipals involved with the movie insist that while the film may have originated with a company best known for its soda, the integrity of \u201cUncle Drew\u201d as a film is genuine.\u201cI would say that you \u2014 we \u2014 would be pretty foolish to view this as a two-hour-long commercial,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cI think that would not do the brand any good.\u201dJim Miller, an executive vice president of Lionsgate, said: \u201cHonestly, aside from they\u2019re our partners, it has nothing to do with Pepsi. If there wasn\u2019t a great story in there, we wouldn\u2019t have engaged.\u201dThe feature film version is an extended, fleshed-out version of the original commercials. The cast includes the retired N.B.A. players Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, along with appearances by a who\u2019s who of basketball. The movie was shot in a little over a month last year, mostly in Atlanta, with about a week spent in Rucker Park.If the original shorts went out of their way not to blast the Pepsi brand, the movie takes a different tack. The opening credits say the film was made \u201cin association with Pepsi.\u201d The Rucker Park scenes show various iterations of the brand logo surrounding the court. Mr. Kroll\u2019s character, the villainous coach of a rival team, gives a shout-out to Pepsi during an interview with ESPN.Pepsi and Lionsgate declined to reveal the film\u2019s budget or the financial terms of their partnership. Mr. Arbetter would only acknowledge Pepsi\u2019s role in funding the screenplay.As for the film industry, will this unexpected partnership lead to more such deals? Paula Kupfer, a senior vice president at Lionsgate, said to ask her in July \u2014 after the \u201cUncle Drew\u201d premiere. But she did acknowledge an emerging reality: In an era when Netflix and Amazon have become prominent players in content creation, and Facebook and Apple are taking steps to get involved, \u201ca good idea can come from anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawsuit Against Weinstein Might Open Door to Criminal Charges", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former employee of Harvey Weinstein accused him in a lawsuit on Tuesday of sexually and physically assaulting her for years and threatening to ruin her career if she denied his sexual advances or told anyone about them.Some of the complaints against Mr. Weinstein reported to New York authorities happened too long ago to be prosecuted, law enforcement officials have said, but the incidents mentioned in Ms. Canosa\u2019s lawsuit might qualify as more serious sex crimes that have no statutes of limitation, because she contends he physically forced her to comply with his demands.The district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., declined to say on Wednesday if his office had interviewed Ms. Canosa. A lawyer for Ms. Canosa, Jeremy A. Hellman, also would not say if Manhattan prosecutors had talked to his client.Ms. Canosa said in her lawsuit that Mr. Weinstein insisted on meeting her in \u201cisolated environments for business purposes,\u201d including in hotel rooms in Hungary and Malaysia. Mr. Weinstein \u201cthreatened plaintiff if she would not give him what he wanted,\u201d and forced himself on her \u201cdespite repeated requests to stop,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The lawsuit gave few details of these encounters.Ms. Canosa has worked for Mr. Weinstein or for his media companies since 2010, the lawsuit said, and was an associate producer on \u201cMarco Polo,\u201d a historical drama that ran for two seasons, which listed Mr. Weinstein as an executive producer.Phyllis Kupferstein, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein based in Los Angeles, said Ms. Canosa worked on and off for the Weinstein Company for a decade, doing special projects and holding influential roles, but was not a full-time executive.\u201cFrom someone who has been thought of as a good friend, involved only in a consensual relationship, these claims are not only mystifying to Mr. Weinstein, but deeply upsetting, and they cannot be supported by the facts,\u201d Ms. Kupferstein said.The latest legal front against Mr. Weinstein came on the same day that the New York attorney general\u2019s office announced that it would appoint a special deputy to lead an investigation into Mr. Vance\u2019s handling of a 2015 sexual assault allegation against Mr. Weinstein that was not prosecuted.The broadly worded letter directed the attorney general to examine \u201cthe actions of, and interactions between\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office and the police on all sexual assault complaints, including the 2015 case. It did not specifically request an investigation of possible misconduct by Mr. Vance\u2019s office.\u201cWe are committed to pursuing a comprehensive, fair and independent investigation,\u201d Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman, said on Tuesday.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s criminal lawyer in New York, Benjamin Brafman, has said the sexual encounters the district attorney\u2019s office has been scrutinizing were consensual, and he has denied Mr. Weinstein committed any financial wrongdoing, asserting that he had reimbursed his former company for all personal expenditures.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don Blankenship Announces Third-Party Bid for West Virginia Senate Seat", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut before Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat running for re-election in the deep-red state, celebrates a candidacy that could split the Republican vote, Mr. Blankenship must overcome West Virginia\u2019s \u201csore loser\u201d law, designed to keep failed primary candidates off the ballot.Mr. Blankenship, who lost a brutal proxy fight with party leaders in the Republican primary, was already anticipating a court fight with \u201cthe establishment\u201d over the matter.\u201cWe are confident that \u2014 if challenged \u2014 our legal position will prevail absent a politically motivated decision by the courts,\u201d he said in a news release on Monday.Mr. Blankenship did not provide evidence or a legal argument to support the claim. But scholars who have studied the law said they could see a reasonable argument to overcome it.For Democrats, the prospect of a third-party entry in West Virginia is a gift. Democrats have been trying to foment Republican divisions, especially in races against sitting Democratic senators in states that President Trump won.In Ohio, they have highlighted misgivings that another losing primary candidate, Mike Gibbons, has with the Republican winner, Representative James B. Renacci, who will face Senator Sherrod Brown in November. In Wisconsin, they have egged on the Republican combatants slugging it out for the right to challenge Senator Tammy Baldwin in the fall. And intraparty fighting in Arizona could imperil Republicans\u2019 effort to maintain the seat being vacated by Senator Jeff Flake.Mr. Blankenship would have little chance of winning the Senate seat outright, but if he could make it onto the ballot, he could siphon off support for West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, who won the Republican nomination. That could propel Mr. Manchin to re-election.And even if his legal challenge fails, Democrats said on Monday that Mr. Blankenship could torment Mr. Morrisey with negative ads, and reach deep into his pockets to demonize the Republican leadership in Washington.Mr. Manchin, who served as the state\u2019s governor before winning a Senate seat in 2010, remains a popular moderate Democrat. But Republicans see the seat, in a state where they have won by huge margins in recent years, as one of their best pickup opportunities this fall.Nachama Soloveichik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Morrisey, said that the campaign would comment on ballot issues \u201cas they may arise\u201d but did not mention Mr. Blankenship by name.\u201cPatrick Morrisey is the only candidate who can defeat Senator Joe Manchin and who will stand with President Trump for West Virginians,\u201d she said.A spokesman for Mr. Manchin declined to comment.Mr. Blankenship has run a populist campaign not unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s, complete with nativist attacks and allegations that the Justice Department under President Barack Obama corruptly prosecuted him for his role in a 2010 mine explosion that killed 29 men.Mr. McConnell\u2019s Senate campaign team went further, taunting Mr. Blankenship the night of his loss with a reference from \u201cNarcos,\u201d a Netflix series.Steven Allen Adams, a spokesman for Mac Warner, West Virginia\u2019s secretary of state, made clear that Mr. Warner believes the law bans a candidate like Mr. Blankenship from seeking to step around the primary process.Still, scholars said that the state had written the text in a way that leaves it vulnerable to challenge.\u201cIt looks to me like West Virginia intended for there to be a ban on sore losers, including in legislation this year. It looks like they were intended to stop someone like Blankenship,\u201d said Barry C. Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cHowever, the law is not written perfectly.\u201dThe State Legislature passed a bill in March seeking to clarify the law, but it does not take effect until June.Mr. Blankenship, for his part, painted himself as a natural fit for the Constitution Party, which champions the \u201cChristian character and heritage of our state, and the Bible as the basis of morality on which the legitimacy of our laws rest.\u201d He cited his legal case as presenting himself as an \u201cespecially appropriate\u201d representative of its values.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Malkmus Doesn\u2019t Think He Was a Jerk", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Word With\u201cI hate being tan,\u201d Stephen Malkmus said almost immediately, standing in the lobby of a Midtown hotel. His olive complexion, the unwanted result of a vacation in Hawaii with his extended family, was startling \u2014 not unlike seeing Santa Claus, if he suddenly lost 80 pounds. Since the 1989 debut of Pavement, the curious indie-rock band Mr. Malkmus led, he\u2019s been an antihero for the brainy, self-conscious and fearful \u2014 the indoor kids, in other words. His music, even since Pavement melted into entropy in 1999, has been jarring and opaque, defined by lyrics that circle around homonyms and puns, or break from generational observations into non sequiturs.He was raised in central California, in a city he recalls as mundane and obsessed with real estate. At the University of Virginia, he met bohemians for the first time, and heard experimental, absurdist bands like the Butthole Surfers and Can, which led him to move to New York after graduation and start Pavement. The group was frequently crowned, by critics and other elitists, the most important indie rock band of the \u201990s.No one has the singing voice they wish they had. Who do you wish you sounded more like?Back in the day, I was a bit boyish, a little yelpy. I can\u2019t even believe I made it this far with the singing, to be honest. My first band, we played at a wedding and then we got a board tape and it had my voice really loud. Then the drummer\u2019s like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just not sing anymore? This sounds terrible.\u201d And I was like, \u201cO.K.\u201d [Laughs] But then my voice got a tiny bit deeper. And I heard the Velvet Underground. I heard a lot of bands that couldn\u2019t sing that well. I was like, I guess I can do it too.I\u2019d like to have a really pure voice, like the Radiohead guy [Thom Yorke]. Usually it\u2019d be women: Cat Power in her prime, or Sandy Denny, or, obviously, Beyonc\u00e9. Who doesn\u2019t wish you could be a badass like that?What is it about \u201970s soft rock that still appeals to you?You don\u2019t talk very much about your family. What\u2019s your dad like?No. He played at a Pavement reunion show in England [in 2010]. I didn\u2019t know if I should talk to him. I\u2019d have to unpack all this stuff: \u201cHi, I\u2019m the Pavement guy who, like, ripped off three of your songs, really intentionally, on one of my albums, and then didn\u2019t do it ever again.\u201d That was the only time I got close enough to say hi, and I was too shy.No. I did that song as a personal favor to Will, for his \u201cpassion project.\u201d That\u2019s what you call it when it doesn\u2019t sell. As soon as I saw it referred to as a \u201cpassion project,\u201d I knew it was, like, over. [Laughs] Sad that passion means death in entertainment. I\u2019ll cover just about anything, except for a Kid Rock song.For a few years, you didn\u2019t play Pavement songs with the Jicks, and then you started playing them. What changed?What\u2019s a guitar solo you wish you\u2019d played?Can you describe yourself when you were 25?I don\u2019t think I was so bad then. Still, no one liked me. There were some definite role models of jerkdom back then, like [the producer] Steve Albini. The whole fanzine culture, Gerard Cosloy [the editor of Conflict], was snarky and sarcastic, like Mad Magazine gone hipster, with music. And there were really bitchy bands, like Royal Trux. I was a product of my time. I\u2019ve always been attracted to negative influences \u2014 I thought that meant you were smart. It was almost like being in a tribe. It was kind of brutal, because men have to develop their hierarchies. And that brought out negative behavior. But really, when I smoked weed, I was a nice boy. Anyone who smokes pot is usually a nice person.For years, people have talked about your songs as though they\u2019re puzzles, full of clues and allusions, but always avoiding a clear meaning. Implicit in that is a belief that you know what the songs are about, but you\u2019re keeping it hidden. Is that the case?Definitely not. A lot of things come out and I don\u2019t know where they came from. It\u2019s all built on your experiences, and poetry, and taste \u2014 what you keep. It\u2019s all cumulative. It\u2019s intentional in that way. Me, me, me, me \u2014 telling you how I feel, that\u2019s not going to be the kind of thing I like to hear, and I don\u2019t do that.I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re puzzles. Sometimes they\u2019ve been. Really, the music is the most important thing. That\u2019s the underlining hum, the electricity. On top, you have your brain \u2014 just like the body, the brain\u2019s on top. It\u2019s neurotic, it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s malfunctioning. It\u2019s like a broken computer. That\u2019s what the lyrics are like. They\u2019re more about the head. The heart is in the music itself. I don\u2019t know when we made the heart this big thing, anyway. To me, everything\u2019s in the brain, pretty much.Who decides what a song is about, the writer or the listener?Definitely the listener does. It\u2019s Postmodern 101. It\u2019s just fun to know from a trivial sense what the guy meant.Who calls you Steve, and who calls you Stephen?You\u2019ve been to a urologist, to make sure of that?I\u2019m not into surgery. Although with the drugs they give you these days \u2026 I\u2019m not going to talk about my colonoscopy, because I know The New York Times prints everything. But once the [voice recorder] is off, I\u2019ll tell you.Advertisement"}

The hush that falls over a crowd during the largely dialogue-free \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d intensifies the suspense. Watching \u201cVertigo\u201d in a theater for the umpteenth time last month, I heard gasps from viewers unfamiliar with its twists. And of course, there are all sorts of other reasons that going to the movies and home viewing aren\u2019t comparable. Spending an evening out spills over to other places, like restaurants and bars.Regular audiences, on the other hand, shell out top dollar for a new release (often with surcharges for 3D, Imax and other superfluous bells and whistles). They\u2019ll see something like \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d in a packed multiplex, its spell broken by the sonic booms of \u201cPacific Rim: Uprising\u201d bleeding in from the next auditorium.

No. But it\u2019s not uncommon. So who can blame a viewer who chooses to watch new movies, less expensively, in an environment they control?Honestly, the question of access is key to understanding the shift to streaming over the past several years. And not just access to theaters; I spent my first 30 years in Wichita, Kan., which is (to put it mildly) not among the first cities to get indies, documentaries or foreign films. So I would spend months hearing about those kinds of movies before they finally made their way to a theater where I could see them, if ever \u2014 most, I would see on video, six-plus months later. Now, those movies are frequently available on demand or on Netflix at the same time as their limited theatrical release.There\u2019s certainly room for both. What seems clear is that at this point, studios, distributors and streaming services have to figure out a way to coexist.The choice between a genuinely immersive outing to a theater and an affordable, user-friendly experience at home could (and should) be a difficult one. At this particular moment, it\u2019s usually not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Members of the Migrant Caravan Await Their Fate Near San Diego", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Scores of migrants from Central America have set up an encampment on the border between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, waiting to apply for asylum in the United States after a journey that has drawn international attention. American border authorities have thus far declined to process the asylum seekers, a stalemate with no clear end.For several years, migrants from Central America have made their way north en masse in so-called caravans as a way to protect themselves from criminals as they flee violence in their home countries. This year, more than 1,200 migrants joined the caravan, which formed in late March in southern Mexico. It has drawn intense scrutiny among conservatives and in right-wing media, and President Trump himself warned on Twitter that the caravan posed a threat to the United States\u2019 security.With the American authorities unwilling to let the migrants enter the country on Monday, upward of 150 migrants from the caravan who intended to seek asylum huddled with donated blankets and sandwiches, which were distributed by volunteers. Plastic tarps protected them from the intense sun, and small knapsacks held their few belongings.The group has vowed to stay until the asylum seekers are allowed to petition for protection on American soil.Mario Quintanillo and Cecilia Sarai Carillo, who made the trek from El Salvador, were married at the beach in Tijuana on Sunday morning in preparation for their request for asylum in the United States. Their 2-year-old daughter, Daryeline Ariana, was with them.\u201cI\u2019m going with the feeling that it\u2019s going to be worth the effort,\u201d Mr. Quintanillo, 30, said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The triumph was more than just historic for residents of South Los Angeles, where Mr. Lamar grew up \u2014 it was also profoundly moving, an acknowledgment that their stories mattered.Young writers and artists in the area have long venerated Mr. Lamar, whose rise from poverty to becoming one of the acclaimed musical writers of his generation is a source of hope and inspiration. Kyland Turner, a young writer and poet from Watts, said Mr. Lamar\u2019s music helped him make sense of his own life and choices at critical moments.\u201cThere was a long time that I didn\u2019t know how to express myself, and Kendrick was that expression for me personally. I was young and trying to make it through the city,\u201d said Mr. Turner, 22. \u201cHis first album, that album got me through some of the toughest parts of my life, from being evicted to having friends dying.\u201dMr. Turner\u2019s dream is to make it as a songwriter and screenwriter. He\u2019s well on his way. He has built a following through raw performances in spoken-word events around the city, drawing from his life in South L.A.\u2019s neighborhoods. He recently did story-consulting work on a Netflix series about South L.A., \u201cOn My Block,\u201d and once performed at the White House.Mr. Lamar\u2019s Pulitzer win, said Mr. Turner, has provided a rush of inspiration for Mr. Turner and others like him.\u201cWe knew about Kendrick before the world knew about him. To see his growth over time and for him to stay true to his community, just on a personal level growing up in the city, in L.A., Watts, Compton \u2014 it made me feel like, man, I can make it,\u201d Mr. Turner said.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

The couple has created \u201cHigher Ground Productions,\u201d a company to produce content for Netflix, the streaming service announced.The former president has told associates that he does not intend to use the new platform to wage a public campaign against his successor in the Oval Office, or to fight against conservative voices that populate media outlets like Fox News.Instead, a release from Netflix said the Obamas will produce \u201cscripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries and features\u201d that highlight issues and themes the president pursued during his eight years in office.\u201cOne of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many fascinating people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why Michelle and I are so excited to partner with Netflix \u2014 we hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world.\u201dMr. Obama has remained largely quiet since leaving office about a year-and-a-half ago, despite calls from some of his supporters to be more active in fighting back against Mr. Trump\u2019s assault on the Obama legacy.The former president and his advisers have rejected that approach, believing that Mr. Obama would become a convenient political target for the current president. As a result, the Netflix deal is unlikely to be a vehicle for any sharp, partisan rhetoric by the former president, officials said.Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer for Netflix, said the deal will benefit the service\u2019s audience.\u201cBarack and Michelle Obama are among the world\u2019s most respected and highly recognized public figures and are uniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are incredibly proud they have chosen to make Netflix the home for their formidable storytelling abilities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Reality Asserts Itself as an Art Form in Its Own Right", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 As virtual reality breaks into the art world at all levels, a host of questions about curation, conservation and commercial value is still being explored.The Berlin-based artist Olafur Eliasson said that we were only in \u201cthe Stone Age\u201d or prehistoric period for the medium.\u201cThere is a new space out there where a lot more people will have access to artistic experience,\u201d he said last week in a panel discussion here at the Art Leaders Network hosted by The New York Times. He added that \u201cthe quality of the glasses is getting so much intensely better\u201d over the three years he has been experimenting with virtual reality.\u201cYou can put your hand in the rain and swish the drops around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a challenge to give it an ephemeral quality, but I am very excited about the result.\u201dIn April, Acute Art\u2019s VR Museum introduced a subscription program to experience works by Mr. Eliasson and the performance artist Marina Abramovic while distributing the output of five other artists free of charge for nonsubscribers.The website works with three brands of virtual-reality headsets.While a painting is acquired through a single sale payment, Mr. Klaris said, virtual-reality works may demand a monetization plan more along the lines of the film industry. An artist who creates such a work \u201cmight be paid every time it is sold or distributed,\u201d he said.Khora Contemporary was founded, however, with the main objective of helping established and young artists translate their work into the realm of virtual reality. The company was inaugurated at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale with commissioned works by Paul McCarthy and Christian Lemmerz.Ms. Nedvetskaia cited a \u201ctriangular\u201d business model involving the artist, production company and gallery. The structure varies on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d Khora Contemporary is also in talks with film festivals on both sides of the Atlantic. Down the line, Ms. Nedvetskaia envisions creating pay-per-view versions of artwork online.She pointed to virtual reality as a new frontier for artists at a time when all other forms and genres have been explored. \u201cThere is little today which is brand new,\u201d she said.But the collector base is just developing. \u201cIt is too early to talk about at this point,\u201d she said of \u201ca very nascent market\u201d while mentioning sales in Asia and the interest of private museums and collections.The Salon Berlin of the Museum Frieder Burda \u2014 a private collection in Baden-Baden, Germany \u2014 is displaying its first virtual-reality component with \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d by the Ukranian artist Nikita Shalenny.The salon\u2019s curator, Patricia Kamp, pointed to the irony that, in an exhibition exploring the alienation from nature in modern society, virtual reality represents a crucial means of harnessing younger visitors.\u201cWhen art doesn\u2019t move people emotionally, it has no purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next generation only grows up with screens. They have a totally different point of access.\u201d\u201cThe Bridge\u201d is juxtaposed with both modern and contemporary paintings in an effort to create dialogue between the different mediums. Ms. Nedvetskaia also mentioned the possibility of exhibiting virtual-reality works alongside the physical material on which they were based, such as Shalenny\u2019s watercolors or video directed by Mr. McCarthy.\u201cIt makes it more believable,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt gives people the confidence that it can be taken seriously as a real art form.\u201dAs Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, said during the Art Leaders Network panel \u201cThe Future of Art Museums,\u201d contemporary art had transcended formal labels.\u201cThere use to be these categories,\u201d he said. \u201cHigh art, fashion, commerce, you name it.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Fauda\u2019 Returns on Netflix, Guns Blazing", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe more pertinent observation about \u201cFauda\u201d is that its creators, Lior Raz and Avi Issacharoff, saw how certain circumstances in their world could be synthesized into entertaining, even gripping melodrama \u2014 the intimate web of shared history and culture; the normality of high emotion, hatred and nihilism; rigid notions of family and honor; the photogenic density of the weathered Palestinian cities in the West Bank, perfect for car and foot chases.That may sound a little cynical, but it\u2019s how a series becomes something more than an above-average action thriller.For Season 2 the creators decided to engage more closely with current events, making al-Makdasi an ISIS follower who wants to give the Islamic State a foothold in the occupied territories, and Israel, at the expense of Hamas. This gives him a second motivation, along with revenge against Doron, who killed his father.It wasn\u2019t a good move \u2014 in later episodes the season starts to feel slack, lacking the focus and narrative momentum that carried straight through Season 1. The revenge story and the political conspiracy story don\u2019t jell, and al-Makdasi\u2019s larger plot feels generic and tacked on.The most unusual, and truly problematic, creation in \u201cFauda\u201d is Doron himself, based on Mr. Raz\u2019s experience as an Israeli operative. His defining trait, and the one Mr. Raz plays best, is his sour, surly implacability. (Mr. Raz doesn\u2019t make his occasional moments of introspection or guilt quite as convincing.) Doron subscribes wholeheartedly to the inevitability of battle and the necessity of blood-for-blood vengeance, and coming from the show\u2019s hero (however antiheroic he may be), that has the effect of defining Arabs as the enemy, no matter how much trouble is taken to \u201chumanize\u201d them. (He also lies to and ruthlessly manipulates his Palestinian lover, a messy, depressing part of the story that is potentially interesting but mostly just sits there.)Part of the attraction of \u201cFauda\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t shy away from the brutality of Doron and his colleagues \u2014 the ease with which they beat and torture, or start shooting into crowds when they\u2019re threatened. At the same time, the show\u2019s sympathies are clearly with Doron \u2014 any more nuanced resolution of its feelings about him will have to wait until Season 3, already ordered. That, along with the different weights given to the deaths of Palestinian and Israeli characters, can affect your response to the series.At the end of the day, though, if you\u2019re going to put the onus on someone to tell the Palestinian side of this story, it shouldn\u2019t be Mr. Rav and Mr. Issacharoff. Netflix has the money. Is it talking to any filmmakers in Gaza or the West Bank?Advertisement"}

But if Comcast offers a significantly higher bid than the $52.4 billion that Disney has put forward, as it has hinted that it would do, other shareholders could scuttle Murdochs\u2019 deal with Disney.Here\u2019s how\u2022 how deeply the family was involved in negotiating the Disney deal, and\u2022 how disproportionately the Murdochs may benefit from a lower-priced but all-stock Disney bidThe stockholders have also agreed not to facilitate any effort or attempt by another entity to make an acquisition proposal for 21CF, including by refraining from discussing or providing information to any person in connection with such a proposal.A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on Comcast\u2019s announcement on Wednesday.

In addition, our directors, though, of course are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dThe cable giant said on Wednesday what we and others have reported: that it is in the \u201cadvanced stages of preparing\u201d a counter bid for the 21st Century Fox assets that Walt Disney has agreed to buy for $52.4 billion.Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. The structure and terms of any offer by Comcast, including with respect to both the spinoff of \u201cNew Fox\u201d and the regulatory risk provisions and the related termination fee, would be at least as favorable to Fox shareholders as the Disney offer.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe lawsuit comes in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone\u2019s influence over the company.

In the amended complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, CBS asserted the independence of its board and asked the court to rule on which side\u2019s interpretation of the recent vote is lawful.ContextOn the day before the CBS board was scheduled to meet last week, National Amusements made a sudden and significant change to the CBS bylaws: From now on, the company said, any vote would require a supermajority \u2014 90 percent of the 14 CBS board members \u2014 for approval.The board voted 11 to 3 to significantly diminish Ms. Redstone\u2019s voting power. But that result fell shy of 90 percent.The WSJ reported that Mr. Ackman supports Mr. Ellison.D.E.

The sales of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia helped lift Uber\u2019s bottom line. Exclude those transactions and Uber would have reported a loss of roughly $550 million.\u2022 Revenue jumped 70 percent from the prior year to $2.59 billion.\u2022 Gross bookings climbed 55 percent.The ride-hailer has long resisted the financial burden of providing its drivers and couriers with health care benefits. But under the leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi, that appears to be slowly changing.The figures aren\u2019t huge. Uber will pay just \u00a31,000 for maternity and paternity leave.

{"Headline": "How Meghan Markle Makes Me Feel About Race and the Crown", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI had been living in Trinidad and Tobago for just over a year when I had the chance to see Queen Elizabeth II.As a 10-year-old transplant from the United States, I watched with thousands of other Trinidadians in the National Stadium, as my sister and hundreds of other children danced for her while showcasing the vibrant wonder of calypso steelpan and carnival costumes.What time is the royal wedding? Can you attend? How much will it cost? What name will be on Meghan Markle's driver's license? And dozens of your other really important royal wedding questions answered.I\u2019d soon come to learn how such ceremonies functioned to maintain the love of the monarchy in even black nations that demanded independence from the Crown. But at the time \u2014 unaware that a few miles away, college students from the University of the West Indies protested her arrival \u2014 I was mesmerized by my cultural pride for my father\u2019s country and excitement for the Queen.Today, as my Google alerts feed me all things Meghan Markle, I struggle even more with conflicting feelings of ambivalence and awe.Just this past Sunday, the Lifetime television movie \u201cHarry & Meghan: A Royal Romance\u201d portrayed this sentiment when the fictional Meghan (Parisa Fitz-Henley) decides to forsake her acting career to fulfill an even larger obligation of being a racial symbol. After a young black Canadian girl asks for her autograph, the girl\u2019s uncle proclaims: \u201cFor a little girl like her, someone like you marrying into the royal family, that\u2019s huge. This is going to change the way people see the world.\u201dAnd while I, too, am moved by the transformative potential of this marriage, I am also skeptical. Imbuing Ms. Markle\u2019s racial biography with so much redemptive potential \u2014 much like we did with President Barack Obama \u2014 ignores the xenophobia and structures of racial inequality upon which Brexit, and by extension insular notions of British identity that the monarchy symbolizes, thrives.Ms. Markle\u2019s desegregation of the royal family gives us a unique opportunity to examine the contributions and experiences of black people on both sides of the Atlantic. But instead, the new multiracial veneer she gives the monarchy has been portrayed in wedding coverage as not simply modernizing, but inevitable, while Britain\u2019s troubled racial past and present is glossed over.Such stories prepare us for seeing Meghan and Harry\u2019s nuptials as a completion of a circle in which multiracial identity is not only embraced, but in fact encoded in the DNA of the royal family of which Ms. Markle is now both an extension and its most recent member.Which is why I\u2019ll be watching the wedding on Saturday with wonder, and a bit of worry.Will Ms. Markle ultimately end up as a truly transformative figure or, like Queen Charlotte (if you believe the theories), a curious historical blip? Who knows? I just hope it doesn\u2019t take another 257 years until the monarchy, and more important, England and Ms. Markle\u2019s home country, the United States, can celebrate the full racial integration of all its citizens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "45 Stories of Sex and Consent on Campus", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "In the time of #MeToo, the debate about how to handle sexual consent has become louder than ever. Many sexual encounters seem to take place in a so-called gray zone of miscommunication, denial, rationalization and, sometimes, regret.There\u2019s that popular saying, \u201cconsent is sexy.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it proudly written on Twitter, on t-shirts and signs at rallies. But something always sat with me the wrong way about that phrase. Consent isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s crucial. It\u2019s not a healthy sexual encounter without full consent.Throughout my three years in college I never, ever moved forward with a girl without first asking her if it was okay. Consent was that simple: \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d In my experience, questions like this, asked with the right cadence and at the right time, made sex a more enjoyable experience.My boyfriend and I have worked out what consent looks like for us. I still struggle with giving a definitive \u201cno,\u201d so our rule is that if the other person isn\u2019t enthusiastically reciprocating, everything stops. If we do any form of role-play, we establish the exact order of activities beforehand, and if at any point we want to step out, we say a safe word and all activity stops.Many people\u2019s first exposure to sexuality is porn, which teaches kids that men should be rough, demanding, and that if a girl says no, you just need to try harder to convince her. We need to teach our children (especially boys) the self control, respect and communication necessary for healthy intimacy, and do it long before they have devices they can watch porn on.Every woman I know carries at least one story of her almost-but-maybe-not-quite sexual assault. And there lies the problem: we have been conditioned to believe that anything less than violent rape by a stranger does not deserve our concern or condemnation. But it\u2019s never been that black and white, and I will now tell you what I wish I could tell my 15-year-old self: Just because he\u2019s your boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t assault you. Sexual coercion is a form of sexual abuse. You have the right to stop at any time, yes, even if he\u2019s already horny. Do not give in to sex just to avoid an argument. Do not apologize for saying no.If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted \u2014 or if you\u2019re not sure \u2014 please consider the following resources:EDITORSJessica BennettDaniel JonesAnya StrzemienBonnie WertheimDESIGNTracy MaUmi SyamSOCIAL MEDIASharon AttiaFahima HaqueRESEARCHMiya LeeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blankenship Loses West Virginia Primary; Cordray Defeats Kucinich in Ohio", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans narrowly averted political disaster in the West Virginia Senate primary on Tuesday with the defeat of former coal executive Don Blankenship while mainstream Democrats fended off a liberal insurgent in the Ohio governor\u2019s race, bringing relief to the establishment of both parties on a day of elections in four states.But Washington Republicans were handed a stinging defeat in North Carolina, where Representative Robert Pittenger was defeated by Mark Harris, a pastor who made his name denouncing same-sex marriage. The unexpected setback is likely to jolt congressional Republicans yet again and underscore that their fragile House majority is the party\u2019s most vulnerable front in 2018.West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Joe Manchin III, one of the most vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election this year.Mr. Blankenship, speaking to reporters Tuesday night, said he believed a hostile tweet by Mr. Trump may have cost him 10 percentage points or more in the race. After the May 1 debate, he maintained, all three candidates\u2019 internal surveys showed him surging into the lead.\u201cThat might have been the Trump impact,\u201d he said of his loss. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 84 percent positive like he is, it can be big.\u201dMr. Trump appeared happy with the results. In an early Wednesday morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cThe Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November.\u201dIn a hard-fought battle in Ohio between two liberal Democrats, Richard Cordray, the former head of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, won the party\u2019s nomination in the governor\u2019s race over the former congressman and presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich.\u201cThis victory happened for a reason,\u201d Mr. Cordray told supporters at a hotel in downtown Columbus, as they cheered and waved campaign signs. \u201cYou demanded change and we heard you and we want the same.\u201dEchoing a campaign message that focused largely on helping the little guy, he promised to continue fighting for \u201ckitchen-table issues that people across Ohio told us were on their minds,\u201d including access to affordable health care and spreading out economic opportunity.President Trump offered his congratulations to Mr. DeWine in a tweet Wednesday morning, and called Mr. Cordray a \u201csocialist.\u201dAnother Ohio contest, however, was more on the minds of Washington Republicans: the nomination battle for the Columbus-area seat vacated by the former Representative Pat Tiberi. State Senator Troy Balderson, who enjoyed support from Mr. Tiberi, narrowly defeated the business executive Melanie Leneghan, a conservative with backing from members of the House Freedom Caucus, in a contest that became a proxy war between party factions.National Republicans were considering not competing in the special election had Ms. Leneghan won, but now they will likely aggressively target Danny O\u2019Connor, the Franklin County recorder and the Democratic nominee, in what has been a conservative-leaning district. A special election will be held in August.In the race for the House seat left open by Representative James Renacci of Ohio, a Republican who easily won the nomination to face Senator Sherrod Brown, the former N.F.L. wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez defeated State Representative Christina Hagan in a contest where establishment-aligned Republicans also grew nervous and poured money in to lift Mr. Gonzalez.Indiana Republicans settled a bloody Senate primary between three largely indistinguishable candidates, selecting Mike Braun, a wealthy former state legislator and business executive, to challenge Senator Joe Donnelly, a first-term Democrat. Mr. Braun campaigned successfully as a political outsider, though his business record is likely to face closer scrutiny in the general election. Mr. Donnelly is another vulnerable Senate Democrat this year, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to campaign against him on Thursday.\u201cWe seem to be in the era of the outsider, said John Hammond, a lawyer and member of the Republican National Committee from Indiana. \u201cThat message along with it being extremely well funded, he outspent the other campaigns two to one.\u201dNorth Carolina did not have any major statewide elections, but voters there delivered the biggest upset of the night: Mr. Pittenger, a third-term Republican, was defeated by Mr. Harris, a pastor who nearly unseated the congressman in the 2016 primary there.The first incumbent to lose renomination this year, Mr. Pittenger sought to repel Mr. Harris by enthusiastically embracing Mr. Trump. But he found little support in return from the administration.See full results and maps from the West Virginia primaries.Republicans were already concerned about holding the Charlotte-to-Fayetteville seat \u2014 Democratic nominee Dan McCready was outraising Mr. Pittenger \u2014 and now must decide how aggressively to support Mr. Harris. Mr. McCready had over $1.2 million in the bank as of last month while Mr. Harris had just $70,000.In Ohio, Mr. Cordray\u2019s victory in the Democratic primary marks an important initial success in his return to electoral politics after serving for most of a decade in the Obama administration.His success also demonstrated a show of strength for Ms. Warren and unions against the more far-left elements of the party, including some of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s allies who had endorsed Mr. Kucinich. (Mr. Sanders did not make an endorsement in the race.) Should Mr. Cordray win this November, it will give Democrats a foothold back in a battleground state that has been drifting to the right in recent years.A former Ohio attorney general who was defeated for re-election in 2010, Mr. Cordray faced stiff opposition in his political homecoming, most notably from Mr. Kucinich, a flamboyant 71-year-old former congressman and Cleveland mayor who is aligned with the far left.Despite collecting endorsements from powerful labor unions and campaigning alongside Senator Warren \u2014 a hero to liberals \u2014 Mr. Cordray struggled at times to inspire enthusiasm from rank-and-file Democratic voters.And after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February, Mr. Cordray agonized over having taken conservative stances on gun control in the past; he had even earned the endorsement of the National Rifle Association in 2010.Yet Mr. Cordray ultimately had far broader appeal than Mr. Kucinich, who also flailed in the final weeks of the race to explain his past praise of Mr. Trump and his decision to accept $20,000 from a group supportive of Mr. Assad. (After attempting to dismiss questions about the fee, he eventually returned the money.)Mr. Cordray will confront a tougher and more conventional opponent in Mr. DeWine. A longtime political hand in Ohio and Washington, Mr. DeWine is a powerful fund-raiser with a record of running toward the center in difficult elections. Mr. DeWine is likely to benefit, somewhat paradoxically, from both Mr. Trump\u2019s strength in the state and the popularity of the outgoing governor, John Kasich, a Republican who ran against Mr. Trump in 2016 and is one of the president\u2019s most insistent critics.The burden will be on Mr. Cordray to show that his populist message and soft-spoken persona can resonate in a state where Republicans have held the governorship for all but four years since the early 1990s.But the most closely watched race \u2014 and, for Republicans, the most anxiety-inducing one \u2014 was in West Virginia, where Mr. Blankenship threatened to again torpedo the party\u2019s chances for success in a red-state Senate seat.Claiming victory on Tuesday night, Mr. Morrisey quickly turned to what is likely to be the centerpiece of his campaign: driving a wedge between Mr. Manchin and Mr. Trump.\u201cWhen President Trump needed Joe Manchin\u2019s help on so many issues, Senator Manchin said no,\u201d Mr. Morrisey said.In his own statement, Mr. Manchin vowed that the campaign would be \u201cabout bringing people together who care about making life better for Americans who work hard for a paycheck.\u201dPresident Trump had remained quiet about the primary race even as Mr. Blankenship began attacking Republican leaders, such as referring to the family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, as the majority leader\u2019s \u201cChina family\u201d and calling Mr. McConnell himself \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201dBut after a telephone call on Sunday with Mr. McConnell, and on the advice of his own aides, Mr. Trump finally waded into the race with a tweet Monday morning aimed at West Virginians.Mr. Trump also invoked the last time Republicans gave away a Senate seat by nominating a flawed candidate, an event that he suggested would live in political infamy. \u201cRemember Alabama,\u201d he wrote, alluding to the party\u2019s nomination of the former state judge Roy S. Moore, who lost a special election after a series of women emerged to accuse him of making sexual advances on them when they were teenagers.But while Mr. Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins attacked one another, and a Democratic super PAC assailed Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Blankenship\u2019s poll numbers crept back up.By last weekend, when it became clear that he was a threat to win and imperil the party\u2019s one-seat Senate majority, Republican officials determined the moment had come for Mr. Trump to step in.And after it became clear that Mr. Blankenship had lost Tuesday, Mr. McConnell\u2019s allies exulted.Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Treating Workers Fairly at Rent the Runway", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Hyman is\u00a0a co-founder of Rent the Runway.I am ashamed to say that until recently I was part of the majority: I am the chief executive of a company that gave different benefits to different groups of employees.Like so many companies before us, my company, Rent the Runway, had two tiers of workers. Our salaried employees \u2014 who typically came from relatively privileged, educated backgrounds \u2014 were given generous parental leave, paid sick leave and the flexibility to work from home, or even abroad. Our hourly employees, working in Rent the Runway\u2019s warehouse, on the customer service team and in our retail stores, had to face life events like caring for a newborn, grieving after the death of a family member or taking care of a critically ill loved one without this same level of benefits.I had inadvertently created classes of employees \u2014 and by doing so, had done my part to contribute to America\u2019s inequality problem.When you\u2019re founding a business, you take your cues on corporate culture from larger, already successful organizations. In America, some of the biggest companies have decided to handle the dual pressures of keeping costs down while retaining \u201ccorporate talent\u201d by ramping up benefits packages. Companies like Starbucks and Walgreens compete for top-tier candidates by offering cushy policies in areas like parental leave or vacation.But the best benefits are reserved for corporate talent, for whom the competition is considered steepest; employees who work at hourly rates are an afterthought (and that doesn\u2019t begin to factor in companies like Uber that opt to consider the people they work with \u201ccontractors\u201d). When I started Rent the Runway, I simply followed suit.But over the years, I began to reflect on how the system that I and others had constructed may have been perpetuating deep-seated social problems. Last month, I equalized benefits for all of our employees at Rent the Runway. Our warehouse, customer service and store employees now have the same bereavement, parental leave, family sick leave and sabbatical packages that corporate employees have.When Reed Hastings needed a break from the early days of building Netflix, his board allowed him to live in Italy part time for a year with his family. When Marissa Mayer, the former Yahoo chief executive, had a child, she had a nursery built in the office. When I had a daughter a year ago, I could afford to pay for child care throughout my maternity leave and afterward, so returning to work was seamless.But the people who are working in warehouses and call centers and retail stores around the country generally have few safety nets. I have a deeper understanding now than when I founded Rent the Runway about the ways these missing safety nets contribute to unemployment and limit social mobility. When I announced our new paid family sick leave plan at our warehouse, for instance, a woman stood up to see whether she could use this policy to care for her daughter, who was scheduled to have a C-section soon. Before that, she had been planning to simply quit her job, without ever telling us why.This has to change. As a founder of a company that has grown from two employees to 1,200 over the last eight years, I implicitly understand that Rent the Runway would not exist without the dedication and loyalty of our team. Don\u2019t I owe it to the team that got me here to take care of them?I believe that these new policies are not only in the best interests of our employees but also of Rent the Runway itself, which I\u2019m hoping will see higher retention rates, lower training costs and better overall productivity from more experienced employees. I believe that these new policies will help us retain corporate employees too, or at least those who care about working at a company that takes values seriously: I received more positive feedback about these changes from my corporate team than about any other leadership decision I have ever made.It\u2019s time for business leaders to step up and fulfill not only their fiduciary duty to shareholders, but also their moral duty to society to treat every worker equally.I want Rent the Runway to be an example of what a modern workplace should be \u2014 a leader in creating a more human workplace, where the heart is just as important as the head, and where we show that we care about each and every member of our team equally.Advertisement"}

Mr. Johnson followed the well-received \u201cSkeleton Twins\u201d with \u201cWilson,\u201d an acerbic 2017 comedy adapted from a graphic novel by Daniel Clowes. His latest picture, \u201cAlex Strangelove,\u201d debuts on Netflix on June 8.\u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d was written by Mr. Johnson, and like \u201cSkeleton Twins,\u201d seems to have an autobiographical element. The title character, Alex Truelove, is a popular high schooler contending with great confusion about his sexual orientation. (He\u2019s played by Daniel Doheny, who bears a resemblance to Mr. Hader \u2014 I got the feeling that Mr. Johnson was temporally retrofitting his screen surrogates.) Alex has a wonderful friend, and eventually girlfriend, in Claire (Madeline Weinstein), with whom he makes internet videos and enlists in light cosplay for school social events. But he can\u2019t bring himself to close any kind of sexual deal with Claire. And once he meets a curly haired teenage Adonis, Elliott (Antonio Marziale), he starts to figure out why.While Mr. Johnson\u2019s movie is not nearly as Hollywood-slick as \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d the kids in \u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d inhabit a comfortable, bright, almost candy-colored world. From the inventive costumes Alex and Claire concoct for their party appearances to the Brooklyn nightclub with a behind-the-stage window looking out on an elevated train track, their environment and its trappings are practically idyllic, which is nice, generally, and especially when you\u2019re working out your sexuality.But \u201cAlex\u201d is an altogether more raucous picture than the decorous \u201cSimon.\u201d It\u2019s upfront in its treatment of teenage sexuality, with a lot of frank dialogue (although the picture sometimes suffers from the common misconception that all high schoolers talk like Algonquin Round Table quipsters). There are a few gross-out jokes that are actually funny, like the one involving projectile-vomited gummy candies.\u201cAlex Strangelove\u201d is witty, compassionate and enjoyable throughout; a charming movie and in many respects an enlightened one. There\u2019s something a little disquieting about it, though. This is the third film I\u2019ve seen in less than a year in which a young white male protagonist struggling with his sexuality walks all over a young woman\u2019s feelings on his way to self-definition. I don\u2019t blame the individual filmmakers for creating narratives of their own choosing, but I do think the constant repetition of this theme could do with some shaking up.The other film, \u201cBeach Rats,\u201d an independent picture written and directed by Eliza Hittman and now available for rental on Amazon Video, is not a comedy. Its main character, Frankie, is a working-class kid in Brooklyn who likes to hang out, smoke weed, and do other young mook stuff with his young mook friends.In the late hours, he sits in front of his computer and tentatively arranges sexual liaisons with men, almost always older ones. He\u2019s desperate both to hide these liaisons from his friends and deny to himself what they mean. One of his tactics is to take up with Simone, a girl who, on meeting Frankie, immediately challenges him: \u201cSo what\u2019s your idea of romance?\u201d He cruelly rebuffs her after taking her to his home, but later, trying to save face, pursues her again.\u201cBeach Rats\u201d takes place in a world very far from \u201cAlex\u201d and \u201cSimon.\u201d It is a movie about perpetual uneasiness. The threat of physical or emotional violence is nearly constant.In \u201cManhunt,\u201d a lawyer framed for a woman\u2019s murder seeks to clear his name and uncovers a byzantine network of crime. It harks back in its themes to Mr. Woo\u2019s groundbreaking 1990s Hong Kong films. (The movie itself is a loose remake of a 1976 Japanese picture of the same name.)Shot with a RED camera (the cinematographer is Takuro Ishizaka), \u201cManhunt\u201d lends digital sheen to the classic Woo fist-and-gun battles that so thrilled us in the likes of \u201cThe Killer\u201d and \u201cHard Boiled.\u201d The outlandish plot is a ridiculous pleasure, particularly once the protagonist comes into the sights of a couple of female assassins (one of whom is played by Angeles Woo, the director\u2019s daughter).One hesitates to sound like Jeff Daniels\u2019s pompous character in \u201cThe Squid and the Whale\u201d and categorize \u201cManhunt\u201d as \u201cminor Woo,\u201d but it\u2019s undeniable that \u201cManhunt\u201d delivers first-rate cinematic technique while skimping on substantial emotional investment. It\u2019s still a great deal of fun. It\u2019s a shame that Netflix did not see fit to promote it more aggressively than it did (that is, promote it at all), but we\u2019re all here now and everyone\u2019s O.K.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a likable memoir of how Jay and Mark Duplass blazed their idiosyncratic trail, and an inspiring how-to guide for anyone who might wish to follow it.Sure, there are also parts that seem extraneous or simply don\u2019t work, but the Duplasses never pretend to be masters of their craft. As they write in the book: \u201cIt seems that people like the Coen brothers have a specific vision of what their movies will look like from the moment they begin writing them, and then somehow are able to realize that vision and make those movies, for the most part, inspired and impeccably amazing. We, however, are not the Coen brothers.\u201dIn episodic chapters, the Duplasses recount their upbringing in Metairie, La., and boyhood rites of passage like getting cable TV and a video camera to shoot their first movies. There\u2019s a refreshing unpretentiousness to these sections: The brothers are unabashed fans of kitsch like \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II\u201d and the soft-rock duo Air Supply, and their close-knit kinship turns poignant when Jay has an emotional breakdown as a student at the University of Texas at Austin and Mark, still in high school, travels there to take care of him.Though their early, self-financed foray into grown-up moviemaking is a mediocre \u201cRocky\u201d knockoff called \u201cVince Del Rio,\u201d the brothers eventually earn acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival: first, in 2003, with a $3 short film called \u201cThis Is John,\u201d and then, in 2005, with \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d a relationship road-trip feature.Initially, the Duplasses seem to be living the fantasy of every indie filmmaker: \u201cBuyers, agents, managers, producers and studio executives were all swarming us,\u201d they write. But they quickly realize that these industry big shots are interested in developing other ideas with them, not in acquiring the movie the Duplasses made using $10,000 borrowed from their parents. \u201cIn short,\u201d they write, \u201cwe seemed to be in demand, but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to actually make money.\u201dIt takes many months for the brothers to receive a legitimate offer for \u201cThe Puffy Chair,\u201d and while they are eager to accept it, for the amount of money alone, they somehow find the fortitude to resist, and end up agreeing to a different deal \u2014 one that provides no money up front but includes distribution from an upstart DVD-by-mail company called Netflix. It\u2019s a valuable lesson in patience that has continued to pay dividends for the Duplasses, who signed a four-picture deal with Netflix earlier this year.While I appreciated the brothers\u2019 honest tales of dealing with anxiety, filial conflict and failing equipment during their collaborations, I was less taken with a chapter in which they reproduce an early draft of one of their unfilmed story ideas, along with Jay\u2019s handwritten notes, though readers\u2019 interest in this sort of paraphernalia may vary.Other sections, in which they compile and consolidate lists of their Top 10 films of all time, or imagine elaborate back stories for strangers they see at airports, may seem charming to devoted fans but felt like filler to me.More worrisome were passages in which the brothers, for all of their enthusiasm and desire to get others to participate in cinema, seem unaware of their inherent privilege as white men from a comfortable background, and who, as siblings working together, have an irresistible gimmick.It\u2019s probably not especially helpful for struggling, financially strapped young filmmakers at the start of their careers to be told to buy a house as soon as possible and pay off the mortgage by renting out bedrooms to creative pals. And the brothers\u2019 advice to invest in the stock market \u2014 the Duplasses say they bought \u201ca slew of shares\u201d of Netflix in 2005 \u2014 isn\u2019t practical unless you possess a trust fund or a time machine.Still, it\u2019s hard not to root for the Duplasses in moments like the one when their sales agent tells them they\u2019re not allowed to attend the Sundance after-party for their film \u201cBaghead,\u201d lest it appear that they\u2019re not engaged in heated efforts to get the movie sold.In another passage, they find themselves fighting with studio executives who want them to reshoot a scene from \u201cCyrus,\u201d because they feel the apartment of its lead character \u2014 a depressed divorc\u00e9 \u2014 needs more throw pillows. After getting uncharacteristically loud and standing their ground, the brothers win the day. \u201cFrom that moment forward,\u201d the Duplasses write, \u201cthey pretty much let us do our thing. Which was a wonderful and terrible thing in the end.\u201dDave Itzkoff is a culture reporter at The Times. His latest book is \u201cRobin,\u201d a biography of the comedian Robin Williams.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Creator of \u2018Dear White People\u2019 Is Doubling Down on Identity Politics", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk a ShowrunnerJustin Simien, the 35-year-old creator of \u201cDear White People,\u201d is no stranger to provocation.The satirical comedy, first a movie and now a Netflix show, revolves around five black students \u2014 Sam, Coco, Troy, Lionel and Reggie \u2014 at a fictional elite university who revel in the sorts of intemperate and intoxicating polemics that can sour a Thanksgiving dinner. A story line from the first season about an app called \u201cWoke or Not,\u201d for example, mercilessly parodied the characters\u2019 self-conscious commitment to social justice.\u201cI read this review on some conservative site because I was so curious where it all was coming from,\u201d Mr. Simien recalled in an interview at the Netflix offices in Manhattan late last month. \u201cIt was like they\u2019d watched the show just enough to give their readers the impression that they\u2019d watched it and then came up with the most insane interpretations. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t get it, it was that they refused to get it.\u201dMr. Simien, who speaks in paragraphs and variously quoted Malcolm X, Eckhart Tolle and RuPaul, discussed why the new season never mentions President Trump by name, what black auteurs owe to their audiences and his upcoming horror film about a (literal) killer weave.\u201cAny chance you get as a storyteller to make people see something that they never saw before, or to think in a new way \u2014 that\u2019s the job,\u201d he said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.There was some controversy over the title of the show last season, and this season the Sam character, who hosts a radio show within the show, also called \u201cDear White People,\u201d deals with her own similar controversy. How did you digest all of the feedback from Season 1?When you\u2019re investigating those questions on the show, do you worry that white people will just choose not to engage?I think the key to the show is making you care about the characters first, because it\u2019s not a thesis. And if we tell the truth about what they\u2019re going through, then maybe you\u2019ll care and think about it.And the other thing is to make people who\u2019ve actually gone through these experiences go: \u201cOh my God, totally. I\u2019m so glad someone finally put it that way.\u201d I think both of those things allow black folks to feel more human in society.What do you make of the idea that obsessive focus on identity is inherently divisive, and that minorities would be better served by a politics that focuses on what we all have in common?I think people who are privileged can say something like that. Because the truth is, I could walk around all day saying: \u201cI don\u2019t identify with being black. I don\u2019t identify with being gay.\u201d But you know what\u2019s going to happen to me? Society\u2019s going to happen to me. I\u2019m going to go into Starbucks and get arrested, or I\u2019m going to walk through the wrong neighborhood in a hoodie.When you don\u2019t have to have the burden of identity, when you don\u2019t have to code switch every day or constantly be aware of your surroundings, you get to say that. Part of the reason the show is called \u201cDear White People\u201d is because there\u2019s no way to be black in America without constantly having to explain or protect or defend yourself. Talking about that is not why Donald Trump is president.The new season doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name. Why not?I just didn\u2019t want to say his name. I didn\u2019t want to give it that kind of power. I think the underlying issues that brought about the Trump presidency are American issues, and they\u2019ve been around before Trump and they\u2019ll be around after Trump.Being on Netflix, do you get much data about who\u2019s watching you?They keep things pretty close to the chest, but I know that Brazilians like us and I know that we\u2019re big in Africa. In Africa they really hated [the Kenyan immigrant character, played by Jeremy Tardy] Rashid\u2019s accent last year [laughs].Is the actor African? He is African. And his accent is based on an actual Kenyan accent, but people thought it was too sing-songy. So we brought in the woman who was the dialect coach for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to give it some flavor and some nuance. But I\u2019m sure people will still be mad.I remember reading this article about how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d had failed the queer community by not expressing LGBT issues. And I was like, but it did so many things! It\u2019s literally changed cinema for black people forever, and was an all-black cast, and made all the money in the world, and introduced African themes, and is opening in Saudia Arabia \u2026 but we didn\u2019t have gay characters. So let\u2019s just throw the whole thing away. That kind of thing can be a lot. But it\u2019s the cost of telling stories in an oppressive society. You have to be prepared to take some of those jabs and you do the best that you can.Your next movie, \u201cBad Hair,\u201d is about a woman who\u2019s possessed by a sentient killer weave. Where\u2019d you get the idea?I always write because I\u2019m really angry about something, and I was so angry that people weren\u2019t seeing how black women are getting it from all angles. [If you\u2019re a black woman,] you\u2019re at the bottom of the totem pole, even though black women are always among the strongest members of our society and culture.I was also really inspired by Korean horror movies, because hair possession is a subgenre there. I was just thinking, \u201cHow would we do this in America?\u201d And of course it couldn\u2019t just be fun \u2014 I always have to have something to say.Advertisement"}

Instead, it may soon play out in real life, with Comcast, led by Brian L. Roberts, trying to pry the bulk of 21st Century Fox away from Disney and its chief executive, Robert A. Iger. \u201cIt will be a bloody battle,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst.But Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, thinks it has a new opening.Cue the battle royale.Here is what you need to know as the tension mounts.How serious is Comcast about a potential hostile bid?At the same time, it\u2019s possible nothing comes of that maneuvering. Comcast, which declined to comment, is waiting for the outcome of the AT&T case to make up its mind.Exactly what are the Fox assets?Why does Comcast want the Fox assets so badly?It boils down to this: Comcast, like Disney, wants to add bulk as a counterattack against Netflix and other tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business.\u201cThere will only be a handful of global, scale players,\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a research report on May 9. \u201cWe think Disney and Comcast increasingly view Fox as the seminal defining point, and this the moment in time, in determining which company ascends to that role.\u201dNBCUniversal has been white hot \u2014 revenue soared 21 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier \u2014 and its portfolio includes the fastest-growing cable network (MSNBC) and the No. 1 cable entertainment network (USA). In the longer term, however, NBCUniversal likely needs a bigger content war chest to compete against Netflix, Amazon, Apple and their ilk.How is Disney likely to respond to a Comcast bid?Comcast has some deal baggage. A 2015 attempt to buy Time Warner Cable collapsed under pressure from regulators, who found that the combined company would have had the power and incentive to inhibit the future of streaming video.If the AT&T deal goes through, does that mean easy regulatory sailing for a potential Comcast-Fox union?No. Timothy Horan, an analyst at Oppenheimer who has expressed support for a Comcast move on Fox, wrote in a May 9 research note that approval for the AT&T deal would help open a regulatory path but that Comcast would still face a \u201cdifficult\u201d road.Antitrust experts note that Comcast-Fox would have more overlapping businesses than AT&T-Time Warner. Comcast-Fox would also control more of the overall entertainment supply chain \u2014 \u201ca content and distribution superpower like we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d as Mr. Nathanson put it in a phone interview.Comcast has a bigger broadband business than AT&T, which could raise government concerns that Comcast could use that power to hurt competitors, especially as the internet grows in importance as a video pipe, some analysts say.Comcast shares have dropped 24 percent since late January. Does the apparent lack of shareholder support for a Fox bid mean Comcast will back off?No. Comcast does not need shareholder approval for a cash offer. Moreover, Comcast executives probably see the decline as temporary and not entirely related to the hostile bid rumblings. Comcast\u2019s cable competitor Charter has seen its shares decline about 28 percent over the same period.Does Comcast have the money to make a hostile bid?The company would borrow to make a cash offer, and banks are willing. Comcast has healthy financials.It would, however, mean taking on an amount of debt \u2014 at least $164 billion \u2014 that Moody\u2019s last week called \u201cstaggering\u201d and said would probably imperil Comcast\u2019s A3 credit rating.\u201cThat sounds like a nearly impossible level of debt to sustain,\u201d Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, wrote in a recent report. But he argued that it was not as scary upon a closer look. Given Fox synergies and cash flow, \u201cNet debt by the end of 2020 would drop to below $130 billion \u2014 essentially in line with a combined AT&T Time Warner.\u201dWhere does this leave Fox shareholders?In the catbird seat. Even if Disney ultimately wins \u2014 as Mr. Nathanson predicts \u2014 Comcast can drive up the price.He added, \u201cOur directors, though, of course, are aware of their fiduciary duties on behalf of all shareholders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Louis C.K.Supported byShe spoke with me this week by phone from her home in Los Angeles, which she shares with her wife, Stephanie Allynne, and their twin boys, who are nearly 2. Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.There\u2019s a real sweetness to this special. I was struck that there was no mention of #MeToo, which was very fresh when the special was filmed. Was that a conscious choice? We would have very gladly done another season if given a chance. There\u2019s also something really nice about moving on from a show that had been tied to such a negative person who was producing it, even though before the pilot was shot, I was trying to distance myself from him. It was certainly like, \u201cOh that\u2019s a bummer,\u201d but it was also a relief.Any chances of doing another show?I just want to do things that come naturally and feel good. I don\u2019t want to be, \u201cUgh, I want to get another show out there.\u201d I don\u2019t feel that way at all. My wife, Stephanie, and I really love working together; we\u2019ve been developing and writing other projects. We have one particular very, very big project that should be announced any second. [The project they are writing, \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d a forthcoming Netflix film starring Jennifer Aniston as the president and Ms. Notaro as her wife, the first lady, was announced Friday.]Regarding that negative person \u2014 Louis C.K. \u2014 how did it affect things at Amazon?He wasn\u2019t involved, but his name was on it. That brought a lot of power, even if he wasn\u2019t working on it day to day. His people were involved day to day. I do want to give credit to Amazon. Amazon let us make exactly the show we wanted to make.Any examples of how that power was exerted?I don\u2019t want to go much into it. But one of the most powerful people in comedy was executive producer on the show, and the networks and studios were excited to have him. I meanwhile had found out he\u2019s not who I thought he was, and so I wanted that separation.We were in production on a TV show that was trying to crack that open and have that discussion and have the light shining on this behavior. Nobody in the \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d writers\u2019 room thought for a second that this was being teed up at the same time as this huge movement was about to rear its head. We were shocked, and we were elated. I hope it continues. There are different signs that this is not stopping. I don\u2019t think that anger and frustration and those feelings can go away. I hope they don\u2019t. The attention and support for the victims needs to be continued, more than people worried about these abusers and what\u2019s next for them, how are they going to move on \u2014 shut up.What do you make of talk about if or how these disgraced men should come back?You know what? If any of these people come back, I would say, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see who is actually going to support them.\u201d That is going to be the glaring horror. Who is going to be, like, \u201cThis is a pressing issue, and we need to get them back?\u201d If a janitor was so great at cleaning the building but also tended to masturbate in front of people, would the people at that building be like, \u201cYes, he masturbated, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone clean so thoroughly, and I was just wondering when he\u2019s going to get his job back, he\u2019s so good at it.\u201d No, it would be, \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d It\u2019s fame and power that people are blinded by.Do you see yourself as having played a significant role in bringing his misdeeds to light? Did you get support afterward?No, I think it\u2019s just having knowledge that there\u2019s an abusive person, and I knew several people in that article. They\u2019re friends of mine, and I know the utter hell \u2014 utter hell \u2014 they\u2019ve been put through. I don\u2019t need public support and I\u2019m not doing it for that, but I did get private texts and emails from people.How, from your point of view, has the comedy scene embraced or pushed back against #MeToo? One of the things we have heard from some of the women who came forth about what happened to them with Louis C.K. was how little the comedy world supported them, with you being a notable exception. Why do you think that was?I think people are friends with him and know he might be back. I think that\u2019s an unfortunate thing that controls people.Advertisement"}

Standing on the festival\u2019s carpeted staircase, lined with photographers and camera crews, Ms. Blanchett added, \u201cLadies, let\u2019s climb!\u201dThe reverberations of #MeToo are shaking up Cannes, now in the midst of its annual 11-day jamboree, where glitter and megayachts abound. But if the world\u2019s most prestigious cinema competition is reckoning with the industry\u2019s dark past, Cannes also must deal with its own present-day deficits. Of the 21 films vying for the Palme d\u2019Or this year, for example, programmers picked only three directed by women.While he was absent this year, the sexualized atmosphere of his heyday remains. Outside the festival\u2019s seafront headquarters, young women in hot pants roller skate around distributing copies of a fashion magazine. Aspiring actresses appear on and off the red carpet in see-through or low-cut dresses in the hopes of attracting the attention of male producers, directors, talent scouts and photographers.It is well known among festival attendees that escorts ply their trade in the lobbies of Cannes\u2019 upmarket hotels. Within 10 minutes of entering one, a reporter was approached by two women, one of whom told him she would go back to his apartment in exchange for 600 euros, or about $700.\u201cCinema is a world that is founded on desire: the desire of producers and directors to make movies with this or that actress, the desire of spectators to watch those movies \u2014 and that desire is based, also, on physical attraction,\u201d Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, France\u2019s junior minister for gender equality, said in an interview. When combined with \u201cpower, visibility, notoriety and money,\u201d she said, the result is \u201ca cocktail of factors\u201d that could lead to excesses.The reports about Mr. Weinstein were embarrassing to Cannes when they surfaced in October. The organization\u2019s president, Pierre Lescure, and artistic director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, said in a statement at the time that they were \u201cdismayed\u201d by the charges against someone who was \u201ca familiar figure\u201d at the festival.\u201cThese actions point to a pattern of behavior that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation,\u201d they said, adding that they hoped the case would \u201chelp us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.\u201dAnd while Mr. Fr\u00e9maux, the artistic director, has acknowledged criticisms of gender imbalance at Cannes, he also has said that films are chosen on merit and that he opposes the idea of pro-women quotas and \u201cpositive discrimination.\u201dStill, a new attitude toward gender equality, and the abuse of power, has been conspicuous throughout the festival.At the American pavilion, an independently operated tent where experienced and emerging filmmakers come together, visitors were required to sign an electronic form warning that their membership could be revoked if they committed harassment.The hotline is another widely publicized new feature. Operators would not say how many calls they had received, but according to Ms. Schiappa, the gender-equality minister, the service had already arranged for a woman to be accompanied to the police station to file a complaint.And the festival\u2019s choice of Ms. Blanchett as jury president was not accidental: She is one of the campaigners who helped establish the Time\u2019s Up organization against sexual harassment.On Monday, Mr. Fr\u00e9maux and the heads of the festival\u2019s two sidebar sections (Directors\u2019 Fortnight and Critics\u2019 Week) signed a charter committing to gender equality and vowed to publish gender breakdowns of the number of films submitted to the festival each year and to reveal the composition of the selection committees. The organization behind the red-carpet rally on Saturday had been seeking such commitments since 2013.One explanation offered for the lack of female directors at Cannes is that they simply produce fewer movies, a fact that has brought calls for government support for female filmmakers in France. While 52 percent of its population is female, only 23 percent of its directors are women, according to the group that staged the rally. \u201cA society that doesn\u2019t represent itself equitably is a sick society,\u201d Ms. Husson said.\u201cI\u2019m super-enthusiastic, because the other way of looking at things is that everything remains to be done,\u201d Ms. Husson said. \u201cA golden era could now begin.

But the finish line is a different story: The only New York horse to win was Funny Cide, in 2003.It won\u2019t be easy, though. Richard Leahy, the owner of Oak Bluff Stables, who has been in the business for more than three decades, told us, \u201cThis is the most competitive Kentucky Derby that I can remember.\u201dAudible was born in 2015 to Blue Devil Bel, a mare from New York, and Into Mischief, a stallion from Kentucky.A newborn horse, referred to as a foal, is typically nursed by its mother during the first year.

{"Headline": "Israel Feels Pride but Senses Peril as U.S. Moves Embassy", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 When Israel declared its independence in 1948, President Harry Truman rushed to recognize it. He took just 11 minutes, and Israelis, about to go to war to defend their infant state, were euphoric.Seventy years to the day \u2014 and nearly as long since Israel declared the holy city of Jerusalem its \u201ceternal capital\u201d \u2014 the United States will formally open its embassy on a hilltop here two miles south of the Western Wall.Israelis find it hard to rejoice when they find themselves doing some of the same things they did back in 1948: listening for civil-defense sirens, readying bomb shelters and calling in reinforcements to confront threats to the north, south and east.Now, in East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, Israeli border police and troops are bracing for expressions of pent-up frustration, impatience and rage \u2014 at the United States for seeming to dispense with any pretense at balance; at Israel for its continuing occupation; at the Palestinian Authority for its weakness and corruption; and at the peace process itself, for inspiring hopes that have again and again proved false.\u201cIf you look at it from the outside, you\u2019d see one of the most dramatic success stories of the 20th century,\u201d said the historian Tom Segev, author of a new biography of Israel\u2019s founding prime minister, \u201cDavid Ben-Gurion: A State at All Costs.\u201dWith Israel so strong and its Jewish population larger than ever, Mr. Segev said, \u201cIt\u2019s really the realization of Ben-Gurion\u2019s dream. But at the same time, the future is very bleak, and some of the problems he left us remain unresolved.\u201dIt is hard for Israeli Jews to feel entirely at ease when they remain so estranged from one another and the nearly two million Arab citizens at home, and from millions of people next door: A lasting settlement with the Palestinians seems as elusive as it has been in more than a generation.However besieged many Israelis may feel, objectively Israel has never been more powerful, in almost any sense of the word.Warming relations with Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states are even buoying hopes that Israel could begin to expand its tiny circle of friends in the region.Monday\u2019s move of the American mission to a fortified former consulate along the seam between East and West Jerusalem, from a beachfront bastion in Tel Aviv, is freighted with symbolism in manifold ways.Many Israelis see the relocation of the embassy as simply acknowledging that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital. But Palestinians, who hope to see the eastern part of Jerusalem become the capital of a Palestinian state, see the move as an abdication of any vestige of American impartiality in determining the region\u2019s future.The relocation of the chief American outpost from liberal Tel Aviv, a blue dot on the red political map of Israel, to a capital city that has largely replaced its secular Israeli population with a more religious one, neatly mirrors what is happening to support for Israel in the United States.President Trump has gone further than perhaps any of his predecessors to support Israel and its right-wing leader, and no American president has done more to bestow gifts on an Israeli leader than he has.Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a senior adviser on the Middle East, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are among the high-ranking representatives sent by the administration to attend Monday\u2019s opening ceremony. Israel said all 86 countries with diplomatic missions in the country were invited to the event, and 33 confirmed attendance.To Palestinians, the official unveiling of the embassy is just the most concrete and latest in a cavalcade of provocations from Washington and the Israeli government.\u201cIt\u2019s might makes right,\u201d said Hind Khoury, a former diplomat for the Palestine Liberation Organization who now heads a sustainable development nonprofit based in Bethlehem. Not only are Palestinians now expected to forget about Jerusalem, she said, but also the losses of their homes in 1948 and again in the fighting of 1967.\u201cAccept Israel\u2019s presence and dominance,\u201d she said. \u201cAccept home demolitions and expulsions and dispossession.\u201cAccept the uprooting of our olive trees, the violence of settlers,\u201d she continued, picking up steam. \u201cAccept settlements. Accept Israel\u2019s control of all the Jordan Valley, and using it for its economic benefit. Accept that Israel didn\u2019t live up to any of its commitments. Accept the siege of Gaza. Accept that East Jerusalem doesn\u2019t belong to us anymore. Accept the racist legislation that Israel passes; that we\u2019re prisoners in our land: I can\u2019t get a visa because we\u2019re \u2018all terrorists.\u2019 Accept the use of \u2018anti-Semitism\u2019 to fight anybody who wants to support Palestinian rights.\u201d\u201cThese are things we have to accept, or we\u2019ll just get more hell,\u201d she said, before adding: \u201cMaybe I speak more like a mother and grandmother, but it\u2019s so sinful to give such a legacy to the next generation.\u201dFor Israeli Jews, a different set of grievances is being assuaged and activated by Monday\u2019s embassy opening and all it stirs up.The American-Israeli author Yossi Klein Halevi, whose new book \u201cLetters to My Palestinian Neighbor\u201d is being published on Tuesday, sees the embassy move as a \u201crare moment of compensation\u201d for what he called \u201cthe campaign to deny any Jewish connection to Jerusalem\u201d \u2014 one expressed in votes of Unesco, or in the speeches of Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, when he invokes the Christian and Muslim attachment to Jerusalem but pointedly omits any Jewish one.\u201cThere\u2019s this deep resentment among Israelis about the war against our history and our rootedness in this city,\u201d Mr. Halevi said.Still, noting that his book \u201cabout reconciliation with my Palestinian neighbors is coming out at one of the worst moments in the tortured history of our relationship,\u201d Mr. Halevi said he wished the embassy move could be accompanied by some kind of \u201caffirmation by both Israel and the United States of the Palestinian presence in the city we share.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be laying out blueprints,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re far from that. But there should be a clear stating of our recognition that we\u2019re not alone in Jerusalem. This would be an apt moment for a generous Israeli statement.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s advocacy against the Iran deal during the Obama administration did much to sour Jewish Democrats on the Israeli leader. His abandonment of a painstakingly negotiated deal to give Reform and Conservative Jews a bigger stake in Jewish life in Israel, and approval of a measure granting the Orthodox chief rabbinate\u2019s monopoly over conversions to Judaism in Israel, drove a wedge between liberal American Jews and Israeli religious leaders.Other policies, like efforts to deport African migrants, and a continuing legislative attack by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s political allies on democratic institutions like Israel\u2019s Supreme Court, have only added to many liberal Americans\u2019 discomfort with Israel.In effect, as the Trump administration gives physical expression to its affection for Israel, a rift appears to be widening between the world\u2019s two main centers of Jewish life.The immediate threats to Israeli security could of course fizzle. The rift between American and Israeli Jews could heal with a new administration in either place, if not before. Even the risk posed by the embassy move could prove no more dampening to the celebration, in retrospect, than the smashing of a glass at a Jewish wedding.And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Middle East peace process \u201cis most decidedly not dead,\u201d despite the embassy move, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the United States still hopes to be able to \u201cachieve a successful outcome\u201d to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Segev, the biographer, said he had learned in his research that Ben-Gurion had never cared much for Jerusalem, and had refrained from trying to take the city in 1948 in part because he knew it would be difficult to guard its Old City from extremists.In that sense, Mr. Segev said, little seems to have changed.\u201cThat\u2019s what Jerusalem is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s been a problem the last 3,000 years.

Wearing a black ball cap and denim jacket, he was in a good mood, often breaking into deep, rolling laughter. \u201cI\u2019ve always had fun at Cannes,\u201d he said, soon after sitting down. \u201cThis is the world\u2019s greatest film festival \u2014 it\u2019s like when people come to Madison Square Garden to see the Knicks \u2014 this is the mecca.\u201d\u201cSpike, I\u2019ve got this script,\u201d Mr. Lee recalled Mr. Peele saying. \u201cI want you to take a look at it.\u2019\u201d Mr. Lee said that there was a lot that already worked in it (Mr. Peele is among the producers of the film) but that he along with one of his co-writers, Kevin Willmott, had to put their stamp on it. \u201cJordan Peele and his guys came to me because they wanted a Spike Lee Joint.\u201dTo do so, Mr. Lee continued, he and Mr. Willmott had to link Mr. Stallworth\u2019s story with the present. \u201cIt cannot be just a history lesson,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt has to be contemporary. So that was the hip thing that we did. Otherwise it\u2019s a period piece. We had to connect David Duke to Agent Orange today.\u201dThis is the name Mr. Lee uses to refer to President Trump, whom he did not mention by name during our conversation. Mr. Lee happily credits the musician Busta Rhymes for the nickname Agent Orange, a toxic defoliant used by the American military during the Vietnam War: \u201cShoutout to Busta,\u201d he said, laughing.Mr. Lee worked with colleagues who have helped him turn his vision into cinema before, including Terence Blanchard, his longtime composer. For this film, though, he brought on a new cinematographer, Chayse Irvin, who shot Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade.\u201d\u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d has a great, strange story that keeps you off balance \u2014 you seek footing as it shifts between comedy and horror \u2014 but it also has moments of serene loveliness. When a guest of the student union, Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael), begins speaking about black beauty, Mr. Lee folds in floating close-ups of men and women whose halo-like Afros create a sense of near-holiness.\u201cI wanted to show black is beautiful,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNot to denigrate anyone else, but white America has been told through 100 years-plus of cinema that white people are the epitome of beauty, the standard.\u201d\u201cWhat got me mad,\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cis that they only talked about Griffith and not the effect that film had. \u2018The Birth of a Nation,\u2019 undeniably, led to the rebirth of the Klan. So you can see, directly or indirectly, people were killed because of that film. It never came up.\u201dWhile he was a student, Mr. Lee made a short, \u201cThe Answer,\u201d about an African-American screenwriter who\u2019s hired for a remake of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201d Mr. Lee said that his teachers weren\u2019t pleased with his film and that he was almost expelled. He is now a tenured professor at N.Y.U., and while he doesn\u2019t show \u201cBirth\u201d to his students, he thinks it should be seen with the right historical context.The intensity with which Mr. Lee spoke about Mr. Trump and Charlottesville finds a corollary in a section of \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d that incorporates some of the rally\u2019s most agonizing images. These include the death of Heather D. Heyer, who had been part of an anti-racism counterprotest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excerpts From the Art Leaders Network Conference", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to Berlin it\u2019s the historic density of the city that is attracting talent over time and always has been. I was born and raised in West Berlin, and I was 10 when the wall came down.And I think this iconic, symbolic moment of the Iron Curtain being torn apart in Berlin touched people across the globe, and still gives them the shivers when they come to Berlin and see the historic dimension here.I think this is very much some of the advantage of Berlin when it comes to showing the roots of the cultural city here.Director, UCCA, BeijingI moved to Beijing in 2001. I arrived the week before 9/11, right out of college to study Chinese. What\u2019s allowed Beijing to become a global art center in these past 18 years: It\u2019s about the fact that there is a significant community of artists, but it\u2019s also about an ecology that kind of builds on itself year after year.So if you look around today you have institutions, you have auction houses, you have galleries, you have media, you have critics, you have independent curators, and you have collectors. And you need all of these ingredients, and they tend to impact each other in a sort of positive feedback loop.President and chief executive, Pace GalleryWhy are art galleries expanding, why are they opening galleries all over the world? It\u2019s driven by the community dynamics that they don\u2019t want to come to us. They don\u2019t want this exclusive experience.They\u2019re very happy to come to us, but they want to see us come to them. So we started going to Palo Alto about almost 15 years ago.And from our lessons \u2014 like our lessons in Beijing and around the world \u2014 you realize that you must become part of that community. You have to have something to offer that community.It is about connecting with the artists, connecting with historians, and also seeing how the galleries connect with a broader public. Because that\u2019s what in particular in a place like Palo Alto or a place like Shenzhen the interest is in \u2014 how do we touch millions and millions of people, which is something that the art world historically hasn\u2019t put a huge focus on. So that becomes extremely important.Director, Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonRight from the beginning, museums like the V&A had this very popular, democratic, civic function. And arguably they slightly lost their way in the mid-20th century, when they became very introverted, scholastic, overly academic in terms of their approach to the public. So we are going back to our founding mission.But the tactic we take is that we don\u2019t give an inch on curatorial excellence, that actually what the public comes to museums and pays quite large sums of money to see is the insides of curatorial talent and skill alongside the collections. We will move heaven and earth to make it as accessible as possible.But you\u2019ve got to have the balance. We cannot be a theme park. We cannot be a venue-for-hire. Scholarship and curatorial scholarship has to absolutely be at the heart of it. Owner, David Zwirner GalleryThe primary motivation to grow is to further the artists\u2019 audience. So what we do as a gallery, first and foremost, we are representing artists and artist estates. And our job is to bring that work to not just those places that are already familiar with it, but also the places that are not familiar with the work.You need more touchpoints where you can inform people about what the artists are doing that we represent.And of course, ideally, you do that in a gallery setting where you present an exhibition.But art fairs are very important, and, you know, it\u2019s a great way to get to know new people and to present one\u2019s program across the world.The audience is actually changing. The socioeconomic mix is totally different. It\u2019s much younger than it used to be. And subsequently, different types of people are coming into the gallery, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.Of course, the gallery is for free, so people should come.Chief executive, ColnaghiI was reading some materials prepared for the panel this morning and noticed that in 2017 the highest-attended exhibition globally was ancient Buddhist sculptures in Tokyo \u2014 nearly 12,000 people a day coming to see ancient Japanese sculptures.So in a way I think that we don\u2019t have a job to do that is engaged in singling out the old versus the new. We have a job to do in terms of defining access and inclusion across the entire spectrum of our programmatic mission fulfillment.And so our ability to tell expansive stories in the ancient world, in the old master world, and the contemporary world, I think the obligation is exactly the same.But I also think that in general times \u2014 and I know that there are certain people here in the audience that have dealt with this \u2014 experience has also become more interesting than possession. That is a challenge \u2014 how do we as, in my case a dealer, find people that actually still want to possess something? Chairman, Americas, Sotheby\u2019sForty percent of our new clients in the recent years are under 40 years old, so it\u2019s a very young demographic. About 40 percent of their spend is on Western art. And that\u2019s really interesting to us.The billionaires in Asia tend to be about 20 years younger than billionaires in the West, so that\u2019s also another kind of support statistic for a much younger demographic.Chairwoman, Qatar Museums board of trusteesI think with the National Museum of Qatar we\u2019ve been always reluctant to announce an opening date just because of the complexity of the museum. It\u2019s finished in terms of building. The construction is complete. The collection is in place.If a museum in the West is delayed, nobody really talks about it or cares. The moment a museum in the Middle East is delayed, it\u2019s front page headlines. So for us, we want to make sure that we open it correctly as opposed to opening it on the day that we have previously announced.So we\u2019re not challenged by the idea of reflecting on our project and deciding when to really open it. I think, currently, we\u2019re looking at opening the building in March of \u201919 \u2014 so from December to March is not really that much of a delay.President and chief executive, Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe Metropolitan went through a process of careful review of our facilities and developed a master plan about five or six years ago and within that plan we identified a lot of deferred maintenance issues that had to be addressed, that had built over the course of five decades. I\u2019m talking about over $800 million dollars\u2019 worth of deferred maintenance.And we needed a plan to deal with what we already had and the consequence of expansion over the course of the last five decades that was very extensive.The modern and contemporary art facilities we have now are not worthy of the rest of the Metropolitan. It\u2019s not substantial enough for our existing collection and it has all kinds of infrastructure problems. So I think one of the lessons in this discussion is, what does it take to actually produce an expansion project?One has to be as thoughtful and focused about priorities, to be a good client for the architect and for ourselves and I think when we began this project several years ago we had lots of good ideas. That\u2019s great. But if you have too many of them, the project gets increasingly complex, increasingly expensive, increasingly unwieldy. Our budgets are now in order and we have a very good plan.Founding partner, Diller, Scofidio + RenfroMy studio took on the MoMA expansion project because we knew that MoMA really, really needed to transform. It needed to expand to show more of its collection because a lot of its collection is behind closed doors.Secondly, it\u2019s interface with the city was really not very good. How could MoMA be better in its current manifestation and how could it show more work in better ways, in deeper ways? The whole variety of work, things that it was not able to show because of limitations.So, you know, I\u2019ve been doing this with all my heart and I have full belief that the project is going to be a big improvement.ArtistAlmost everything in the studio is influenced by computers nowadays. The artists who work there work with computers; the architects are trained on computers. So it\u2019s hard to imagine running the studio without technology, so to speak.We have a number of things going on in the research which are related to technology, such as playing with VR. And we\u2019re very active on the social media. And it turns out that, for instance, the home page, when we finally got around to checking how many people actually visit the home page, there\u2019s more people visiting the home page than going to the exhibitions.So some years ago we took the home page much more seriously, realizing, my God, this is our space, this is a way to have a dialogue with people that is otherwise not really appreciated. So gradually we have become incredibly influenced by technology.ArtistFor me, the art I love is always political. Picasso is very political to me. All those important artists, they always have very political opinions. Duchamps is very political to me. He became very intellectual.If you talk about Medieval art or Renaissance, good art always has to have a strong content, giving new definition to aesthetics \u2014 you know, having a strong moral manifesto and always having a strong philosophy behind it.Managing partner, Klaris Law; chief executive, KlarisIPThere\u2019s a number of ways that VR can be used. One is, artists adopting a new medium. But what I can imagine is that this world will draw from moviemakers, from photographers, from VR people, young people who grow up in a space. And so as you look at the categories of artists you also have to look at the way the different fields monetize their content, right?I mean, in the art world traditionally you take an object and you sell it for a given price, and that exchange is it. And then that object gets sold again to another person at another time, and that\u2019s it. The artist gets paid only the first time.However, in the movie business the relationship with your art might change very much. You might get paid every time the thing is sold or distributed. It might be a piece of VR that\u2019s going down on Netflix, and in your home you\u2019re wearing your goggles. So the artist could be getting a royalty as opposed to a single-sale payment.Partner, Khora ContemporaryI think we are moving in the direction of virtual reality, in general, technology, being part of our everyday life. We see now how museums have embraced VR, we saw the Tate with the Modigliani show, where they reproduced Modigliani\u2019s studio, which was quite talked about and popular, and drew quite a lot of younger crowds, who maybe were not familiar with the artist.You have virtual museums where private collectors put their artworks into a virtual world so you can approach the works and see them in a virtual space, without having to actually physically go to the museum.I always ask myself how would my kids want to experience art. What would draw them to a museum? In our family we all come from the art world, so it forces them to look at art. But they perceive art in a completely different way if it\u2019s done with the aid of technology, whether we like it or not. And I think this is the future, and this is an opportunity for us to draw the younger generations to museums, to art galleries.Director of the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkI think the real issue for all of us in the museum world is to learn to think digitally, so that what we\u2019re talking about is not simply the transformation of certain kinds of stories into different formats, or the use of new technologies to deliver those stories, but to fundamentally rethink how we think, to move away from the kind of analogue art history that we were all taught \u2014 hierarchical, sequential, to a more networked reconsidered manner of actually presenting works of art, so that we begin to move into a realm where the way in which we look at art, the way in which we display art, actually is no longer so analogue.And I think one of the great advents of digital technology is that it has begun to teach us how to imagine different relationships between objects and between viewers and objects.I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve seen our demographics change dramatically from an average age of a little over 50 to an average age of under 40 has been because we\u2019ve recognized what people who are younger want to do when they go to a museum. They want to be with each other, and talk, and think, and text, and create a kind of continuum of experience.Chief executive, PhillipsEssentially it is a very collaborative business. I mean, we\u2019re all sitting here in this room, we all know each other. We\u2019re sitting here with museum directors, gallery owners, auction house people. There\u2019s a huge amount of shared resolve I suppose, and shared experience.And all that comes together quite often to create business opportunities in our world. And I\u2019ve always believed that the most successful people in our business are the people who do collaborate \u2014 legally of course, for most \u2014 and there are huge opportunities for dealers to work with auction houses.Capital and finance and the amounts of money that are now required \u2014 I mean, most dealers find it very difficult to get anywhere near because of the sums of money required. Auction houses are a source of funding for deals, etc., etc.So, yeah, we are in a different world, and I think inevitably we\u2019ve been collaborating more and more closely for some time.Chairman of Christie\u2019s AmericasI think that we\u2019re both competitors and collaborators. I would draw a distinction though between the secondary market and the primary market. I agree that the primary market is no place for auction houses, and that it requires a completely different structure in order to build the careers of artists.I think when it comes to the secondary market it is very much a place for auction houses in the guise of private sales, and that there should be no distinction, and that the global footprint of either the great galleries or the auction houses provide equally good distribution options for the clients.Sometimes we compete, and sometimes we collaborate. But at the end of the line it\u2019s two very different professions.Being a gallery, being in auction houses have two different motivations, two different goals. But I think there are places where it\u2019s a very fruitful collaboration.Excerpts from the Art Leaders Network conference have been condensed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tour of Small-Town Sicily", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerA sampling of the island\u2019s beautiful vistas, ancient culture and what might be the best gelato in the world.The rain lightly pelted my window just as dawn was breaking on the Ionian Sea. I was lying snugly in my hotel bed in Syracuse, the venerable, ancient city on the eastern coast of Sicily. I dozed off for another hour or so before I was awakened once more by morning light through the balcony window. Does travel get any better than this? I thought. I sat up and set my feet down on the floor. Wet. It was very wet. Rain had leaked in and flooded nearly half of my hotel room. To make matter worse, I had unwisely laid my laptop on the floor, along with my phone. I leapt to my feet, panicking, and ran to get the hair dryer.My exploration of the island on a sunny, slightly windy afternoon took me to the western edge, where I walked up Foro Vittorio Emmanuele II, a long waterside promenade with plenty of pedestrian activity and even a few carnival-like games. I eventually found myself in the stunning, expansive Piazza del Duomo, a large plaza with the 7th-century Cathedral of Syracuse as its focal point. I took a quick tour (2 euros) of its rustic interior, which includes relics from St. Lucia, the patron saint of the city, including a bone from her left arm.For my cone (2.50 euros), I had one scoop of chocolate and one of almond with cinnamon \u2014 each intensely flavorful and impeccably smooth. I also sampled torrone (nougat) and ricotta, the latter of which perfectly balanced sweetness and tangy sharpness. But the gelato wasn\u2019t the only star at Caff\u00e8 Sicilia. A cassatina (4 euros), which resembled a small cake, was wrapped in a colorful marzipan casing and about as perfect a version as I could have hoped for. A cannolo (3 euros) stuffed with ethereal sheep\u2019s milk ricotta was wrapped in a light, flaky shell that wasn\u2019t remotely greasy or heavy. I took my treats to go, though plenty of people were eating in the small, quiet dining room.One of the elements that distinguishes Caff\u00e8 Sicilia is its use of local produce, an area where Sicily really shines. I went out past the Porta Reale di Noto on the eastern end of the city, a large structure resembling L\u2019Arc de Triomphe, and bought a bag of Sicilian bitter almonds (3.50 euros) and some dried Sicilian tomatoes (2 euros) from some roadside vendors.While frugal traveling is certainly about saving money, it\u2019s also about getting great value: L\u2019Oste e Il Sacrestano provided a meal I would have paid twice the price for.Advertisement"}

Trapped, he apparently swallowed his qualms and killed her. In the final scene, he crawled into bed next to his girlfriend, grimaced and said to himself: \u201cStarting n\u2014\u201d Cut to black.\u201cBarry\u201d will likely be one of the best new series I see all year, so I should be happy. And I am, mostly, I guess.At the same time, this doesn\u2019t feel like a series that should stretch on more than a few seasons. \u201cBarry\u201d commits to a bold premise, but could you sustain it for six years, seven, more?Either Barry is capable of change or he\u2019s not. If he is, that seems like material for one more very good season or two. If he\u2019s not, and the series brings him back into the criminal life, then the character\u2019s drive (you, and Barry, want him to redeem himself) is at odds with the needs of the plot (you, and the network, want the story to keep going).But there\u2019s a hitch. June (Elisabeth Moss) ended the first season as she ended the novel, headed either for rescue or punishment. The series decided to make it both: First, she was brought to a horrific mock execution, then was liberated by the resistance, then was recaptured. There is only so long, in a series about bondage and rape, that you can string out the cycle of raising and dashing hopes without numbing or traumatizing your audience.Wanting a good series not to last too long is a high-class problem, and a fairly recent one. In the early decades of TV, series were endless, until they ended. This was fine, since most shows essentially returned every episode to the status quo ante. (Or, in the case of a soap like \u201cDallas,\u201d the absurdity of endless plot twists was taken for granted.) A story might get tired but it wouldn\u2019t really get old, because TV took place in a time warp where time didn\u2019t pass.In the cable era, TV got more ambitious and more serial. Things changed by the end of an episode. Characters would be in very different circumstances a few years after we met them. Once TV was telling stories that changed, it suggested that the stories needed to end, properly, rather than just stop.And when it passed that date \u2014 whew, could you smell it. Take \u201cDexter.\u201d Like \u201cBarry,\u201d it was about a murderer for whom we had mixed sympathies (a serial killer who tried to follow a code to whack only deserving victims). The first season was excellent, and popular. So it had another, and another, and another, stringing itself out for eight seasons of implausible dilemmas until its final mercy-killing.\u201cThe Office\u201d should have departed when Michael Scott did. You may be a bigger fan of the later seasons of \u201cHomeland\u201d than I am, but had it ended after its first, it would have been a legend.In part, this situation is the side effect of a good thing: With more TV outlets serving more-targeted audiences, a daring, unconventional show has a decent chance of surviving. With dozens of cable outlets and the seemingly bottomless pockets of Netflix and Amazon (soon to be joined by Apple), TV is becoming a \u201cmore\u201d machine. TV series are becoming like athletes going on a season or three past when they should have retired.Beyond that, it feels like we\u2019re losing the idea that you should leave people wanting more, that you can love something without needing twice as much of it.All this has given me a strange appreciation for the disappointments of TV past. \u201cFreaks and Geeks\u201d broke my heart when it was canceled in 2000, and not a few times have I wondered whether, had it come along a dozen years later, it might have lasted for years.On the other hand, like most high school shows, it probably shouldn\u2019t have had more than three seasons or so. There\u2019s a reason we feel sad for the former prom king who keeps hanging around after graduation.I realize that complaining about too much of a good thing makes me sound like a crank. No one\u2019s forcing me to watch this revival or that sequel, to stick with a show that\u2019s lasted too long.But we lose something when we lose a sense of finality. It gives meaning to art the way that the knowledge of death gives meaning to life. When no ending is permanent \u2014 even if it means resurrecting dead characters \u2014 the power of endings is compromised. And often an ending that comes before we want it to comes exactly at the right time.So I hope the second season of \u201cBarry\u201d wows me as much as the first. But I also hope that, when it knows the time has come, it will not hesitate to pull the trigger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Traditional TV Is in Trouble", "Date": "2018-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision networks will draw hordes of advertisers to New York City this week for their annual bonanza of presentations and parties, a decades-old tradition known as the upfronts that is meant to dazzle marketers and loosen their purse strings.But beneath the sparkle and the canap\u00e9s, the networks are also navigating a serious advertising upheaval. Ratings are on the decline, especially among young people, some of whom don\u2019t even own televisions. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the many devices and apps people now use to watch shows. And there is a host of material from Silicon Valley that is competing for viewers\u2019 attention, including Google\u2019s YouTube, Facebook and Netflix. It all adds up to a precarious situation for broadcast TV.Advertising on TV has long been the best way for marketers to reach a large number of people at one time. And it is still a formidable medium. But cracks are showing.National TV ad sales peaked in 2016, when they exceeded $43 billion, according to data from Magna, the ad-buying and media intelligence arm of IPG Mediabrands. Sales fell 2.2 percent last year, and the firm estimates that they will fall at least 2 percent each year through 2022.Some of the decline could be mitigated through new business with platforms like Hulu, but \u201cit\u2019s not yet enough to upset the decrease of traditional sales,\u201d said Vincent Letang, Magna\u2019s executive vice president of global market intelligence. At the same time, he said, while networks have raised the cost of advertising on their airwaves in recent years, ratings have declined sharply, including some in unexpected areas like the National Football League.TV is still a good value for plenty of advertisers. Mr. Letang said pharmaceuticals and personal care products were increasing their presences on TV. But the combination of rising prices and falling viewership is giving some big brands pause.As TV ad spending has begun to drop, marketers have been diverting more money to tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have increasingly focused on expanding their video \u2014 and video ad \u2014 business.Old Navy has long been a prominent TV advertiser, and television remains crucial to the company\u2019s marketing. But the way Old Navy defines TV advertising has evolved, said Jamie Gersch, its chief marketing officer.Those opting out of traditional TV packages are watching Netflix and videos on Amazon Prime, and to a lesser extent, paying for services like Dish Network\u2019s Sling TV, according to Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence.As networks navigate these changes, they are moving to reduce the number of ads they show. Ads, after all, make money, but they also annoy viewers. Last year, the average number of commercial minutes during an hour of broadcast TV was 13.6, according to Nielsen data.So if there are fewer commercials, how do companies market their products?Ralph Heim, vice president of media and sponsorships at Sonic Drive-In, said he was intrigued by several of the new data targeting products for television ads. But he remains concerned about how the announcements on limited ads fit with a declining audience.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a more premium advertising experience for advertisers, and they\u2019re hoping that people will pay more,\u201d even though the audience is smaller, Mr. Heim said.He added, \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re following the eyeballs, right?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Battle for Control of CBS, With Far-Reaching Consequences", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s no secret that the proposed reunion of CBS and Viacom hasn\u2019t been a Hollywood romance. But simmering tensions erupted into open warfare this week, with far more at stake than control of two legendary entertainment companies.No matter who emerges the victor in what promises to be a prolonged series of courtroom showdowns, both companies will be profoundly affected, and the broader media landscape fundamentally transformed.The CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves and the company\u2019s board launched the opening salvo on Monday, filing suit to prevent Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both CBS and Viacom, from firing CBS directors before they could dilute her voting rights and strip her of control \u2014 a step they plan to take Thursday, provided that a judge in Delaware allows it.Although the two sides had been negotiating over how much CBS should pay for Viacom, and who should be in charge after the merger, control is the real issue. The CBS board and management \u201chave simply become uncomfortable with the reality that CBS has a controlling stockholder,\u201d Ms. Redstone asserted in a response to the suit.For its part, CBS said it\u2019s simply adhering to the principle that the company \u201cshould be and would be governed for the benefit of the company and all its shareholders, not just the controlling stockholder.\u201d It is a principle CBS said had been endorsed by Sumner Redstone, Shari\u2019s 94-year-old father, who long controlled both CBS and Viacom.The interests of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone might well include considering a takeover offer, especially in light of a rapidly consolidating media and communications landscape. Since talk of reuniting Viacom and CBS first surfaced two years ago, AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (a deal awaiting a court ruling on an antitrust challenge), Disney has reached a deal to buy much of 21st Century Fox, and Netflix and Amazon have emerged as fully integrated distributors and content producers.CBS executives were incensed that Ms. Redstone rebuffed an approach from Lloyd C. McAdam, chairman and chief executive of Verizon Communications, roughly a year ago, thereby \u201cdepriving CBS stockholders of a potentially value-enhancing opportunity,\u201d CBS said in its complaint.While the exact nature of that conversation remains in dispute, the Redstone entity that controls CBS, National Amusements, has made clear its categorical opposition to any takeover. As said in a 2016 letter to the boards of both CBS and Viacom, \u201cTo avoid any doubt, National Amusements is not willing to accept or support (i) any acquisition by a third party of either company or (ii) any transaction that would result in National Amusements surrendering its controlling position in either company or not controlling the combined company.\u201dThe issue of control often looms large at companies with dual-class share systems. Controlling shareholders often want to maintain managerial control \u2014 that\u2019s often why they establish the dual-class structure in the first place \u2014 while public shareholders often hope to sell to the highest bidder.Although dual-class share structures are controversial and have long been opposed by shareholder-rights advocates, they have been growing in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurial founders are often reluctant to cede control; Facebook, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and Snap are all dual-class share companies. But so are Berkshire Hathaway, Ford Motor, Comcast and The New York Times Company.Should CBS ultimately prevail in what would be a highly unusual attempt to dilute a controlling shareholder, a bevy of dual-class companies will no doubt be scrambling to rewrite their bylaws.The conflict is magnified in this instance because Ms. Redstone is the controlling shareholder in both parties to the proposed merger.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the Redstones have a clear conflict of interest in this situation,\u201d said Margaret Blair, a professor and expert in corporate governance at Vanderbilt University School of Law. \u201cThe law is very clear that the authority for running the corporation lies with the board. If the board feels the controlling shareholder is interfering with the best interest of the other shareholders, courts will defer to the board, and I think they should.\u201d(At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge in Delaware granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.)Such cases are rare, because directors who dare to defy a controlling shareholder\u2019s wishes, as the CBS directors have done, can simply be replaced. There was widespread amazement on Wall Street this week that Ms. Redstone hadn\u2019t sensed the rebellion coming, and moved to replace the CBS directors or curtail their powers. Now her hands are tied, at least temporarily.Ms. Redstone has been at the center of a drawn-out soap opera over control of the media empire forged by her father, the ailing Mr. Redstone.After years of being estranged from her father and isolated from the family business, Ms. Redstone was thrust unexpectedly into the role of media mogul after she reconciled with her father, ousted his two girlfriends from his Beverly Hills mansion, and gained control of the family trust that controls National Amusements and, in turn, CBS and Viacom.Ms. Redstone has gone on a crash course in media management, lunching with other media executives and showing up at the Sun Valley conference and other media watering holes. By all accounts, she\u2019s taken on the task with a level of enthusiasm and determination that rivals her father. Still, there\u2019s nothing in her experience that would typically qualify her to run major media companies.The Harvard Law School professor Lucian A. Bebchuk used the Redstone example in an argument that dual-share class structures typically outlive their utility, and should be phased out by a company at some point. \u201cConcerns about the emergence of inferior leadership over time are further aggravated when the dual-class structure enables a transfer of the founder\u2019s lock on control to an heir who might be unfit to lead the company,\u201d he wrote last year in an article titled \u201cThe Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock\u201d in Virginia Law Review. He cited a \u201cwide range of distorted choices\u201d that are \u201caimed at increasing private benefits of control at the expense of the value received by other shareholders.\u201dCBS hasn\u2019t said exactly why the special committee formed to evaluate and negotiate the potential merger with Viacom finally decided this past weekend that such a deal wasn\u2019t in the best interest of CBS shareholders other than Ms. Redstone, but it isn\u2019t hard to see what their objections might be.Investors other than the Redstones have long opposed the idea \u2014 every time there were reports the deal was off, including this week, CBS shares jumped. A chorus of analysts has criticized the deal. One called the merger a potential \u201cdisaster\u201d for CBS.People close to CBS told me this week that the company was never enthusiastic about the potential combination, and agreed to consider it largely as a courtesy to Ms. Redstone. They said CBS alone is a very attractive company, either as a takeover candidate for a large telecom company like Verizon, or as a stand-alone content creator.Though CBS faces the same advertising challenges as the other broadcast networks, analysts have praised Mr. Moonves for positioning CBS for the digital era. He\u2019s not only kept CBS the No. 1 broadcast network in prime time for the past nine years, but also executed a successful direct-to-consumer streaming strategy.\u201cFrom CBS\u2019s perspective, you\u2019ve got to be pretty happy with your business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. \u201cWhy would you want to complicate it?\u201dFor its part, Viacom, after years of turmoil, seems to have stabilized under the leadership of its new chief executive, Robert M. Bakish, who has emerged as a favorite of Ms. Redstone\u2019s. (Ms. Redstone has pushed to have him play a meaningful role in the merged companies, either as a high-level executive or as a board member.) But so far this year, Viacom\u2019s Paramount movie studio accounted for less than 6 percent of the domestic box office. Disney, the market leader, had over 34 percent.Still, people at CBS told me that while they wouldn\u2019t mind gaining control of the Paramount studio, they have little or no interest in Viacom\u2019s traditional cable networks, including MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. Those are suffering acutely from the cord cutting that is afflicting the entire cable industry. (Mr. Creutz, the analyst, described Viacom\u2019s cable assets as a \u201cmelting ice cube.\u201d)Given the level of acrimony that has erupted this week from CBS\u2019s move \u2014 National Amusements said it was \u201coutraged\u201d and Ms. Redstone was described as \u201cshocked, disappointed and upset\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine any amicable settlement. That leaves two potential outcomes: If Ms. Redstone prevails, Mr. Moonves and his team would be out, marking the end of an era at CBS. It would presumably fall to the relatively untested Mr. Bakish to merge the two companies and soldier on at a perilous time for cable and broadcasting operations.If CBS wins, and Ms. Redstone\u2019s control is diluted, the Redstone era will come to an end, and with it the likelihood that either CBS or Viacom will last long as independent companies. Viacom is so small and weak that it would need a rescuer, probably at a lower price than CBS was being asked to pay. And CBS would be free to pursue a merger with someone like Verizon, or go it alone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Carrot Top Wins in Vegas (Yes, He Can Be Funny)", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyLAS VEGAS \u2014 Mocking Carrot Top is a venerable comedy tradition.These days, Carrot Top, whose real name is Scott Thompson, receives little attention from critics, talk show bookers or Netflix executives despite having what is surely the longest-running stand-up act in the country: He has played sold-out houses at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas for 13 years, competing with Criss Angel and Cirque du Soleil for longevity. On a recent visit, I found Carrot Top, 53, to be a far more ambitious performer than he gets credit for, an innovator in the shameless pursuit of cheap, sometimes questionable, laughs.His insults about the rest of his appearance go harder. Pointing at his face, he says with a grimace: \u201cThank you for looking at this.\u201d Then he waits a beat, looking slightly uncomfortable listening to the laughter. In this moment, you can see Carrot Top morphing into Scott Thompson, before he returns to the next joke.I\u2019ve never seen a stand-up show with a more elaborate sound design. Hardly a few seconds go by without a bit punctuated by a clip from a popular song or a cartoonish squawk or some other audio accent. It\u2019s stand-up scored like a musical, tricked out with smoke and wind machines and confetti blasts, not to mention dramatic shifts in lighting. Are these meant to serve as easy shortcuts to laughs? Often, yes, but precision matters as much with design as it does with punch lines. And the timing of this production is never off.The biggest laughs come when the visuals, sound and props all work together, as when the stage went dark, and he walked around with a flashlight while the U2 song \u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For\u201d played.Carrot Top\u2019s props are still quaintly homemade, a clumsy juxtaposition to the rest of the show. It\u2019s as if a video game were interrupted by an arts and crafts demonstration. Standing in front of a collection of trunks, he grabs sight gags like a New England Patriots helmet that doubles as a Kleenex dispenser or goofy objects like Croc shoes pasted to toy crocodiles. These require no explanation, but serve as visual punch lines to quick setups. He announces \u201cAmish blow dryer,\u201d for example, then grabs a tube and blows on one end.None of these are especially funny on their own, but he picks them up and dispenses with them so quickly that they do take on a diverting momentum. Putting an emphasis on speed over quality, Carrot Top overpowers his audience with a flurry of jokes, never pausing for more than a few seconds before the next one arrives.This show is dopey and occasionally offensive. There are lame sexual jokes about Elton John, Ellen DeGeneres and Ricky Martin as if the fact of their homosexuality is itself funny. If you wanted to do a deep dive into the politics of Carrot Top, there\u2019s plenty to work with. After all, he is an orange-haired buffoon who became famous in the 1980s and remains popular despite being sneered at by the elite media.By the time he starts passing out drinks, it\u2019s clear he will do anything to please the crowd (which does appear to be having a great time). His comedy panders shamelessly, but he is hardly the first entertainer in Las Vegas to commit this sin.The fact is that Carrot Top has figured out something essential about surviving in show business. To sustain a long career, you\u2019ve got to have more than a gimmick. You need at least two or three.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 Is Still the \u2018Ultimate Trip\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "Out ThereThe rerelease of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece encourages us to reflect again on where we\u2019re coming from and where we\u2019re going.Supported byIn the spring of 1964 the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was very worried. NASA was about to fly the Mariner 4 space probe past Mars.At the time he was deep in development of a blockbuster film about the discovery of alien intelligence. Word was that MGM had bet their studio on the film. What if Mariner discovered life on Mars and scooped them?Mr. Kubrick\u2019s movie, \u201c2001, A Space Odyssey,\u201d finally debuted, late and over budget in April 1968, to baffled film critics and long lines of young people. John Lennon said he went to see it every week. It was the top-grossing movie of the year and is now a perennial on critics\u2019 lists of the most important movies of all time, often the first movie scientists mention if you ask them about sci-fi they have enjoyed.The movie broke with many of the conventions of the time, like mood music to tell you what to feel and think. \u201c2001\u201d left you alone in space with your thoughts.The story begins four million years ago in Africa, where a bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until a strange black monolith appears. To the thunder of \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra,\u201d one of those apemen is inspired to pick up a bone and use it as a club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around.Suddenly, the apemen are eating meat and chasing their rivals away from the water hole. In a moment of exultation the ape throws the bone into the sky where, in what has been called the longest fast forward in film history, it turns into a spaceship.Around that toss Kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution. Another monolith appears on the moon, and yet another in orbit around Jupiter, where an astronaut named Dave Bowman connects with it after subduing a neurotic computer, the HAL 9000, which has murdered his shipmates. In the finale, Bowman is sent through a \u201cstar gate\u201d on a trip through space and time, death and rebirth, returning as a glowing Star Child to float like a fetus over the Earth.The last time I watched the movie (on VHS of all things on my tiny home television), was in 2000, on the eve of its eponymous year.I never realized how much I had missed until I read Mr. Benson\u2019s book, a deep, informative and entertaining dive into the making of the movie.One revelation is how haphazardly the movie was made. Nevermind the special effects and the model spaceships, Kubrick and Clarke were making up much of the story as they went along. Up until the very end, Mr. Benson tells us, they were struggling with how to portray the alien being responsible for the monoliths, until they realized it couldn\u2019t be done. We don\u2019t know what is out there. It would be hubris to even try to imagine.This is not a review of the book; Mr. Benson is a friend of mine, and I\u2019m unabashedly ignorant of the history of cinema anyway. But it is a review of my own shifting attitudes and encounters with the movie itself over the years.One mark of the movie\u2019s status as a masterpiece is that it has something different to say to us every time we encounter it anew.Like the monolith it appears to give us what we need.Fifty years ago it was a harbinger of the future. We were about to win the race with the Russians to the moon. A whole generation was pumped and primed to tune in, turn on and transcend the whole dreary space-time continuum as we knew it.Thoroughly researched by Kubrick and Clarke, large swaths of the film were like a documentary of the future: the space station, the moon base, the grand-stepping outward just as Clarke and people like Wernher von Braun had prophesied.It\u2019s now been 46 years since there was anyone on the moon. It\u2019s possible to imagine a time in which there will be no humans alive who have been there.But Mars is having a moment in the popular imagination \u2014 from the Matt Damon film \u201cThe Martian,\u201d which got high marks for scientific realism a couple years ago, to an upcoming television series \u201cThe First,\u201d about settlers on Mars being planned by Beau Willimon, the producer and showrunner of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dWhere the script has really flipped is in the future history of evolution.We all carry HAL in our pockets now, and in a few years he, it, will be in our bloodstreams. The future, to the extent that humans are part of it, is bionic.Computers, to the delight of surveillance states and the despair of civil libertarians, can now recognize faces. For all we know neural networks like Deep Mind can dream.In that case, I have a bone or two to pick with the director.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a rocket engineer. He is Wernher von Braun, not Werner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Collector Sues Sotheby\u2019s to Block Basquiat Auction, Exposing Ugly Family Dispute", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is a case about a broken promise, a family disagreement, and an art masterpiece that, if this Court does not step in now to save it, will be lost to the people who love it, and to New York, forever.\u201dThe art masterpiece in question \u2014 \u201cFlesh and Spirit,\u201d a 12-by-12-foot painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat \u2014 is just days away from the auction block. It is a prized asset of the estate of Mr. Neumann\u2019s wife, Dolores Ormandy Neumann, who died in September 2016, and its potential sale shines a spotlight on what appears to be a nasty family dispute.Shortly before her death, Ms. Neumann executed a will that fully disinherited her husband of 62 years and gave their middle child, Belinda, the vast majority of Ms. Neumann\u2019s property while appointing her the preliminary executor of her mother\u2019s estate, according to Mr. Neumann\u2019s lawsuit. The couple\u2019s other daughters, Melissa and Kristina, were left with only modest shares, the suit states.The will, which is being disputed in court, was executed while Dolores was receiving serious medical treatment, was the product of undue influence and is therefore invalid, according to Mr. Neumann\u2019s lawsuit.But that\u2019s not Sotheby\u2019s problem. What is its problem is Mr. Neumann\u2019s charge that Sotheby\u2019s \u201cbotched\u201d the marketing of the Basquiat, which is to be auctioned on May 16, violating an agreement he said he made with the auction house that is in effect through April 2019.In the agreement, according to the lawsuit, Sotheby\u2019s promised Mr. Neumann, 86, that it would seek his approval on \u201call matters relating to cataloging, placement, and exhibiting each and every work consigned.\u201d He said the promise was broken \u201cin spectacular fashion, and with lasting consequences.\u201dInstead, according to the lawsuit, Sotheby\u2019s was \u201cshamelessly willing to capitalize on a difficult family situation\u201d and entered into an agreement with Belinda to sell the painting.Melissa and Kristina Neumann signed affidavits supporting their father\u2019s lawsuit.Attempts to reach Belinda Neumann on Thursday by phone and email were unsuccessful.\u201cThis eleventh-hour claim is entirely without merit,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident that the \u2018agreement\u2019 Mr. Neumann relies on does not exist, and the court will find in our favor and the auction will proceed as scheduled.\u201dMr. Neumann said that the auction house failed to highlight or mention the work\u2019s many unique characteristics, like its \u201chinged construction,\u201d \u201cmulti-panel composition\u201d and \u201cdeep art-historical significance.\u201dHe is asking for a \u201ctemporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction against the impending auction and sale of \u2018Flesh and Spirit\u2019 by Sotheby\u2019s.\u201dIn his suit, filed by Andrew G. Celli Jr. of the firm Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff & Abady, Mr. Neumann does not claim that he owns the work of art, but that \u201cNew York law forbids the disinheriting of a surviving spouse\u201d and that he has a \u201cstatutory right to one-third of his wife\u2019s estate.\u201dMr. Neumann has made clear in the past that many parties covet the pieces in his family\u2019s collection, which includes works by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.\u201cMuseum people are always looking at me as if I\u2019m already dead,\u201d Mr. Neumann said at the time. \u201cThey just can\u2019t wait for me to die. \u2018How\u2019s your health?\u2019 they want to know.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting that sold for over $110 million.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Little Women,\u2019 Through British Eyes", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re going to add a new version of \u201cLittle Women\u201d to the dozen or so film and television adaptations that have already been made, you\u2019d better have a pretty good reason. It\u2019s not as if Katharine Hepburn and Winona Ryder have left the world in need of a definitive portrayal of Jo March.Ms. Thomas and the director Vanessa Caswill may have met the BBC\u2019s needs, but they haven\u2019t made a strong case for yet another adaptation. The gift for broad, somewhat florid melodrama that Ms. Thomas has shown in \u201cCall the Midwife\u201d doesn\u2019t match up with the delicacy of the emotions and the subtlety of the relationships in \u201cLittle Women,\u201d Louisa May Alcott\u2019s 1868 novel about the four March sisters of Massachusetts. What we get is a fairly faithful rendition of the book\u2019s events that lacks the warmth and depth of feeling that make the book worth reading.There are some flat-footed attempts at lyricism, or modernization, through the intrusive use of music, or short passages when the cuts come more quickly and the camera moves in for off-center close-ups. Some jarring comic absurdism is added through the unusually obtrusive presence of Aunt March\u2019s parrot. But mostly the production just marches through the story, giving everything equal weight \u2014 Amy falls through the ice, Beth gets scarlet fever, Meg marries, and each crisis feels pretty much like the others.At the time, though, most of those actors were young and not that well known. The problem with this new \u201cLittle Women\u201d is that its young cast members seem to have been left to their own devices. Their styles (and their mindfulness of the mid-19th-century period) are all over the place, and they\u2019re prone to flat, affectless moments that needed another take.Kathryn Newton of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d brings spirit and mischievousness to Amy (though her internal calendar is clearly turned to the 21st century), and Willa Fitzgerald of \u201cScream: The TV Series\u201d has a touching, reserved quality as Meg. They fare better than Annes Elwy as the sickly Beth or Maya Hawke in the central role of the argumentative budding writer, Jo.Among the adult supporting characters, Angela Lansbury has some amusing moments as Aunt March and Michael Gambon some touchingly courtly ones as Mr. Laurence, the wealthy neighbor. The performer who makes the strongest impression is probably Jonah Hauer-King, who gets across Laurie\u2019s openness and generosity.Advertisement"}

Which makes her new Netflix series a bit like playtime in the sandbox.Their answers are outlandish, whimsical, brutally honest and utterly reasonable. Ms. Burnett, meanwhile, tosses out the occasional zinger that, mostly, goes right over her young co-stars\u2019 heads.\u201cThe clich\u00e9 is true \u2014 out of mouths of babes,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir advice is very, very good. Some very funny. Some very heartfelt.\u201dSeven decades into her illustrious career, with 25 Emmys for \u201cThe Carol Burnett Show,\u201d a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor already on her mantel, Ms. Burnett will receive the inaugural Peabody career achievement award on May 19. In a phone interview from her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., she talked about her role as a pioneering female comedian and what she finds funny \u2014 and doesn\u2019t.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.At this stage, why take on another series?It was 12 shows, so it\u2019s not a huge commitment, and I liked the kids. It\u2019s a cute premise because we have three grown-up dilemmas for each show, and the kids give their advice on how to solve the problems. And there\u2019s no script. It\u2019s all unrehearsed, and the kids are not professional actors. It was a walk in the park.You famously discovered young talent like Vicki Lawrence and Bernadette Peters. But on \u201cThe Carol Burnett 50th Anniversary Special\u201d in December, Jim Carrey reminisced about asking to come on your show as a kid. Is he the one who got away?Well, I didn\u2019t know Jim when he was 10 years old. I did answer his letter, however. Vicki was 18 and had no professional experience, but she wrote me that people said that she reminded them of a younger me. And we were planning to have a segment where Harvey [Korman] and I would be a married couple raising my kid sister. She was going to be in a contest called Miss Fireball of Inglewood, and I told my husband: \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling. Let\u2019s go see this contest.\u201d She won the contest, we auditioned her, and she got the role. That wouldn\u2019t happen today.Why not?No network would allow us to hire somebody that raw. Now they have the sponsors, and they\u2019ve got to approve everything and are too hands-on, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And they don\u2019t trust you. That was back in the covered-wagon days when they just gave you a show and said: \u201cO.K., you\u2019re the artist. Do it, and if it\u2019s successful we\u2019ll renew every year.\u201d When you think of that Saturday night lineup with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cM*A*S*H,\u201d Mary [Tyler Moore], Bob Newhart and us, we all had free rein. The network left us alone, and that\u2019s why those shows were so good.In the 1960s, you took advantage of an option in your contract with CBS that allowed you to host 30 hours of a variety show. But network executives wanted to put you in a sitcom because they thought variety was a man\u2019s job. I never thought, oh my gosh, it\u2019s a woman and dah, dah, dah. I just knew that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I wanted an actual rep company, which is what our show was, even though it had my name on it. There were times when I would be supporting Harvey, or Harvey would be supporting Vicki. Everybody got a chance to shine, and I learned that from \u201cThe Garry Moore Show,\u201d because I remember sitting around the table, reading the script, and Garry had a funny line or two. And he looked up and said: \u201cYou know what? Give this to Carol, or give this line to Durward [Kirby]. They can say it funnier than I can.\u201d The generosity \u2014 but he was also smart because he said, \u201cWhatever makes the show better is going to make our show successful.\u201dIn your 2016 memoir, \u201cIn Such Good Company,\u201d you wrote about trying to maintain ladylike qualities while making demands of your male staff.Back in the day, the men \u2014 Jackie Gleason and Sid Caesar and Milton Berle \u2014 if they said: \u201cHey guys, this sketch sucks. Get with it! What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d they were fine because they were guys. But if a woman did it, she would be labeled a bitch. So I tap-danced around it a lot. Like, if a sketch wasn\u2019t working, I\u2019d call the writers down to rehearsal and I\u2019d say: \u201cCan you help us out here? I\u2019m not saying this right. Maybe you could come up with a different line that would make it easier for me to get a laugh.\u201dBut now, because women are more accepted as producers, writers and stars, like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, I would say: \u201cGuys, this isn\u2019t working. Let\u2019s go back to the drawing board.\u201d Still, that\u2019s a nice way to say it. I can\u2019t stand confrontation. It makes me crazy. What about the censors? We never got called on anything except one time. We were doing a scene where I was in a nudist camp, and I\u2019m behind a fence that says \u201cKeep Out,\u201d and my shoulders and legs are bare, and Harvey was interviewing me about what nudists do for recreation. He said, \u201cHow do you nudists dance?\u201d My line was, \u201cVery carefully.\u201d Well, for some reason the program practices thought that was too dirty, and so we came up with the line we wanted in the first place: \u201cCheek to cheek.\u201d They bought it.Female vs. male comics: What\u2019s the difference?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside a Powerful Silicon Valley Charity, a Toxic Culture Festered", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Silicon Valley technology executives have amassed enormous fortunes in recent years, one relatively obscure group \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation \u2014 has emerged as the local charity of choice.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has donated stock worth more than $1.8 billion to the foundation. Reed Hastings, the founder and chief executive of Netflix, has given $100 million. And many other tech titans, including the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Microsoft\u2019s co-founder Paul Allen, have donated millions.According to interviews with a half dozen former and current employees, some of whom agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, Mari Ellen Loijens, the foundation\u2019s top fund-raiser, routinely bullied and demeaned colleagues, made sexually and racially insensitive remarks and at times even threatened physical violence.The employees say that Emmett Carson, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, ignored multiple complaints about abusive behavior by Ms. Loijens because she was responsible for much of the organization\u2019s growth.\u201cShe brought in the money, made the place bigger, and he could go out and be a superstar,\u201d said Rebecca Dupras, an executive who said she left the foundation last year because she no longer wanted to work with Ms. Loijens. \u201cHe could have stopped this and reined her in, and he didn\u2019t.\u201dCiting the ongoing investigation, Sue McAllister, a foundation spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about the allegations against Ms. Loijens and Mr. Carson.\u201cThe investigation will be thorough, and will include a focus on workplace culture, including among other things, how teams are managed and what type of working environment is being fostered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not able to comment on confidential internal H.R. matters.\u201dMr. Carson initially suggested on Twitter he was unaware of the problems at his foundation, and has not spoken publicly since being placed on leave. He and Ms. Loijens did not respond to requests for comment.The foundation\u2019s upheaval has sent shock waves through the philanthropic world. Mr. Carson was a respected nonprofit executive with a rising national profile, and his ambition to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation a national powerhouse was well-known.The foundation was formed in 2007 through the merger of two local charities that decided to pool their resources. Mr. Carson, who had worked at the Ford Foundation and was chief executive of the Minneapolis Foundation, was brought in to raise the group\u2019s profile.Community foundations have historically been local affairs, vehicles for wealthy individuals to give back to their communities by investing in regional nonprofit groups.But Mr. Carson had a grander mission. With huge fortunes being created by technology companies, there was a chance to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation one of the nation\u2019s biggest philanthropies, an institution that could rival the foundations created with Gilded Age wealth a century ago.Mr. Carson pushed his team to raise as much money as possible, and the foundation increasingly gave grants not just to local groups, but to national and international causes, ranging from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Sweden.\u201cThere was this bigger is better mentality,\u201d said Dory Gannes, who worked at the foundation for two years, leaving in 2016 after what she said was a dispute with Ms. Loijens. \u201cOur world was driven by scale \u2014 how many clients we had, how many grants we processed, how many countries we made grants to.\u201dMs. Loijens, who came from the Junior League of San Jose, distinguished herself as an accomplished fund-raiser and made herself indispensable to Mr. Carson. Yet to her colleagues, Ms. Loijens was known as a bully who regularly made offensive remarks.During one meeting, Ms. Dupras said she mentioned to the group that she wasn\u2019t feeling well, eliciting a sexually charged retort from Ms. Loijens.\u201cShe said I was pretty good looking and might be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Dupras said. \u201cShe said, \u2018You might want to get that checked out.\u2019\u201dElizabeth Dressel, who left the foundation in 2012, said that one evening, a young black woman on her team was working late. Ms. Loijens approached the young woman and said, \u201cWork, slave, work.\u201dAt another meeting, Ms. Dupras said Ms. Loijens threatened her staff. Employees were supposed to take meetings with donors or their advisers in pairs, but Ms. Loijens learned that someone had met with a donor without a partner.\u201cThen she said, \u2018If I ever catch you having a meeting by yourself, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dupras said.\u201cI personally went to H.R. on more than five occasions, and I was only there for one year,\u201d Ms. Dressel said. \u201cBut the culture was supported by Emmett because the sole focus was to increase the size of the funds.\u201dMs. Dupras said she attempted to discuss the toxic workplace culture with Mr. Carson twice, but was brushed off. \u201cHe was definitely not open to a conversation about her at all,\u201d she said.Despite the internal turmoil, money kept flowing into the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Since 2011, Mr. Zuckerberg has donated some 45 million shares of Facebook stock to the organization, worth roughly $1.8 billion at the time they were given. In 2014, GoPro\u2019s founder, Nicholas Woodman, donated stock worth $500 million to the foundation. That same year, WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder, Jan Koum, donated stock worth $566 million.It was a distinction that grated on former employees. \u201cThis guy is enabling bullying in the workplace, then he\u2019s walking around promoting philanthropy,\u201d Ms. Dupras said.After the allegations first surfaced last month, Mr. Carson took to Twitter.But a former employee, Maria Moreno, quickly called out Mr. Carson.The next week, a group of 65 current staff members sent the foundation\u2019s board a statement that accused the foundation\u2019s leadership team, including Mr. Carson, of ignoring complaints about Ms. Loijens.\u201cThey knew about her behavior,\u201d read the statement, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cAnd, through their inaction, senior leadership and HR has created and reinforced a toxic culture of fear, blame and intimidation.\u201dWithin days, Mr. Carson was placed on leave and the human resources director, Daiva Natochy, had left the foundation.Donors to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation have had little to say about the turmoil at their charity of choice. Representatives for Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Hastings said they support the actions of the foundation\u2019s board, which placed Mr. Carson on leave and began the investigation.Former employees said they anguished over their decision to come forward, fearing it would jeopardize their careers, but felt they had a responsibility to do so.\u201cThe focus was on bringing dollars in the door, rather than creating a culture where people were supported and respected,\u201d said Ms. Dressel, who added that it was her four daughters who encouraged her to speak out publicly.Ms. Dressel said she hoped the departure of Mr. Carson and Ms. Loijens would allow the foundation to start fresh. \u201cIt could be an amazing organization doing wonderful charitable work,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the United States foundations that are larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations are larger; the Gates Foundation is not the only one larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Advertisement"}

In fact, over the study period, the proportion of emergency room and hospital encounters for these suicide-related diagnoses almost tripled, from 0.66 percent in 2008 to 1.82 percent in 2015. And the rate of increase was highest among adolescent girls. In the new study, the researchers noted a strong temporal relationship between the school year and the frequency of the encounters for suicidal thoughts or actions; the rate dropped sharply in the summer, which is notably different, Dr. Plemmons said, from the pattern in adults, where July and August are higher risk months. Performance anxiety or social pressures could be factors, Dr. Plemmons said, and schools can potentially play a role in identifying kids at risk, and in delivering treatment.\u201cWe bring all this information back to the child and parent and make a safety plan,\u201d Dr. Gerson said. \u201cA portion we admit to inpatient, but we also have access to immediate outpatient care which lets us do intensive therapy even without admitting the child to the hospital.\u201dBut many places don\u2019t have the ability to do that assessment or arrange that care. There has not been enough of an investment in children\u2019s mental health, Dr. Gerson said, either in high quality outpatient care or inpatient beds, given the magnitude of the problem. There is \u201creally poor access to outpatient care, particularly quick access,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople get admitted and end up boarding because there\u2019s no other option.\u201d \u201cI would recommend to parents either ideally don\u2019t have your kid watch \u201913 Reasons Why,\u2019 or other shows with graphic depictions of suicide or self-harm,\u201d Dr. Gerson said in an email. But \u201cif your kid wants to watch it, watch it together \u2014 the whole series, not just one episode \u2014 and talk about what you see, so you can help your kid understand and process anything that is upsetting or triggering.\u201d \u201cStay calm. Ask, \u2018Tell me more about what you\u2019re thinking,\u2019 show the kid you\u2019re taking it seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cI see parents who in a very well-intentioned way will say things like, \u2018Oh no, honey, everything\u2019s fine, let\u2019s think about the good things.\u2019\u201d And again, that may make a distressed child clam up. Parents who have reason to be concerned must find a way to get the child evaluated. That doesn\u2019t have to mean the emergency room; you can start by calling your pediatrician. But a parent will have to decide whether the child \u201cis able to be safe in that process \u2014 emotionally stable enough that they can drive with you to the pediatrician\u2019s office \u2014 or is your child really in distress at this moment and you need to call 911.\u201dIn their medical center, she said, and in many others, a psychiatric response line offers parents a chance to talk it over on the phone to help decide whether or not to bring the child in. But again, if the child is violent or the parent is frightened, call for help in de-escalating the situation and ensuring safe transport: \u201cIf the child is in imminent aggressive or physical risk, it\u2019s totally reasonable to call 911.\u201d\u201cThe No. 1 thing that I learned is that asking about these thoughts in no way makes someone that way,\u201d Dr. Plemmons said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge fear that there\u2019s a suggestive power, and that has not been shown to be the case.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201ctalking about it and destigmatizing it is hugely important.\u201d\u201cWe know there are therapies and treatments that work, and we know that small things really, really make a difference for kids,\u201d Dr. Gerson said. \u201cThey really just need us to listen and say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting; we\u2019re going to find a way to get you some help.\u201d She noted that parents should make clear to their child, \u201cI really want to know how to help you best. I know this is something a lot of kids struggle with. I\u2019m not mad at you. We\u2019re going to figure out how to get through this together.\u201dFor help, call the National Suicide Prevention line, 1-800-273-8255.  Advertisement"}

A pair of scientists snatch their daughter, Simone, from high school and take her and her young brother, Rasmus, to a bunker in the forest just before a virus-carrying rain starts to fall over Denmark. The parents know what\u2019s up, but they\u2019re gone before they can provide answers.This cues the passage-of-time montage \u2014 lonely birthday parties, indoor plants growing and dying, isolation as an excuse for Simone (Alba August) to walk around in her underwear, Rasmus suddenly played by an older actor (Lucas Lynggaard Tonnesen).

{"Headline": "When Living Your Truth Can Mean Losing Your Children", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe questioning went on for days. Did she allow her children to watch a Christmas video? Did she include plastic Easter eggs as part of her celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim? Did she use English nicknames for them, instead of their Hebrew names?This grilling of Chavie Weisberger, 35, took place not in front of a rabbi or a religious court, but in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, during a custody battle with her ultra-Orthodox Jewish ex-husband after she came out as lesbian and decided to leave the ultra-Orthodox fold. The stakes could not have been higher. In fact, the judge, Eric I. Prus, eventually ruled that she should lose custody of her children, largely because she had lapsed in raising them according to Hasidic customs.A New York State appellate court ruled that Justice Prus had erred in making religious observance the paramount factor when deciding custody. The court also said he had violated Ms. Weisberger\u2019s constitutional rights by requiring her to pretend to be ultra-Orthodox around her children, even though she was no longer religious, in order to spend unsupervised time with them.Ms. Weisberger and her husband had originally gone to a Jewish court, known as a beth din, to receive a divorce in 2008. The religious divorce agreement granted her full physical custody of the children, who were then 5, 3 and 1.She was raised ultra-Orthodox in Monsey, N.Y., as part of a family of revered rabbis \u2014 her grandfather is the founder of the Hasidic sect to which she formerly belonged, Emunas Yisroel. She fully expected to maintain traditional customs, so she barely noticed the clause requiring her to do so in her divorce agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember seeing it,\u201d she said.But by 2012, she began openly identifying as lesbian and wearing more secular clothing. Shocking some religious neighbors, she had a transgender friend as a houseguest. That was when her ex-husband, Naftali Weisberger, sued for sole custody, claiming that her changed lifestyle was violating the divorce terms and traumatizing their children.When divorce agreements inked in Jewish courts are disputed, the matter is often brought to civil court, where secular judges can be asked to enforce their terms. Sometimes, particularly when one parent has decided to leave ultra-Orthodoxy, this can lead to personal religious matters being placed under a microscope as a judge seeks to determine whether the parents are honoring their original agreement.A civil court judge\u2019s rationale for focusing on religious practice, family lawyers said, is that once a religious divorce agreement is signed and submitted to the secular court, it is seen as a legal contract. There is also a strong interest in custody cases in maintaining the status quo for children \u2014 meaning a divorce should not upend their lives. For the children of the ultra-Orthodox, that would favor maintaining religious customs.Yosef Rapaport, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who has been a litigator in Jewish courts in Brooklyn, said that he feels the details of religious practice are pertinent, insofar as they relate to the well-being of the children.\u201cIt is something that matters, be it kosher food, or the way the mother dresses,\u201d he said. For example, he said, when \u201cthe mother has to take the child out to the bus stop in front of the house, and the whole block looks, it is something that might embarrass the kid.\u201d\u201cIt might look trivial for a person who doesn\u2019t observe these things, but it\u2019s not trivial for the friends and for the peers of the child,\u201d he added. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the child to be shunned in school. Children can sometimes be extremely vicious.\u201dMr. Rapaport said that it was only to be expected that a judge would look unfavorably on someone who reneged on an original agreement, even if that agreement was signed in a beth din. But family lawyers say they see differences in how much weight various secular judges give to the rulings of a Jewish court.Pronounced deference to beth din agreements, they say, tends to happen in jurisdictions where judges, some of whom are familiar with Jewish customs, are elected by large populations of ultra-Orthodox Jews, like Brooklyn or Rockland County, N.Y.\u201cA lot depends on the judge,\u201d Ms. Susser said. \u201cSome are excellent, some may be biased.\u201dJustice Prus, who lives in Cedarhurst on Long Island, is an observant Jew himself, which some advocates for the formerly ultra-Orthodox believe contributes to his willingness to wade deep into the details of religious practice in his Downtown Brooklyn courtroom. But he hears every kind of matrimonial case, and on Wednesday, he was a stern, fast-talking presence, chiding an estranged couple for relying too much on attorneys rather than working out small issues face to face.\u201cI can\u2019t instill common sense in you,\u201d he told them.\u201cI didn\u2019t foresee my family turning on me,\u201d said Ms. Ausch, who has also since come out as lesbian. \u201cI didn\u2019t foresee my best friends, my family, coming to court and testifying against me.\u201dIt is not only women who are losing access to children based on details of their religious practice. Julie F. Kay, a human rights lawyer in private practice, said she knew of at least one court that issued an order denying a formerly ultra-Orthodox father visitation rights because he showed up to a parental visit in jeans, which are not permitted to be worn by the ultra-Orthodox.The situation is raising human rights concerns, she said, in part because American case law strongly establishes that children should not be kept away from a parent just because a conservative community might disapprove of his or her identity.\u201cWe have a strong protection of religious rights in this country, and it\u2019s supposed to be a shield,\u201d Ms. Kay said. \u201cBut they are using it as a sword. The government is enabling people to force their religious beliefs on others as a condition to maintain their relationships with their children.\u201dPart of the issue, family lawyers said, flows from the guiding principle in family court: all decisions are made to serve the \u201cbest interests of the children.\u201d A parent\u2019s rights can quickly become secondary in this setting, where overworked judges may pressure parties to settle quickly.Some who have left the ultra-Orthodox say that in recent years, the community has become more organized in how it aids the religious parent and ostracizes the parent leaving the fold.But Mr. Rapaport said it was conspiracy-minded to accuse the community of acting as a monolith. Instead, he said, individual parents suing for custody are relying on their large networks of relatives and friends to help make their case, as anyone would.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the most split-up community you could ever think of. It\u2019s very rare to get people together for one cause. Everyone marches to their own drummer here; it\u2019s like herding cats.\u201dMs. Weisberger married her husband, Naftali, in 2002 when she was 19. They decided to get a religious divorce in 2008 after she came to terms with her sexuality and revealed to her husband that she was a lesbian. As she came to accept herself, she also began to reject her ultra-Orthodox upbringing, which teaches that homosexuality is forbidden.She involved her children in her transformation. In their apartment, they made a word wall that included universal values like \u201cperseverance\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d to guide them. She allowed the children to try nonkosher food, like a chicken kebab at a street fair, and permitted her girls to wear pants in the house. That violated the terms of her religious divorce agreement, which required her to raise the children Hasidic.Her ex-husband, meanwhile, had remarried. He was failing to pay child support to Ms. Weisberger, or even to visit regularly with the three children, according to court papers. But as soon as he sued for custody in 2012, the couple\u2019s children, then 5, 7 and 9, were removed from Ms. Weisberger\u2019s care. A week later, Justice Prus permitted her temporary visitation for part of each week, provided that she maintain strict religious practices in the presence of the children.It took three years for the Justice Prus to make his ruling. During that time, Ms. Weisberger acted religiously as ordered, but she was also open with the court about her sexual identity and her shift toward a secular worldview.\u201cI had been scrambling to find my truth and to live my truth, and it was just like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, this is where I am,\u2019\u201d she said.Justice Prus awarded sole custody to her ex-husband, ruling that her personal transformation had caused too much turmoil for the children, who attended yeshivas and were struggling to live between two worlds.\u201cGiven the existence of the agreement\u2019s very clear directives,\u201d Justice Prus wrote, referring to the Jewish divorce agreement, \u201cthis court was obligated to consider the religious upbringing of the children as a paramount factor in any custody determination.\u201d It is, he added, \u201cthe crux of the agreement.\u201d\u201cEach party\u2019s lifestyle is completely antithetical and antagonistic toward the other,\u201d so no compromise was possible, he added in his ruling.Ms. Weisberger decided to appeal. Her attorneys enlisted the help of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, which advocates for gay rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union, both of which wrote briefs on her behalf. In August, the appeals court overturned Justice Prus\u2019s decision and restored full physical custody to Ms. Weisberger.\u201cIt is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise,\u201d the judges of the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division wrote. \u201cA religious upbringing clause should not, and cannot, be enforced to the extent that it violates a parent\u2019s legitimate due process right to express oneself and live freely.\u201dMs. Weisberger now works at Footsteps, helping other formerly ultra-Orthodox men and women adjust to secular lives their upbringings did not prepare them for. Though she no longer has to pretend to be religious, she still keeps kosher at home, and sends the children to ultra-Orthodox yeshivas, because the appeals court granted authority over schooling decisions to her ex-husband.But the children can now check out secular books from the public library, forbidden to them before. Ms. Weisberger recently had a Harry Potter-themed birthday party for her youngest daughter. The children, now 11, 12 and 15, are learning how to navigate both of their worlds, and adjusting to more regular visits with their father.Mr. Weisberger, who now also has five children from his second marriage, did not respond to a request for comment. His upstairs neighbor in the two-family house where he lives in Borough Park said she thought the whole situation was a shame.\u201cHe\u2019s very nice, he wants the children to be on a good path,\u201d she said of Mr. Weisberger, giving her name only as Tzyve. \u201cThey are very nice children, very cute. The new wife, she takes care of them very well.\u201dMs. Weisberger said she hopes her case will give other parents leaving the ultra-Orthodox community courage to be honest about their secular or gay identities in court.\u201cPeople kept telling me I was choosing nonkosher food over my own children; I was doing this to my own children. But I was that confident that I could be the person I am, and that\u2019s what\u2019s best for my children \u2014 that I was able to shut out those messages.\u201dBut family lawyers and advocates say they still advise parents turning away from ultra-Orthodoxy to be cautious with their new identities because of the likelihood that access to their children could still be threatened.\u201cYes, it\u2019s really nice to come out and be honest,\u201d said Ms. Getter of Footsteps. \u201cBut when you have kids, and you are in the court system, and have the community fighting you, I always say you need to slow it down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dear Movie Industry, We Have Thoughts", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery so often, our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, fire off a number of thoughtful memos to the movie industry and the industry-adjacent. These messages are largely ignored, which does not stop Ms. Dargis and Mr. Scott from continuing this semi-serious tradition. Given the new summer season and how deeply fraught the past year has been \u2014 Harvey Weinstein, Netflix, #MeToo, #oscarsalittlelesswhitebutnotmuch \u2014 it was time for our critics to weigh in again with their thoughts (and complaints).No pressure, but you\u2019re all we\u2019ve got right now. Don\u2019t mess it up.[Ms. Dargis has decided to remain quiet on this subject in favor of her more temperate colleague.]What are you watching? Nobody knows! The streaming service doesn\u2019t share its numbers. But many of us love it anyway, just like we loved getting those DVDs in the mail. There is so much good stuff in the queue, all available for home viewing. Original movies and TV shows and much more besides, though it isn\u2019t always easy to find.Every distributor of content, including movie studios and this newspaper, seeks to monetize a share of human attention. The tech giants, whose ranks Netflix aspires to join, want something more like a monopoly, to be the conduit for as much of our experience as they can.At the moment, the terms of the bargain look attractive, and the complaints trivial. Netflix is throwing money at creative people (Chris Rock and Shonda Rhimes) and cool movies (\u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d and \u201cMudbound\u201d) and turning our queues into cornucopias. What we get is endless choice and stupefying abundance. We might risk losing something of greater value, though. An infinite archive and a perfect algorithm don\u2019t add up to a culture.So \u2026 subtitles. Apparently you are not a fan, as we know from \u201cIsle of Dogs,\u201d a fantasy you far too carelessly set in Japan. You were sharply criticized for your representation of Japanese people and culture, which is, you know, understandable given that its canine heroes all speak in cute English while much of what the Japanese human characters say remains untranslated. You\u2019ve said that \u201csubtitles didn\u2019t seem that fun\u201d and that \u201cwhen you\u2019re reading subtitles, you\u2019re really focused on the subtitles all through the movie and you don\u2019t listen to the language as much.\u201d I assume that you didn\u2019t want subtitles messing with your beautiful, meticulously designed visuals \u2014 but come on!First of all, you have my gratitude and admiration for breathing life into the fainting corpse of adventurous, independent, democratic American cinema. The movie world is better for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d and \u201cLady Bird\u201d and for the genre experiments and argument starters that have filled out your slate since \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d put you on the map in 2013.Your movies play in festivals alongside a lot of interesting films from other countries, films that have an increasingly hard time finding traction in the American marketplace, in theaters or on streaming platforms. Maybe you could use some of your money to acquire a few, and your marketing savvy to connect them with the audience you have already cultivated, which is young, worldly and curious. And also capable of reading subtitles.More than six months later, female activists, like those in Time\u2019s Up, are admirably working for real change. But as Sun Tzu or perhaps Angelina Jolie once said, the only thing that power understands is greater power, which in the industry often means money. But there are different forms of power, including that of self-determination. Actresses turned producer-directors like Lois Weber who worked in early cinema understood that and so did Ida Lupino back in the 1950s. So it\u2019s heartening to see performers like Ms. Jolie, Charlize Theron, Eva Longoria, Rachel Weisz and Alia Shawkat help bring female-driven stories onto the screen. More, please.Please read some history. About the Salem witch trials, the Spanish Inquisition, the martyrdom of early Christians, Joseph McCarthy, Joseph Stalin, the Gestapo, Pol Pot and any of the other historical monsters and catastrophes you like to invoke when talking about whatever is bothering you in contemporary culture. Also please refrain from hyperbolically throwing around words like \u201csilencing,\u201d \u201cthought police\u201d and \u201ccensorship\u201d in reference to criticism on social media or elsewhere. People who indulge in this kind of rhetorical inflation are like rats spreading bubonic plague.What, exactly, is so complicated about dealing with discrimination and harassment?You are perhaps at this moment breathing a sigh of relief, crawling out from under your desk and looking forward to getting back to business as usual. The daily barrage of news reports about bad men in your industry (and many others) seems to have subsided, and in some circles the talk has even turned to redemption. It\u2019s comeback time! Not in every case, of course, but if Harvey Weinstein ends up being the guy who takes the fall for everyone else, you won\u2019t mind. You never much liked him anyway (even if you used to tell anyone in earshot what good friends you were).As for you: Your harassment never reached the level of assault; your flirting and touching wasn\u2019t really harassment; your general contempt for women doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not one of the good guys. If your first two wives won\u2019t vouch for you, the third one surely will. And for whatever reason, you were spared. You\u2019ve picked up a new vocabulary \u2014 \u201creckoning,\u201d \u201crespect,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with our values\u201d \u2014 and adjusted your behavior a bit, mostly by making self-conscious jokes about being a white man and loudly professing admiration for the strength and bravery of certain actresses. You sometimes worry that the whole #MeToo thing might be going too far, but your own position seems secure. Your #time, by golly, is not yet #up.Keep telling yourself that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Repeat Seizures, Memory Loss and Wild Mood Swings: What Is Happening to This Man?", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.The early-morning quiet was interrupted by the sound of a large object falling. \u201cWillie?\u201d the middle-aged woman called out to her husband, who moments earlier disappeared into the bathroom for his daily prework shower. \u201cWillie?\u201d she repeated, moving to the bathroom door. Hearing no answer, she opened the door. Her 43-year-old husband was lying on the floor, his eyes just a sliver of brown iris, above bloodshot white. His arms and legs were jerking. There was blood all over his face and on the floor around his head. Her husband of 16 years was having a seizure.Their tiny poodle had followed her and now stood outside the bathroom door barking. Even she knew this wasn\u2019t right. The woman dropped to her knees and slid her hands behind her husband\u2019s head searching for a cut. Where was all this blood coming from? His thick dark hair was slick with the warm liquid but she couldn\u2019t find a source. His mouth fell open, and a stream of blood escaped his purplish lips, running down the side of his face. Blood filled his mouth as if it were some kind of cup. Was she going to have to do CPR on him, she wondered? She turned his face to the side and an unimaginable amount of blood flowed out of his mouth and onto the floor. A normal ruddy color came back into his lips. \u201cCall 911,\u201d she shouted to her 14-year-old daughter. \u201cAnd don\u2019t come in here.\u201dBy the time the E.M.T.s arrived, the seizure was over, the man had regained consciousness and his wife had helped him sit up. His head left a bloody mark on the shower door, and he babbled senselessly. His speech was so slurred she could barely understand him. Was that from the cut on his tongue, or had he had a stroke? By the time the ambulance got the man to Memorial Medical Center, in nearby Las Cruces, N.M., he was making more sense, but his words were still garbled.In the emergency department his blood pressure was dangerously high \u2014 he hadn\u2019t taken his blood pressure medications, maybe not for days, he admitted. He was having trouble with his memory. These days nothing seemed to stick in his brain, and that included the need to take his pills. Could this very high blood pressure be the reason he had a seizure? the woman asked the E.R. doctors. No one could tell her. Other than his blood pressure, his exam was normal, the E.R. doctor said, so it didn\u2019t look as if he had a stroke. Blood tests showed only an elevated white-blood-cell count \u2014 not uncommon after a seizure. And his liver tests were a little abnormal. Did he drink a lot? Sometimes, she reported. That could have been why. A head CT was unremarkable, with no sign of a stroke or a mass or an infection, or indeed anything that might have triggered this seizure.The next day, Willie went to see the neurologist. The doctor took a thorough history: Willie had never had a seizure of any type before; no head trauma or stroke or surgery. No double vision, or difficulty speaking or swallowing. He was very hard of hearing in his right ear and sometimes had episodes of dizziness, but that started nearly a decade earlier. Back then, an ear, nose and throat doctor told him that he had something called Meniere\u2019s disease. (Meniere\u2019s is a disorder of the inner ear that is characterized by hearing loss, tinnitus and episodic vertigo.) That problem had been stable for years. He had high blood pressure and took a medicine for that. Otherwise, he had been healthy his whole life.Again, a careful examination revealed nothing. The neurologist ordered an electroencephalogram (EEG) to try to localize the source and identify the type of seizure. He also ordered an M.R.I. of Willie\u2019s brain. M.R.I.s can show anatomy not seen by a CT scanner. The doctor reminded the patient and his wife how important it was for him to take his medication every day and instructed him not to drive until they were certain his seizures were under control. And they were to come back to see him in three months.\u2193Seizures are relatively common events, with 1 in 10 adults having at least one in their lifetime. And for up to half, it will be the only seizure they ever have. There are many types of seizures. Some can be restricted to a single area of the brain. Others, like the type this patient had, spread throughout the brain, first causing all the muscles in the body to tighten and then to jerk. After a generalized type of seizure the patient usually falls into a deep sleep and is often confused upon awakening. Seizures can be caused by something systemic and potentially treatable \u2014 like an infection or a toxic ingestion \u2014 or can be triggered by an abnormality in the brain itself. This latter kind can result in repeated seizures and require anti-seizure medications. The EEG and M.R.I. are done to help identify the possible causes of a first seizure. And to see if he was likely to have another. For most patients with a first seizure, however, both tests are likely to be normal.The EEG and M.R.I. were done the next day. The EEG was normal, but the M.R.I. was not. The neurologist brought the patient and his wife back to the office so he could give them the results in person. They were worrisome. The M.R.I. showed several poorly defined bright areas at the top of the brainstem near the center of the brain. The largest was a little larger that the gum balls you might get from a machine, in an area of the brain called the pons. There were other areas of brightness, higher in the midbrain, forward near the bottom of the frontal lobes and to both sides in the temporal lobes. The radiologist\u2019s report listed several possible causes for these extensive changes. None of them were good news.On the top of the radiologist\u2019s list: infection. Could this be some kind of infection of the brain itself? The herpes virus is the most common. Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections can do it as well as tuberculosis and a bacteria called mycoplasma, which usually causes \u201cwalking\u201d or atypical pneumonias. Cancer that spread to the brain was another frightening possibility. Finally, autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis or lupus were also possible.The neurologist thought infection was very unlikely. Other than the seizure, the patient had no symptoms at all. He was more concerned about some type of cancer. He arranged for the patient to see an oncologist the following day. The oncologist sent him for a CT scan of his chest, abdomen and pelvis. All normal. The neurologist then arranged for a spinal tap. The fluid from the tap contained more protein than normal but showed no evidence of a cancer or of infection. There was no sign of an autoimmune disease in either the patient\u2019s spinal fluid or blood.\u2193In between doctor visits and trips to the hospital for additional testing, Willie and his family tried to live their lives. Willie worked in law enforcement but found himself able to do less and less. He was forgetting so much that it was hard for him to do his job. He gave up drinking after that first seizure. The doctor in the E.D. and his neurologist had persuaded him that while it hadn\u2019t caused the seizure, it was probably not helping.Giving it up hadn\u2019t helped his memory. If anything, it made it clear to him and his wife just how much of his life he\u2019d lost. Days after his seizure, his mother was visiting him. He asked about a close friend of the family\u2019s, saying he hadn\u2019t seen her for a while. His mother\u2019s face froze. He watched as his mother and wife exchanged looks. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d his wife said quietly, \u201cyour friend died a few months ago.\u201d You went to the funeral. Even with this reminder he had no memory of this terrible loss. He felt hot tears flow uncontrollably down his face; he got up and walked out of the room. What was happening to him?Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions.

Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.He went to Memorial Medical Center the second time three months later. It wasn\u2019t for a seizure but for something else, which seemed to him and his wife even scarier. That day started off like any other. But when Willie\u2019s wife got home from her job, their daughter met her at the door.\u201d Mommy,\u201d she said, \u201csomething is wrong with Daddy.\u201d She hurried into the kitchen and found her husband sitting at the table eyes fixed in front of him, as if looking at something no one else could see. She said his name. He didn\u2019t answer. She said it again louder; then again and again. Finally, he answered. He was fine, just fine, he answered without looking at her. Nothing was the matter, he said in a strange and quiet voice. And yet it was clear to both his wife and daughter that something was very much the matter.Her first thought was that maybe her husband was drunk. Until then she believed him when he told her he hadn\u2019t touched a drop since his seizure. Now she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cWillie, have you been drinking?\u201d She asked him over and over again. No drinking, he told her, when he finally seemed to understand what she was asking. Now she was really worried. If it wasn\u2019t beer, what was happening?Willie\u2019s wife didn\u2019t know what to make of it, and neither did Willie\u2019s neurologist.\u2193Willie had a second seizure a few months later. It was early in the morning, and his wife felt him moving around in the bed as if arranging the covers. She rolled over to look at him and saw him jerking in that immediately recognizable way. She let the seizure pass, making sure that he didn\u2019t get too close to the edge of the bed and that he was breathing. She didn\u2019t go to the hospital. They didn\u2019t seem to have any idea of what was wrong with her husband. She called his neurologist, and he increased the dose of the anti-seizure medication.As the days and weeks passed, it was clear that her husband was getting worse. Every day he seemed to remember less and less of their lives together. He asked her to tell him the story of their daughter\u2019s birth. He couldn\u2019t remember. He was in the Army and had been deployed to Iraq as part of Desert Storm. And yet now he couldn\u2019t remember where he went in Iraq or even the names of any of his buddies. The men he\u2019d spent every day and night with for months. Gone. As if Desert Storm had never happened. He confessed to his wife that he was worried that one day he would wake up and not even remember her or his daughter. She tried to reassure him, but she had the same worry.But that wasn\u2019t the only change. Over the past few months he\u2019d become wildly emotional. Every day, sometimes several times a day, he would become overwhelmed with sadness, and tears would roll down his wide, tanned cheeks. He was helpless to stop them. He had no control. He couldn\u2019t make himself think of happy thoughts the way his wife suggested. When these spells came upon him he felt as if he couldn\u2019t think at all.Even before this second seizure, the neurologist referred the patient to the Epilepsy Center at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. It was three hours away, but he\u2019d done everything he could think of to help this middle-aged man with mysterious brain lesions. He simply needed more expertise than he could provide.\u2193Willie\u2019s wife called the Clinical Neuroscience Center in Albuquerque. They couldn\u2019t schedule him an appointment for months. She made the appointment but was overwhelmed by the thought of how much more he might lose before he could be seen.Willie\u2019s aunt suggested that they take him to the Mayo Clinic. There was a branch a few hours away in Scottsdale, Arizona. She sent an email describing her husband\u2019s illness. They called her within a week with questions, then scheduled an appointment for Willie to be seen. They told her they would need her husband\u2019s records, so she contacted all his doctors and collected them. And then she packed her husband and daughter into the car.Over the next year, she and her husband traveled to Scottsdale a half dozen times. He had repeat M.R.I.\u2019s, more spinal taps, dozens of tests performed on his blood and the fluid taken from his spine. He had nearly a month of high-dose steroids to treat a possible autoimmune disorder. After six months of testing and treatment, the decision was made to get tissue from the brain itself. His largest lesion was deep inside a part of the brain known as the pons. Many of the most important nerves in the brain pass through that region. It is the Grand Central Terminal for much of the brain \u2014 serving as a connecting point between the various parts. Once the decision was made to take some of the brain tissue, this seemed the best place to look. The risk of damaging this key pathway was present, but it was thought to be the most likely spot to provide answers. And yet it didn\u2019t. That biopsy showed only nonspecific signs of chronic inflammation. No sign of what might be driving that inflammation.Last October, just weeks after that second, unsuccessful biopsy, the patient lost his job. Willie\u2019s first seizure occurred in February 2016. It\u2019s been nearly two and a half years and while his seizures are under control, he continues to worsen. His hearing is worse; his memory is worse; and he continues to have uncontrollable mood shifts that can reduce him to tears in a heartbeat.Willie\u2019s wife is beginning to think that much of what her husband has lost may never be regained. But she continues to hope that somehow, someone will be able to come up with a diagnosis and that maybe then, they will be able to stop the losses. And despite all that\u2019s happened to him, Willie still has some of his old sense of humor. If he loses everything, he joked to me, then he\u2019d have to depend on his wife and daughter to make him a video reminding him of who they are and what he\u2019s been through. It will be, his wife adds, their own version of 50 First Dates, a reference to the 2004 film with Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler. Willie laughs. So do his wife and daughter. But, at the same time, tears stream down all three faces.Do you have any thoughts on what could be eating away Willie\u2019s memory and brain? Any recommendations on what Willie and his wife and doctors should consider next?Enter your comments below, and briefly describe your thinking; how a diagnosis is made is often as revealing as the diagnosis itself. All answers will be reviewed, and the most promising diagnoses will be shared with the patient and his primary-care physicians.I\u2019ll post an update in the coming days.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Illustration by Andreas Samuelsson.

Screams of joy follow. Stunned, the mother runs out of the room for a second and then runs back to embrace her daughter, wrapping her arms around her. The video became a viral sensation and has generated north of 15 million views. (Only half of them by me.) \u201cThere is so much negativity on the web,\u201d said the younger Mr. Meixelsperger. \u201cI think these homecoming videos bring people back to reality about sacrifice and what is important.\u201dAn online platform through which people can solicit financial donations for those in need (including themselves), GoFundMe is a source of some of the saddest and most heartbreaking content online. Its campaigns almost always make me cry, and very often, they also compel me to make donations to total strangers.Founded in 2010, the company has helped users to raise more than $5 billion, often used to to help cover funeral and medical expenses and other costs arising from emergencies. Until recently, the company took a 5 percent cut of all donations, in addition a slice of the credit card processing fees.Last fall, it changed its policy and now offers use of the platform for free for personal campaigns in the United States, Canada and some countries in Europe, with United States donors charged a credit card processing fee of 2.9 percent, a portion of which goes to GoFundMe. (Certified charities are still charged 5 percent, and voluntary \u201ctips\u201d are solicited from those creating personal campaigns.)GoFundMe pages tend to look like basic blog posts, but the company has created a new division, GoFundMe Studios, that sends production teams to locations around the world to film heart-tugging documentary-style videos about various causes. The point is to convey to as broad an audience as possible that the site is about more than paying for funerals. \u201cThere is a hunger for these life-affirming stories,\u201d said Raquel Rozas, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, and they can inspire additional campaigns.Earlier this spring, a team led by Wil Tidman, the head of GoFundMe Studios, traveled to the rural community of Louisa County, Va. (population: approximately 35,000), to film a video at the local high school. Students in the newspaper and leadership classes had gone to local businesses, soliciting sponsorships for Ms. Fletcher\u2019s 100-mile run. They came up with nearly $10,000, almost double the amount donated last year when Ms. Fletcher ran for an entire school day. Mr. Tidman and his team put together storyboards to map out some of the shots they wanted to help convey the drama, leading toward an emotional climax. They gathered footage the day before: of dilapidated houses lining the roads that connect Ms. Fletcher\u2019s home to the school, as well as of Ms. Fletcher jogging the sidewalks of the economically struggling commercial center of Louisa.\u201cThere is so much content coming at us from social-media feeds, and a lot of it is creating a numbness,\u201d said Mr. Tidman, formerly the vice president for original productions for GoPro, the action-camera company. \u201cI want us to help people turn that numbness into something else, something that has feeling and emotion.\u201dSeveral inches of snow fell on the April day of Ms. Fletcher\u2019s run, enhancing the drama; temperatures hovered in the 30s. The production team had worked with Ms. Hicks to plan a number of surprises that would boost Ms. Fletcher\u2019s spirits and add emotion.Former students of Ms. Fletcher who credit her with helping them get to college showed up throughout the day and night to run with her. Ms. Fletcher\u2019s daughter arrived for a few laps. They had planned for the school\u2019s marching band to descend a hill toward the track just as she was finishing her 400th lap, but her pace slowed after she had run about 80 miles. So that wasn\u2019t quite the climax Mr. Tidman and his team had hoped for.Still, a flood of students rushed down the hill from school to the track, encircling Ms. Fletcher as she hit the 400-lap mark.In the finished film, former students read letters of thanks to Ms. Fletcher as the camera shows her running in the mist. The effect, as the kids would say: #AllTheFeels. As of early this week, it had generated over $22,000 more in donations than last year\u2019s campaign, which was sans video. Legacy media has plenty to cry about, but sad shows are a bright spot in the television business. There is no bigger tear-jerker than NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d a multigenerational family drama told in present tense and flashbacks. The second season ended in March. That the show makes people cry is a big part of NBC\u2019s promotional strategy. On social media, the program\u2019s feeds regularly share viewers\u2019 sobbing reactions. \u201cI have an ugly cry headache. Anyone else love this show like I do?\u201d said one fan on Twitter. The show reposted this and added the comment, \u201cThere are a few that might,\u201d with a winking emoji.In another tweet, a new viewer who works from home wondered how many tissues she would need.Like with most makeover shows, leading viewers to a catharsis is built in to the formula. \u201cThe nice thing about our show is we are there to help, and when you help someone, there will be emotion,\u201d said David Collins, its creator.The juxtaposition of cosmopolitan gay men with men living, in some cases, in quiet towns in the Deep South is a setup for a lot of funny situations, but poignant ones too. In several episodes, members of the so-called Fab Five confront individuals who have not interacted much with gay people. In an episode focused on a makeover of a conservative Christian named Bobby Camp, Bobby Berk, the interior-decorating expert, is reminded of his religious upbringing and childhood feelings of shame about his sexuality. Sobfest! Karamo Brown, who is black and the team\u2019s resident adviser on cultural matters, finds common ground in another episode with Cory, a white police officer and supporter of President Trump. If that episode doesn\u2019t make you cry, it at least gives you hope. \u201cWe are showing the conversation that more Americans should be having,\u201d said Rob Eric, an executive producer of the show.At the top of the industrial complex of tears stands \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d the daytime talk show that provides the web with some of its most viral tear-jerking content. There are military reunions; there are surprised holiday shopping sprees and college scholarships; there are celebrity duets with children of cancer patients. Catharsis reigns.When Ms. DeGeneres was conceiving the format and tone of her show in 2003, she insisted that compassion and empathy would guild her humor, Ms. Connelly said.\u201cThere was a time when I was the person people were making fun of,\u201d Ms. Connelly remembers the host saying. \u201cAfter I came out, I would turn on late night TV and people would be making fun of me and it hurt my feelings.\u201dIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, which is Ms. DeGeneres\u2019s hometown. She told her producers she wanted to create segments that helped the community and also that focused on the good work taking place in the storm\u2019s aftermath. This created a genre of segments that viewers of the show have come to expect \u2014 as they once did from \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d \u2014 along with comedy bits and celebrity interviews. After he described the ordeal in a calm and humble manner, Ms. DeGeneres asked him who he considered a hero. Mr. Shaw cited Dwyane Wade, the star shooting guard with the Miami Heat. \u201cI like the way he carries himself off the court,\u201d Mr. Shaw said.\u201cLet\u2019s see how he carries himself out here,\u201d Ms. DeGeneres said.Mr. Wade walked onto the stage. He and Mr. Shaw hugged. I wept.Advertisement"}

It Got Raw.", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "In a wide-ranging conversation about the new season, cast members became emotional as they discussed accusations of sexual misconduct against Jeffrey Tambor.Supported byPerhaps no moment better defines \u201cArrested Development\u201d than a recent attempt by Tony Hale, who plays the high-strung, blissfully immature (and one-handed) Buster Bluth, to set up a promotional clip on \u201cConan.\u201dThis week many of the actors got together for a group interview about the new season, including Mr. Tambor, Mr. Hale, Jason Bateman (Michael), Alia Shawkat (Maeby F\u00fcnke), Jessica Walter (Lucille), Will Arnett (Gob) and David Cross (Tobias F\u00fcnke).\u201cI have to let go of being angry at him,\u201d Ms. Walter said through tears, as Mr. Tambor sat a few feet away. In \u201calmost 60 years of working, I\u2019ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set and it\u2019s hard to deal with, but I\u2019m over it now.\u201dWhen Mr. Bateman painted Mr. Tambor\u2019s behavior as typical of certain performers, Ms. Shawkat interjected: \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acceptable.\u201dIt was a notably raw interlude for a cast better known for absurd antics, and it reflected the emotional complexities of Hollywood\u2019s ongoing reckoning with toxic male behavior. It was also just part of a wide-ranging interview that touched on awkward fans, the comedic limitations of the Trump family and how long these actors can keep playing the Bluths. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Fan devotion to this show is legendary. Who has a good story about an interaction in the street? You have played these characters off and on for 15 years. When it came time to return for the Netflix seasons, did it come right back?

Tony, there\u2019s no learning curve for you in dealing with Buster\u2019s gigantic hand, or hook, or jeweled hook? Is there much improv on the set?Whatever criticisms there were of Season 4, it was remarkably prescient. You guys had the border wall before Trump did, and there was a subplot about \u201cFake Block\u201d and privacy.You take on Trump a lot more directly in this season. How does the show navigate that? Were there jokes in the new season that were either scaled back or dropped because it was just too real? I have to address the elephant in the room, which is the allegations from the \u201cTransparent\u201d set. The \u201cArrested Development\u201d cast has been publicly supportive. Jeffrey, if there\u2019s another season, do you expect to be a part of it?From the Hollywood Reporter interview, you talked about how you yelled at directors, assistant directors, the \u201cTransparent\u201d creator Jill Soloway. You even said at one point you lashed out at \u2014[LAUGHTER]If someone approached you and said, \u201cO.K., here\u2019s an actor that admits he routinely yells at directors, at assistant directors, at co-workers, assistants,\u201d would you hire that person?And you feel like you have?  I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I have no idea what it\u2019s like to be on a set. I\u2019ve never been on one. But it seems like Jason is saying that this is part of the process. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying, Jessica.I realize this is an awkward question to ask with Jeffrey in the room.

{"Headline": "How Dostoyevsky Predicted the \u2018True Crime\u2019 Craze", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Wilson is a scholar of Russian literature.The \u201ctrue crime\u201d genre, spurred by podcasts like \u201cSerial\u201d and shows like Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down. That\u2019s welcome news for those who seek criminal justice reform. The genre is increasingly framed as reformist, with critiques of police abuses, overzealous prosecutions and mass incarceration playing central roles.In this way, today\u2019s true crime resurgence has an antecedent in the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the Russian author of numerous novels about murder including, most famously, \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d Dostoyevsky was obsessed with the judiciary. He spent considerable time watching trials, debating with lawyers about the nature of innocence and guilt, visiting the accused in prison and trying to sway public opinion about certain cases. So enmeshed were Dostoyevsky and his writing in the legal consciousness of czarist Russia that defense attorneys were known to invoke Rodion Raskolnikov, the charismatic murderer-protagonist of \u201cCrime and Punishment,\u201d when seeking sympathy from the jury.Like many of today\u2019s true crime authors, filmmakers and podcast hosts, Dostoyevsky wrote about crime (in both his fiction and journalism) as a way to uncover the lapses and deficiencies, as he perceived them, in the legal code. Unlike contemporary consumers of true crime, who find themselves in the middle of a larger national conversation about police brutality and racial bias in sentencing, Dostoyevsky was writing at a time of tremendous enthusiasm and hope regarding the future of Russian jurisprudence. In 1864, Czar Alexander II instituted sweeping changes to the legal code, the most radical of which was the introduction of the jury trial. Dostoyevsky shared the country\u2019s excitement over the changes, writing to a friend: \u201cWe will have just courts everywhere. What a great regeneration that will be! (... I keep thinking and dreaming of all these things, and my heart beats faster over it.)\u201dDostoyevsky himself had been victim to an overzealous judicial system. In 1849, he was sentenced to death for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle, an intellectual society influenced by the French utopian socialists. In an event that became pivotal to his ideas on mercy, punishment and death, he watched as the first group of his co-conspirators was rounded up for the firing squad, only to learn, minutes before it was his turn to die, that the sentenced had been commuted.Despite his initial excitement about the legal reforms, over the course of covering the new trials (which, as part of the reforms, were now open to the public), he began to have serious doubts about the courts. For one, Russian juries produced an unusually high number of acquittals (about 40 percent in all cases). Dostoyevsky was likewise inclined toward clemency, writing approvingly of the acquittal of a pregnant woman named Kornilova who threw her 6-year-old stepdaughter from a four-story window. But what concerned him was that with acquittals came a tendency to view sympathetic justice solely through the prism of legal exoneration. Where was the space, he wondered, to properly attend to the moral regeneration of those who had committed acts of violence?Dostoyevsky ultimately wanted people to feel more at ease with the concept of guilt, to embrace it as a feature of common humanity and to recognize our own complicity in the everyday acts of violence (cruelty, lack of love, stinginess) that drive people to moral transgressions.He devoted his final novel, \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov,\u201d to developing the idea of \u201ccollective guilt.\u201d At the book\u2019s center is the murder of Fyodor Karamazov, a derelict father who was violent, abusive and selfish, leading all his sons to, consciously or subconsciously, desire his demise. Though ultimately killed by his illegitimate son, the other children all come to accept their own culpability in the steps that led to their father\u2019s murder. The eldest, Dmitri, is eventually falsely accused (another sign of Dostoyevsky\u2019s disenchantment with the post-reform courts), but he is ready to accept moral culpability, he says, because \u201ceveryone is guilty for everyone else.\u201dAs true crime shows continue to proliferate today, Dostoyevsky\u2019s evolution as a crime writer could prove instructive in expanding the genre\u2019s reformist potential. While true crime podcasts and television series admirably shine a light on the cases of people trapped in the contradictions of the American justice system, equal attention should be paid to stories of restorative justice, like that exemplified by podcasts like \u201cEar Hustle,\u201d which is produced by inmates in San Quentin State Prison in California. As Dostoyevsky implored through his novels and reporting, it is not only our task to support the innocent or wrongly convicted but also to recognize the humanity of the guilty and the shared sense of responsibility that we have for one another.An earlier version of this essay described the circumstances of Curtis Flowers\u2019s sentencing incorrectly. The death penalty was imposed by the jury, not by the prosecutor.Advertisement"}

Not interested in the fairy tale? Sit back and enjoy watching Harry\u2019s predecessors fight, scheme and rebel instead.TV ShowBack in the 16th century, the role of queen existed primarily to produce an heir. A daughter was considered fine, but only sons could really be trusted with the throne. King Henry VIII \u2014 glutton, narcissist and bully \u2014 was ruthless in his pursuit of a male heir, ultimately cycling through six wives over the course of his 36-year reign.\u201cThe Tudors\u201d takes a soapy look at this homicidal husband, bouncing merrily between the bedroom and the throne room with the help of an all-star cast and a lot of modern touches. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is Henry, Natalie Dormer is his temptress Anne Boleyn, and Sam Neill is the priest who helped Henry break with the Catholic church so that Henry and Boleyn could be married.TV ShowMovieMovieElizabeth I was known as the Virgin Queen because she never married, but unmarried didn\u2019t have to mean chaste. Shekhar Kapur\u2019s film \u201cElizabeth\u201d has the princess (Cate Blanchett) canoodling with Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) when she is accused of heresy and arrested by her sister, who was then on the throne. The film then follows her unexpected journey from terrified prisoner to powerful queen, not shying away from the violence and instability of England in the 16th century \u2014 a time when people there were burned alive for being the wrong kind of Christian. Concerns over whom she will marry and when she\u2019ll provide an heir loom large throughout this poetically filmed biopic, pressing in on her until she makes a decision, declaring to herself, \u201cI have become a virgin.\u201dMovieA royal wedding can, of course, be followed by a royal divorce, and no divorce has drawn more public attention than when Harry\u2019s parents split up. When Diana, Princess of Wales, died in 1997, she had been divorced from Prince Charles for a year and was no longer a member of the royal family. For the Queen, that meant deciding that there was no need for the royal family to add its voice to the public\u2019s incredible outpouring of grief. She didn\u2019t fly the flags over her palaces at half-mast, which many newspapers presented as deeply disrespectful.Helen Mirren plays a chilly Elizabeth, who starts to doubt how well she knows her own people as she navigates her biggest controversy to date. Director Stephen Frears deftly splices archival footage with imagined discussions taking place between the Queen and those close to her, teasing out the tension between royal protocol and celebrity culture, as an old power system confronts a new one.TV ShowTV ShowDuring Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, the British Empire swelled to cover a quarter of the world. The British believed that Queen Victoria was the Empire in human form, which, in retrospect, wasn\u2019t really something for her to be proud of. At the beginning of this five-part BBC documentary from 2012, the presenter, Jeremy Paxman, promises that the series will confront the horrors perpetrated in the British colonies. But perhaps inevitably, the series more often lapses into the usual celebrations of the empire\u2019s former strength, although the fourth episode is unflinching in its recounting of the atrocities perpetrated by slave owners and British opium trade.The series certainly has its flaws, but it stands as a fascinating example of contemporary Britain\u2019s attempt to grapple with its colonial past. Paxman, a well-known British political journalist, visits former colonies, offering well-researched accounts of colonial events and their legacy. But he, too, has his blind spots, for example asking locals in his clipped upper-class accent whether they think British occupation was a good or bad thing. Surely it\u2019s more complicated than that.MovieDuring World War I, the royal family changed its name from \u201cSaxe-Coburg and Gotha\u201d to \u201cWindsor\u201d in an attempt to hide its German roots. By the time World War II came around, Edward VIII had already abdicated. But during the war, he and his wife, Wallace Simpson, had dinner with Nazi ministers, and Adolf Hitler was reportedly very impressed by the couple.This juicy tabloid-style documentary investigates those connections, building upon archival footage and interviews with historians and firsthand witnesses, complemented by some wonderfully cheesy reconstructions. We are told that Edward \u201cwinked awfully well\u201d and that Simpson was a \u201cgold digger.\u201d We also learn that the couple was passing some sort of information to the Germans through a Nazi foreign minister named Joachim von Ribbentrop. Was Edward aware of Hitler\u2019s plan to put him back on the throne as a puppet king once the Nazis conquered England? Who knows. But he certainly seems to have thought the Nazis had some good ideas."}
{"Headline": "Rachel Kushner\u2019s \u2018The Mars Room\u2019 Offers a Blackly Comic Take on Prison Life", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Now we have her much-anticipated third novel, \u201cThe Mars Room,\u201d and though it, too, has already been optioned, it couldn\u2019t be more different from \u201cThe Flamethrowers\u201d \u2014 or, for that matter, from Kushner\u2019s first book, \u201cTelex From Cuba,\u201d also an N.B.A. finalist. That was a historical novel about some American families living in Cuba in the mid-1950s, just before the Castro revolution. It was so earnest and evocative, so meticulously researched (with walk-on parts for Hemingway, both Castro brothers and Desi and Lucy), that it almost felt like a throwback. The one hint that the author might be up to something more original was a subplot involving an exotic dancer named Rachel K (no coincidence, surely), who turns out, like her novelist creator, to be both an illusionist and an observer who misses nothing.\u201cThe Mars Room\u201d is much smaller in scope than either of its predecessors, and seemingly more modest, with less swagger in the writing. It\u2019s a page turner all the same, and in some ways more affecting than the other books. It\u2019s a prison novel, of all things, set mostly in a place called the Stanville Women\u2019s Correctional Facility, in California\u2019s Central Valley, and except to readers who don\u2019t get Netflix, will immediately bring to mind the hit series \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d But Stanville is a much darker place than that show\u2019s minimum-security facility, and the novel is both more blackly comic and more knowing about prison life. You can learn from it how to communicate with another cell through the plumbing and how to brew pruno, or prison moonshine, or whip up a prison cheesecake using Sprite and nondairy creamer. Only the losers, the prisoners with no money, eat in the chow hall, it turns out; the rest dine in their cells on junk food and ramen noodles purchased from the commissary.The novel\u2019s main character is Romy Hall, a 29-year-old serving two life sentences, plus six years. I won\u2019t reveal what lands her in jail, except to say she\u2019s guilty but that there are extenuating circumstances ignored by her hapless, fumbling public defender. Romy is hardly an innocent, though. Growing up in the unfashionable Sunset District of San Francisco \u2014 described in great detail by Kushner: the fog, the clamminess, the beach bonfires, the sticky-floored Irish bars \u2014 she becomes an almost feral street kid, drinking, shoplifting, doing drugs and thinking about selling them, all before she\u2019s barely pubescent.Romy is bright enough but drifts through high school getting high, and afterward makes her living by giving lap dances at a strip bar called the Mars Room, a place so seedy, she says, that \u201cif you\u2019d showered you had a competitive edge\u201d and \u201cif your tattoos weren\u2019t misspelled you were hot property.\u201d Except for an art teacher she takes up with for a while, her taste in men runs to dirtbags, and with one of them, the doorman at another strip bar, she has a child, Jackson, who is 7 when the novel begins. He\u2019s a sweet, charming boy, and she loves him after her fashion, but is at best an indifferent mother. Jackson spends so much time fobbed off on a neighboring Hispanic family that he starts speaking Spanish. On what will prove to be her last Thanksgiving as a free woman, Romy parks him with a babysitter and spends the day with one of her Mars Room regulars.Part of Kushner\u2019s achievement here is that she makes this character, for all her shortcomings, so appealing. Romy\u2019s narration darts around in a voice that is tough, cynical, a little defensive at times, but ruthlessly honest and without a trace of self-pity. She has some of the bruised sweetness of Denis Johnson\u2019s alkies and junkies in \u201cJesus\u2019 Son.\u201d That Romy is white makes her something of an exception at Stanville. (White prisoners, she says sarcastically, tend to be either drunken drivers or baby killers, and in fact she has a baby-killer roommate, the aptly named Laura Lipp, who never shuts up.) Many of the others, some of whom she eventually bonds with in a kind of extended prison family, come from even worse circumstances: You feel that they were practically programmed to wind up in jail. But Kushner imparts to them, too, a redemptive gloss of dignity and individuality. Romy\u2019s best friends are Conan, a trash-talking trans man so masculine-seeming that he gets sent to a male prison for a while; and the gentle, philosophical Sammy, so at home in prison that she invariably manages to be sent back there. She thinks of her paroles not as departures but as vacations.Some of Stanville life we get to see through the eyes of a character named Gordon Hauser. Except for the Fudds, as Conan calls the guards, he\u2019s one of very few non-prisoners in the book, but in his own way he\u2019s almost as confined. He\u2019s a graduate-school dropout, who never finished a Ph.D. thesis on Thoreau, and after a stint as an adjunct at a community college settles into teaching G.E.D. classes in prison, because the money\u2019s better and it seems easier. Lonely and depressed, he commutes to Stanville from an isolated cabin in the Sierra foothills, where he spends way too much time studying the journals of Ted Kaczynski. Gordon is well-intentioned but morally a little obtuse \u2014 a stand-in for the reader, perhaps \u2014 and his gradual discovery of the mindlessness and injustice of prison life, especially on death row, is one of the book\u2019s plot levers. Kushner says of the lifers: \u201cAll of them were people who suffered and along the way of their suffering they made others suffer, and Gordon could not see that making them suffer lifelong would accrue to justice. It added new harm to old.\u201dThe other thing driving the plot is the death, about halfway through, of Romy\u2019s mother, who though herself a lousy parent, has been taking care of Jackson, who is now catapulted into \u201cthe system.\u201d Because she is no longer his guardian, legally speaking, Romy can find out nothing about him, and the more she is rebuffed by legalese and bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, the more she anguishes.\u201cThe Mars Room\u201d makes you share her frustration. It\u2019s one of those books that enrage you even as they break your heart, and in its passion for social justice you can finally discern a connection between all three of Kushner\u2019s novels. Both \u201cTelex From Cuba\u201d and \u201cThe Flamethrowers\u201d paid glancing attention to the downtrodden and the exploited: sugar-cane cutters in \u201cTelex,\u201d Brazilian rubber gatherers and Italian factory workers in \u201cFlamethrowers.\u201d In \u201cThe Mars Room\u201d the neglected become the focus, and it\u2019s apparent that Kushner\u2019s imagination, almost Dickensian in its amplitude, also embraces some of Dickens\u2019s reformist zeal. In its small way, \u201cThe Mars Room\u201d does for prison what \u201cHard Times\u201d and \u201cNicholas Nickleby\u201d did for 19th-century education.\u201cThe Flamethrowers\u201d was in love with speed and with anarchy, with moments \u2014 during a strike, an urban riot, a New York City blackout \u2014 when the rules are suspended and everything is up for grabs. \u201cThe Mars Room,\u201d on the other hand, chafes against the slowness and sameness of time and the oppressiveness of a system that in the name of \u201cjustice\u201d dooms our poorest citizens to lives of incarceration. It\u2019s not giving away too much to say that, like most good prison novels, this one ends with an escape. There are two, actually, one clearly based on Richard Matt and David Sweat\u2019s 2015 breakout in upstate New York. The other is a more bookish kind of escape, and culminates in a moment of transcendence achieved mostly by literary style and authorial sleight of hand. It\u2019s eloquent and moving, but to me, at least, it seems a little forced and wishful. The rest of Kushner\u2019s novel is so powerful and realistic you come away convinced that all such escapes are illusory, and that even for those who get out, prison is still a life sentence.Charles McGrath, a former editor of the Book Review, is working on an edition of Donald Barthelme\u2019s work for the Library of America.Advertisement"}

Roseanne Barr, the show\u2019s star, is asked about her vocal support of President Trump and her plan to reflect her political views on the revived sitcom.Her use of Twitter also comes up. Ms. Barr has been known to use the platform to spread conspiracy theories and post various insults. In 2013, she made a racist comment about Susan Rice, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, who is black. The tweet, which Ms. Barr deleted, called Ms. Rice \u201ca man\u201d and uses the word \u201cape\u201d to describe her \u2014 a word choice that would come back to haunt her again. In Pasadena, Ms. Barr says that her online comments will not be a distraction, because her children have locked her account, @therealRoseanne.

{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fauda,\u2019 an Israeli TV Hit, Lets Viewers Escape \u2014 Into the Conflict", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 No one in Israel\u2019s television industry was much interested when Avi Issacharoff and Lior Raz first pitched \u201cFauda,\u201d about a team of undercover operatives hunting Palestinian terrorists across the West Bank. And no wonder.Audiences here liked to escape \u2014 into talent shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cMaster Chef,\u201d where the competition is individual, not national; or reality shows like \u201cBig Brother,\u201d where the conflict is personal, not political; or fiction like \u201cLoaded,\u201d a dramedy about a high-tech start-up whose owners become overnight millionaires, playing to Israel\u2019s self-image as the next Silicon Valley.What explains its success here is a different kind of escapism: a chance for Israelis to visit places and engage with subjects that they ordinarily avoid \u2014 and then return home safely with the flip of a switch.Living in Israel means living with the conflict in a way that Americans may have a hard time understanding. Smartphones routinely buzz with text messages about the latest knife attack or vehicle-ramming. Apps tied into the civil defense system send people running to bomb shelters when incoming rockets threaten their communities.For many Israelis, the tall concrete wall cordoning off much of the West Bank provides a kind of needed mental barrier: They can tune out the conflict, and the Palestinians, if they choose. And many do.\u201cPeople want to have fun,\u201d Mr. Issacharoff said over breakfast near his home in Tel Aviv. \u201cPeople want to go to the beach, to eat in restaurants, to sit in coffee shops, to listen to good music.\u201dYet the work being done in their name by Israeli counterterrorism forces never ceases.In \u201cFauda,\u201d that work is shown as gritty, messy and morally complicated. Members of the undercover unit, career operatives in their late 30s and 40s, show tenderness toward their children and lovers at home, and then go off and commit torture and worse.\u201cIt\u2019s like we lift up the curtain to a place that nobody talks about,\u201d said Mr. Raz, who once served in Duvdevan, an elite commando force known for posing as Arabs, and plays the lead character, Doron Kavillio. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the mental price those people are paying for their actions. What the real job is.\u201dRules and laws are routinely broken; orders are flouted. What is unquestioned is the righteousness of the cause.By portraying Israeli violence and depicting some of the humiliation that Palestinians experience daily, its creators said, \u201cFauda\u201d allows viewers to peer across the barrier wall at some of the ugliest aspects of the occupation, then retreat to safety while consoling themselves that it\u2019s all just make-believe.\u201cWhen you see a group of Israelis executing someone, it\u2019s not an escape. But then you say, it\u2019s a TV show, so it is an escape,\u201d Mr. Issacharoff said. \u201cWhen you see a group of Israelis beating the crap out of an old man, it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s really terrible. But you can say, it\u2019s over there \u2014 it\u2019s fiction.\u201dSlightly different from an escape, but no less transporting, is how \u201cFauda\u201d can allow viewers here to momentarily remove themselves from the numbing zero-sum game of the conflict and its dueling narratives. Ordinarily, each side sees itself as victim, the other as perpetrator. Empathy is in short supply, as is interest in reviving a peace process that may have run its course after a quarter-century.But by creating textured characters on both sides \u2014 Israeli heroes who show themselves capable of the worst kinds of evil, Palestinian villains who show themselves capable of the best kinds of love \u2014 \u201cFauda\u201d may have pierced some of the calluses caused by so many years of friction.\u201cI\u2019m getting emails from Israelis who are saying for the first time in their life they feel empathy and compassion for the other side,\u201d Mr. Raz said. \u201cAnd the same from Gaza and Kuwait and Lebanon and Turkey.\u201d\u201cIt gave them the option to love the Hamas terrorist,\u201d Mr. Issacharoff said of viewers. \u201cIt allows women to think about the Hamas guy who becomes an ISIS guy as a sex symbol. But it\u2019s a show. I mean, a true terrorist cannot be a sex symbol.\u201dMr. Issacharoff and Mr. Raz concede that their show is an escape for Israelis, its intended audience, far more than for Palestinians. (Season 3 will be the first written with an international audience in mind.) Their writers\u2019 room, for example, includes no Palestinians.And the show has met with a great deal of Palestinian criticism.Some seized on the Israeli-accented Arabic of the undercover operatives sent to infiltrate West Bank villages and cities, calling it ludicrous to suggest that their true identities would not be discovered the moment they opened their mouths to speak.Mr. Issacharoff, a fluent Arabic speaker, pleaded guilty to this: Few of the Israeli actors spoke the language before joining \u201cFauda.\u201d One major character \u2014 a feared interrogator named Capt. Gabi Ayub \u2014 is played by Itzik Cohen, a Jewish comedic actor who made his name as a drag queen.But Mr. Issacharoff said the cast needed to meet only the threshold of realism for an Israeli audience, not of survival behind enemy lines. \u201cI\u2019m not going to send them to an undercover operation in Ramallah,\u201d he said.More substantively, Palestinian critics observe that \u201cFauda\u201d shrinks from fully conveying the oppressiveness of the Israeli occupation.The indignities Palestinians experience aren\u2019t entirely overlooked: The very first episode showed the confiscation of a Palestinian car at an Israeli checkpoint. But other pernicious aspects of the occupation \u2014 the demolitions of Palestinians\u2019 homes, the evictions of whole villages of Bedouins \u2014 have yet to make it on screen.Mr. Issacharoff said he didn\u2019t want to belabor the occupation \u2014 and suggested that \u201ceven for Palestinians, it\u2019s boring.\u201d\u201cAmong Palestinians it\u2019s kind of a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cA student\u2019s late for class, the teacher asks him why, and he says, \u2018The occupation.\u2019\u201dBut Sayed Kashua, an Israeli-Arab humorist who wrote the acclaimed 2007 series \u201cAvoda Aravit,\u201d or \u201cArab Labor,\u201d said he found nothing funny about \u201cFauda,\u201d and complained that marketing the show as telling the story of the conflict from both sides was misleading.\u201cIf an Israeli creator feels he needs to humanize Palestinians, it means that he begins with the idea that they\u2019re not human,\u201d Mr. Kashua, now a professor at the University of Illinois, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd making them cry or fall in love is not humanizing. That\u2019s an exotic way to portray Palestinians. You cannot humanize a murderer by showing him crying when he hugs his mother.\u201dHe also argued that \u201cFauda\u201d too easily jibes with a widespread Israeli belief that there is no partner for peace on the Palestinian side, and even the most ardent Palestinian militants are motivated by personal revenge, rather than by political beliefs or national aspirations. \u201cIt\u2019s a given,\u201d he said. \u201cLike it\u2019s from God. There are murderers; there\u2019s an always ongoing struggle. But it\u2019s not true. There are reasons for that situation, and there are good people who are trying to solve it. And if you\u2019re not pointing to the historic or political reasons, then you\u2019re not talking about a possible solution.\u201dStill, Mr. Kashua allowed that that might be a bit much to expect from a commercial drama.While Mr. Issacharoff said he was content, for now, merely to open a few hearts and minds, he and Mr. Raz made no bones about their own biases. Asked about a villainous character who blows up one of his friends \u2014 a plot point many Palestinians objected to \u2014 Mr. Issacharoff observed that years ago, when suicide bombings were more frequent, terrorist commanders had exploited emotionally weak people to carry them out, rather than volunteering themselves or their own children.\u201cI\u2019m an Israeli, I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m a Zionist,\u201d he said. \u201cI have the Israeli narrative. I cannot understand, still, after 18 years in the field, these suicide attacks. So if someone is sending his guy to do one, yes, he doesn\u2019t care about him, and he\u2019s a terrible human being.\u201cAnd you know what else I\u2019m sure about?\u201d he added. \u201cThat the majority of the Palestinians, deep in their heart \u2014 they know that.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified an actor, based on information provided by Netflix. She is La\u00ebtitia E\u00efdo as Dr. Shirin El-Abed, not Rona-Lee Shim\u2019on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Can\u2019t Stop Fainting. Is His Heart the Cause?", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.The 20-year-old man awoke to the bright April sunlight and the strange feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was a sensation he had come to know well over the last few months and one that signaled the start of one of these episodes that now dominated his life. He shook his girlfriend awake. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d Matt pleaded. By now, she knew what he meant and immediately began chatting about a hike they\u2019d taken last fall with his new puppy and some friends. Should we go back today? It\u2019s supposed to be a beautiful day. She watched him anxiously as she spoke. His face was pale, and the dark circles under his eyes looked even darker than usual. After a minute or so, Matt took a deep breath and shook his head as if the movement itself could clear his mind.I\u2019m O.K., he said at last. Just a little nauseous. Sweat gleamed on his face.\u2193Matt had been having spells like these for over a year. The first time it happened, he was on the floor playing tug-of-war with his puppy. He had the same creepy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling, the same cold sweat, the same nausea. He didn\u2019t feel himself lose consciousness, but suddenly the puppy and the rope were gone. He looked up and saw the pup gnawing on the rope in a different room.He found his mother and was telling her what happened when suddenly he slid to the floor, unconscious. His arms and legs jerked a few times, and then he was still. He opened his eyes after maybe 30 seconds, but he couldn\u2019t get up or even try to speak for another several minutes. Terrified, his mother drove him to Frederick Memorial Hospital, in Frederick, Md., the next town over. During the ride, Matt fainted again.She pulled the car up to the Emergency Department and ran in to get help. He had just been hooked up to the IV and the heart monitors when the young man passed out once more. This time what was happening was visible on the cardiac monitor: His heart was beating at a regular rate when, suddenly, it slowed and then stopped. The line on the monitor went flat. After a few seconds there was a beat and another brief pause, and then his heart started beating again as if nothing had happened. A temporary pacemaker was placed, and he was admitted to the intensive care unit.The next morning Matt was seen by a cardiologist who specializes in the heart\u2019s electrical system \u2014 the nerves and connections that run the rate and rhythm of the heart as it beats. He got the whole story from Matt and his mother. The young man had never fainted before. And, before this, had no medical problems at all. No one in his family had heart problems or fainted regularly. No one had died suddenly for unknown reasons \u2014 which might suggest a hidden and potentially inheritable heart problem. He didn\u2019t drink or smoke, did occasionally use marijuana \u2014 though none lately \u2014 and worked out frequently.The cardiologist examined the young man carefully. He appeared healthy, and his heart exam \u2014 indeed, his entire exam \u2014 was completely normal. An EKG done the night before, after his loss of consciousness, was also normal. An echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the beating heart, showed that Matt\u2019s heart was moving normally. The specialist reviewed the strip recorded during his fainting spell and saw how the heart had paused for several seconds before resuming its usual rhythm. Matt was monitored constantly over the next several days. There were no pauses or other abnormalities seen.\u2193Fainting, or what is known medically as syncope, is a transient loss of consciousness caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, usually from a heart that isn\u2019t beating well enough to get the blood where it needs to go. Although the heart is involved in syncope, the problem doesn\u2019t usually originate there. The usual trigger is the nervous system. Vasovagal syncope (VVS), the most common form of nerve-induced fainting, occurs when the heart gets an unneeded signal to slow down. The vagus nerve is designed to slow down the heart when it is beating rapidly because of fear, exertion or sex \u2014 but if triggered when the heart isn\u2019t racing, the patient can faint when the vagus causes the heart to slow.It\u2019s not always necessary to identify the precise cause of syncope, but it is essential to make sure that it is not caused by the heart. So-called cardiac syncope accounts for only about 20 percent of all fainting spells. But because this kind of syncope can indicate heart disease, it\u2019s important to separate patients with cardiac causes from those other reasons for fainting. Research has shown that those who have cardiac syncope have a higher risk of death, presumably from the underlying heart problem.About half of the time the patient\u2019s own story will provide the most important clues to the cause of a syncopal event. The biggest clues include the patient\u2019s age and gender and if there is a history of heart disease. The patient\u2019s recollection of what happened just before the loss of consciousness is also crucial. The classic story for cardiac syncope is a middle-aged man who suddenly finds himself on the ground with no preceding symptoms and no awareness of the fall. An EKG may reveal a heart attack or arrhythmia, but often does not.Vasovagal syncope usually has a very different story. Patients with this type of syncope are frequently young and describe feeling lightheaded or \u201cfaint\u201d before losing consciousness. This sensation is often associated with breaking out in a cold sweat and nausea followed by a sense of narrowing vision \u2014 as if entering a tunnel. Upon awakening, patients will often describe a profound fatigue. And this type of syncope often follows some unpleasant stimulus \u2014 typically fear, or heat, pain or stress.This young man had elements of a classic story of vasovagal syncope: Each instance was preceded by a feeling of faintness, nausea and a cold sweat. And when Matt woke up, he often felt very tired. But there were abnormal qualities to it as well. Most of the time, VVS occurs only once. A quarter of those who have this kind of fainting event will eventually have a second or even a third fainting spell. Having so many episodes one right after another, however, was unusual. Another oddity was that they often happened while Matt was lying down. Usually VVS occurs when the subject is upright. VVS is also frequently associated with some unpleasant experience. Not so in this young man\u2019s case. And finally, the patient\u2019s sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and the brief hallucinations he had sometimes before the events sounded more like a seizure than syncope. On the other hand, the strip obtained from the cardiac monitor while the patient was in the ED strongly suggested a neurally mediated, classic vasovagal faint with a sudden slowing of the heart.Because the young man\u2019s story didn\u2019t fit the classic picture of VVS, the doctors caring for him in the hospital wanted to make certain his heart was not involved. He was tested for the common causes of cardiac syncope \u2014 Lyme disease and thyroid disease. He didn\u2019t have Lyme disease, and his thyroid test, while not completely normal, was unlikely to have caused him to faint. After watching him on a cardiac monitor for four days, his doctors thought he was safe to send home. Still, because his story was a little atypical, a loop monitor was implanted in his chest. This monitor would record any abnormal heart rhythms.After leaving the hospital, the patient\u2019s primary care doctor referred him to a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins in nearby Baltimore. After reviewing the young man\u2019s hospital records and listening to his story, the specialist massaged Matt\u2019s neck just below the ear on each side, where the carotid arteries lie. These vessels, which carry blood from the heart to the brain, have receptors that help regulate how fast the heart beats. Some people have a strong response to even mild stimulation of the carotid, causing the heart to slow down. Matt\u2019s reactions, however, were normal. He also had the young man increase his intra-abdominal pressure by pushing the way you might push to have a bowel movement. This can stimulate the vagus nerve and send signals to the heart to slow down and is thought to be one of the reasons some people can faint after urinating or moving their bowels. Matt\u2019s heart slowed down a bit \u2014 as was normal. Neither seemed likely to cause syncope. The cardiologist ordered an MRI of the heart to look for diseases that can interfere with a normal heart rate by infiltrating the muscle and interfering with the heart\u2019s electrical system. The images were normal.For the next six months, the monitor implanted in Matt\u2019s chest didn\u2019t show any unusual activity. He had no more sensations of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and no more fainting. Finally, patient and doctor agreed that the monitor could come out. They didn\u2019t have a firm answer about what had happened, but it seemed to have resolved itself.\u2193Two weeks after the monitor was removed, Matt was getting ready to take a shower when he suddenly had that strange feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu again. He was headed toward his bedroom to lie down when he suddenly blacked out, hitting his nose on the sink. He woke up in a pool of blood with a cut on the bridge of his nose. He was taken back to Frederick Memorial Hospital. Once again, he was hooked up to the cardiac monitor. And remarkably, once again his heart stopped, this time for nine seconds. Then there was a beat, followed by another long pause. A code was called and a defibrillator rushed to his bedside, but his heart restarted itself before a shock was needed. A temporary pacemaker was again placed and the cardiologist who saw him the first time consulted. A second Lyme test was done, as well as a second set of thyroid tests. This time both were unremarkable.\u2193It has been more than a year, and the patient has continued to have episodes of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, accompanied by cold sweat and lightheadedness, once or twice a week. Most of the time he can somehow keep himself from passing out. The near-syncopal event he had in April, while with his girlfriend, resolved with rest alone. Having someone talk to him, he feels, sometimes short-circuits whatever is happening in his brain and keeps him from losing consciousness.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.Still, the episodes where he loses consciousness have persisted. A few weeks ago he was at work and tried lifting something heavy. Suddenly he was once again overcome with a sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was followed by the nausea and cold sweats he has come to know so well. Seconds later, he found himself on the ground. He has had to take time off from work. His employer was concerned about why his apparently healthy employee had suddenly passed out, and he isn\u2019t sure Matt should come back until he has some answers.What do you think is going on here? Do you recognize this condition? Is this vasovagal syncope, or is there something else going on? What should Matt and his doctor look at next?Enter your comments below, and briefly describe your thinking; how a diagnosis is made is often as revealing as the diagnosis itself. All answers will be reviewed, and the most promising diagnoses will be shared with the patient and his primary-care physician.I\u2019ll post an update in the coming days.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Illustration by Andreas Samuelsson.

{"Headline": "\u2018Dietland\u2019 is Violent, Disruptive and Surreal. And Funny.", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs it begins, a fat woman struggles up a mountain molded from desserts and fairground rides. She shrinks as she climbs, shedding her shapeless black wrap for a skintight scarlet number. She\u2019s skeletal when she crests. Then she dies.But don\u2019t get too depressed. \u201cThe logo is a carnival,\u201d Ms. Noxon said during a shoot in Queens last winter. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun house! It\u2019s not a sad house!\u201dPlum thinks that her life will start as soon as she loses weight. When she\u2019s enmeshed in a shadowy feminist conspiracy (likely involving a terrorist cell that goes by the name of Jennifer), it starts anyway. Turns out it\u2019s the patriarchy Plum has to lose, not the pounds.\u201cThe show just feels like it visits a lot of different territories,\u201d Ms. Noxon said during an on-set dinner she didn\u2019t have time to finish. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to eat some food.\u201d (She was pulled away a few minutes later. She wrapped the plate to go.)Ms. Noxon, 53, who radiates the focused cheer of a pep squad captain, has rarely met a genre she couldn\u2019t handle. In her decades in television, she has worked in most of them, with a particular interest in the roles women choose and the ones chosen for them.Ms. Noxon discovered the \u201cDietland\u201d novel while scrolling through Audible. The cover showed a cupcake fitted with a grenade pull. She thought it would be a \u201cchick lit novel, sort of an easy read.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not,\u201d she said.Only \u201cTo the Bone\u201d is explicitly autobiographical \u2014 and then it\u2019s only semi-autobiographical, with several invented characters and scenes \u2014 but all of these projects are deeply personal. They explore and explode a fantasy that Ms. Noxon has lived with all her life, the belief that if she were only a little taller, a little prettier, then she would be loved, cherished, safe.\u201cDietland\u201d argues that if women really want love and safety, it\u2019s the world they\u2019ll need to change, not their bodies. That\u2019s a big ask, but Ms. Noxon\u2019s attitude is exuberant and encouraging rather than scolding. She\u2019s \u201ca feminist with a boob job,\u201d she said. She\u2019s not inclined to scold.\u201cTo the Bone,\u201d about a woman dealing with an eating disorder (and starring Keanu Reeves and Lily Collins), is part of what Ms. Noxon calls her \u201cself-harm trilogy.For all Ms. Noxon\u2019s cheerleading, \u201cDietland\u201d approaches female anger and violence in raw and sometimes startling ways. Women\u2019s marches are one thing; armed revolt is another. There\u2019s plenty of comedy here, some of it cute (there\u2019s a sign on the \u201cDaisy Chain\u201d fridge: \u201cDO NOT Take Kitty\u2019s Almond Water\u201d), some cringe-inducing, some savage. But though terrorism and its accessories are new to Ms. Noxon (when asked the type of weapons Jennifer uses, she said, \u201cLong ones?\u201d), the Jennifer sequences aren\u2019t played for laughs. It\u2019s hard to say, \u201cYou go, girl,\u201d when girls are hurling bodies from freeway overpasses.Ms. Margulies\u2019s Kitty is both an oppressor and a victim. She\u2019s not a Jennifer recruit, but she\u2019s angry, too, which Ms. Margulies finds \u201cvery refreshing.\u201d Speaking between scenes, Ms. Margulies, 51, said, \u201cA show like this is very freeing for those of us who feel like we\u2019ve had to somehow stay quiet \u2014 so we don\u2019t rock the boat or stir the mud or you know, get up in anyone\u2019s grill or make a problem.\u201dMs. Nash\u2019s body is one of those problems and that\u2019s the way she likes it. \u201cDietland\u201d is not the first show to center on a fat actress (fat is Ms. Nash\u2019s preferred term, too). There\u2019s \u201cFat Actress\u201d itself, \u201cDrop Dead Diva,\u201d \u201cMike & Molly,\u201d \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and \u201cRoseanne\u201d then and now. But \u201cDietland\u201d uses Ms. Nash\u2019s body as a provocation and not as a punch line or punching bag. Revealing costumes ask audiences to confront their discomfort with women who aren\u2019t straight size.\u201cI feel like it\u2019ll make people squirm and that gets my blood pumping,\u201d said Ms. Nash, 37, who added that she has never dieted. \u201cI love it. I want you to be so uncomfortable. Like if I can ruin your day by making you look at me, I\u2019m going to make you look at me.\u201d She added an intensifying expletive. She doesn\u2019t know where Plum\u2019s story will take her, but she wants for the character what she wants for herself, what any person of any size deserves: \u201ca full life.\u201dMs. Noxon doesn\u2019t know where Plum will wind up either. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve any of these things, by the way,\u201d she said over that abbreviated dinner. \u201cNothing gets solved.\u201d But she wants everyone to enjoy the curves, the twists, the free-fall thrills along the way.But her jokes, her enthusiasm, her insta-best-friend candor, it all suggests she\u2019s enjoying those curves and twists and free-fall thrills along the way.\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to see the rest,\u201d she said a few weeks later when filming had finished. \u201cBecause it really is demented.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was too early for drinks. Rather, she was writing about her trip through Chile\u2019s Route of Parks in Patagonia, a previous stop.Here are highlights of our conversation, edited and condensed:How do you pack for a year on the road?Let\u2019s say that I packed a lot of stuff that I now would not pack. At the beginning I sent home maybe 13 pounds of stuff and then I sent home more stuff and it\u2019s down to a pretty bare minimum of things. So basically I excised anything cute out of my wardrobe, which was really painful. And then I went back to New York and I bought a few cute things. It\u2019s really hard to live without color.I guess you don\u2019t pack a tiny Swiss Army knife which got confiscated on my way here at the La Guardia Airport, which had made it through three months of travel. That was interesting because I have not known LaGuardia to be particularly vigilant.As a woman, do you have specific concerns about traveling alone?It\u2019s a fine balance during this experience of going around the world to keep watch of my own safety but also be open to new experiences. Generally what helps is that most of the people I meet up with are women or, I think, are sympathetic groups. But it doesn\u2019t help much for the love life.Do you try to act like a local?I\u2019m walking around with a sporty backpack and a camera around my neck. I don\u2019t look super in with the in-crowd.But I want to find things that aren\u2019t in the guidebooks, that aren\u2019t typical tourist hangouts even though sometimes those are fun. In Colombia, in Bogot\u00e1, I went to the most over-the-top restaurant that I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Even if it\u2019s a tourist trap it\u2019s a great tourist trap. So go to those things.I do find that when I get in trouble safety-wise, it\u2019s always because I\u2019m trying too hard to be a local.There\u2019s just sort of a wariness that you have to have as a tourist that I think is important to keep.How much did you know about Saskatoon?Zero. But when I got this job the most congratulations came from Saskatoon. You guys went on my radar immediately. When things were kind of tough in some places I just kept thinking: Well, Saskatoon likes me.Has the trip ever been lonely?Sometimes I can lean on having social media as a crutch. So if I do get lonely I will log on to Instagram and reply to people, and things like that. The first time that I felt actually lonely was when I was driving around a beautiful rain-forest park in Chile and I had no cell signal. There were a few moments when I was climbing the volcano by myself and thinking no one knows where I am and they can\u2019t even locate me by GPS.A friend who was supposed to come and meet me couldn\u2019t come at the last minute. So not being able to share this beautiful thing that I was seeing with anyone really felt lonely in the moment. Where do you suggest that your friends visit? (From an audience member):Chile is a pretty great starter South American country. There\u2019s a low likelihood of getting sick and the landscape is really beautiful. La Paz, Bolivia, is one of the most unique places I\u2019ve ever been. It has this great Indigenous culture, it\u2019s actually a majority Indigenous country. You can get to this unbelievable landscape of the salt flats from there which is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.This month\u2019s picks for Netflix viewers in Canada from Watching, The Times\u2019s viewing guide, include Gary Oldman\u2019s performance in \u201cBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u201d and, as legal recreational marijuana use nears in Canada, \u201cHow High,\u201d a stoner comedy.Advertisement"}

They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank\u2019s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis.The nation\u2019s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests \u201cperiodically.\u201d These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks\u2019 risk management. If the Fed requires these company tests less frequently, regulators may end up with less insight into how the most systemically important banks are preparing for shocks.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2014 Michael de la MercedCritics\u2019 corner\u201cIf you\u2019ve already confronted so many dysfunctions, there has to be clearly a problem,\u201d Mr. Verhofstadt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the banks.\u201dHe also asked whether Facebook could compensate European users for the way their data is being used, asking: \u201cWhat will be the amount that you give them?\u201dThe new flaw will lead to the same problem: Intel says that users could see a 2 percent to 8 percent decrease in performance when updates are installed.Yet both firms still face challenges.AMD has enjoyed recent success from some of its chips being used to mine cryptocurrency, but more specialized processors from other manufacturers are becoming popular in the Bitcoin community. And Intel still needs to ensure that it cements itself as a major player in A.I. chips, which is becoming harder as companies like Tesla, Apple, Google and Facebook design their own.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeTo those on Wall Street and other executives who make a living negotiating, the deal struck by the president who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d doesn\u2019t look too artful. Not only that, the deal \u2014 to the extent there is one \u2014 raises all sorts of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to extract concessions in future negotiations.\u201cThis was not a quid-pro-quo or anything else.

{"Headline": "Mom-Coms Latch On to the Raw Reality of New Motherhood", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago, I was watching a new show, me and the laptop scrunched into the corner of the sofa. It was late at night and everyone else had gone to sleep, when rounding the second episode, my sympathetic nervous system started working unpaid overtime: short breath, tensed muscles, pounding heart, the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal shebang.Cortisol or no, I binged all seven episodes \u2014 twice \u2014 and lived to tell. But for some new and newish mothers, \u201cThe Letdown\u201d may feel so achingly familiar that it\u2019s just about unwatchable. Speaking of aches, the title refers to the reflex that sends milk flowing through the breast, a reflex sometimes accompanied by knifelike pains. All the joys.Mothers aren\u2019t exactly TV noobs. (I\u2019ve seen \u201cI Love Lucy,\u201d too.) But for a long time, TV seemed to think that having a baby was the kind of story arc that could be handled in an episode. That helpless, screaming, wetting, nipple-abrading bundle of joy wouldn\u2019t really change the woman who birthed it. And if it did, it would change her in some sunshiny, uplifting fashion that didn\u2019t interfere with a return to full hair and makeup by the time the credits rolled.Offscreen, many women may find that new motherhood alters them in a deeper and less camera-ready ways. It can take a sledgehammer to ego boundaries, making you wonder who you were before you had a baby and who you are now and where did all those new moles come from.That\u2019s like life, too. At least it\u2019s like Alison Bell\u2019s life. Ms. Bell, the co-creator of \u201cThe Letdown\u201d who stars as Audrey, became pregnant while she was making the pilot. Her son is now 4 and he still doesn\u2019t sleep through the night. \u201cWe were conscious of making things ongoing concerns, ongoing challenges,\u201d she said.Sarah Scheller, the other co-creator, based the show on her experiences in a support group for new mothers. She\u2019d been conditioned to think of her own stories and the stories of other new parents as mundane, as niche, but she knew that they weren\u2019t.\u201cIt\u2019s such a steep learning curve when you become a mother,\u201d Ms. Bell added. \u201cThe people who suggest that it\u2019s a boring time of your life, that is just bizarre.\u201dShe also had fond memories of sleep training: \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there thinking you\u2019re ruining your child\u2019s life, thinking this is the damage that\u2019s gonna make them a drug addict when they\u2019re 18.\u201dShe always knew that the relationship between her character, Bridgette, and Bridgette\u2019s son, Larry, would drive the show. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the child to be a prop,\u201d Ms. Shaw said. \u201cWhen you are a mother to a young child \u2014 a single mother, a married mother \u2014 you\u2019re constantly preoccupied with your child.\u201d She\u2019s given her own son a small role so that they can hang out together on set, though she (wisely) hasn\u2019t let him see any of the episodes.Julia\u2019s a battler. She\u2019s just not a very good battler. She bungles a children\u2019s party, she falls into a swimming pool, she botches a school auction, trying and mostly failing to wrest a stable identity and some crumbs of leisure time from the work-life imbalance.This extreme focus on the self can make \u201cMotherland\u201d seem solipsistic. But if male characters have been allowed to gaze at their navels for decades, maybe women deserve a turn. (It\u2019s the least they deserve. Have you seen what pregnancy does to the lower stomach?)In these new shows, most of the story lines have been drawn directly from the creators\u2019 own lives and the lives of their friends. \u201cTheir stories are not safe with us and they know that now,\u201d said Ms. Scheller of \u201cThe Letdown.\u201dAnd yet everyone I spoke to emphasized that these shows weren\u2019t intended only for mothers. Certainly \u201cSMILF,\u201d with its casual nudity and premium-cable raunch, seems to reach past the stroller set, while other shows may gratify the child-free. A few close-ups of a wailing baby and Siri and Alexa will be busy searching tubal ligation.Both \u201cMotherland\u201d and \u201cThe Letdown\u201d stick a dad amid the mom\u2019s groups, an equal-opportunity, tent-widening gesture. The main dads \u2014 Audrey\u2019s husband, Julia\u2019s estranged husband, Frankie\u2019s former partner \u2014 are well-meaning, but more or less checked out and not always especially competent. \u201cAlthough men are changing and the dynamics are changing, it\u2019s still not even. That\u2019s what we learned ourselves, that\u2019s what we found through research,\u201d Ms. Bell said. Because my husband reads this paper \u2014 hi, babe, I think we\u2019re out of diapers \u2014 I cannot possibly comment on whether or not I find this relatable.Still there\u2019s one essential story these shows are helpfully debunking, the one about new mothers having it all. Yes, you can have it all, assuming your all doesn\u2019t include sanity, ease, a coherent sense of self, an untrammeled pelvic floor. That part feels familiar, too, mostly because I live in a country without paid maternity leave or high-quality sliding-scale child care, which means I went back to work at five weeks and have blown off R.E.M. sleep since and I\u2019m writing this while the almost-two-year-old is watching \u201cDaniel Tiger\u201d against the explicit recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics.The mothers in these shows, like most of the mothers I know, are slap-fighting with a pretty much unanswerable question. Here it is in Ms. Shaw\u2019s words: \u201cHow do you strike that balance of needing to live your life and also honoring the fact that you have this little being you\u2019re fully responsible for?\u201dMaybe that\u2019s why I keep watching. I\u2019m hoping some show will figure it out for me. I\u2019m pretty sure it involves an au pair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Racist Tweet, Roseanne Barr\u2019s Show Is Canceled by ABC", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo months ago, Roseanne Barr was a star again.But on Tuesday, that all came crashing down. ABC abruptly canceled \u201cRoseanne\u201d hours after Ms. Barr, the show\u2019s star and co-creator, posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman who was a senior adviser to Barack Obama throughout his presidency and considered one of his most influential aides. Ms. Barr wrote if the \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\u201dMs. Barr later apologized, but it was too late. In announcing the show\u2019s cancellation, ABC\u2019s entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said in a statement that \u201cRoseanne\u2019s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\u201dREAD MOREThe show brought in an estimated $45 million of advertising revenue for ABC this year, and the network likely would have collected more than $60 million next season, according to Kantar Media.On a phone call with ABC and her representatives shortly before the show was canceled, Ms. Barr expressed remorse for the tweet but did not seem to be fully aware of the potential implications for her sitcom, according to a person familiar with the phone call who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was private.If Disney did not act forcefully with regard to \u201cRoseanne,\u201d much of that work might have been rendered moot.Ms. Jarrett, who appeared at an MSNBC town hall about racism in America on Tuesday, said of Ms. Barr\u2019s tweet, \u201cWe have to turn it into a teaching moment.\u201d\u201cBob Iger, who\u2019s the C.E.O. of Disney, called me before the announcement,\u201d she added. \u201cHe apologized. He said that he had zero tolerance for that sort of racist, bigoted comment, and he wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show.\u201dIt did not take long for ABC to move on. A repeat episode scheduled for Tuesday night was promptly replaced with a rerun of \u201cThe Middle.\u201d The network also began the process of taking each episode of \u201cRoseanne\u201d off its website, and Hulu, which is partly owned by Disney, is also removing episodes from its service.The timing of Ms. Barr\u2019s outburst was terrible for ABC. She wrote the message just two weeks after it and the other broadcast networks made their pitches to advertisers about their coming fall lineups, with the hope of attracting up to $9 billion in advertising commitments by summer\u2019s end.Earlier, Ms. Barr had an exchange with Chelsea Clinton after Ms. Barr erroneously referred to Ms. Clinton as \u201cChelsea Soros Clinton,\u201d a reference to George Soros, the billionaire liberal donor who is often the focus of conservative critics. Donald Trump Jr. shared one of Ms. Barr\u2019s posts in the exchange.She later deleted the post about Ms. Jarrett. About a half-hour later, she offered an apology.\u201cI apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me - my joke was in bad taste.\u201dMs. Barr also said she was \u201cleaving Twitter\u201d \u2014 but hours later, she was back, retweeting statements of support and links to conservative websites.\u201cIt was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting,\u201d Ms. Barr later wrote, referring to a sleep aid that can cause changes in mood and behavior, \u201cIt was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible.

{"Headline": "What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.\u00a0Mr. Wu is a law professor who who specializes in antitrust.Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.Microsoft, the world\u2019s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft\u2019s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.Yet it is worth remembering that at the time, challenging Microsoft was not a popular decision. Microsoft was a well-liked company and Mr. Gates was widely heralded as a visionary genius. Many, Microsoft most of all, argued that enforcing the antitrust laws against Microsoft would damage innovation and impede the economic growth fueled by the technology sector.This view turned out to be wrong. Innovation surged in the newly opened markets and the United States continued to spearhead growth in the technological world. The enduring lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trustbuster\u2019s courage to take decisive action against even a very popular monopolist.Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business. Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web. Google, the tiny start-up, would have faced an unfair fight against Bing. Microsoft-Myspace might have become the default social network instead of Facebook. And who knows whether Netflix or any other online video service would have been started?It took the power of law enforcement to rebut Microsoft\u2019s claims that everything it was doing was pro-competitive, innovative and innocent. The discovery of candid internal company memos, a famously revealing deposition of Bill Gates and a full trial made it clear that Microsoft saw the internet as a major threat to its monopoly rule and was seeking to tame it.The presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was right to propose that Microsoft be broken into two companies \u2014 one for the Windows operating system, one for other products. In the end, unfortunately, Microsoft was kept whole.Some limitations were placed on Microsoft\u2019s behavior, such as a requirement that it share certain programming information with third-party companies. The appropriateness of that remedy is still debated. But what we do know is that the remedy pushed Microsoft to act with more caution, creating an essential opening for a new generation of firms.It might seem like a cruel irony that the immediate beneficiaries of the Microsoft antitrust case \u2014 namely, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 have now become behemoths themselves. But this is how the innovation cycle works: It creates room for saplings to grow into giants, but then prevents the new giants from squashing the next generation of saplings. (Microsoft was itself, in the early 1980s, the beneficiary of another antitrust case, against IBM, the computing colossus of its time.)Which takes us to the present day. Unfortunately, ever since the Microsoft case there has been remarkably little oversight of the technology sector, despite the obvious signs of corporate consolidation and outsize market power. Enforcement of the antimonopoly laws has fallen: Between 1970 and 1999, the United States brought about 15 monopoly cases each year; between 2000 and 2014 that number went down to just three.Antitrust efforts have become too fixated on the idea that the only real harm consists of raising of prices for consumers. Yet in the Microsoft case, Internet Explorer was \u201cfree,\u201d even though Microsoft was bent on destroying competition with it. Today, both Google and Facebook offer products that are free. Society has grown to rely on them, but because they have no dollar price, antitrust regulators have been hesitant to take action.Any American can tell you that there is no free lunch. Everything has a price. We pay for these products and services with our time and our data. And like Microsoft, these firms have come to exert too much control over our shared technological future.At a hearing before the Senate, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was asked to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor \u2014 a company providing a similar service that consumers can go to if they are unhappy with Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg could not name one. Part of the reason for this is that Facebook bought its most obvious competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to acquire upstart companies before they can reach that point.The pattern is familiar. And if the Microsoft case showed us anything, it is that we should not trust any one company to decide our future.Richard Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

Disney\u2019s market capitalization is currently a little more than $151 billion, while Comcast has a market capitalization of roughly $145 billion.Netflix\u2019s move above Disney and Comcast serves as a symbolic moment. Netflix and its Silicon Valley brethren have upended the media industry and spurred a rush of consolidation. Disney and Comcast are fighting over the assets of 21st Century Fox, while AT&T is trying to acquire Time Warner.Netflix\u2019s ascendance also caps a remarkable run for the company. A decade ago, Netflix was valued at $2 billion and less than $15 billion five years ago.

Ether fell to $566.Regulation of cryptocurrencies is still relatively weak, at least in the U.S. So far, the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have focused on initial coin offerings, the sale of digital tokens as a means of raising money.According to Bloomberg, the Justice Department is working with the C.F.T.C., which can\u2019t directly regulate the trading of cryptocurrency tokens because they\u2019re not futures.

With the new cash, Mr. Elkiner said, his company now hopes to work on even bigger projects. One of them: making it easier for customers to sign up for a Visa-branded credit card within minutes when they\u2019re buying something online, then completing that transaction using a virtual version of the card, without having to wait for a physical one.The ultimate goal, according to Mr. Salazar, is simple. \u201cThe largest opportunity in the industry is in displacing cash,\u201d he said.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThere\u2019s an opening for Comcast.

Despite, or maybe because of, the grisly subject matter, Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff talk freely about their personal lives, like friends at Sunday brunch.Ms. Hardstark has been frank about her anxiety and depression, and Ms. Kilgariff has talked about her mother\u2019s death from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They frequently mention that they see a joint therapist (in addition to attending one-on-one sessions).\u201cWe\u2019re both from California rural families where talking about mental health was second nature and not something to be ashamed of,\u201d Ms. Hardstark said. \u201cIn the same way people don\u2019t talk about murders a whole lot, people don\u2019t talk about how hard the struggle is to live a happy life.\u201dFittingly, both women offer psychoanalytic explanations for their lifelong fascination with the macabre. Growing up in Irvine, Calif., in the 1980s, Ms. Hardstark said she was struck by how the women Ted Bundy kidnapped looked like her mother.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Arrested Development\u2019 Chases Its Past, Slowly", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the story of a classic sitcom that lost its mojo, and the audience that had no choice but to keep coming back to see if it had gotten its act together again.It\u2019s \u201cArrested Development,\u201d and I can report that the fifth season \u2014 whose first eight episodes arrive on Netflix on Tuesday \u2014 eventually re-approaches the manic pleasures of the show\u2019s heyday. Unfortunately, it takes its time getting to that point, and it doesn\u2019t stay long.The original series, which ran from 2003 to 2006 on Fox, was a comedy miracle, capturing the oblivious entitlement of the wealthy Bluth family with elaborate farce plots and enough inspired coinages to fill a vault.Netflix resurrected it in 2013. But because the cast members could only commit to brief shooting schedules \u2014 and because no one was quite sure what this newfangled \u201cstreaming TV\u201d stuff would look like \u2014 the creator, Mitchell Hurwitz, devised an origami-folded fourth season, with a hopscotching timeline and episodes built around individual characters.Cut to 2018, when Netflix is spending lavishly and we\u2019ve since learned that the definition of streaming TV is \u201cTV, but more of it.\u201d This time, Mr. Hurwitz has his full cast at his disposal, which is an instant improvement, restoring the show\u2019s old rhythms and dynamics.But first it has a lot of business to take care of. The opening half-hour isn\u2019t so much an episode as a reference manual, a massive plot download beginning with a five-minute Ron Howard recap. The action accelerates as slowly as a stair car, accreting new subplots like hop-ons.Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is running for Congress on a platform of building a wall at the Mexican border. (The series doubles down on this Nostradamian pre-Trump story line from 2013 by employing some flexible chronology, setting the new season in 2015.) Tobias (David Cross) is sporting a dyed-pink mustache. Michael (Jason Bateman) is entangled in an investigation into the disappearance of family friend Lucille Austero (Liza Minnelli). Various family members are fleeing their demons, or one another, in Mexico.At best, \u201cArrested Development\u201d is a clockwork of meshing narrative gears, misunderstandings and compounding fibs. But this kind of story can substitute complication for cleverness. Although Season 5 ditches the puzzle structure, it\u2019s still built more as a single long narrative (a streaming-TV tic) rather than tightly plotted episodes.Things pick up a few episodes in, as the show connects with its heart \u2014 that the Bluths can only express love in warped ways \u2014 and its engine \u2014 that the one thing you can rely on them to do is lie to one another.And the cast\u2019s talent is in full flower. You don\u2019t need wild story machinations to enjoy Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter) lobbing 80-proof Molotov cocktails of sarcasm, or Gob (Will Arnett) spiraling into self-loathing, or Buster (Tony Hale) being fitted with yet more artificial hands.Alia Shawkat and Michael Cera get some of the best material as intermittently kissin\u2019 cousins Maeby and George Michael. She\u2019s in disguise as a senior citizen in a retirement condo (long story), and Ms. Shawkat \u2014 a comedic old soul to begin with \u2014 pulls off the ruse brilliantly.George Michael, meanwhile, is still dating Rebel Alley (Isla Fisher), the daughter of Ron Howard (longer story). He describes Rebel\u2019s family to his father, Michael, who\u2019s also dating Rebel (even longer story): \u201cThey\u2019re just such a nice \u2014 I don\u2019t want to use the word \u2018family\u2019 because they all like each other.\u201dI\u2019d explain the references, but \u201cArrested Development\u201d is assuming that anyone who\u2019s made it this far is in it for the references. I\u2019m starting to wonder if TV revivals like this are becoming what superhero franchises are to movies: fan-driven, list-checking exercises whose highest aim is to satisfy existing expectations and thus can never blow your expectations away.Nostalgia is limiting for a TV series, because it\u2019s always going to be partly conscious of recreating what it was rather than becoming what it could be. I can\u2019t reasonably argue that Season 4 was \u201cbetter\u201d in execution than this more reliable new season. But it was trying to be something new, rather than something it never could: the seasons of the show that might have existed a decade ago had Fox not canceled it.All that said, the first half of Season 5 is perfectly fine. Mostly funny. At moments scintillating. It\u2019s a good time as long as you keep in mind what the show is now. \u201cArrested Development\u201d was once the story of a wealthy family who lost everything. Now, it\u2019s mostly a story about having watched \u201cArrested Development.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Corrupt Leaders Are Falling Around the World. Will It Boost Economies?", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyAs the rogues\u2019 gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery, extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party, appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s former president and current front-runner in polls for October\u2019s presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption charges \u2014 in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than a decade ago.Lula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever. An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges.With the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when, in mid-April, the region\u2019s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d Donald Trump skipped the meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House couldn\u2019t keep up. Pence\u2019s official schedule initially included \u201ca banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.\u201d The only problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges.Behind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour; they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. \u201cJudges, journalists and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,\u201d says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt\u2019s not that corruption is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able to uncover it.\u201dThe \u201csand\u201d argument, however, has gained far more traction in recent years. \u201cAt this point, the evidence is fairly settled that corruption is a drag on long-term growth,\u201d Casas-Zamora says. The World Bank estimates that bribes siphon off around $1.5 trillion from the global economy each year \u2014 about 2 percent of world\u2019s gross domestic product and 10 times the value of overseas development aid. Much of that money, the bank says, goes into the pockets and foreign bank accounts of elites rather than into the public investments \u2014 schools, courts, hospitals, roads \u2014 that are needed to lift economies over the long haul. By degrading social norms and civic virtues, not to mention the rule of law on which investment depends, corruption rots the foundations of a healthy economy.For citizens in the developing world, this is not an academic debate. They see the costs of corruption every day: in shoddy public services; in \u201cpublic servants\u201d suddenly driving luxury cars; in small businesses pushed into the informal economy out of fear that taxes and laws will be unfairly applied. Corruption is, in effect, a regressive tax. According to the World Bank, poor families in developing countries often spend twice as much of their income on bribes as high-income families. As the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, put it: \u201cEvery dollar that a corrupt official or a corrupt business person puts in their pocket is a dollar stolen from a pregnant woman who needs health care; or from a girl or a boy who deserves an education; or from communities that need water, roads and schools.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIn the developing world, corruption is Public Enemy No. 1.\u201dJust a few years ago, Peru was growing so fast that it was considered, with Mexico, Chile and Colombia, one of the \u201cPacific Pumas.\u201d But the collapse of commodity prices hit hard \u2014 Peru depends heavily on mining \u2014 and the Odebrecht payoffs in exchange for major infrastructure projects laid bare the country\u2019s vast inequalities and injustices. Corruption has plagued Latin America since the days of colonial occupation, but in this case, the cure hurts almost as much as the disease. The Odebrecht scandal has paralyzed construction ventures across Peru, says Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, \u201cbut it is also making the government more prudent for new public investment projects.\u201d It\u2019s bitter medicine, but if it helps Peru begin to overcome its culture of corruption, the economy will be far healthier in the long run.A central driver of the anticorruption movement is a young generation of judges and prosecutors armed with greater independence and, in some cases, tough new transparency laws. Many countries in Latin America have adopted stricter accountability laws in the last two decades, though only Brazil has tested them effectively. S\u00e9rgio Moro, the lead prosecutor in Brazil\u2019s biggest corruption cases, has leaned on two other new tools, plea bargains and whistle-blower protections, to persuade underlings to testify against top bosses and leaders, including Lula. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, there were no rules, no conventions, no jurisdictions against corruption,\u201d says Delia Ferreira Rubio, chair of the global anticorruption group Transparency International. It\u2019s the collective responsibility of governments, civil society and businesses, Ferreira Rubio says, \u201cto ensure that impunity does not prevail.\u201dAfter an earlier wave of corruption scandals led to the fall of presidents in Brazil and Peru, daily life resumed, and corruption only worsened. Will this time be different? The social and legal progress over the last 20 years may signal a tectonic shift. But corruption fights back, too. In some countries, threatened elites are trying to curb civil society, weaken prosecutors and attack the press. Even top prosecutors say corruption cannot be rooted out with only court cases, even ones that break the spell of impunity. The goal is to build \u201csystems of integrity\u201d throughout society. And that requires commitment greater than the platitudes emanating from the Summit of the Americas. Such a prospect may be years, even generations, away. But the biggest psychological obstacle may have fallen already. As Casas-Zamora says, \u201cThe sense of fatalism about corruption is disappearing.\u201dBrook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Would you be shocked to learn that President Trump\u2019s choice to run the space agency is not an actual scientist or engineer? Or that he is a climate change skeptic? Or that he has never run a large organization?You probably wouldn\u2019t. In fact, Mr. Bridenstine\u2019s lack of qualifications make him a perfect fit for the Trump administration, a place that sometimes feels like what the kids in \u201cStranger Things\u201d call the Upside Down, a world just like our own, except that everything there is inverted, darkened and corrupted.You can see how someone without any science experience could be tapped to run NASA, as long as they could make up for it by demeaning gay and trans Americans, a group that of course included the first American woman in space, the unsinkable Sally Ride. Not to mention a transgender pioneer, Dr. Christine McGinn, who was flight surgeon for two shuttle missions. Talk about stranger things.Or, for that matter, \u201cLost in Space.\u201dIt also succeeds because this \u201cLost in Space,\u201d like its 1960s predecessor, reflects its time. Back in 1965, the Jupiter 2 blasted off in the futuristic year of 1997 because the earth was threatened by overcrowding; Dr. Smith, the saboteur, was a Cold War spy. (In short order, that character also became something of a gay icon, back when that meant being a scaredy-cat who said things like, \u201cYou bubble-headed booby.\u201d)The new \u201cLost in Space\u201d is set in 2048; the apocalyptic MacGuffin this time is an incoming asteroid named the Christmas Star \u2014 a doomsday event we later find out (spoiler alert) is not exactly what it seems; you might even, depending on what kind of NASA administrator you were, call it \u201cfake news.\u201dThere was a 1997 movie of the franchise, too, about which maybe the best thing you can say is that Matt LeBlanc from \u201cFriends\u201d played the pilot.Each generation gets the \u201cLost in Space\u201d it deserves.In hopes of understanding the universe a little better, I had a short talk with Bill Mumy, who played Will Robinson back in the day. As we began the interview, I asked him to check the microphone. Without further prompting, Mr. Mumy shouted, \u201cDanger, Will Robinson! Danger!\u201d \u2014 the old show\u2019s catchphrase.What the two series have in common is that each is sparked by a threat to life on earth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken as good care of this planet or the people on it as we should have,\u201d Mr. Mumy says. \u201cThat\u2019s the consistent lesson of every version of the show.\u201dThat\u2019s right: In 2018, the director of NASA isn\u2019t a scientist, the president is Donald Trump, and Will Robinson is Dr. Smith.But we need NASA, not only because of our fundamental yearning to explore the stars but also because of the necessary research we depend on the agency to conduct \u2014 research that may very well determine whether our Earth will wind up like the doomed planet the Robinsons had to flee in \u201cLost in Space.\u201dDonald Trump, having made America great again, now prepares to leave his mark on outer space. Two years ago, while still in Congress, Mr. Bridenstine sponsored a bill that would have eliminated NASA\u2019s objective of expanding \u201chuman knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space.\u201d What would you say about a world in which President Trump appoints this same man as the agency\u2019s director?Danger, Will Robinson.

{"Headline": "\u2018Extra\u2019 Cardinals Invade the Vatican (Blessings Not Included)", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRome JournalROME \u2014 The cardinals seemed to be everywhere, checking their cellphones as they sat on parked mopeds, petting dogs and wearing plastic bibs over their pectoral crosses as they waited in line for lunch on a small street outside the Vatican.Florence Cooper, a tourist from Vancouver, stumbled upon a group of them on Monday dressed in their distinctive black cassocks and scarlet buttons, fascias and zucchettos.\u201cPicture?\u201d Ms. Cooper, 69, asked. They draped their arms over her shoulders as her husband snapped a photo.Astonished at her good luck, she thanked the Italians for their kindness and lifted the medallion of St. Christopher hanging from her necklace for a blessing. That\u2019s when Fausto Maria Rivalta, 64, interrupted.\u201cWe\u2019re extras in a movie,\u201d he explained. The smile vanished from Ms. Cooper\u2019s face. \u201cI thought they were cardinals,\u201d she said.A lot of people did.This week, a confluence of ersatz eminences trafficked the streets around the Vatican for the filming of a Netflix drama about the relationship between Pope Francis, played by his Welsh doppelg\u00e4nger Jonathan Pryce, and Benedict XVI, played by Anthony Hopkins, during the papal transition of 2013.Rome is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and priests and nuns are as much a part of the fabric here as ancient ruins, Baroque churches and lately, heaping piles of garbage and potholes. (And sometimes, garbage in potholes.) But cardinals are rare birds in the city streets, tending to lay low in their apartments, sedans and curial offices.Even some Vatican officials were a bit baffled.Paul Tighe, an authentic bishop and the second-highest-ranking official at the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Council for Culture, walked down the street with a novel under his arm, doing a double take when he saw all the red hats.\u201cFor a moment,\u201d he confessed, \u201cI tried to see if I could recognize any of them.\u201dOutside a restaurant, Renato Friscotti, 72, stood among a small college of faux cardinals and explained how he got the job.\u201cThey picked us because we look the part,\u201d Mr. Friscotti said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the long aquiline noses. And we are so old.\u201dMr. Friscotti is himself a veteran of ecclesiastical extra work. In the HBO series \u201cThe Young Pope,\u201d he appeared as Pope Celestine V, who, like Benedict, made what Dante called the \u201cgreat refusal\u201d and retired from office in 1294.Mr. Friscotti, a retired phone technician, said posing with pilgrims and occasionally imparting a blessing to tourists was the least he and his friends could do. \u201cWe let them think what they want to think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes them happier.\u201dSome extras said they were assigned to portray an actual cardinal during the historic conclave that elected Francis. Renato Abbate, 74, a writer, said that one of those real cardinals drove past him and his friends and looked as if he were sizing up \u201cthe competition.\u201dThey thought they had more in common with Mr. Hopkins, who plays Benedict XVI, saying he was down to earth.\u201cHe says hello to all of us and shook 150 hands the other day,\u201d Mr. Friscotti said.An extra in a priest\u2019s collar added that Mr. Pryce, who plays Francis, was a nice guy, too, and recalled that when they were filming a dining scene in the Royal Palace of Caserta, he \u201cwas throwing bread all around.\u201d Mr. Pryce, he said, also had the advantage of looking exactly like Francis.\u201cA dead ringer,\u201d said Enzo Massacci, 67, a retired railroad employee who was himself a dead ringer for a Borgia cardinal.After lunch, the production crew led a procession of pretend prelates, Swiss Guards, nuns and Vatican gendarmes under the arches of the Passetto di Borgo and across Via dei Corridori. They turned right on Via della Conciliazione, the broad thoroughfare that spills out onto St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, where tourists and pilgrims filmed them and waved.The extras skirted along the outside of Bernini\u2019s colonnade, where they stopped across the street from three tents, under which the show\u2019s stars and crew huddled.Alfiero Toppetti, 76, dressed as a cardinal, leaned against the railing and stared at the tents as a counterfeit clergyman droned on at his side.\u201cIn cinema, the less you talk,\u201d he told him, \u201cthe better it is.\u201dA veteran actor who has appeared in several Italian movies and television variety shows, Mr. Toppetti stood still as a makeup artist fixed his hair and zucchetto and explained that, hailing as he did from Assisi, the home of St. Francis, he couldn\u2019t resist the chance to portray a cardinal, even though the pay wasn\u2019t great. \u201cWe do it for love,\u201d he said. \u201cA sacrifice.\u201dAs security guards sidestepped speeding cars and ushered a few eccentrics (\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Jesus. Have a nice day\u201d) off the street, the production staff started separating the fake cardinals from other extras portraying tourists and journalists.Much like real journalists might, the fake ones took a load off on the bases of the columns near the home to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, where Benedict worked as prefect before his election as pope.\u201cI\u2019m playing a journalist,\u201d he said, explaining that he had joined the production as a script consultant, a job he had also had on Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d through which he first met Stephen K. Bannon.Mr. Williams, a conservative and great admirer of Pope Benedict, has in the past acknowledged that Breitbart \u201cdidn\u2019t love\u201d Francis, and said he made sure this production treated Benedict fairly. \u201cThere were some things that needed changing,\u201d he confided as he rushed to his mark.He and the other actors prepared to shoot a scene in which Mr. Friscotti and Mr. Toppetti walked directly behind Mr. Pryce, as Francis. Before they started rolling, one of the security guards brought me to the tents across the street.Next to me stood Mr. Pryce, who indeed looked identical to Francis \u2014 Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio before he got his white robes. He laughed with the crew about the microphone in his vestments and I took a picture of a woman rolling a lint brush over his black mozzetta.A member of the crew demanded I delete the picture.\u201cThis,\u201d the crew member proclaimed, in the shadow of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, the Holy Office and the home of Pope Francis, \u201cis the dominion of Netflix.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No one said this was going to be pretty, but there are some very fine reads out there this year. There\u2019s also some of the season\u2019s usual fun, like the glitter of Broadway and fiction that wallows in the richly dramatic lives of the rich.\u201cSocial Creature\u201d is a wicked original with echoes of the greats (Patricia Highsmith, Gillian Flynn). It tells of how the impoverished Louise falls into the orbit of the fabulously debauched Lavinia, who adopts her as an instant bestie and gives her clothes, a room, a complete makeover \u2014 everything but the keys to Lavinia\u2019s family manse. Louise moves in, but Lavinia retains control. Sort of. To use one of the book\u2019s favorite phrases, here\u2019s the thing: Lavinia isn\u2019t going to live very long. We\u2019re told that from the start. But the book builds enormous suspense around the questions of how, when and why she will die. And what will happen after that.He writes of how his father\u2019s stubborn nature, profligacy and addiction destroyed the family\u2019s stability. He also writes of his own addiction issues, and the overlap between father\u2019s life and son\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Netflix Counts the Reasons Teens Should Watch \u201813 Reasons Why\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cMovies and shows are a wonderful way to open up a dialogue,\u201d one of the dads says to the other, as Courtney sighs, annoyed.If the show\u2019s writers were aiming for coy self-reference, they achieved it. Far more overt is the opening of the first episode of the new season, which begins streaming on Friday at 3:01 a.m. Eastern Time. The show\u2019s stars address the camera directly, out of character, and issue trigger warning after trigger warning. \u201cBy shedding a light on these difficult topics, we hope our show can help viewers start a conversation,\u201d says Katherine Langford, after introducing herself as the actress who plays the character Hannah Baker, the teenager whose suicide is the centerpiece of the show\u2019s story line.\u201cWe knew when we were making Season 1 that we were telling a challenging and suspenseful story in a pretty unflinching way,\u201d said Brian Yorkey, the playwright (\u201cNext to Normal\u201d) who adapted the book for Netflix and is the series\u2019 showrunner. \u201cWe suspected that there would be some strong conversation. What we didn\u2019t expect was the amount of the conversation.\u201dMr. Yorkey and Netflix executives have spent the last year trying both to figure out the story line for a second season and how to get ahead of any blowback the show\u2019s return could cause.First, there was the creative question of where to take the characters now that the show\u2019s original source material had been exhausted?\u201cWe started with the idea of the trial as the engine of the story and the engine of discovery,\u201d Mr. Yorkey said. \u201cIs it possible to get justice for what happened to Hannah, and what does that look like?\u201dSimultaneously, Netflix executives enlisted Zeno Group, a public relations and marketing firm, to conduct a study that Netflix used to promote the idea that TV shows help parents and their kids to bond over difficult issues.By the fall of last year, Netflix took a more serious tack. Through Zeno, it reached out to Prof. Ellen Wartella, the director of the Center on Media and Human Development at Northwestern University.University administrators negotiated a deal with Netflix, in which Professor Wartella and her team would have autonomy in creating the questions and analyzing the data collected by a third party, even though Netflix partially funded the research. \u201cWe wanted a rigorous, independent academic study to help us understand the far reaches of the conversation\u201d ignited by the show, said Brian Wright, the Netflix executive who oversees family and young adult original series.Among Professor Wartella\u2019s recommendations: The cast should address the audience directly as actors not characters, to help convey to teens the fiction of it all, and direct them to talk to adults about their problems and to seek information on the web. (Mr. Wright says his team came upon that idea independently.)\u201cNetflix is taking their responsibility seriously,\u201d said Jill Cook, the assistant director of the American School Counselor Association. (Ms. Cook says the association has no financial relationship to Netflix.)Ms. Cook initially contacted Netflix last year to express her organization\u2019s concern that the depiction of adults on the show as clueless \u2014 a counselor doesn\u2019t report concerns to the principal, parents have no idea that their kids are having torrid sex upstairs after a school-night family dinner, dads watch DVDs instead of Netflix \u2014 would discourage students from seeking help. For the show\u2019s resources site, it helped create the discussion guides, and for its own website it recently posted a template letter that school administrators can send to parents.One person who plans to binge-watch the new episodes as soon as they drop is Polly Conway, the senior editor for television for Common Sense Media, a digital resource for parents trying to assess what movies, TV shows and books are appropriate for their children.Among the warnings are that story lines revolve around suicide, gun violence and sexual assault. \u201cThis year we want to be ready,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t know how huge it would be and it happened fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Every step of the way has been carefully considered.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Ali Wong\u2019s debut special, \u201cBaby Cobra,\u201d had its premiere on Mother\u2019s Day in 2016, very few people outside of the comedy world knew who Ms. Wong was and there was little reason to think this hour or so of jokes would change that. She had trouble selling out shows and no one submitted the special for Emmy consideration because what would be the point? And while Netflix had an impressive track record of showcasing stand-up stars, it had never made one \u2014 until Ali Wong.\u201cBaby Cobra\u201d presented something new, a pregnant woman in her third trimester delivering a deliriously filthy and funny hour of comedy woven into a sneakily feminist assault on the double standards of parenting. Pioneers like Joan Rivers, who had also performed pregnant, and Roseanne Barr paved the way with biting jokes about motherhood and domesticity, but Ms. Wong made maternal comedy seem more glamorous, sexual and overtly political.She alternated jokes about the injustice of how little is expected of fathers with lustful tributes to the sex appeal of Asian men. \u201cThey got no body hair from the neck down,\u201d she says in the special. \u201cIt\u2019s like making love to a dolphin.\u201dMuch of the special involves raw descriptions of the nitty-gritty of having a baby, whether it\u2019s the workaday sex to try to get pregnant or a pregnant wife\u2019s peculiar resentment of her husband. When he asks her to help with household chores, her response is: \u201cI\u2019m busy making an eyeball, O.K.? Are you making a foot? I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many selfies I\u2019ve gotten asked for at the gynecologist and pediatrician office,\u201d she said. \u201cI should sell tickets there.\u201dIn \u201cHard Knock Wife,\u201d her follow-up special, which Netflix will release once again on Mother\u2019s Day, she performs pregnant again, with her second child. \u201cIt\u2019s very much like a sequel to \u2018Baby Cobra,\u2019\u201d she told me in her toy-strewn house, not long after giving birth. \u201cWhen Chappelle asked me if I was doing another one, he said that\u2019s so cool\u201d that each baby had a special.So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that anxiety about success is also a theme of her new work. This is part of the reason she returned to the stage early this year, five weeks after giving birth, against the advice of her doctor. She\u2019s terrified of becoming unfunny. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen to people who got famous and seduced by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s work ethic or if they\u2019re delusional because the audience loves them so much.\u201dTwo months after giving birth she slipped out of the house and drove to the Upright Citizens Brigade here to make an unannounced appearance, walking onstage in sweatpants and a puffy jacket to roaring applause. She told a new joke about #MeToo and got a laugh, though she wasn\u2019t sure she could trust it. U.C.B. crowds are notoriously generous. Only after experimenting with that joke 25 more times, she said, would she know if it works.While she comes off as cerebral and soft-spoken offstage, her jaunty stand-up alter ego has the strutting charisma of a rock star. When she was growing up her favorite comic was Eddie Murphy and, like him, she isn\u2019t afraid to swagger, preen or grab her crotch.Ms. Wong, who majored in Asian-American studies at U.C.L.A. and considered a career in academia before trying and falling in love with stand-up after college, held off for nearly a decade before producing a special. Now 36, she has done two late-night television sets but considers them a bad form for her brand of comedy, so won\u2019t return. Hard to pigeonhole, her comedy begins with a strong, dynamic stage presence and arguments that take some time to build.At the U.C.B. she alternated between a forceful declarative voice and a croaking whisper that reminded Hilary Swank, who was in the audience that night, of her \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d co-star Clint Eastwood. Ms. Wong talked about being a mother. But she bristled when describing a fellow comic who said pregnancy was becoming her trademark. \u201cPregnancy is not rainbow suspenders,\u201d she said, exasperated.After she finished her set to loud applause Ms. Wong drove home, pumped some milk for her baby, went to sleep and woke up at 7 a.m. to breast-feed, while her husband, Justin Hakuta, took care of their 2-1/2-year-old daughter. In her new special she raises the question of work-life balance and explains her secret. \u201cI have a nanny,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dIt infuriates her that more celebrities don\u2019t acknowledge this. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to the hard-core stay-at-home moms to pretend you\u2019re able to have an amazing body by chasing around your kids,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think one of the hardest things to talk about as a comic is having money because it\u2019s so unrelatable. But this is such a big part of my life.\u201dNow that she\u2019s had some experience as a mother, \u201cHard Knock Wife\u201d digs deeper into the theme of motherhood than \u201cBaby Cobra\u201d did. But if you were expecting a mellow and mature evolution, think again. She makes jokes about farting, urinating and various sexual acts, but her dirtiest material might be about childbirth. \u201cGiving birth is hard core,\u201d she said at home. \u201cSex is not dirty. A C-section is dirty.\u201dThis dichotomy has been the foundation of countless jokes, and in \u201cHard Knock Wife,\u201d Ms. Wong takes a jackhammer to it. When asked if there\u2019s a generational difference between these two perspectives \u2014 Mr. Rock is 53 \u2014 she agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s also speaking to who he is \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of people who can identify with that,\u201d she said, adding that among her friends\u2019 relationships, most of the women make more money than the men.When asked why there have been so few Asian stand-up stars, Ms. Wong hesitated, avoiding the question. At another point she noted that Asians are stereotyped as not funny, even among other Asians. \u201cThey have internalized that their own people are not funny,\u201d she said, adding that some have told her they didn\u2019t think she would be good.When it comes to her comic sensibility, she pointed to her father. \u201cAsians are known for being obsessed with saving face, but when my dad had to pass gas, he didn\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the quietest, most inappropriate places, in a church or a library or during someone\u2019s speech, he would rip it up. It was kind of great comedic timing.\u201dWhen her father died around a decade ago, she started thinking about family differently. \u201cBefore my dad passed away, I would miss a lot of baby showers and weddings, sacrificed a lot of family and friend events for dumb road dates,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t do that anymore. It\u2019s gone in the other direction. I\u2019m more inclined to put family and friends first.\u201dIn fact, she is determined to bring her family with her on the road. She has already mapped out a tour this year that revolves around school holidays and has taken a particular interest in how star mother entertainers have managed touring with kids.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about how Mariah sets up a nursery,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to read about Carrie Underwood touring with her kids on a bus. Nelson George told me how Sade toured. I\u2019d love to be like Sade, but it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re not, well, Sade.\u201dThe first time Ms. Wong became pregnant, she confessed, she was so worried that her husband would not love their child that she gave the baby a Japanese first name (her husband is half-Japanese, half-Filipino) and his last name. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of sign of me in her name,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I think subconsciously I did that to try and ensure he would love her.\u201dIt\u2019s a notable admission, particularly since at the same time Ms. Wong was taping \u201cBaby Cobra,\u201d which sharply attacked how our culture has such low expectations for fathers. But she said that when she gave birth and father and child bonded so easily she realized she had gone overboard. \u201cNo matter how progressive things get, you can\u2019t fight biology,\u201d she said.In the new special she pokes fun at her mother for asking if being the breadwinner would threaten her husband, and in person, she underlined the point. But she also allowed for more nuance.\u201cI make fun of him a lot,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the truth is he\u2019s a VP at a multimillion-dollar tech company.\u201dAt one point her husband interrupted the interview as he came downstairs. He made small talk but didn\u2019t linger. After he left the house, Ms. Wong said, \u201cObviously, he doesn\u2019t like talking to journalists.\u201d Then she went quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really strange transition.\u201dShe said that he had become more open to her talking about their family onstage, but that with her growing profile he had asked to hear jokes that include him at the beginning of the process of working them out, not the end, and he had occasionally vetoed a bit.\u201cHe\u2019s an Asian unicorn; there\u2019s nobody like him,\u201d she said, singing his praises after explaining why there are things more important than comedy. \u201cI have to run jokes by him or I lose my marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not worth a cool joke.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ali Wong\u2019s status with the series \u201cFresh Off the Boat.\u201d She used to write for it; she is not currently a writer on it. The article also misstated Justin Hakuta\u2019s employment status. He is a vice president at a tech company, not vice president of the firm.Advertisement"}
