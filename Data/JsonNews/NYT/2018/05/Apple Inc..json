{"Headline": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhen it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up?To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it\u2019s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon\u2019s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring.Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October.As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there\u2019s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner\u2019s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren\u2019t direct competitors.While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense).But Amazon is already vertically integrated \u2014 it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201dThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201dIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.The government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201dTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201dWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.Courts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201dWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201dPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Fill Warren Buffett\u2019s \u2018Moat\u2019 With Candy, but It Still Holds Water", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 Elon Musk is taking on Warren Buffett, and their differences run deeper than jokes about candy and medieval fortifications.At Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting over the weekend, I relayed a question from a shareholder to Mr. Buffett about a comment Mr. Musk had made a couple days earlier.\u201cI think \u2018moats\u2019 are lame,\u201d Mr. Musk had said during a Tesla earnings call. It was a criticism of an economic principle that Mr. Buffett had coined in 1999 and that has become something of a mantra for his faithful: Invest in businesses \u201cthat have wide, sustainable moats around them.\u201dSuch moats, Mr. Buffett has said, are made of the competitive advantages that benefit major brands and companies, like distribution networks, pricing power and brand reputation.But to Mr. Musk, they are a metaphor for being stuck in the past. \u201cIf your only defense against invading armies is a moat, you will not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the pace of innovation \u2014 that is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness.\u201dAt a time when technology is upending even old-line industries that once seemed impenetrable to competition, might Mr. Musk be right?\u201cElon may turn things upside down in some areas,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to take us on in candy,\u201d suggesting Berkshire\u2019s See\u2019s Candies division enjoyed an unassailably wide moat. The quip elicited laughter from the 20,000 shareholders who packed the CenturyLink Center.Mr. Musk answered the challenge immediately, saying he was starting a candy company. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.Not only that, Mr. Musk said, he planned \u201cto build a moat and fill it with candy\u201d \u2014 making it impossible for Mr. Buffett to resist sinking his money into the venture.The repartee was good for some chuckles and clickbait headlines, but the mini-spat masked a more serious and significant debate taking place across corporate America: Have the traditional moats shrunk?When direct-to-consumer brands like Dollar Shave Club have been able to take on consumer giants like Procter & Gamble\u2019s Gillette \u2014 so much so that Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion \u2014 are any businesses still safe? Mr. Buffett owns Kraft Heinz, for example, but could upstart food companies one day overtake it, breaking through the substantial network of distribution and marketing arrangements \u2014 and brand loyalty \u2014 that Kraft Heinz has built up over decades?Mr. Buffett acknowledged that times had changed. \u201cThere have been more moats that have become susceptible to invasion than seemed to be the case earlier,\u201d he said.To a large degree, Mr. Musk is a living embodiment of a gleeful invader. With Tesla, he is trying to prove that what was long thought of as a substantial moat around the automobile industry could be overcome. He has gone direct to consumer with Tesla vehicles, bypassing the traditional car dealers that were once considered a barrier to entering the automotive business. He even had what seemed like his own moat: a network of Supercharger stations around the country that he recently opened up to competitors. (His initial panning of the \u201cmoat\u201d idea followed a question about why he was willing to cede the advantage that the closed charging network provided.)But, in truth, Mr. Musk\u2019s experience \u2014 and challenges \u2014 at Tesla may demonstrate just how much a moat remains a powerful deterrent to competitors.In the case of the automobile industry, perhaps the biggest barrier is the huge amount of capital needed \u2014 Tesla has already raised more than $12 billion. But even with huge amounts of money, Tesla\u2019s recent production struggles \u2014 it has repeatedly missed its targets for making the new mass-market Model 3 \u2014 show the immense value of manufacturing experience.Mr. Musk\u2019s willingness to challenge convention has clearly pushed the automobile industry forward, but his progress has lately been bumpier than he initially expected. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t succeed, but if he does, he may be the exception, not the rule.There are still huge swaths of our economy that have dauntingly wide moats, many of them protected by regulatory walls. Banks, which have been speculated about as ripe for disruption by financial technology companies, seem more likely to buy start-ups than compete against them. Airlines \u2014 which Mr. Buffett once called \u201ca death trap for investors\u201d \u2014 have consolidated, and enormous corporations control virtually all the landing slots at airports around the globe. Before it could get off the ground, any insurgent hoping to challenge them would have to find a spot to come down.Even many digital businesses have a moat: Google and Facebook control so much of the advertising market that it is hard to see how a kid in a garage with an idea could usurp them anytime soon. Amazon has itself has become so powerful that virtually every seller feels it has to go through it. And Mr. Buffett has convinced himself that Apple\u2019s deep relationship with its customers through its ecosystem of products and iCloud mean the business has a defensible moat.\u201cThere are some pretty good moats around,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cBeing the low-cost producer, for example, is a terribly important moat,\u201d he said, citing Geico, the low-cost insurance company Berkshire owns.Saturday night, after the Berkshire meeting ended, Mr. Musk was still tweeting: \u201cSaying you like \u2018moats\u2019 is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies.\u201dFor better or worse, the limited competition that oligopolies face is usually good for investors \u2014 even if consumers might disagree.But whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Perhaps Charlie Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, put it best: \u201cElon says a conventional moat is quaint. And that\u2019s true of a puddle of water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Says It Will Buy Back $100 Billion in Stock", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said it would buy back an additional $100 billion in stock, by far the largest increase in its already historic record of returning capital to investors. The company didn\u2019t provide a timeline for the repurchases. Apple also increased its dividend by 16 percent to 73 cents a share, pushing past Exxon Mobil to become the largest dividend payer, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.But critics say the actions can take money away from potential investments in hiring or research and development, and can increase economic inequality because they typically benefit wealthier people.Investors should want companies to reinvest in themselves and their employees versus repurchasing their own stock to increase the share price, said William Lazonick, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who studies stock buybacks. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.\u201dLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that Apple was making significant investments in hiring, research and development, and manufacturing, \u201cbut we also have a very, very profitable business.\u201dHe said that \u201cbecause we\u2019re making all the right investments all around the company, it makes perfect sense for us not to keep the cash on our balance sheet but return it to investors.\u201dNo company has ever done stock buybacks like Apple. In the most recent quarter, Apple repurchased $23.5 billion in stock \u2014 the largest single stock buyback ever and more than the market value of 275 of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.Apple said Tuesday that it had now returned $275 billion to shareholders since 2012 and that it planned to finish its previous stock-buyback program in the current quarter, about nine months early.Other academics and investors cheered Apple\u2019s continued returns to shareholders.\u201cPeople like to believe the stories that C.E.O.s do things to boost the short-term stock price and line their own pockets,\u201d said Alex Edmans, a finance professor at the London Business School. \u201cBut if you look at hundreds of examples, you find that stock buybacks do increase long-term value.\u201dHe said that companies typically bought back stock only when they had extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise, and that investors would spend that money elsewhere.Apple said its profit increased 25 percent to $13.8 billion in the most recent quarter on the back of strong revenue growth for iPhones, the Apple Watch and its services business. Apple earned $2.73 a share, it said, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion.The three months ending with March were Apple\u2019s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone, the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs, including the financial results of Apple\u2019s suppliers, that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple\u2019s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result.Apple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price \u2014 driven by the $1,000 iPhone X \u2014 helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hit back at the notion that the iPhone business, which accounts for 62 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, had little room to grow. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the view that the market is saturated,\u201d he said.Investors have also worried that Apple\u2019s influence in China, the company\u2019s No. 2 market, is waning amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals. But Apple\u2019s results suggest that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for the pricier iPhones. Apple said revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion, the largest increase in 10 quarters.And Apple\u2019s services revenue, which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales, rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion. Apple said consumers had paid for more than 270 million subscriptions for its services or ones sold via its App Store, up from roughly 170 million a year earlier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Temporary Cease-Fire in CBS\u2019s Fight With Redstones: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Shari Redstone\u2019s response to the CBS lawsuit.\u2022 A tough road ahead for the Trump administration on trade.\u2022 Who doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s lifeline to ZTE?Less than an hour before hearing, Ms. Redstone issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. Under the new rules, decisions on dividends would need to be approved by a \u201csupermajority\u201d of CBS\u2019s board. That likely would have blocked a potential move by most of CBS\u2019s board to issue a special dividend to water down the Redstones\u2019 voting stake to 17 percent from 79 percent.The change to bylaws is now on hold: The judge said on Wednesday that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.Ahead of the hearing, Ms. Redstone\u2019s National Amusements filed its legal response to a CBS lawsuit, seeking to prevent her from blocking a special meeting of its board on whether to water down her controlling stake.Here are some of the notable parts of the filing by lawyers for National Amusements:\u2022 On CBS\u2019s contention that Ms. Redstone intends to replace its board because of its resistance to a deal: \u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger.\u201d\u2022 Why Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery should reject a CBS board move to dilute the Redstones\u2019 voting power to 17 percent from 79 percent: \u201cThis is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting power.\u201d Later, Ms. Redstone\u2019s lawyers add, \u201cThis court has held that, absent a compelling justification (which is non-existent here), a board of directors breaches its fiduciary duty of loyalty by acting for the primary purpose of diluting a controlling stockholder\u2019s voting rights.\u201d\u2022 The revelation of which CBS director National Amusements had suggested was involved in questionable activity. The filing includes an affidavit by Robert Klieger, a CBS board member and lawyer for the Redstones (whom other directors have argued is working on behalf of Ms. Redstone), regarding a call he had had last week with Bruce Gordon, the head of the CBS board\u2019s special committee:Specifically, I noted National Amusement Inc.\u2019s discomfort with the continued CBS board position of Charles K. Gifford given certain incidents that took place in 2016 and 2017. I also discussed the possibility of facilitating Mr. Gifford\u2019s exit from the CBS board with minimal disruption and public attention, including, in the event of a merger of CBS and Viacom, through his potential non-appointment to the board of a combined company.\u2022 A lament for what Ms. Redstone is her current predicament:\u201cPlaintiffs have forced CBS\u2019s controlling stockholder into a position of having to make a Hobson\u2019s choice\u2014of either accepting massive dilution of its voting power (thereby losing control of the company and suffering the economic detriment to its stake that entails), or acting as a stockholder to prevent such dilution and protect its voting power, knowing that doing so might trigger the departure of (and payment of massive parachute payments to) key management and directors of the company.CBS filed a response to National Amusements saying that Ms. Redstone\u2019s opposition to the special meeting is proof that CBS need a temporary restraining order.\u201cUnless restrained, defendants will use the consent process to replace directors or amend bylaws in advance of Thursday\u2019s board meeting.\u201dThe context\u2014 Michael de la MercedSenate Democrats narrowly won a vote on Wednesday to save so-called net neutrality rules.Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports:The Senate passed a resolution in a 52-47 vote to overturn a decision last December by the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle Obama-era rules that prevented broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast from blocking or speeding up streams and downloads of web content in exchange for extra fees. The commission\u2019s repeal of net neutrality is set to take effect in a few weeks.The rare victory for Democrats is sure to be short-lived, with a similar resolution expected to die in the House, where Republicans have a larger majority. Only three Republican senators voted in support of the resolution.Apple has quietly explored the idea of opening a campus for 20,000 employees in Northern Virginia, further advancing the possibility that the Washington area could evolve into an East Coast outpost for Silicon Valley.His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users.His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament\u2019s various blocs and the head of the body\u2019s civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook\u2019s practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues.\u2014 Prashant S. Rao and Sheera Frenkel\u2022 The job comes with big challenges. Whoever becomes C.E.O. will have to work across three companies with 1.2 million employees and develop solutions to bring down costs in a multi-trillion dollar industry. The group will also be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints\u201d That means whoever takes the job will have to \u201chandle the requisite long hours, extensive travel and public scrutiny of running a high-profile start-up, but probably without the allure of a big stock incentive plan, which is typically an attractive incentive in tech recruiting.\u201d\u2022 At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, Warren Buffett said the partnership hoped to announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months.\u201d But he seemed uncertain, though not unhopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important.

{"Headline": "Tariff Impact Colors a Key House Race in Boeing Country", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUBURN, Wash. \u2014 President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president\u2019s recent moves on trade.Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces.\u201cI\u2019m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,\u201d Mr. Cesmat said. \u201cThousands of people\u2019s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.\u201dThe spat with Beijing has rattled the state\u2019s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm.\u201cTrade issues are high on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. \u201cThey are wondering and worrying how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201dThat anxiety is particularly acute in the Eighth Congressional District, a comma-shaped expanse that will hold one of the most closely watched midterm races in November as the Democrats battle to win back the House. Several political handicappers rate the race as a tossup.The district\u2019s quirky boundary, which encompasses the vast airplane-making ecosystem to the west and thousands of acres of cherry and apple farms on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, makes the territory uniquely vulnerable to the president\u2019s actions on trade. Boeing is probably the American company with the most riding on a healthy relationship with Beijing.China is projected to buy more than 7,000 planes worth around $1 trillion in the next 20 years, more than Boeing\u2019s current backlog for the entire world. Most commercial aircraft in China are made by Boeing, the company says, but if the trade pressures escalate, China could choose to award more work to Europe\u2019s Airbus.For now, Beijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on some airplanes, including older 737 models made in the Renton factory where Mr. Cesmat works, which is just outside the district.\u201cChina knew exactly where to target,\u201d said Kim Schrier, the Democratic candidate who has built the biggest campaign war chest ahead of the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting districts where this could be problematic for Republicans.\u201dMs. Schrier is among half a dozen or so Democrats gunning for a seat that became catnip for the party the moment that the seven-term Republican incumbent, Dave Reichert, announced his retirement in September. Despite Mr. Reichert\u2019s success, the district favored Hillary Clinton by three percentage points over Mr. Trump, and it went twice for Barack Obama. Ms. Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate, has been hammering Dino Rossi, the likely Republican nominee, on the tariff issue.\u201cThese tariffs are a direct response to the policies of a president you helped elect. Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she tweeted to Mr. Rossi last month.Mr. Rossi, a former state senator, is careful to note that the bluster could be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating style. But he said he understood why everyone was so worried. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get down to a trade war. In the end it will be very disruptive,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHopefully this is more posturing than anything.\u201dBut voters in the district say the escalating trade drama has already begun to complicate their daily lives. Companies that supply construction materials have suspended orders, waiting to see what happens to metal prices. Employees at a builder of truck components say managers have been hastily reassessing supply chains that run through China and Mexico. A local hard-cider brewer is reconsidering an expansion after the steel and aluminum tariffs made new tanks and cans more expensive.And at Boeing, a company that employs grandfathers next to granddaughters and has introduced generations of Washingtonians to their spouses, the unease has been evident from the executive suite to the factory floor.Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on trade didn\u2019t used to inspire so much teeth-grinding among Boeing workers. A lot of union mechanics were happy last year when he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have reinforced the nation\u2019s embrace of free trade. And the president earned a lot of fans in Washington when he criticized the company on the campaign trail in 2015 for setting up a new plant outside Shanghai, saying it would \u201cend up taking a tremendous number of jobs away from the United States.\u201dJim McKenzie, a union machinery repairman, remembered that comment when, several months ago, he came across a package of dorsal-fin parts at the Boeing plant in Auburn where he works. Mr. McKenzie pulled back the Bubble Wrap and saw a label that made him feel as if he were sinking into quicksand: Boeing China.\u201cWe drill it and assemble it, but they ship the parts in from China,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThere are people who have worked here for 25 years making those parts, and they\u2019re proud of that.\u201dBut Mr. McKenzie, 56, isn\u2019t eager to blow up the Beijing relationship. \u201cChina will just buy all their planes from Airbus,\u201d he said, leaning his chair back against a wall in the machinists\u2019 union hall in Auburn.He doesn\u2019t have much hope that Mr. Trump will do anything to stop Boeing from setting up shop in China \u2014 he saw how Carrier shipped work from Indianapolis to Mexico even though the president had railed against the move. In Boeing\u2019s case, Mr. McKenzie said, hiring some Chinese workers might be unavoidable. \u201cYou have to provide them jobs to sell them airplanes,\u201d he said.Ms. Schrier recently won the endorsement of the machinists\u2019 union, which represents more than 26,000 Boeing workers. Mr. Cesmat, 27, plans to volunteer for her campaign. \u201cShe pledged to support our jobs,\u201d he said.Boeing\u2019s political action committee donated $2,000 to Mr. Reichert\u2019s campaign, but hasn\u2019t contributed to any candidates vying to succeed him, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. It did donate $8,000 to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is facing a strong Democratic challenge in her quest for re-election in Washington\u2019s Fifth District.The fear over trade tensions has spread beyond Boeing\u2019s hulking factories, all the way to Schilling Cider, a hard-cider company founded here five years ago by two friends, Mark Kornei and Colin Schilling. The business grew quickly, thanks in part to the state\u2019s abundant apple orchards, but now it\u2019s staring down an uncomfortable new reality.The company that sells Mr. Kornei stainless-steel tanks told him recently that prices for its raw materials might rise by 20 percent. A single tank costs around $50,000. He has also heard from the manufacturer of his aluminum cans that prices could increase by 10 percent. Mr. Kornei will buy 11 million of them this year, so that uptick alone could cost him more than $100,000, he said.\u201cStirring the pot unnecessarily doesn\u2019t help business whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Kornei said. \u201cGive us a steady set of rules so we can figure out what we are going to do.\u201dMr. Rossi acknowledged that some of what the president says and does \u201ccan at times\u201d make it harder for him on the campaign trail. But he has raised more than $2 million, about twice as much as Ms. Schrier.The Republican tax cuts are a big selling point for Mr. Rossi, who has a ready figure for exactly how much a typical household will save because of the law (\u201c$3,357 \u2014 that\u2019s real money\u201d). He\u2019s also counting on a personal bond with Republican voters east of the Cascades.Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Uncle Drew\u2019: Branding Vehicle or Feature Film? Yes", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the movie looks like another inoffensive summer road-trip comedy. In the trailer, there are stars like Nick Kroll and Tiffany Haddish ping-ponging punch lines with Lil Rel Howery. There\u2019s a sense of escapism along with a healthy dose of slapstick.\u201cUncle Drew\u201d may be all of that. It is also the continuation of a corporate marketing campaign for a soda company.An unusual integration of branded content and film, the movie is built around the N.B.A. star Kyrie Irving and is based entirely on a series of Pepsi commercials that went viral beginning in 2012. A heavily made-up Mr. Irving plays Uncle Drew, a septuagenarian driven to show up younger basketball players on the playground. He sets out to reunite with his teammates from decades ago for one more run at the Rucker Park tournament in Harlem.Moviegoers might not realize or care that they are watching what is essentially a Pepsi commercial when they turn out for the June 29 release. Academics, meanwhile, believe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is the first feature film of its kind, taking product placement one step further in a new avenue for branding and signaling the film industry\u2019s willingness to \u2014 ahem \u2014 play ball.In short, Pepsi needs to tap new audiences for its product, and \u201cUncle Drew\u201d is, as Rohit Deshpande, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School, put it, \u201canother salvo in the cola wars.\u201dThe \u201cUncle Drew\u201d story begins in 2011, when Mr. Irving, then a 19-year-old newcomer to the N.B.A., agreed to appear in a Super Bowl promotion for Pepsi. The collaboration went well and Pepsi signed him to a deal. Afterward, Pepsi\u2019s agency partner, Davie Brown Entertainment, and Mr. Irving conceived the idea of a geriatric character who would show young players what real basketball looked like. Pepsi executives were intrigued. They wanted to shift away from traditional advertising and toward storytelling.With Mr. Irving\u2019s character, Pepsi hopes to extend its brand while entertaining viewers at the same time.\u201cEveryone has so many marketing methods coming at them so often that it\u2019s tough to break through,\u201d said Lou Arbetter, the general manager of Pepsi Productions. He helped develop the original shorts. \u201cYou want to create things that people actually want to see.\u201dThis is in line with recent research showing that consumers have grown increasingly wary of traditional advertising.\u201cIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t like ads; it\u2019s that people don\u2019t like being sold to,\u201d said Beth Egan, an associate advertising professor at Syracuse University. \u201cMillennials especially are really keen to have a relationship with brands, but that has to be a true, authentic and two-way relationship.\u201dIn preliminary findings from a recent study led by Ms. Egan, when subjects were exposed to branded content, prominent mention of the brand increased viewers\u2019 suspicion of the messaging.So how do you mostly remove the brand but keep the association?Pepsi filmed several videos, written and directed by Mr. Irving, featuring cameos from other N.B.A. names, including Mr. Irving\u2019s then-teammate, Kevin Love, and the retired Hall of Fame center Bill Russell. The Pepsi logo wasn\u2019t conspicuous other than a \u201cPepsi Max presents\u201d at the beginning and some shots of spectators drinking Pepsi.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong association now between Irving, \u2018Uncle Drew\u2019 and the Pepsi brand,\u201d Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cThis was just another chapter in how to bring the brand\u2019s story to life,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cNobody has done it before, but I would venture to take a guess that this won\u2019t be the last time.\u201dPrincipals involved with the movie insist that while the film may have originated with a company best known for its soda, the integrity of \u201cUncle Drew\u201d as a film is genuine.\u201cI would say that you \u2014 we \u2014 would be pretty foolish to view this as a two-hour-long commercial,\u201d Mr. Arbetter said. \u201cI think that would not do the brand any good.\u201dJim Miller, an executive vice president of Lionsgate, said: \u201cHonestly, aside from they\u2019re our partners, it has nothing to do with Pepsi. If there wasn\u2019t a great story in there, we wouldn\u2019t have engaged.\u201dThe feature film version is an extended, fleshed-out version of the original commercials. The cast includes the retired N.B.A. players Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, along with appearances by a who\u2019s who of basketball. The movie was shot in a little over a month last year, mostly in Atlanta, with about a week spent in Rucker Park.If the original shorts went out of their way not to blast the Pepsi brand, the movie takes a different tack. The opening credits say the film was made \u201cin association with Pepsi.\u201d The Rucker Park scenes show various iterations of the brand logo surrounding the court. Mr. Kroll\u2019s character, the villainous coach of a rival team, gives a shout-out to Pepsi during an interview with ESPN.Pepsi and Lionsgate declined to reveal the film\u2019s budget or the financial terms of their partnership. Mr. Arbetter would only acknowledge Pepsi\u2019s role in funding the screenplay.As for the film industry, will this unexpected partnership lead to more such deals? Paula Kupfer, a senior vice president at Lionsgate, said to ask her in July \u2014 after the \u201cUncle Drew\u201d premiere. But she did acknowledge an emerging reality: In an era when Netflix and Amazon have become prominent players in content creation, and Facebook and Apple are taking steps to get involved, \u201ca good idea can come from anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Despite the fact that the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 beat analysts expectations of $1.12, Walmart\u2019s stock price was down by more than 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading on Thursday.The company is trying to offer all things to all shoppers as it tries to counter Amazon\u2019s online dominance \u2014 a nice physical store to shop in, an easy-to-use website and fast home delivery.\u201cThis whole converged experience we think is really important,\u201d said Greg Foran, the head of Walmart\u2019s operations in the United States.It is an expensive proposition. For a company with a long history of squeezing expenses from its stores, Walmart\u2019s operating profit is now under pressure, as it makes investments in both e-commerce and in improving its big boxes. Earlier this year, the company raised its starting wage to $11 an hour to better compete for workers in the tightening labor market.Walmart\u2019s deal for Flipkart, one of the largest and riskiest in its history, follows a pattern of purchases over the past 18 months as it expands its footprint beyond box stores.A big question facing Walmart \u2014 and other brick-and-mortar retailers scrambling to build out their online capabilities \u2014 is how much e-commerce sales are cannibalizing transactions that would have otherwise been made in its stores. The extra cost of home delivery cuts into the margins on each sale.With more than 300 million tech-savvy millennials, India is an enticing market for Walmart. But the push into India is also fraught with risks, given the country\u2019s problematic infrastructure and the reality that much of the population can barely afford basic necessities.Closer to home, Walmart is also trying to reach younger, urban and more affluent online shoppers, who have long been more of Amazon\u2019s core customer base than Walmart\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Fatal Uber Crash, a Self-Driving Start-Up Moves Forward", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRISCO, Tex. \u2014 On Monday, an orange and blue car with the words \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle\u201d prominently displayed on both sides drove itself through the streets of this rapidly growing city north of Dallas, navigating across four lanes of traffic and around a traffic circle.The car, operated by the Silicon Valley start-up Drive.ai, will eventually become part of a fleet of autonomous taxis that will ferry locals along a predetermined route between the Dallas Cowboys facility in Frisco and two other office, retail and apartment complexes.But Drive.ai\u2019s announcement that it will officially begin its taxi service in July showed that the industry is starting to get back on track.Tarin Ziyaee, until recently the chief technology officer of the self-driving start-up Voyage, said he hoped the Uber crash would push companies to openly discuss the powerful but still limited technologies inside their test cars.\u201cWe need to talk about the nitty-gritty \u2014 what these systems are really doing and where their weaknesses are,\u201d said Mr. Ziyaee, who also worked on autonomous systems at Apple. \u201cThese companies are putting secrecy over safety. That has to change. The public deserves to know how things work.\u201dMr. Ng said the Uber crash had not affected Drive.ai\u2019s rollout plans. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on the path forward,\u201d he said.Drive.ai was founded in 2015 by Mr. Ng\u2019s wife, Carol Reiley, a roboticist, and several students who worked in a Stanford University A.I. lab overseen by Mr. Ng. The start-up specializes in a rapidly progressing type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which allows systems to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data.Venture capital firms including New Enterprise Associates have since invested in the start-up. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Drive.ai has raised $77 million and has more than 100 employees.When Drive.ai\u2019s free, daytime-only service begins this summer, it will be open to 10,000 people who live or work in the area. The cars will travel along a few miles of road where the speed limit does not exceed 45 miles an hour, with passengers being picked up and dropped off at only a few specific locations.Backup drivers will be behind the wheel, taking control when needed. But as the program expands, Drive.ai plans on moving drivers into the passenger seat and out of the cars entirely by the end of the year.Because the cars are equipped with sensors that gather information about their surroundings by sending out pulses of light \u2014 as well as radar and an array of cameras \u2014 the cars could potentially operate at night as well. But the start-up decided to keep a tight rein on its service before gradually expanding the route and exposing the cars to new conditions. Drive.ai said it would suspend operations during a downpour and in the rare event of snow.There will still be situations where the cars are slow to make decisions on their own \u2014 in the face of extremely heavy traffic, for instance \u2014 but remote technicians employed by Drive.ai will send help to the cars over the internet. The cars will include connections to three separate cellular networks.Drive.ai said it was working closely with Frisco officials. The city of 175,000 can keep the company abreast of construction zones and other road changes, Mr. Ng said, and signs identifying the area where the cars will drive have been installed.Thomas Bamonte, a senior program manager for automated vehicles with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which handles planning for Dallas and surrounding areas, said such work would become increasingly important as the metropolitan area added roughly a million new people every 10 years.\u201cWe want to invest in new technology rather than the physical expansion of roadways,\u201d he said.Asked if the Uber crash gave him pause, he said state law allowed companies like Drive.ai to operate without interference from local governments. The companies, he said, must be cautious.Noah Marshall, a financial analyst with Jamba Juice, which is based in Frisco, said the new autonomous taxi service would be a \u201cgreat thing\u201d for the town. His office is along Drive.ai\u2019s route, and he said he hoped to try the service.Other Frisco residents were warier.\u201cThis might be a good idea, but there is so much traffic here, and Texans aren\u2019t very patient,\u201d said Mark Mulch, a local real estate agent. Referring to one Arizona city where self-driving cars are being tested, he added: \u201cScottsdale is laid back. But Dallas is too fast.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters Block Google Buses in San Francisco, Citing \u2018Techsploitation\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They\u2019re back.Anti-Google protesters blocked at least a dozen private buses for tech industry workers on Thursday morning in their first significant demonstration here in several years.About 15 activists clad in white Tyvek coveralls dumped scooters in front of the buses at an intersection in the Mission District, a formerly low-income, mostly Latino neighborhood whose rents are now punishing.The scooters, owned by tech start-ups who see the ride-sharing company Uber as a role model, have become the latest flash point in the simmering anger against the tech industry in its hometown. The scooter companies want to use the sidewalks as a place to store their vehicles until the next customer comes along.To the activists, privileging the scooters over the homeless is another example of what they call \u201ctechsploitation.\u201d \u201cSweep tech not tents,\u201d was one of the rallying cries of the blockade. Another sign: \u201cThey call it \u2018Disruption.\u2019 We call it displacement.\u201dThe protests were generally small and nonviolent, although when the actions spread to Oakland a tire was slashed and a window broken. An episode in which a demonstrator vomited onto the windshield of a Yahoo bus in Oakland quickly entered the annals of famous Bay Area moments of street protest.On Thursday, someone sprayed a vulgar message on the side of one bus but otherwise the mood was largely respectful and inclusive. Aside from the buses, traffic continued to flow through the intersection. A microphone was passed around and people from the community spoke briefly.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lives and we don\u2019t got nowhere to go,\u201d one young man said. Another, addressing the workers in the buses, said, \u201cEach one of you has taken the space away from someone who belongs here.\u201d A third said the tech industry wanted \u201cmore money out of each square inch, and people are pushed out the sides.\u201dSome of the workers got off the buses and left. Others filmed the action on their phones. A half-dozen of the buses were Google\u2019s. At least one was for employees at YouTube, a division of Google. Other buses belonged to Facebook.Gina Scigliano, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was a good corporate citizen.\u201cGoogle has contributed over $250 million to the Bay Area in the areas of homelessness, economic opportunity and education,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAnd since 2014, specific to San Francisco, we have given $63 million to these causes.\u201dFacebook declined to comment.The blockade was not publicized beforehand, so only a handful of people were present. After an hour, there was a prayer and the blowing of a conch. The action disbanded, the scooters went back to the sidewalk and the buses were able to move on.Advertisement"}

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.- Peter EavisThe governing coalition\u2019s majority in the upper one \u2014 the Senate \u2014 is slim: six votes. In the course of a sharp increase in borrowing costs triggered by an irresponsible budget (or its anticipation), that majority may well erode quickly.But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.- Peter EavisUltimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:\u201cProtecting the privacy of customers has always been a top priority for Amazon. The Alexa privacy settings give customers insight and control over their data; they can use it to easily manage and delete their audio recordings, configure third-party skill permissions, and opt-out of having their voice data used to develop new Alexa features.\u201dSo, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeIt\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said.The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update. The recall includes 15 Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram models from six model years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds of Apps Can Empower Stalkers to Track Their Victims", "Date": "2018-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKidGuard is a phone app that markets itself as a tool for keeping tabs on children. But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like \u201cHow to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover\u2019s Phone.\u201dA similar app, mSpy, offered advice to a woman on secretly monitoring her husband. Still another, Spyzie, ran ads on Google alongside results for search terms like \u201ccatch cheating girlfriend iPhone.\u201dAs digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent.Digital monitoring of a spouse or partner can constitute illegal stalking, wiretapping or hacking. But laws and law enforcement have struggled to keep up with technological changes, even though stalking is a top warning sign for attempted homicide in domestic violence cases.Statistics on electronic stalking are hard to find because victims may not know they are being watched, or they may not report it. Even if they believe they are being tracked, hidden software can make confirmation difficult.According to data published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men in the United States at some point endure stalking or sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner that has significant effects. While comprehensive numbers aren\u2019t available on domestic abuse cases involving digital stalking in the United States, a small survey published in Australia in 2016 found that 17 percent of victims were tracked via GPS, including through such apps.In a Florida case involving abusive surveillance, a man named Luis Toledo installed an app called SMS Tracker on his wife\u2019s phone in 2013 because he suspected she was having an affair. \u201cHe said he was able to see text messages and photos his wife was sending and receiving from others,\u201d Sgt. A. J. Pagliari of the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office recalled.Representatives for SMS Tracker, made by the Dallas-based Gizmoquip, did not respond to requests for comment about the app\u2019s role in the case. A recent review on the Google Play store for SMS Tracker tells potential users: \u201cI would recommend if you think your partner is cheating.\u201dThere is no federal law against location tracking, but such monitoring can violate state laws on stalking. Spying on communications can break statutes on wiretapping or computer crime. And knowingly selling illegal wiretapping tools is a federal crime.But it\u2019s not illegal to sell or use an app for tracking your children or your own phone. And it can be difficult to tell whether the person being surveilled has given consent, because abusers frequently coerce victims into using such apps.In Everson, Wash., for example, Brooks Owen Laughlin is accused of beating his wife and using an app typically used for benign purposes, Find My iPhone, to control her movements.\u201cIf she would turn it off, he would instantly call her or text her and say, \u2018Why did you turn that off? What are you doing?\u2019 That was pretty much 24-7,\u201d Chief Daniel MacPhee of the Everson Police Department, said in an interview. Mr. Laughlin pleaded not guilty in April to charges of assault, harassment and stalking.Such technical and legal ambiguity has created an environment in which tools are marketed for both legal and illegal uses, without apparent repercussion.\u201cThere are definitely app makers that are complicit, seeking out these customers and advertising this use,\u201d said Periwinkle Doerfler, a doctoral student at New York University and an author of the study on apps, which will be presented in the coming days. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit under the radar about it, but they\u2019re still doing it.\u201dThe researchers, from N.Y.U., Cornell University and Cornell Tech, contacted customer support for nine companies with tracking services. The researchers claimed to be women who wanted to secretly track their husbands, and only one company, TeenSafe, refused to assist.KidGuard, the app largely aimed at parents, also bought ads alongside Google results for searches like \u201ccatch cheating spouse app.\u201d A spokesman for the business, based in Los Angeles, said in an email that the company worked with third-party marketers and customer service reps who had been \u201ctesting new strategies.\u201d It deleted blog posts about tracking romantic partners and said it did not support that activity.Spyzie, another app that ran such ads, did not respond to requests for comment.On YouTube, dozens of videos provide tutorials on using several of the apps to catch cheating lovers. The videos frequently link back to the app makers\u2019 sites using a special code that ensures the promoter will get a cut of the sale \u2014 a type of deal known as affiliate marketing.Affiliate marketing also appeared on multiple websites that discussed using surveillance apps to track romantic partners. One site, spyblog.ml, had posts about spying on \u201cloved ones\u201d and linked to mSpy. The app company said that its terms of service prohibited illegal activity and that it would block the site from its affiliate program.Reviews and online discussions about the apps suggest the market for spying on spouses has been important to the businesses. FlexiSPY, an app company, posted survey results on its site showing that 52 percent of potential customers were interested because they thought their partners might be cheating. Asked about the results, the company said the data was five years old and \u201cno longer relevant.\u201dThe proliferation of such tracking apps raises questions about the role of businesses like Google and Apple in policing their services.The two companies, which run nearly all smartphones in the United States, have long taken different approaches to regulating apps.Apple makes it difficult for iPhone users to download apps from outside the company\u2019s App Store, and has many restrictions on what apps in its store can do. After testing several programs available in the stores on both platforms, the researchers found that Apple\u2019s strict rules resulted in more limited surveillance capabilities on those apps than those running Google\u2019s software.Many App Store apps offered location tracking for phones. But for more intrusive surveillance, spying companies had to work around Apple\u2019s restrictions by using the victim\u2019s name and password to get data. To combat misuse by predators, an Apple spokesman said, the company urges people to use a tool called two-factor authentication to help protect their accounts even if their passwords are stolen.Google prides itself on being more open. Its smartphone software, Android, allows people to install apps from anywhere, and the most invasive ones were found outside the company\u2019s app store, Play.The researchers found two apps in the Google Play store that allowed the app icon to be hidden from victims and the camera to run without notifications, as well as a handful of others that tracked users\u2019 locations without telling them, all apparent violations of Google\u2019s rules.\u201cThey\u2019re not enforcing their own policies,\u201d Ms. Doerfler, the N.Y.U. researcher, said. \u201cIf someone reports it then they\u2019ll take it down, but it\u2019s not something they are checking within their operating system.\u201dIn response to the researchers\u2019 findings, Google tightened several policies \u201cto further restrict the promotion and distribution\u201d of surveillance apps, a company spokesman said. The company provides funding to the N.Y.U. team that helped conduct the study.Google removed many spying and tracking apps and blocked advertising on search results about spying on spouses and romantic partners. YouTube, owned by Google, took down some videos about spying services, although the company determined that others didn\u2019t violate its policies because the services could be used with consent.Many law enforcement agencies don\u2019t have the computer skills to quickly help survivors, or they don\u2019t devote forensic resources to domestic abuse and stalking cases, which in many states are misdemeanors.One sheriff\u2019s department, in Dakota County, Minn., is trying to tackle the problem of abusive digital surveillance, and has used Justice Department grants to hire a forensic specialist for the task.The sheriff, Tim Leslie, said that from 2015 to 2017, the department went to court in 198 cases involving technology and stalking or domestic abuse, on par with earlier years. Its conviction rate rose to 94 percent from 50 percent, with many more suspects pleading guilty instead of contesting the charges, he said.In one case, the specialist analyzed a woman\u2019s phone and found it had a program on it called Mobile Spy, bought using her then-husband\u2019s email address. The specialist could see that it had been launched 122 times. The effect of the stalking was \u201cprofound,\u201d the woman said.Even though it had been more than a year since the app was last used, the man was charged with misdemeanor stalking and pleaded guilty in 2015.\u201cWe go after the misdemeanor stuff pretty hard, in the theory that if you stop that, it doesn\u2019t escalate,\u201d Sheriff Leslie said.Federal cases involving such spying are rare. The Justice Department in 2014 charged the maker of a spying program called StealthGenie under a wiretap law that prohibits advertising and selling a device for \u201csurreptitious interception.\u201d The developer paid a $500,000 fine, shut down StealthGenie and was sentenced to time served.Victims\u2019 advocates said they noticed after the case that makers of surveillance tools changed their tactics, sometimes moving computer servers overseas or scrubbing explicit language about spousal spying from their websites. \u201cAs soon as these companies caught wind that they shouldn\u2019t be doing it, they just changed their marketing,\u201d Ms. Olsen said.One app maker told The Times that he hired a legal team after the StealthGenie case to help him avoid running afoul of the law. \u201cThere were a few modifications we had to make,\u201d said Patrick Hinchy, the founder of New York-based ILF Mobile Apps, which makes Highster Mobile and other services. Several apps, he said, removed call recording and delayed the availability of the data by 10 to 15 minutes. Mr. Hinchy said the company only provided assistance to customers that it believed was legal.When a researcher recently contacted the company and asked, \u201cIf I use this app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?\u201d the representative responded: \u201cOur software is undetectable from the home screen.\u201dThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is 1\u2212800\u2212799\u22127233.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s Antitrust Enforcer", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 At first blush, Margrethe Vestager\u2019s decision to investigate Apple\u2019s planned acquisition of the music-identification app Shazam seems fairly minor, at least by her standards. As Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, Ms. Vestager is known for aggressively pursuing big cases against Silicon Valley giants, and the Shazam deal is a smallish one, by most estimates valued at far less than $1 billion.\u201cWe\u2019re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data \u2014 how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in an interview. \u201cWhat will happen when the data that Apple holds combines with the data from Shazam?\u201dWhile Ms. Vestager\u2019s global influence is ascendant, her political fate is murky. She has made it clear that she would like a second term as competition commissioner, but there is no guarantee that the Danish government will reappoint her to the commission next year. In fact, the new prime minister, who comes from a rival party, has said he will not do so.Her appeal partly speaks to a populist impulse from the political left, a David-versus-Goliath belief that it is high time someone stood up to giant corporations, particularly those that exert so much power. But not everyone views her as a heroic regulatory warrior.Critics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.For the moment, the attention is on data privacy, and whether it is possible to regulate how technology companies share and profit from users\u2019 personal information.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating about her role is that in her mind, the new antitrust is about data, not about market power,\u201d said Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley executive and now a general partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.He added: \u201cI believe the European approach is more appropriate than the U.S. laissez-faire approach. The U.S. economy sort of lives or dies by the notion of free markets, and I think what we\u2019re seeing is a perversion of free market economics that is very difficult to counter without regulation.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s what my generation looks for in a politician,\u201d said Corina Stoenescu, a Harvard Business School student who helped organize a conference in March where Ms. Vestager was the keynote speaker. She added: \u201cThe moment tech giants come into question, then Vestager comes into question. She\u2019s the only person on the planet who has a voice about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good if we can inspire each other globally,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a recent interview in Copenhagen.She was juggling interviews and preparing for a speech, as a bag of knitting rested nearby. She likes to knit in meetings, and has recently been making elephants, after moving on from socks. (She also sometimes sews her own clothes.)Trained as an economist, she grew up in Glostrup, a suburb of Copenhagen, the daughter of two Lutheran ministers. (She\u2019s not a fan of organized religion, she said, and follows a \u201cBelieve in God, fear the church\u201d philosophy.)She entered politics at 21, joining the tiny centrist Danish Social Liberal Party, which was founded by her great-grandfather. Elected to Parliament in 2001, she rose to become the party\u2019s parliamentary leader six years later \u2014 she was already national chairwoman \u2014 and was blamed as being too young, too boring and female when the Social Liberals lost half their seats in the subsequent election.\u201cShe was very, very young, but if she had been a man, people would not have complained in the same way,\u201d said her biographer, Elisabet Svane.As for the boring part: \u201cShe has a lot of humor, but she is a little boring sometimes,\u201d Ms. Svane said in an interview. \u201cThe party is boring. They are technocrats and teachers, and they always know what is best for society.\u201dMs. Vestager brought in a media consultant, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, who advised her to drop the dull platitudes, simplify her message and stick to her beliefs \u2014 even if they made her unpopular. She rethought how to present herself.\u201cAll of us have multiple selves,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a public figure is not about changing yourself, but maybe bringing out some other side of yourself.\u201d She learned to smile more, she said, \u201cto be more direct, less detailed, not like an economist lecturing.\u201dHer party rebounded in the 2011 elections and joined a three-party governing coalition led by the Social Democrats under Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Appointed to the new post of economics and interior minister, Ms. Vestager pushed through deeply unpopular cuts in retirement and unemployment benefits \u2014 forcing Ms. Thorning-Schmidt to renege on her own campaign promises \u2014 while helping enact more liberal immigration policies.She made a fair share of enemies, among them a group of long-term unemployed workers angry about reductions in their benefits. She still keeps the sculpture they gave her, of a middle-finger-brandishing hand, in her office in Brussels, saying it was \u201ca reminder that you will make mistakes, and people will have a different point of view, and that should be part of your understanding of yourself.\u201dIn 2014, Denmark made her the country\u2019s appointee to the European Commission, and she took charge of the competition portfolio.Ms. Vestager appears to have found that rare thing, a decent work-life balance. (By comparison, the fictional character she and Ms. Thorning-Schmidt are collectively said to have inspired, Birgitte Nyborg, the central figure of the Danish political drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d struggles unsuccessfully to hang onto her marriage.) Ms. Vestager\u2019s husband, Thomas Jensen, a math and philosophy teacher, lives in Copenhagen with their youngest daughter, 15. Their two older daughters are in college.\u201cHere, it\u2019s more the rule than the exception to be a working mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sometimes been asked if I\u2019m a bad mother to my daughters, and I say, \u2018They don\u2019t know any different \u2014 this is the mother they\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d\u201cPower is not something you own,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only something you\u2019re borrowing.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Ben Berke from Boston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Berkshire\u2019s Annual Meeting: Buffett Approves of Apple\u2019s Buyback Plan", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Saturday. Welcome to a special DealBook Briefing of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting.\u2022 What is Berkshire doing to promote gender equality?\u2022 Apple\u2019s buyback plan gets a thumbs up.\u2022 Warren Buffett isn\u2019t backing off his comments about guns and is sticking by Wells Fargo despite the scandals.\u2022 Where does Berkshire\u2019s health care venture with JPMorgan and Amazon stand?\u2022 Is Mr. Buffett now semi-retired?\u2022 Trade \u2018is a win-win situation.\u2019Asked what Berkshire Hathaway was doing to promote gender equality, Warren Buffett said Berkshire\u2019s recent choices of chief executives to run its businesses reflected fairness. \u201cBefore we made this management change, I probably named only six or seven C.E.O.s in the last five or six years. I would say that half of them that I\u2019ve named have been women,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\u201cI feel very good about the decisions we\u2019ve made about our C.E.O.s,\u201d he added.He did not answer whether Berkshire would push for gender equality on the boards of the companies that Berkshire is invested in.Mr. Buffett also said it was clear that women had been treated unfairly in the past.\u201cI have two sisters who are absolutely as smart as I am, and they have better personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t remotely have the same opportunities as I had.\u201dMr. Buffett said there was still a \u201cpipeline problem\u201d in corporate America, making it hard to find as many qualified women to lead companies.But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t use that excuse forever.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterBerkshire is quickly building its stake in Apple.Since Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the stake has grown into Berkshire\u2019s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.So what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201dCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Given Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.Mr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.Here\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201dAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201dHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.The discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:Warren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.Mr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.But his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201dThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.Mr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201dMr. Munger then added:\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201dOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.Berkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.In response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201dMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterThe question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has been a thread through many of the exchanges with shareholders.\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201dHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201dCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201dAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.The shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen GrocerThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.Warren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.But just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.Mr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201dCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\u2014 Emily FlitterThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.So it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d\u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201dSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.In the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.Given the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.Berkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\u2022 What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? \u2014 Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\u2022 What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this?Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\u2022 What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? \u2014 Jason Lu, Shanghai\u2022 Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? \u2014 Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\u2022 He\u2019s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? \u2014 Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\u2022 How long he plans on doing this. \u2014Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\u2014 Elisa Mala(As Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting has grown over the years, it has become a three-day event. Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)Shareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.What was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.Investors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth). There were Justin cowboy boots embroidered with the words \u201cBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Shareholders Meeting\u201d and guests had the option to \u201cPut yourself in Warren Buffett\u2019s boots,\u201d as the marketing materials suggest, and purchase a style that had been owned by the man himself.Jim Van Fossen, a retired financial planner, bought matching Berkshire Hathaway boxers for himself and his son, Conner Van Fossen. In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders\u2019 meeting.Of course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses. See\u2019s Candies displayed Scotch Kiss confections \u201cmade by Warren,\u201d and one staff member\u2019s uniform bore Mr. Buffett\u2019s autograph.The most photographed autograph was at the Benjamin Moore paint booth, where Mr. Buffett had signed his name in permanent marker next to a wall-size mural of his face. All day long, revelers followed suit, decorating the wall with their own signatures in dry-erase ink, and snapping selfies to preserve the memory.\u2014 Elisa Malahealth carepriceyear endAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut, and who doesn\u2019t, are accurate, a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback.To be fair, the notion that a big tax cut for corporations \u2014 which was the main element of last year\u2019s law \u2014 might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn\u2019t crazy. But the two key words here are \u201cmight\u201d and \u201ceventually.\u201dThe story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations, Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity, driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages.But what does \u201cbringing money to America\u201d mean? Apple didn\u2019t have a huge, Scrooge McDuck-style pile of gold sitting in Ireland, which it loaded onto a homeward-bound ship. It has digital claims \u2014 a bunch of zeros and ones on some server somewhere \u2014 which in effect used to bear a label saying \u201cthis money is in Ireland.\u201d Now it has changed the label to say \u201cthis money is in America.\u201d What difference does this make?Well, it alters the company\u2019s tax liabilities to the U.S. and Irish governments, which was the point of the change. But otherwise it makes no difference at all.But why aren\u2019t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers?One answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run, it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn\u2019t as global as all that \u2014 the investment world, we might say, is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy, and even in the long run it can\u2019t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return \u2014 which means more for stockholders and less for workers.And at a deeper level, tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from.Apple, however, is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position \u2014 its brand, if you like. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist; what matters is that given its position, it can and does charge what the market will bear, pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes, it gets to keep more of its profits, but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by, say, building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks.And these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it; there are still businesses \u2014 say, trucking companies \u2014 whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic \u201crents,\u201d profits not tied to physical capital, are a big, growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents, there\u2019s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty, even in the long run.The bottom line \u2014 which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise \u2014 is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is, in fact, a big giveaway to wealthy investors.Advertisement"}

That capped a remarkable 10-month run for the cryptocurrency, which traded below $1,150 on Feb. 22, 2017.Since mid-December, the price of bitcoin has retreated. It bottomed out below $6,000 in early February and is currently down more 50 percent from its high.The researchers write:\u201cThe advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.\u201d\u201cThis one-sided speculative demand came to an end when the futures for bitcoin started trading on the CME on December 17. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) had opened a futures market a week earlier on December 10, trading was thin until the CME joined the market. Indeed, the average daily trading volume the month after the CME issued futures was approximately six times larger than when only the CBOE offered these derivatives.\u201dShares of Apple have risen nearly 16 percent, including a 1.9 percent gain on Monday, the past six sessions.

Given Athenahealth\u2019s potential, this reality is deeply frustrating, but the fact remains that Athenahealth as a public company has not made the changes necessary to enable it to grow as it should and to create the kind of value its shareholders deserve.\u201dElliott said it approached Athenahealth about the company going private in November.Citigroup has a market value of $175 billion, so ValueAct owns about 0.7 percent of Citigroup.\u201cThe letter doesn\u2019t call for any significant strategic changes, though it does suggest the bank could increase its plan to return cash to shareholders to about $50 billion from $40 billion,\u201d The WSJ reports, citing ValueAct\u2019s letter to its investors.Saturday was the day for the \u201cWoodstock of capitalism\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting, and a celebration of Warren Buffett \u2014 and Andrew joined shareholders, analysts and other journalists seeking to ask the Oracle of Omaha about virtually anything.Andrew has more from the meeting: Shareholders applauded a question \u2014 which they rarely do \u2014 that was critical of Berkshire\u2019s ownership of Wells Fargo. And Mr. Buffett\u2019s response to a gun question and a critique of Elon Musk caused lots of chatter.\u2022 Mr. Buffett is sticking with Wells Fargo despite its current troubles, and said that its current C.E.O., Tim Sloan, \u201cis correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201d\u2022 He loves Apple \u2014 but wants the company, of which Berkshire owns about 5 percent, to keep buying back shares.

He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions.

{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday. Walmart is on board.He didn\u2019t join the White House.

Apple Pay is a key part of that strategy but adoption has fallen short of expectations since it was started four years ago, The WSJ reports. For Goldman\u2019s part, the Wall Street firm has pushed increasingly into consumer banking to offset slowing revenue from trading and investment banking. The Apple Pay card will be the first credit card issued by Goldman.Sturm Ruger\u2019s C.E.O., Christopher Kilroy, played down the significance of the move, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s it, a report.\u201d And a former N.R.A. executive, Sandra Froman, won re-election to the board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Telegram App Says Apple Is Blocking Updates Over Dispute With Russia", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple was thrust into the middle of a long-simmering dispute on Thursday between the encrypted messaging app Telegram and the Russian government, which has sought to shut down the service since it declined to help Moscow intercept communications sent through its platform.\u201cUnfortunately, Apple didn\u2019t side with us,\u201d he continued.An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Durov\u2019s statement.The situation highlights the messy gatekeeper role that Apple plays, with its App Store acting as the main way people can download apps, along with Google\u2019s Play store. Apple finds itself caught between the interests of encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal, which want to prevent anybody from intercepting communications between users, and governments, which want access to messages to identify security risks and other issues.The Russian authorities have repeatedly said Telegram is a threat, claiming that extremists use it to coordinate their efforts. Russian human rights activists and many otherwise apolitical users, however, saw the move as an attempt by the Kremlin to curtail freedoms and as only the first step in a broader plan to introduce online censorship.So far, the attempts to shut Telegram down have been clumsy, with the app remaining available on many devices in Russia, including some that began to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to hide their geographic location from authorities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PepsiCo to Acquire the Fruit and Veggie Snack Maker Bare Foods", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContinuing to bet that consumers want to crunch on healthier snack items, the food and beverage giant PepsiCo announced Friday that it was acquiring Bare Foods, a maker of baked fruit and vegetable snacks.For PepsiCo, which did not make public the financial terms of the deal, the purchase of a company that makes products like salt-and-vinegar beet chips and Granny Smith apple chips is its latest effort to diversify its food and beverage portfolio and move toward the more natural, less-processed foods that are now in favor by an increasingly health-conscious public.The acquisition was one in a string of purchases of healthy snack-food companies by large conglomerates.In the past four years, snack sales in the United States have jumped more than 12 percent to $145 billion, according to Nielsen Retail Measurement Services. A large portion of that growth has come from consumers seeking out healthy snacks or those that are organic or have so-called clean labels \u2014 no artificial flavors, colors, preservatives or sweeteners. Sales of nuts, trail mix, and organic savory snacks in the United States jumped to nearly $9 billion last year from $7.8 billion in 2012, according to Euromonitor International.As consumers\u2019 appetite for healthy snacks has grown, so has the number of products fighting for a spot in their cabinets. In 2017, a study by Nielsen showed thousands of small manufacturers collectively held 60 percent of the fast-growing clean-label market.That competition poses a challenge for PepsiCo and other food and beverage conglomerates looking to acquire small manufacturers: picking which healthy snacks will stick around for years or even decades and which ones will wind up being just a fad.\u201cAbout eight or 10 years ago, you had a lot of small companies come into the world of snacking,\u201d Mr. Sankaran said. \u201cMany of them didn\u2019t stick. Consumers tend to be fickle and try lots of different things. If something isn\u2019t a powerful concept, it doesn\u2019t last.\u201dBare Foods was founded in 2001 by a farming family in Washington that was searching for a way to extend the consumer life of its organic apples. Its founder, Eric Strandberg, partnered with a friend and began slicing and baking the apples. They began offering the baked snacks at Pike Place Market in Seattle and soon discovered they had a hit.The current chief executive, Santosh Padki, was brought on a couple of years ago to help oversee the company\u2019s expansion.Today, Bare Snacks are sold across the country in grocery store chains as well as Whole Foods and Target, with Walmart scheduled to come on board soon, Mr. Padki said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Silicon Valley Must Go to War", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Kirchhoff helped lead a Pentagon group that integrates technology from startups into military missions.Should technologists prevent their tools from being used to wage war?Other critics of Silicon Valley-Pentagon partnerships have made a different argument: not that collaboration risks compromising Silicon Valley values, but that contact with the military\u2019s inefficient processes would contaminate the fast-moving culture of Silicon Valley.Both arguments misunderstand the nature of technology and the military\u2019s role in accelerating the commercial ascendancy of the United States. A closer relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon is good for industry and for national security \u2014 as well as for the debate we as American citizens must have about how technology is used, especially in war.Google\u2019s engineers should be applauded for raising questions about how the machine-learning algorithms they invented are employed in Project Maven. Their aspiration that Google never \u201cbuild warfare technology\u201d or \u201coutsource the moral responsibility\u201d for using technology is a noble goal. It would be morally convenient if technology for war could be cleaved so cleanly from technology for everything else. But it can\u2019t be.Silicon Valley is already at war in the sense that the broad classes of technology it invents for search, storage and pattern recognition have inherent military uses. The same machine-learning algorithms developed to categorize images on the internet can be used to identity terrorist activity. Technology circulates between government and industry, between times of peace and war, in ways no corporate policy can turn on or off.Engineers in Silicon Valley are learning what students of history have long known: Technology often springs forth in unforeseen ways, wreaking havoc in some cases and providing salvation in others. Those who uncork the proverbial genie cannot control its future by decree.But all hope for accountability is not lost. The controversy over Project Maven is teaching us an important civics lesson about who governs technology. Google exists in a democracy whose elected representatives ultimately decide whether to use force and through what means. The best way to influence how the United States fights wars is not through company policy; it is by the ballot box.Because the United States military is a product of our democracy, it aims to fight with precision and a focus on limiting harm to innocent civilians \u2014 to a far greater extent than is the case with other, less democratic major powers. The technology behind Project Maven promises to reduce collateral damage still further, making any decision by Google to withhold it morally complex.Since 2015, the Pentagon\u2019s engagement with Silicon Valley has been conducted through a group called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, which I helped lead from 2016 until last year, that integrates technology from start-ups into military missions. The group arose not from the paranoid war room of \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d but rather from the more prosaic reality that most innovation today \u2014 unlike that of two generations ago \u2014 takes place in the commercial sector, not government labs.Apple and Google each have a market capitalization twice as large as that of the entire United States defense industry. The only way the military can continue protecting our nation and preserving the relative peace the world has enjoyed since World War II is by integrating the newest technology into its systems. Denying the military access to this technology would over time cripple it, which would be calamitous for the nation and the world.A partnership with the Pentagon is also in companies\u2019 interest. Working on important, tough military problems helps refine their products, improving the global competitiveness of American industry. Even beyond the usual incentives created by federal research and development, which helped spur innovations like Siri and the internet, there is value to the industry in having access to the military\u2019s operational testing and unique data sets.The debate at Google is vital and timely. Engineers everywhere should closely follow how the military uses new classes of technology and object if those uses violate our values. But if the goal of Silicon Valley technologists is to wall themselves off from the Pentagon\u2019s most pressing needs, they must concede that this will hurt both our security and industrial strength.Moving past the current debate requires all sides to focus on the values we hold in common. Those in uniform working to protect the nation from a threatening world are just as worried by how novel technologies could be misused as the engineers who create them.They also hold dear a motto of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201d Their commitment to this ideal goes beyond a corporate code of conduct. It begins with an oath to uphold the Constitution and a duty that may require the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our form of self-government. That is a powerful basis for shared concern about the new technologies that will ineluctably figure in peace and in war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CBS Tries to Sell Its TV Dramas as Its Own Battle Heats Up in Court", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen he took the stage at Carnegie Hall during CBS\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers on Wednesday, Stephen Colbert did not shy away from the topic on the minds of everyone in the audience.\u201cOf course, this year, CBS has the most exciting legal dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso \u2014 some great TV shows.\u201dNot long before the host of CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d appeared onstage, a court chancellor in Delaware offered a ruling on the legal battle between the network and its corporate parent, National Amusements, one that has ensnared the longtime CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves, and his boss, Shari Redstone, the daughter of the ailing 94-year-old entertainment mogul Sumner M. Redstone.But if executives at CBS and National Amusements believed they would come away from the hastily called hearing with clear answers on which party was in the right, they were sadly mistaken.The Delaware judge effectively declared a cease-fire in the war between the network and its controlling shareholder, Ms. Redstone. The ruling from the bench \u2014 in effect, the judicial version of buying time \u2014 followed a flurry of legal volleys by each side concerning the fate of CBS, which Ms. Redstone hopes to merge with its fellow National Amusements media company, Viacom.CBS had been resisting the attempt by Ms. Redstone to orchestrate the merger. But what had been a cold war started to burn hot on Monday, when a lawyer representing the network and its key board members filed a lawsuit against National Amusements and Ms. Redstone, seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent her from interfering with a special meeting of the CBS board scheduled for Thursday.The board planned to vote on a special stock dividend that would drastically water down the Redstone family\u2019s voting stake at CBS to 17 percent from 79 percent \u2014 a move that would give Mr. Moonves more freedom to reject a merger with Viacom. In its lawsuit, CBS claimed that Ms. Redstone would seek to prevent the meeting and perhaps even replace the members of the board with her allies \u2014 something Ms. Redstone, the vice chairwoman of CBS, has denied.\u201cN.A.I. does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS board or taking other action to force a merger,\u201d lawyers for National Amusements said in a filing on Wednesday.Chancellor Andre G. Bouchard of Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery put a temporary halt to the legal wrangling in his decision. Technically, he granted CBS\u2019s request for the temporary restraining order, but with modifications. The judge is expected to issue a more expansive ruling on Thursday concerning whether the result of the CBS board\u2019s planned vote will be allowed to go into effect.Less than an hour before the hearing, Ms. Redstone, 64, issued a change to the CBS bylaws that would grant her more control of the network\u2019s board. That change, too, is now delayed: The judge said that he would issue his legal opinion on Ms. Redstone\u2019s change to the bylaws in his decision on Thursday.The hearing in Delaware took place on a day when CBS was making its annual presentation to advertisers at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Moonves was absent from a press breakfast in New York on Wednesday morning, during which the network unveiled its fall lineup. It was the first time in 22 years that he had been a no-show at the morning gathering of reporters and CBS executives.\u201cLeslie sends his regrets,\u201d Kelly Kahl, the president of CBS\u2019s entertainment division, told the group of reporters.Given the corporate intrigue surrounding the network, Mr. Kahl added that the number of questions he could not answer far exceeded the number of questions he could.At 4:15 p.m., moments after the judge issued the decision to delay the legal battle, Mr. Moonves, 68, took the Carnegie Hall stage to huge roars from the advertisers, who were all too aware of the tensions between one of the industry\u2019s most successful executives and his boss.\u201cGood afternoon, everybody,\u201d Mr. Moonves began.More roars rained down on the stage, before the ad buyers in the room rose from their seats in a standing ovation, a rarity at the annual upfront presentations.Big laughs followed.\u201cAnyway,\u201d he added, \u201cfor years I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m only out here for a few minutes \u2014 and this year, perhaps for the first time, I actually mean it.\u201dThe latest attempt by Ms. Redstone to merge CBS and Viacom started innocently enough, or so it seemed. On Feb. 1, the two companies jointly announced that they would \u201cevaluate a potential combination,\u201d reigniting talks that had fizzled a year earlier.The plan seemed to make sense. In the past year, the Walt Disney Company has agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox in a deal that would form an entertainment colossus for the age of streaming, and AT&T is pursuing an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. At the same time, traditional media companies are contending with technology companies like Apple and Facebook that have moved into the entertainment business. And CBS and Viacom had coexisted, in relative peace, as a united company within National Amusements from 2000 to 2006.Cut to little more than three months later: CBS and National Amusements were tussling as lawyers working under the direction of their headstrong leaders filed motions against each other. With the legal decision that is expected to be issued on Thursday, Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves are very likely to have a clearer idea of what the future holds for them and their companies.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s important to keep in mind that Duplex is just an experiment, and it may never be released publicly in its current form.But the demo \u2014 which amounted to a series of extremely high-tech crank calls \u2014 raised a lot of hackles.In a statement, a Google representative said: \u201cWhat we showed at I/O was an early technology demo, and we look forward to incorporating feedback as we develop this into a product.\u201dEven some A.I. experts were taken aback by the Duplex demo, which showed off a kind of technology that scammers could one day use to make mass robocalls, conduct social engineering hacks and impersonate people on the phone. Google has said that the technology won\u2019t be used for telemarketing. The company says it will be used to call businesses using publicly available numbers to gather information like a store\u2019s hours. But it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see how this kind of technology could be used for all kinds of questionable or dangerous tasks. And there\u2019s an obvious ethical question of whether a robot caller should be required to identify itself as a nonhuman.\u201cI don\u2019t think the main goal of A.I. should be to mimic humans,\u201d he said.Defenders of Google\u2019s Duplex experiment have pointed out that an automated phone call service could be helpful for people with disabilities, or for freeing people from annoying customer service slogs. (\u201cO.K. Google, cancel my cable subscription.\u201d) But Google is now in a precarious position. It wants to keep pushing its A.I. development forward, but it needs to do so in ways that won\u2019t scare people at a time when distrust of the tech industry is growing by the day.\u201cOften we\u2019ll see tech that is scary,\u201d Mr. Nanjiani wrote. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll bring up our concerns to them. We are realizing that ZERO consideration seems to be given to the ethical implications of tech. They don\u2019t even have a pat rehearsed answer. They are shocked at being asked. Which means nobody is asking those questions.\u201dMaybe Google should have invited a few more actors to their prelaunch product meetings.Some other tech stories I found interesting this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Alexa Listening? Amazon Echo Sent Out Recording of Couple\u2019s Conversation", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey\u2019re always listening. They\u2019re on the internet. But what happens when digital assistants like Alexa go rogue? Could they share our private conversations without our consent? Privacy advocates have long warned this could happen, and now it has.Skeptics were quick to say we told you so, as the news rocketed through the connected world.Now, Amazon says it knows what happened: As the woman, identified only as Danielle, chatted away with her husband, the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Alexa, mistakenly heard a series of requests and commands to send the recording as a voice message to one of the husband\u2019s employees.\u201cEcho woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like \u2018Alexa,\u2019\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cThen, the subsequent conversation was heard as a \u2018send message\u2019 request. At which point, Alexa said out loud \u2018To whom?\u2019 At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer\u2019s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, \u2018[contact name], right?\u2019 Alexa then interpreted background conversation as \u2018right\u2019. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\u201dIn a follow-up interview, though, Danielle told KIRO7 that the Echo that shared her conversation was right next to her at the time with the volume set to seven out of 10. It never requested her permission to send the audio, she said.The family had several Echoes in their home, using them to control the heat, lights and security system. But, two weeks ago, Danielle\u2019s husband received a call from the employee in Seattle, who reported receiving audio of their conversation.\u201cAt first, my husband was like, \u2018No, you didn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Danielle told KIRO7. \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018You sat there talking about hardwood floors.\u2019 And we said, \u2018Oh gosh, you really did!\u2019\u201dThe family disconnected the devices and contacted Amazon, prompting an investigation. Now, Danielle is asking for a refund.\u201cI\u2019m never plugging that device in again,\u201d she told KIRO7. \u201cI can\u2019t trust it.\u201dThe news was met with a mix of alarm and humor on social media.Amazon\u2019s main home assistant devices \u2014 the Echo, Echo Plus and Echo Dot \u2014 are each equipped with seven microphones and noise-canceling technology. Amazon and Google are the leading sellers of such devices.The assistant, the company said, had \u201cin rare circumstances\u201d mistakenly heard \u201cAlexa, laugh.\u201d As a result, Amazon changed the phrase for that command to \u201cAlexa, can you laugh?\u201d and had the device verbally acknowledge such requests.This month, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a published paper that they had proved that the technology could be exploited, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s Only One Warren Buffett", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Berkshire Hathaway C.E.O.\u2019s three-day extravaganza \u2014 er, shareholders\u2019 conference \u2014 drew tens of thousands of fans to Omaha.OMAHA \u2014 Officially, it\u2019s known as the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting.Unofficially, a handful of nicknames describe the three-day extravaganza that happens in the first weekend of May, in which tens of thousands of people descend upon Omaha to revel in all things Warren Buffett.There\u2019s \u201cBerkyville,\u201d which captures the folksy, small-town tenor of the event. There\u2019s \u201cAGM,\u201d an abbreviation of \u201cAnnual General Meeting,\u201d preferred by the finance crowd. And there\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s personal favorite: \u201cWoodstock for capitalists.\u201dBut the most revealing name is the shortest one: the meeting. Just as some New Yorkers refer to the Big Apple as \u201cthe city,\u201d as if there were only one, scores of attendees consider this shareholders meeting to be in a class of its own.In part, that\u2019s because the atmosphere feels closer to a carnival than a buttoned-up investors\u2019 conference. There are tables of merchandise and costumed mascots, Ping-Pong matches and a movie reel of celebrity-filled skits and spoofs. There is an unofficial circuit of V.I.P. parties and piggyback events. At the center of it all is Mr. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s chief executive, one of the world\u2019s most successful investors and the weekend\u2019s enthusiastic master of ceremonies.For Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Initialized Capital and a former executive chairman of Reddit, the fun began long before he touched down in Nebraska. \u201cThere\u2019s such a range of people, even just from the plane out of Newark to here,\u201d he said. Pointing to his business partner, Garry Tan, he added, \u201cThis guy talked to, uh, well, I don\u2019t want to name drop.\u201d As if on cue, the investor Li Lu walked up to shake Mr. Ohanian\u2019s hand; inches away, John Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, typed away on his laptop. For Mr. Tan, the big names mattered less than the Midwestern sensibilities: \u201cThere is a piece of this that really resonates with us, around being plain-spoken and investing in what you understand,\u201d he said. Revelers line up overnight to get in \u2014 or, in capitalist fashion, hire other people to stand in line for them. This year, many people expressed gratitude for the gentle breezes and sunshine, a welcome reprieve from the torrential rainstorms of past years. A handful of revelers were dressed up in bow ties and silver-glitter heels. Others climbed up poles to snap photos of the crowd.By 7 a.m., attendees were streaming into the arena. Many purchased fluffy pretzels and pink beverages adorned with umbrellas from the concessions stands and settled in to be entertained. A parody of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys\u2019s \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d blasted over the loudspeaker, but the lyrics were changed to: \u201cIn Berkshire, financial strength is where dreams are made of, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do.\u201d Then the \u201cmovie\u201d started rolling.As in previous years, Berkshire Hathaway had created a video reel of skits with celebrities, who ostensibly agree to participate for free. This year Katy Perry was one of about half a dozen big names on the screen, joking about the Left Shark debacle at the Super Bowl in 2015 and comparing the uncoordinated backup dancer to the Oracle of Omaha himself. The right shark, she said, was the one who showed up on time to rehearsal and got none of the credit \u2014 and that was Mr. Buffett\u2019s vice chairman Charlie Munger. The crowd applauded loudly.After the Berkshire Hathaway board was announced and earnings were delivered, the most beloved portion of the show began: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger held a question-and-answer session, taking on topics like global politics and cryptocurrencies. Mr. Buffett dispensed wise advice and spoke with occasional self-effacing charm. Mr. Munger delivered deadpan one-liners that drew raucous laughs, including his comparison of virtual currencies to \u201cturds.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re interested in business, this is the bucket-list event,\u201d said James Weber, the chief executive of Brooks Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s just priceless.\u201d For hard chargers in the financial industry, who are often laser-focused on performance, it\u2019s a reminder that business can be fun. \u201cEvery year that I come personally, I walk away energized,\u201d said Mr. Calkins of Benjamin Moore, who said he has attended the meeting 17 times. Even after the main event was over, there was still plenty of weekend left to enjoy. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t coming here because they\u2019re investing money,\u201d said Conner Van Fossen, an Air Force member who attended the event with his father, Jim Van Fossen, for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s about the spectacle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs and Apple Plan to Offer a New Credit Card", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne company has a devoted customer base teeming with wealthy, well-traveled young adults. The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers.Now they\u2019re trying to join forces.Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing.The product would be Goldman\u2019s first credit card offering and could help the bank\u2019s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant\u2019s digital payment service.The two companies have been talking for months and haven\u2019t settled on all the details, said one of the people.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment.The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come.The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer.\u201cThis seems to make sense,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, \u201cIt\u2019s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer finance business.\u201dPart of Goldman\u2019s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times.Apple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products.Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple\u2019s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don\u2019t yet accept digital payments, the person said.\u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,\u201d said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. \u201cThe Apple Barclays card isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s going to turn that person\u2019s head, in terms of making them want to get a card. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what these two brands can do to create something that might make more of a splash.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gasoline has advantages in energy density, cost, infrastructure and transportability that electricity doesn\u2019t and won\u2019t for decades. The brilliance is Musk\u2019s Trump-like ability to get people to believe in him and his preposterous promises. Tesla without Musk would be Oz without the Wizard.But the Tesla story isn\u2019t just about the perils of misdirected government-led development and clever rent-seeking entrepreneurs. And it isn\u2019t about the virtue signaling of those who like their environmentalist bona fides to come with vegan-friendly upholstery. It\u2019s about hubris and credulity \u2014 the hubris of the few to pretend they know the future and the credulity of the many to follow them there.Donald Trump long ago figured out that truth is whatever he thinks he can get away with, a cynical kind of wisdom he rode all the way to the White House and whose consequences we live with every day. With Musk the consequences are hardly as serious, but the essential pattern is the same. Maybe he\u2019ll next try to sell us on a time machine and promise rides to anyone willing to make a $10,000 deposit. Tesla could surely use the cash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa and Siri Can Hear This Hidden Command. You Can\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "Researchers can now send secret audio instructions undetectable to the human ear to Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant.Supported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Many people have grown accustomed to talking to their smart devices, asking them to read a text, play a song or set an alarm. But someone else might be secretly talking to them, too.A group of students from University of California, Berkeley, and Georgetown University showed in 2016 that they could hide commands in white noise played over loudspeakers and through YouTube videos to get smart devices to turn on airplane mode or open a website.This month, some of those Berkeley researchers published a research paper that went further, saying they could embed commands directly into recordings of music or spoken text. So while a human listener hears someone talking or an orchestra playing, Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker might hear an instruction to add something to your shopping list.\u201cWe wanted to see if we could make it even more stealthy,\u201d said Nicholas Carlini, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in computer security at U.C. Berkeley and one of the paper\u2019s authors.Mr. Carlini added that while there was no evidence that these techniques have left the lab, it may only be a matter of time before someone starts exploiting them. \u201cMy assumption is that the malicious people already employ people to do what I do,\u201d he said.These deceptions illustrate how artificial intelligence \u2014 even as it is making great strides \u2014 can still be tricked and manipulated. Computers can be fooled into identifying an airplane as a cat just by changing a few pixels of a digital image, while researchers can make a self-driving car swerve or speed up simply by pasting small stickers on road signs and confusing the vehicle\u2019s computer vision system.With audio attacks, the researchers are exploiting the gap between human and machine speech recognition. Speech recognition systems typically translate each sound to a letter, eventually compiling those into words and phrases. By making slight changes to audio files, researchers were able to cancel out the sound that the speech recognition system was supposed to hear and replace it with a sound that would be transcribed differently by machines while being nearly undetectable to the human ear.Amazon said that it doesn\u2019t disclose specific security measures, but it has taken steps to ensure its Echo smart speaker is secure. Google said security is an ongoing focus and that its Assistant has features to mitigate undetectable audio commands. Both companies\u2019 assistants employ voice recognition technology to prevent devices from acting on certain commands unless they recognize the user\u2019s voice.Apple said its smart speaker, HomePod, is designed to prevent commands from doing things like unlocking doors, and it noted that iPhones and iPads must be unlocked before Siri will act on commands that access sensitive data or open apps and websites, among other measures.There is already a history of smart devices being exploited for commercial gains through spoken commands.There is no American law against broadcasting subliminal messages to humans, let alone machines. The Federal Communications Commission discourages the practice as \u201ccounter to the public interest,\u201d and the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters bans \u201ctransmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness.\u201d Neither say anything about subliminal stimuli for smart devices.Courts have ruled that subliminal messages may constitute an invasion of privacy, but the law has not extended the concept of privacy to machines.Now the technology is racing even further ahead of the law. Last year, researchers at Princeton University and China\u2019s Zhejiang University demonstrated that voice-recognition systems could be activated by using frequencies inaudible to the human ear. The attack first muted the phone so the owner wouldn\u2019t hear the system\u2019s responses, either.The technique, which the Chinese researchers called DolphinAttack, can instruct smart devices to visit malicious websites, initiate phone calls, take a picture or send text messages. While DolphinAttack has its limitations \u2014 the transmitter must be close to the receiving device \u2014 experts warned that more powerful ultrasonic systems were possible.That warning was borne out in April, when researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign demonstrated ultrasound attacks from 25 feet away. While the commands couldn\u2019t penetrate walls, they could control smart devices through open windows from outside a building.The Berkeley group also embedded the command in music files, including a four-second clip from Verdi\u2019s \u201cRequiem.\u201dHow device makers respond will differ, especially as they balance security with ease of use.Mr. Carlini said he was confident that in time he and his colleagues could mount successful adversarial attacks against any smart device system on the market.\u201cWe want to demonstrate that it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, \u201cand then hope that other people will say, \u2018O.K. this is possible, now let\u2019s try and fix it.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vaping Products That Look Like Juice Boxes and Candy Are Target of Crackdown", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal authorities said on Tuesday they were issuing 13 warning letters to companies that sell vaping products like liquid nicotine in packaging that may appeal to children, including products that resemble juice boxes and candy.The joint action by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission is the latest step by the federal government to crack down on the vaping industry, particularly on devices that are popular with teenagers.One product, the Twirly Pop, sold by Omnia E-Liquid, also came with a real lollipop, federal officials said.Some of the companies also sold products to minors. Federal officials said even if the products were not sold to minors, a child could be mistakenly poisoned because the packaging so closely resembled food and candy.\u201cThe images are alarming, and it\u2019s easy to see how a child could confuse these e-liquid products for something they believe they\u2019ve consumed before,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a telephone call with reporters on Tuesday.Child poisonings from ingesting liquid nicotine have recently increased. Such poisonings can be deadly and can cause seizures, comas and respiratory arrest. There is no evidence the products under scrutiny this week caused any child deaths, officials said.Nevertheless, \u201cit takes a very small amount of these e-liquids, in some cases less than half a teaspoon, to be at the low end of what could be a fatal effect for a kid, and even less than that to make them very, very sick,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, the director of the F.D.A.\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products.Some of the products even smelled like the food they were imitating, said Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the acting chairwoman of the F.T.C. The apple juice product came in a cardboard box, with the corners sealed and folded over just like the shelf-stable boxes sold in supermarkets, according to the warning letter. It also smelled like apple juice, even without opening the package.\u201cThese companies are marketing their e-liquids in a manner that the product particularly appealing to young children,\u201d she said.Nick Warrender, the owner of Lifted Liquids, said he removed the Vape Heads product from his inventory and redesigned the packaging about six months ago to address officials\u2019 concerns over marketing such products. \u201cIt was something we already saw as a problem,\u201d he said.He said that the products were never marketed to children, but were designed to appeal to adults\u2019 nostalgia. \u201cOur goal is complete compliance with the F.D.A. and the F.T.C.,\u201d he said, but added that he also wanted to create products that will be attractive to consumers.\u201cOur goal is also to provide products that are going to give adult smokers the ability to get away from cigarettes and also something they are going to enjoy.\u201dMr. Warrender said his products are sold in childproof packaging and that any online sales go through a rigorous vetting system.Jameson Rodgers, vice president of business development at NEwhere, Inc., said the company stopped manufacturing and shipping the apple juice product months ago, after deciding in early 2017 that it was \u201ca way to be proactively responsible.\u201d Mr. Rodgers said that it was possible some retailers were continuing to sell remaining inventory of the product even though his company had stopped making or shipping it.Other companies could not be reached immediately for comment. F.D.A. officials said all of the companies sent warning letters on Tuesday had recently sold the products.Dr. Gottlieb said the action on Tuesday, as well as the crackdown last week on the Juul products, were part of a longer-term campaign aimed at reducing the use of vaping products by minors.While he said there is value in encouraging the development of alternatives that could lure smokers away from harmful cigarettes, public health officials needed to be vigilant about not addicting a new generation of young people to vaping products.\u201cThese are just the initial steps in what is going to be a sustained campaign,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said. \u201cThere are bad actors out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Privacy Rules Could Make This Woman One of Tech\u2019s Most Important Regulators", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "With Europe\u2019s sweeping new data privacy law, Ireland is in the middle of a standoff between regulators and tech companies.Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 If Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t know who Helen Dixon is, he will soon.From an unassuming townhouse in the Irish capital, Ms. Dixon, the country\u2019s data protection commissioner, leads an agency that was once a bureaucratic backwater. Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook\u2019s building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea.Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world\u2019s most consequential regulators.She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThere\u2019s a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,\u201d Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview.Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That\u2019s roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations.Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science.Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved.But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland\u2019s financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater.\u201cThe question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?\u201d said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. \u201cWe need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.\u201dBudgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley.Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland\u2019s history of lax oversight of the technology industry.Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints \u2014 not as common in Europe as the United States \u2014 that could result in sizable damages against businesses.\u201cWe should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you\u2019re not mandated by the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cEither they don\u2019t care or they actively oppose what we\u2019re doing.\u201dRepresentatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon\u2019s team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law.\u201cWe\u2019ve really leapt into explaining what we\u2019ve done and the thinking that\u2019s gone into that,\u201d said Stephen Deadman, Facebook\u2019s global deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cI\u2019ve got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon\u2019s office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media.\u201dGoogle and Twitter declined to comment.Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers \u201cto the fullest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why a Trade War With China Isn\u2019t \u2018Easy to Win\u2019 (Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAt this point, it\u2019s looking as if Trump\u2019s tough talk on China trade will turn out to be as empty as his tough talk on, say drug prices. Faced with the prospect of actually going toe to toe with powerful interests \u2013 as opposed to doing harm to desperate immigrants, poor people who need health care, etc. \u2013 Trump keeps backing down, ignominiously. But what happened to all that bluster about trade wars being \u201cgood, and easy to win\u201d?1. Someone actually managed to explain the economics to him, and he realized that the trade war wasn\u2019t actually a good idea2. He just lost his nerve, as he consistently does when confronting people who aren\u2019t powerless3. He was bribed, with China offering sweet deals to his personal business interests4. The Chinese also have some kind of tapeIt tells you a lot about the state of American leadership that (1) is highly implausible, while 2-4 all seem quite possible. And this means that what I\u2019m about to say may amount to overthinking the issue.Still, I think there are some good reasons why even a crude mercantilist looking at the China situation might conclude that this particular trade war isn\u2019t nearly as easy to win as it might appear at first glance.But GATT-think needs some modifying in an era of complex international value chains. Even if producer interests predominate over consumer interests, what producers should care about is not how much they export but how much income they derive from exporting. That is, they should care about \u201cincome at risk,\u201d not \u201cexports at risk.\u201d These numbers can be very different, and in the case of US-China trade they are.Smartphones are an extreme case, but there\u2019s a lot of that sort of thing. The income China derives from exports to the US is probably not much more than half the face value of those exports. There\u2019s a bit of the same thing going on in the other direction \u2013 US aircraft, for example, contain quite a few foreign components \u2013 but it\u2019s much less extreme.What this means, in turn, is that even if we only focus on narrow producer interests \u2013 even if we take a mercantilist view \u2013 US-China trade is a lot less lopsided than it seems, which in turn means that the pain from a trade war would be a lot less asymmetric than the raw trade numbers might suggest.But wait, there\u2019s more. Apple sells those iPhones for considerably more than it costs to import them from China. This adds a whole additional chunk of US income at risk to the bilateral trade relationship. True, given time Apple could probably find other suppliers \u2013 but not right away, and not easily. Foxconn wasn\u2019t built in a day.Overall, it\u2019s still probably true that China would be hurt worse than the U.S. in an all-out trade war. But the pain wouldn\u2019t be at all one-sided. And it\u2019s possible, I guess, that Trump dimly recognized that reality, or at least noticed that his beloved stock market really doesn\u2019t like trade war talk.Actually, I\u2019m still betting that it\u2019s a bribe and/or some kind of tape. But worth talking through, anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman C.E.O. Blankfein Is Likely to Step Down in December", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new era at Goldman Sachs is taking shape.The Wall Street giant\u2019s president, David M. Solomon, is likely to be named chief executive officer by the end of this year, and he is already structuring his senior management team, according to people familiar with the firm\u2019s plans.Yet in recent weeks, Mr. Blankfein has quietly laid the groundwork to step down late this year. His exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm\u2019s annual dinner for retired partners in December, two people said. Mr. Solomon, who is 56, would step in shortly after that.The timetable is not settled and could change, these people cautioned.Given what is likely to be a relatively short run-up to his promotion, Mr. Solomon is starting to sketch out the possibilities for a new management team, according to Goldman employees.One big question is who will succeed him as Goldman president, a role that is often shared by two executives. Contenders include John Waldron, the firm\u2019s co-head of investment banking; Eric S. Lane, who co-heads its investment management division; and Stephen M. Scherr, who runs the consumer banking division.\u201cThe simple fact is that no decisions have been made,\u201d said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman.The expected leadership transition will mark the end of a prosperous but rocky era for the Wall Street firm.When Mr. Blankfein was named C.E.O. in 2006, he took over a wildly profitable investment bank known for both its seasoned deal advisers and its aggressive stock and bond trading. Buying and selling assets using its own money as well as clients\u2019 funds, Goldman made many billions of dollars in trading each year. Among its most lucrative wagers was that the United States housing market would suffer in 2007. That market cratered, almost bringing down the banking industry and the entire American economy.Mr. Blankfein, a onetime gold salesman known for his intellect and dry wit, steered Goldman through that tumultuous period, but not without the firm suffering huge damage to its reputation. It was pilloried by politicians for appearing to profit at the expense of clients, and became synonymous with Wall Street avarice.Since then, Goldman\u2019s business model has been hurt by tough federal regulations intended to curb risk-taking on Wall Street. The firm, once reliant on its high-flying traders, now has to look elsewhere for new revenue.Under Mr. Solomon, Goldman\u2019s investment banking business flourished, ranking among Wall Street\u2019s top firms for advising on corporate mergers and acquisitions. But that is a much less profitable business than trading had been before the crisis. And other Goldman divisions, such as investment management and consumer banking, remain too small to pick up the slack.Last year, Mr. Solomon and his co-president, Harvey M. Schwartz, presented Goldman\u2019s board of directors with a plan for generating billions of dollars in additional revenue. Their ideas, which were accepted by directors, included expanding the investment-banking business into midsize cities like Dallas and Seattle, enlarging Goldman\u2019s online-lending business and doing more trading of currencies and commodities on behalf of large corporations.Mr. Solomon was informed in early March that Mr. Blankfein and the board had chosen him as the next C.E.O., say Goldman officials. Shortly after that, Mr. Schwartz, the other leading candidate for the top job, announced plans to retire.But aside from continuing the shift into more consumer-focused areas, it isn\u2019t clear whether Goldman under Mr. Solomon will look much different than under his predecessor.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized how it emerged that Goldman Sachs and Apple were working on a credit card product. It was disclosed by two people familiar with the companies\u2019 talks; it was not announced by Goldman Sachs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SoftBank Fund Puts $2.25 Billion in G.M.\u2019s Driverless Unit", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-driving cars have increasingly figured in visions of the automotive future, and a big new investment is the latest signal that such a moment is close at hand.On Thursday, a fund affiliated with SoftBank Group of Japan said it planned to invest $2.25 billion in the driverless-technology division of General Motors to help the automaker ramp up a ride-hailing service in select cities.The deal\u2019s magnitude reflects the growing confidence that commercial use of autonomous cars is in sight \u2014 despite recent setbacks to some other companies, including at least two fatal accidents, that have raised questions about the technology\u2019s safety.\u201cThis is a new source of capital to scale this business,\u201d Dan Ammann, G.M.\u2019s president, said in a conference call. \u201cWe think this fully funds our plan.\u201dAs part of the deal, G.M. said it would put an additional $1.1 billion of its own money into the unit, which is known as G.M. Cruise Holdings and is based in San Francisco. SoftBank\u2019s investment will be made through its Vision Fund, which focuses on the technology sector.Investors offered the move a vote of confidence, sending G.M.\u2019s shares up almost 13 percent on Thursday.In both Detroit and Silicon Valley, as well as overseas, the rush to build a foundation for autonomous-driving technology is gathering momentum. Waymo, the driverless-technology company spun out of Google, said Thursday that it had agreed to purchase as many as 62,000 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for a ride-hailing service that will start operating commercially in Phoenix by the end of this year.Waymo previously agreed to buy up to 20,000 compact cars from Jaguar Land Rover, starting in 2019, giving it a potential fleet of more than 80,000 driverless vehicles within three or four years.\u201cThe volumes they are committing to is a clear signal these companies think they\u2019ve got it, that their technology is very close to commercial ready,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks autonomous technology.The determination of G.M. and Waymo to offer ride services within months also suggests a conviction that businesses that use driverless cars to ferry ordinary people from place to place will spread rapidly and \u2014 absent the cost of a driver \u2014 yield hefty profits.At the same time, Mr. Ramsey noted, \u201cit\u2019s a completely unproven business model,\u201d with costly technology that is bound to have growing pains. The first vehicles will probably be programmed to be so cautious in traffic that crosstown trips may initially take much longer than people are used to, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think safety will be the concern for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time it takes to get to your destination could be a turnoff, though.\u201dLike G.M., Ford is racing to put self-driving cars into ride and delivery fleets, but it has a longer timeline and is hoping to have its car in production by 2021.G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the SoftBank investment validated the direction that G.M. and its Cruise division were taking. The investment gives SoftBank a 19.6 percent stake in G.M. Cruise and values the unit at more than $11 billion. That\u2019s well above the $1 billion that G.M. paid two years ago to acquire Cruise as a start-up company.\u201cThere\u2019s no other company in the world that has the technology chops and the experience to lead the industry on this front,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner of SoftBank\u2019s investment arm, SoftBank Investment Advisers.The investment highlights the ambition and seemingly bottomless wallet of SoftBank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son. It was Mr. Son who came up with the idea of raising nearly $100 billion from investors ranging from Saudi Arabia to Apple for the Vision Fund, which is now one of the world\u2019s biggest and boldest investors in tech companies.In a reflection of Mr. Son\u2019s personality, SoftBank and the Vision Fund have become known for moving quickly to invest in companies with products seen as crucial to the future of technology. They have been willing to pour large sums into early start-ups at enormous valuations, crowding out other potential investors.Ride-hailing has been a major focus for SoftBank, with investments in Uber, Didi Chuxing of China, Ola of India, Grab of Singapore and 99 of Brazil.At the time, the company said its vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be produced on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate. Likely spots for initial operations are San Francisco and Scottsdale, Ariz., where Cruise is already conducting tests.Waymo, on the other hand, does not intend to make cars but instead will rely on partners to produce vehicles that it will outfit with sensors, radar and other technology.A unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, it has been working on self-driving technology for nearly a decade, and is focusing on four potential lines of business. In addition to the ride service it intends to start, the company expects to put its autonomous-driving technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, and aims to license its technology to automakers like Fiat Chrysler. It sees a potential fourth business line in driverless shuttles that can ferry riders to mass transit systems.The company expects to begin buying Pacifica minivans for its ride service later this year. They will be produced at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Windsor, Ontario, and equipped with self-driving technology at a Waymo technical center in Novi, Mich.Waymo gave no details on how many minivans it expects to buy this year or next, the value of the deal, or the period covered by the purchase agreement.The companies said Thursday that they were in talks about licensing Waymo technology to Fiat Chrysler so the carmaker can at some point sell self-driving vehicles to consumers.Advertisement"}

What it does have is:Yes, the ride-hailing business should be regulated, but not to make it more like the disaster it is replacing.DAVID BERMAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The editorial waxes nostalgic about the \u201cbygone era\u201d before green cabs, Uber and Lyft, when \u201ceach type of car service tended to stay in its lane.\u201dMoreover, the vast majority of city taxi drivers \u2014 who earn around $35,000 per year working punishing weeks on New York\u2019s streets \u2014 rent their cabs from fleets that own hundreds of medallions (the licenses to operate a cab), a practice that fueled the era of Bitcoin-like speculation that drove medallion prices to stratospheric heights.Smart regulations can and must ensure that the technological revolution of for-hire-vehicles (and autonomous vehicles to come) provides efficient transportation for all users. But in tackling the challenges of the present, let\u2019s not gloss over the failures of the past.To the Editor:As a driver of a yellow cab for six and a half years, I care about this issue with every fiber of my being. I have watched my income plummet by well over 30 percent over that span and have seen the city do nearly zip to alleviate the situation. It has been tough to pinpoint who exactly is at fault.Yes, the medallions were overpriced when they hit over $1 million a few years ago. The city was going to auction off 2,000 more as a way to generate revenue, only to watch that effort fail because there would be too many taxis on the streets. A few years later and there are well over 50,000 for-hire vehicles competing with us that didn\u2019t exist when I started, with the numbers growing every month. Where were the traffic study, the environmental impact study and the admission that someone messed up by letting them loose?Sure, you may think that it\u2019s a win-win for the consumer. But Uber loses $1 billion per quarter and can\u2019t even treat its employees properly, and this is the behemoth that\u2019s supposed to represent all that\u2019s right with the gig economy. Yes, the Taxi & Limousine Commission failed to upgrade the taxis to the 21st century and reform outdated rules. But drivers like me who never had a say in this ended up taking the fall. We can only hope that the city gets it right this time around.To the Editor:Taxis and Uber are essentially in the same market, but Uber, and similar companies, slipped in because there is no street hailing. Taxis are a lesson in regulatory capture and failure. Regulations are initially adopted to protect consumers and the general public. Over time that breaks down as consumers are ignored, harassed, overcharged and forced into cabs that are filthy, or have drivers who are surly or cannot speak English.The taxi industry became a monopoly just waiting for something to break the cabal. Uber and its compatriots are just the disruptive force to do the trick. If taxis are highly, but poorly, regulated, Uber resists all regulation. It does not matter much whether Uber drivers are contractors or employees; Uber is a transportation company and must accept all that entails.Cities must reinvigorate taxi regulation so that it serves the public, and Uber must be under the same regulation. First and foremost, regulation should provide safety and customer service, but it should also encompass rate controls, congestion limits and pricing, insurance, driver licensing and much else. There is no reason that taxi hailing and app hailing should be regulated differently.To the Editor:I\u2019ve been taking taxis for almost 50 years. Contrary to what many people think and say, I have generally found the drivers to be incredibly hard-working family men (and some women) who are polite and love this city as much as I do. I don\u2019t understand why the powers that be in the city let Uber and the rest take over our streets and decimate the taxi industry just like that. Shame on them!DONNA KENTON, NEW YORKTo the Editor:This has become a crisis of unintended consequences, and New Yorkers, particularly taxi and livery drivers, do not have the luxury of letting elected officials take their time to find solutions as the situation grows increasingly dire.As a protectionist measure, there has always been a supply cap on the number of taxi medallions permitted in the city. This cap, rightly or wrongly, created a supply and demand system favoring medallion holders and the taxi drivers. Now livery providers like Uber have joined the city streets with no caps, and what we have is chaos.Livery companies should have cap barriers similar to taxi medallions to protect both the drivers and the people who use the services. Drivers can\u2019t make a living, and people who use a livery service can\u2019t get where they are going, because the city streets are so clogged with livery cars. Supply way exceeds the demand, and everyone suffers. Emergency services such as fire trucks and ambulances are also impeded by the increased congestion.SALLY GREENSPAN, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The Times editorial fails to address one of the fundamental attractions of Uber over taxis, and that is the convenience of using an app to order an Uber car to your location when you need one. That the taxi industry still refuses to coordinate all taxis and permit people to call one to their location is its own failure of business enterprise. Let taxis be permitted to be the sole random street-hailing service for customers. But strongly urge them to include an app-hailing program. Their failure to modernize should not be supported by the city administration.To the Editor:The most important lesson of the New York City taxi mess is that government-granted monopolies disserve the public interest. The technology that makes Uber and Lyft possible was available to New York\u2019s taxi medallion holders, but, protected by their taxi monopolies, they stuck with the status quo and let service deteriorate. Uber and Lyft succeeded only because New York visitors and residents were starved for good service made possible by new technologies.Like most monopolists throughout history, the medallion holders put monopoly profits ahead of service to the public. The last thing New York\u2019s government should do is to reward their greed by bailing them out.HENRY H.

{"Headline": "Iraqi Artifacts Once Bought by Hobby Lobby Will Return Home", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The line of people snaked around the blue tablecloth, as government officials and archaeology scholars paused to admire the ancient clay tablets and seals lined in rows.Here, in the backyard of the Iraqi ambassador\u2019s home on Wednesday, was closure for these artifacts: a ceremonial transfer back to Iraq, where they had been looted from archaeological sites. Their coming return there will complete a long, circuitous voyage through Israel and the United Arab Emirates to Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts chain, and eventually into the hands of the United States government.The samples carefully lined on the table were just a small fraction of the thousands of smuggled artifacts that Immigration and Customs Enforcement formally returned on Wednesday.\u201cTo have them in my residence is to underline that they\u2019re coming home,\u201d said Fareed Yasseen, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, speaking after he and Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of ICE, signed the ceremonial transfer. \u201cWe really have a sense of kinship to these artifacts.\u201d\u201cThese artifacts are part of Iraq\u2019s illustrious heritage and history,\u201d said Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, \u201cand we\u2019re proud of our role in removing them from the black market in antiquities and returning them to their rightful owners.\u201dHobby Lobby did not respond to requests for comment about the return of the artifacts. But at the time of the forfeiture in July, Steve Green, the company\u2019s president, said the company was \u201cnew to the world of acquiring these items, and did not fully appreciate the complexities of the acquisitions process.\u201dMany of the officials mingling in the ambassador\u2019s backyard with glasses of apple cider and hors d\u2019oeuvres had been involved in the seizure and the return of the artifacts. Others were archaeologists and Middle East scholars who had come forward in support of the items\u2019 return, collectively admiring the condition and the intricacy of the designs on the seals.

{"Headline": "Apple, Spurned by Others, Signs Deal With Volkswagen for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple once had grand aspirations to build its own electric self-driving car and lead the next generation of transportation. Over time, the tech giant\u2019s ambitions ran into reality.In recent years, Apple sought partnerships with the luxury carmakers BMW and Mercedes-Benz to develop an all-electric self-driving vehicle, according to five people familiar with the negotiations who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But on-again, off-again talks with those companies have ended after each rebuffed Apple\u2019s requirements to hand over control of the data and design, some of the people said.Instead, Apple has signed a deal with Volkswagen to turn some of the carmaker\u2019s new T6 Transporter vans into Apple\u2019s self-driving shuttles for employees \u2014 a project that is behind schedule and consuming nearly all of the Apple car team\u2019s attention, said three people familiar with the project.Apple\u2019s deal with Volkswagen, which has not been previously reported, and the failure of its talks with other automakers reflect the continuing travails and diminished scope of the company\u2019s four-year-old car program.Apple declined to comment.Apple originally began its car project \u2014 known internally as Titan and T172 \u2014 in 2014. At the time, Apple planned to build a single vehicle that would upend society and industry, in what would be the automotive version of the iPhone. The company set to work on an electric driverless car with a lush interior reminiscent of a lounge or living room, where passengers face one another instead of the road, according to two early employees of the project.Apple enlisted software programmers, automotive engineers, rocket scientists and the industrial-design team of Apple\u2019s design chief, Jonathan Ive, to reimagine the car. They entertained a series of unconventional concepts, including augmented-reality or holographic displays embedded in windshields and windows, a sunroof made of a special polymer that reduces heat from the sun, and windows with adjustable tints \u2014 like those on Boeing\u2019s new 787 Dreamliner jets.As recently as 2016, Apple planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build research and development labs around its Cupertino, Calif., campus, including a machine shop and labs for electric car batteries, according to interviews and documents about the plans viewed by The New York Times.Members of the car project soon found that even designing and building fundamental parts of a new car was not simple. Apple initially intended to build the car in-house, with preliminary discussions of an Apple automotive plant in the south of the United States, two former employees said. But those plans quickly shifted to finding a manufacturing partner to build \u2014 but not design \u2014 the cars.Two former employees said Apple\u2019s requests of partners gradually evolved. At first, the company asked for help building an Apple-designed vehicle. Then, it began asking potential partners to provide foundational car pieces like the chassis and wheels. Eventually, Apple requested that potential partners retrofit their own vehicles with Apple\u2019s sensors and software.In late 2015, Apple bought two Lexus S.U.V.s and hired a Virginia firm called Torc Robotics to retrofit the vehicles with sensors, a project known internally as Baja, one former employee said. The fleet has grown, and California regulators have authorized Apple to use 55 such S.U.V.s to run self-driving tests on public roads, the most of any company in the state after General Motors \u2014 but still fewer than Waymo has across six states.BMW was long Apple\u2019s top choice, given its focus on high-end but mainstream products, former employees said. Many Apple executives, including the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, also drive BMWs. Mr. Cook visited BMW as early as 2014 to discuss a partnership, and those on-and-off negotiations continued for years. But a person close to the talks said any deal now appeared dead because both Apple and BMW wanted to own the customer experience and relationship.Apple\u2019s other favored choice was Mercedes-Benz, internally code-named Bruce, according to one former employee. The two companies held partnership talks for more than a year, said three people familiar with the discussions. But those negotiations were halted because of similar disagreements over control of the experience and data, said one person close to the talks.Apple also met with Nissan in Japan, BYD Auto in China and sports-car maker McLaren in Britain, among other companies, one former employee said. None of the talks resulted in a deal because either the automaker was reluctant to give up control to Apple or Apple was holding out for a more attractive partner.Now, at a lab near Turin, Italy, run by a Volkswagen subsidiary called Italdesign, the companies plan to remake Volkswagen\u2019s T6 vans as electric self-driving shuttles, these people said.The frame, wheels and chassis of the T6 vans will remain, but Apple is replacing many components, including the dashboard and seats, said two people familiar with the project. Apple is also adding other computers, sensors and a large electric car battery, they said. The shuttles will ferry employees between two of Apple\u2019s Silicon Valley campuses, and will include a driver behind the wheel to take control if needed, as well as an operator in the passenger\u2019s seat tracking the van\u2019s performance.Executives leading Apple\u2019s car project had told Mr. Cook that the shuttle would be completed by the end of 2018, but that deadline will be missed, one former employee said. It is unclear whether Apple\u2019s partnership with Volkswagen will extend beyond the shuttle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.Microsoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.But while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201dSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sales of new homes, which make up about 10 percent of all sales, hit a four-month high in March, and revisions have shown that home sales throughout the first quarter were stronger than initially reported. The Census Bureau will report Wednesday on sales of new homes, and the National Association of Realtors will report Thursday on sales of existing homes. \u2014 William P.

But he still has enough support to survive a motion to oust him. \u2014 Jack EwingTECHNOLOGYThe world\u2019s most sweeping data privacy regulations go into effect across the European Union on Friday. The rules intend to make it harder for companies to harvest data on the more than 500 million people living in the 28-nation bloc. The law requires organizations to get permission from their users before collecting any personal information, and companies could face steep fines \u2014 of up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 for noncompliance. But enforcement will be a challenge: Oversight falls to whichever country has a company\u2019s European headquarters within its borders, and many of those countries have small data-protection agencies. The data protection office in Ireland, with a budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to about $8.8 million, will be responsible for overseeing tech giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple. \u2014 Adam SatarianoMEDIAMemorial Day weekend has been on the decline as a reliable, bonanza sales period for Hollywood. \u201cBaywatch\u201d (Paramount) got stranded on a sand dune last year. \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass\u201d (Disney) fizzled in 2016. \u201cTomorrowland\u201d (Disney) drew yawns from ticket buyers in 2015.
