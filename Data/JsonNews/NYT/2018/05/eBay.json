{"Headline": "A Tiffany Collector of Things Pastel", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tastemaker Louis Comfort Tiffany favored bright opalescent palettes during his later years, and the colors have become something of an obsession for Gordon H. Hancock, a glass collector in Patchogue, N.Y. Mr. Hancock, 75, a retired owner of a car repair shop, owns about 400 pieces of pastel-tinted glass tableware that Tiffany workers made in the 1920s, as Mr. Tiffany\u2019s five-decade career wound down.The objects are neatly organized in display cases throughout Mr. Hancock\u2019s low-slung 1950s home. He has clustered vases, candleholders, saucers and dinner plates; drinking vessels for water, wine and champagne; and serving pieces for salt, sugar, cream, cakes, fruit and cigarettes. The palette on the shelves includes rosy pinks, celadon greens, caramel, violet, sapphire and aquamarine. Iridescent gold is dusted along the ruffled or pointy rims and the twisted or fluted stems. Subtle crosshatching and motifs of foliage, flowers and butterflies come to light when sunbeams pour in at just the right angles.\u201cI like to say, \u2018The glass talks to me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hancock said during a recent tour of his home, where he lives alone. \u201cTo me, this is like walking into my garden,\u201d where everything is always in bloom. (His wife, Maureen, died in 2007; his two sons and two grandsons live nearby.)At the bottom of each piece, he applies a neat handwritten label, with a system of letters and numbers that he also uses in his computer database. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you what my code is,\u201d because it would reveal what he has paid, he said teasingly.Virtually everything in the Hancock collection was made in the 1920s, when Mr. Tiffany was heading into retirement. The factory, in Corona, N.Y., had supplied roomfuls of custom works for homes, churches, synagogues and institutions, and it produced popular knickknacks like pincushions and thermometer holders. Mr. Tiffany eventually handed the company to some longtime colleagues, two generations of glassworkers in the Nash family. Incarnations of the business limped along for a few years, and it was bankrupt by the time Mr. Tiffany died in 1933.Mr. Hancock has pored through every scholarly study that mentions the Tiffany twilight era, and he has decoded the factory\u2019s cryptic number and letter markings. He can explain how the staff rolled and molded the molten glass and developed innovative hues, iridescent layering and enameled metal rims. On one pinkish-gold plate in his collection, an inscription reads, \u201cSample approved by A.J. Nash.\u201d In copies of the Nashes\u2019 notebooks, he has found original design drawings for vessels he owns. As the Tiffany workshops faltered, a notebook page was inscribed with the words \u201cthe end\u201d above a strand of teardrops.Mr. Hancock has focused on this rather poignant collecting area since the 1970s, when he first saw Tiffany vases and stained glass at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cThat\u2019s what sparked my interest,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought it was absolutely beautiful.\u201d The first pastel piece to enter his home was an aquamarine wine glass. It took decades, he said, to assemble a matching set of everything else in aquamarine that might have graced the table of the goblet\u2019s original owner, to serve meals from soup to nuts.Mr. Hancock, a Brooklyn native, became a methodical collector while still a teenager in East Meadow, N.Y. He was always drawn to narrow niches: United States airmail stamps, for instance, and half-dollars that depict windblown Liberty in midstride. In the jargon of the collecting world, he is deemed a \u201ccompletist,\u201d seeking to own at least one of everything ever made in his area of pursuit.He has not decided whether to sell the collection eventually or give it to his family, and he does not consider it finished.\u201cIt\u2019s ongoing,\u201d he said, and then he described some red and violet vessels that he is pursuing, in forms that were new to him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018In Praise of Wasting Time\u2019 Speaks Ominously of a Digital \u2018Grid\u2019", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe M.I.T. professor Alan Lightman has produced a highly personal polemic targeting the subversive impact on civilization of the increasingly frenetic pace of life. His book, \u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time,\u201d proposes \u201cthat half our waking minds be designated and saved for quiet reflection.\u201d Failure to heed his recommendation, Professor Lightman warns, will result in the collective destruction of \u201cour inner selves and our creative capacities.\u201dIn reaching this conclusion, Professor Lightman, an eclectic physicist, novelist and essayist, draws on personal experience and historical anecdotes as well as research on a variety of topics like creativity and loneliness, productivity and meditation. The common culprit behind \u201ctoday\u2019s time-driven, wired existence\u201d that threatens our very humanity is identified ominously as something called \u201cthe grid.\u201d The grid is described as \u201cthe vast and all-consuming network\u201d whose digital tentacles have already transformed \u201cour entire way of thinking\u201d and \u201cour way of being in the world, our social and psychological ethos.\u201dProfessor Lightman documented a variety of disturbing social phenomena to back up his views. These include an increase in teenage depression, a study in which college students preferred to self-administer a painful electric shock rather than sit quietly with their thoughts for 12 minutes, and a decline in creativity among children. As provocative and often entertaining as these and his more personal observations are, their connection to the emergence of \u201cthe grid\u201d is often tenuous at best.For instance, the research on child creativity notes a decline beginning in 1990, which Professor Lightman asserts \u201capproximately coincides with the public emergence of the internet.\u201d In fact, the first web page wasn\u2019t created until 1991 and wasn\u2019t fully commercialized until 1995 when Amazon and eBay\u2019s predecessor began operations.More problematically, it is never fully clear what is meant by \u201cwasting time.\u201d At certain points in the book this appears synonymous with \u201cnon-goal oriented uses of time,\u201d but the chapter extolling the virtue of all forms of \u201cplay\u201d is chock-full of goal-oriented activities. What\u2019s more, one study he highlights used playing the 1990s video games Minesweeper or Solitaire as examples of time wasting that fostered creativity. It is hard to distinguish this activity from much of what is undertaken by those who have become \u201cintravenously connected to the grid.\u201dIn his chapter on creativity, Professor Lightman instead emphasizes the value of \u201cletting the mind wander and spin.\u201d His own previous study found the great scientific discoveries of the 20th century were often achieved after first getting \u201cstuck\u201d on what seemed to be an insoluble problem. The breakthrough came after finding a relaxed environment in which the scientists\u2019 minds \u201ccan roam and explore and invent in unfettered freedom.\u201dThe vast majority of knowledge is acquired the old-fashioned way: hard, focused acquisition of increasing expertise. Although there is clearly value to unfocused activity \u2014 what Professor Lightman calls the free-grazing mind \u2014 to get unstuck, there is no evidence that for most people it makes sense to dedicate anything like half our waking hours to such musing. In his flurry of wide-ranging anecdotes, he mixes the examples of the work habits of pure creatives like Gertrude Stein and Federico Fellini with those of research scientists. Just as he fails to adequately distinguish between very different forms of wasting time, Professor Lightman fails to consider the relative applicability of his proposals to different use cases.Like the provocative title, the hostility to \u201cthe grid\u201d that underpins \u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time\u201d sometimes feels more like a narrative hook than a genuine, deeply held view. During a flattering description of a 10-day Tibetan Buddhism retreat, Professor Lightman was careful to note that he didn\u2019t \u201crecall seeing any laptops or smartphones.\u201d Yet his own \u201cfree-grazing\u201d mental activities included remembering \u201ca high school friend who had abruptly stopped answering my letters.\u201d The professor mentions in passing that with \u201csome sleuthing, I confirmed that he was alive and well.\u201d Sounds like someone sneaked a smartphone into the retreat to do a little Googling!\u201cIn Praise of Wasting Time\u201d is published by TED Books, one of the many spinoff businesses of the wildly popular conferences described by the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb as a \u201cmonstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers.\u201d The ubiquity of TED Talks is both a symptom of the grid against which Professor Lightman rails and a source of its popularity. Like the internet itself, they can be neither easily dismissed nor fully embraced. The witches\u2019 brew of interesting ideas, exaggerated claims and unsatisfying generalizations that make up this volume both reflects and reveals some of the conundrums of our wired age.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese two very different solos \u2014 one featuring appropriated photographs, the other oil paintings \u2014 have an unexpected synergy, especially regarding visual memory and associations.The New York sculptor Al Freeman fills the gallery\u2019s smaller space with the first solo show of her uncanny Comparisons: each a collage of a famous work of art (Matisse, Bruegel and Bacon) and a photograph \u2014 usually culled from the internet\u2019s underbelly \u2014 to which it bears a striking, often hilarious resemblance. A well-known photograph of Eva Hesse\u2019s black sculptures seems nearly identical to the gear of a dominatrix, laid out like an eBay photograph. The nested squares of a Josef Albers painting are partnered with the locked arms of two wrestlers. Many collages feature drunken adolescents joking around (frequently unclothed) or pranking their passed-out buddies. One such young man, hanging from a clothes hanger inserted in his T-shirt, eerily echoes the flayed skin from Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cLast Judgment.\u201dMs. Freeman\u2019s comparisons are more than funny; they\u2019re full of feminist barbs and insights into the mind\u2019s reflexive leaps \u2014 their pleasures, tells and revelations.These reflexes may be activated by the promising New York debut of the Brazilian artist Marina Rheingantz, whose paintings recalibrate the work of Cy Twombly and Anselm Kiefer into large, semiabstract landscapes full of ambiguous forms and details that are deeply dystopian in mood. They\u2019re beautiful wastelands writ small, delicately dotted with suggestions of trash; ruined structures and abandoned encampments; occasional tiny flags or palm trees; and enticing little pileups of paint. The nocturnal \u201cJojola\u201d could be grounds once used for military maneuvers, horse jumping or a dilapidated carnival. \u201cJorro\u201d evokes fountains run slightly amok. The most convincing works \u2014 \u201cJojola,\u201d as well as \u201cVarzea\u201d and the snowy \u201cPisador\u201d \u2014 are expansive fields that Ms. Rheingantz paints with unusual delicacy and small brush strokes. These three paintings confirm that while all is not well with the world, the artist\u2019s deliberate avoidance of bravura implies that there is always another way to do things.ROBERTA SMITHEverything about the work in Yun-Fei Ji\u2019s show \u201cRumors, Ridicules and Retributions\u201d is subversive. Raised during the Cultural Revolution but trained in traditional ink painting before getting an M.F.A. at the University of Arkansas, Mr. Ji uses the flattened perspective of the classical Chinese landscape to paint scenes \u2014 such as the disintegration of China\u2019s rural villages \u2014 that the current government would sooner keep quiet. His people are formed with bursts of staccato strokes that bring to mind stands of bamboo, but their faces have the workaday realism of a contemporary graphic novel. But what\u2019s most subversive about the work in New York, where Mr. Ji lives part time, is that it never quite picks a side.WILL HEINRICHYou can\u2019t initially tell that the objects here are portable toilets, since the large plastic housings are mounted sideways on the wall. In doing so, Mr. Slominski mimics iconic minimalist sculptural installations like Robert Morris\u2019s exhibition at the Green Gallery in 1964. Additionally, working with a German company, Mr. Slominski has deconstructed portable toilets, turning their components into cubes, or cast-plastic relief sculptures depicting nature and fertility scenes.Once you reach the back gallery, however, a multicolored portable toilet titled \u201cChameleon\u201d (2018) sits upright and alone, urging the viewer to approach. Unlike Mr. Cattelan\u2019s gold toilet, \u201cChameleon\u201d is meant to be looked at rather than used. Like its progenitors, however, it\u2019s poised and positioned to provoke. Duchamp perversely reasoned that \u201cFountain\u201d (1917), his urinal purchased as a ready-made sculpture on Mott Street in New York, was emblematic of the United States since \u201cthe only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges\u201d; Mr. Cattelan\u2019s Trump-era toilet is tauntingly titled \u201cAmerica.\u201dMr. Slominski stresses the German origin of his toilets, conjuring both the celebrated history of German manufacturing and design and the dire need for facilities as migrants streamed across Europe in recent years. Like his peers, Mr. Slominski argues for the toilet\u2019s formal and universal significance. But the current exhibition suggests that toilets are equally important as art \u2014 except, that is, when they\u2019re actually the same thing.MARTHA SCHWENDENERMary Mattingly\u2019s new collage photographs are disorienting. One, titled \u201cEndgame\u201d (2017), centers on a picture of two cranes standing in marshy waters. As the birds dip their beaks, the slope of their necks directs the viewer\u2019s gaze downward, to a table in front of the picture, on which sit three objects: what looks like an oblong chunk of black rock, a pile of rocks tied together with string and shards of pottery similarly bound. Just below the tabletop, where there should be a wall, there is instead a rectangle of bare trees. It interrupts the illusionistic space and compounds a looming question: How do all the elements here conceptually connect?The rest of the works in the show provide clues. More traditional photographs depict sites of mines with desolate beauty. Parts of those places, like cones of white rock at an abandoned mine in Texas, appear in the collage images. A text panel seen in a still life shows up in one of three wall-mounted box sculptures, which feature industrial and agricultural objects laid out schematically and connected obsessively with string.This is a method Mattingly has used before, bundling everyday objects with twine. If tying things together can feel like an obvious symbol, it\u2019s also a romantic gesture. Mattingly is as invested in the workings of the world as she is in its possibilities. Between the two is where she locates her poetry.JILLIAN STEINHAUERAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Sell Your Old Phone Safely", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe high cost of a new phone can be a hard pill to swallow, but it becomes easier if you sell your old one. Here\u2019s how to make sure your personal information is securely wiped before you hand your phone off to a stranger.Before you do anything, back up all the data currently on your phone. Not only will this prevent you from losing precious photos, but it\u2019ll also make setting up your new phone a breeze, since you can restore all your apps, contacts and other data from the backup.To do so, plug your iPhone into your PC or Mac and launch iTunes. Click the iPhone button that appears in the top-left corner of the toolbar, and click the \u201cBack Up Now\u201d button. This process may take a few minutes, but when it\u2019s done, you\u2019ll have your important information backed up to your computer, and your new phone will prompt you to restore from iTunes during the initial setup.If you log into an app with an account, it probably backs up your data regularly to that account. In other cases, you may need to manually create a backup file from that app\u2019s settings. Then you can plug your phone into your computer, drag those backup files onto your desktop (I\u2019d also drag your photos over, just in case) and store them safely for your next phone. If you aren\u2019t sure if you have everything, it might be a good idea to buy your new phone before selling the old one, so you can make sure you have what you need before wiping.Once you\u2019re sure you have everything backed up, you\u2019re ready to erase that data from your device. Take care, though: This needs to be done in a way that ensures the phone\u2019s new owner can\u2019t recover any of your personal information.When you delete a file from your phone or computer, it isn\u2019t actually erased. The device just marks that space \u201cfree\u201d to overwrite with other data. But anyone with easy-to-obtain recovery software can view recently deleted files, which means your personal information is at risk.The encryption process may take a few hours, but once it\u2019s finished, you can now proceed to erase your phone. Head to Settings > System > Reset Options and choose \u201cErase All Data (Factory Reset).\u201d Once that\u2019s done, your phone will be as good as new.Now that your device is wiped, you\u2019re ready to post your phone and get that cash! Now is a good time to remove your SIM card on the side of your phone using a small paper clip. This occasionally contains personal information, and it\u2019s also linked to your cellular account, so you\u2019ll need it to activate your new phone.Whitson Gordon is a writer and editor in San Diego.

{"Headline": "How Much Is That Sneaker in the Window?", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo walk into the 3,000-square-foot Stadium Goods store in SoHo is to be confronted by rows and rows of pristine, shrink-wrapped athletic footwear. Look closely and you might be a little stunned by the price tags.This is clearly not Foot Locker.Sneaker fanatics have been around for decades, with swaps and buys largely happening on eBay or as personal transactions. But it\u2019s only in the last few years that the reseller market has accelerated and gone sharply upscale. John McPheters, who co-founded Stadium Goods with Jed Stiller, says the shift has been driven by \u201cmen who are now learning from childhood how to treat fashion as a sport \u2014 the way that women have always treated fashion.\u201dThe point is not utility, but rather about expressing identity. \u201cSneakers are the single most flexible and acceptable way to communicate personality for these new shopping-obsessed men,\u201d Mr. McPheters said.\u201cWith its advanced technology platform that is highly regarded in the luxury industry, we believe Farfetch is a terrific partner to help us expand our global reach,\u201d Mr. McPheters said in a statement when that deal was announced.Before starting Stadium Goods, Mr. McPheters did marketing and business development for Flight Club, a sneaker consignment shop, and later ran social media accounts for Nike while employed at the creative marketing agency Team Epiphany. Mr. Stiller had been an investor in various New York nightclubs. The two had previously done another start-up, Swarm Mobile, a retailing app, that was sold to Groupon in 2014.The demand for collectible sneakers and streetwear is particularly fervent in China, Mr. McPheters said, adding that he got his first taste of that market\u2019s potential when a Chinese customer dropped $10,000 in a single spree at the Stadium Goods store. \u201cOften, the shoes they want were never available in their country,\u201d he said.He and Mr. Stiller seized an opportunity to enter the market early, launching a brand page on Alibaba\u2019s TMall platform in 2016 just a year into its business.The partners believe the future of sneaker retail will be a hybrid model combining traditional channels and aftermarket selling. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of what\u2019s hot,\u201d Mr. Stiller said, noting that in the sneaker world what\u2019s trending is not necessarily the newest item. \u201cWhere a lot of retailers are dependent on what brands are releasing at the moment, we\u2019re not. Ninety-five percent of our stock are styles that are no longer on the market.\u201dStadium Goods is hardly the only player in this fast-growing field, of course.With hot sneaker styles costing $300 and up, \u201cthe last thing you want to be spending your money on is fakes,\u201d said Eddy Lu, a co-founder and chief executive officer. \u201cFor us, it was let\u2019s build something that solves the growing problem of counterfeits and fakes.\u201dIt\u2019s built for the casual sneaker enthusiast looking for a good strike price on coveted Yeezys \u2014 like getting the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Cream White when it is selling for $380 (original price $220) and not, say, $560 \u2014 but also for those who think of sneakers as a portfolio investment. \u201cWe\u2019re an evolution of eBay,\u201d Mr. Luber said. He added that StockX is now bringing in about $2 million a day in gross merchandise volume.\u201cAfter that, we allowed seven people who bought the shoes to resell without even touching the product,\u201d Mr. Luber said. \u201cThat\u2019s like true day trading.\u201dThese companies are shaking up how the resale market but they suffer from constraints, said Matt Powell, NPD Group\u2019s sports industry analyst.One issue is just how big this market is. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to tell what the true size is because there are always going to be transactions between two private individuals,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a $1 billion market like many are saying it is.\u201d He points to the math: \u201cWhen I look at the sneakers that are resold and then add a factor of three because of the higher resale value, I\u2019m getting closer to $300-$500 million.\u201dWith total sneaker sales in the United States around $38 billion last year, the resale market is still relatively minor, he said.The other obstacle to major growth is inventory; the major resellers specialize in limited-release styles. \u201cIf the manufacturer starts to get greedier,\u201d by increasing the product, \u201ca flood of inventory would crash the market,\u201d Mr. Powell said. Indeed, a glut of Jordans in early 2016 drove that resell market down.The resellers seem largely aware that sneakers can only take them so far. \u201cYes, our main business is sneakers right now but we\u2019re a stock market for things,\u201d Mr. Luber, said. StockX already sells watches, and streetwear from Supreme and Kith. The company has plans to roll out more product from streetwear designers like Fear of God. (Mr. Powell noted that streetwear has the same constraint: \u201cWhat really drives the streetwear market is most of those items are, again, limited in quantity.\u201d)But where the slick new resellers may have a leg up is their combination of product, content and convenience, said Joe La Puma, senior vice president of content strategy at Complex who hosts \u201cSneaker Shopping,\u201d a sneaker program on YouTube.\u201cThe industry is becoming more professionalized but also I\u2019m seeing that the customer is getting choosier about what sneaker he or she wants,\u201d Mr. La Puma said. \u201cSo instead of buying sneakers, say, every week, they\u2019re saving up to buy one shoe they really want.\u201dThat kind of cachet matters in this world and the top resellers all have it, Mr. La Puma emphasized. Sneakerhead consumers pay attention to what celebrities are wearing, he said.\u201cSpecifically, Kanye West, Travis Scott, ASAP Rocky, Virgil Abloh and Jared Leto are influential in their own circles,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every shoe starts out super special. There\u2019s the chance that if one of these celebrities wears it, it may then become super hot.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted the given name of the co-founder and chief executive of GOAT.

Two gouaches made as holiday gifts and several postcards with drawings by LeWitt reside in Mr. Baume\u2019s bedroom.\u201cThe project was the first time he worked with carving and manipulating stone,\u201d Mr. Baume said. \u201cThis figure was a lovely surprise birthday present.\u201dHere are edited excerpts from the conversation.How did you originally get interested in art?It\u2019s only through exposure that you can develop the sensitivity to art. Being involved in public art, I love the idea that it\u2019s making that accessible in a way to people who wouldn\u2019t have the access necessarily.What was an early acquisition?In college, I had a part-time job at a gallery in Sydney. One of the gallery artists, Lindy Lee, made this \u2014 an appropriated image of Jan van Eyck\u2019s \u201cMan in a Red Turban.\u201d Each panel is the same image but Xeroxed, some to the point of oblivion.There was very little market for artists in that Sydney scene at the time. Working at the gallery, I would pay $50 a month for works over a long period. It wasn\u2019t like trying to collect young artists now in New York, which is a very different proposition.I love the subtle color shifts in this LeWitt wall drawing.It\u2019s almost not there, yet very present. It\u2019s this wonderfully simple serial structure of variations and combinations of these four basic colors and four basic kinds of line \u2014 vertical black lines, horizontal yellow, diagonal red and the other diagonal blue.

{"Headline": "The Skeleton in My Closet", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesMy husband, Mark, was a pack rat. So clearing out his belongings after he died suddenly at 57 was a challenge even for a rabid organizer like me. To complicate matters, my two kids and I were moving from a four-bedroom house in the suburbs to a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. Most of what we owned wasn\u2019t coming along.I spent every spare minute making piles: keep, sell, donate, toss. Tucked under the attic eaves were several milk crates of Mark\u2019s old Playboys, Sports Illustrateds and National Geographics, dating back to the 1960s. I sold a few at our moving sale, but the rest sit untouched in a cramped storage unit. I\u2019m guessing the unenviable job of selling them will one day fall to my kids.But one discovery eclipsed them all. Digging through a rarely used closet one night, I opened a Nike shoe box and came face-to-face with a real human skull.My first word was \u201choly\u201d followed by an expletive. Then a hazy memory floated back: My husband, a dentist, was showing me a research skull, the kind dental students use in anatomy class, with metal hinges attaching the lower jaw to each side and two clasps securing the cranium in place. It was the same one I now held. Stamped on the left was a company name \u2014 Clay Adams, Parsippany, N.J. \u2014 an importer of medical supplies.Of all the things I inherited after Mark\u2019s death, the skull topped a long list I call \u201cI Never Wanted This.\u201d It included cabinets crammed with ancient financial documents, a garage and shed bursting with all manner of cobweb-covered gadgets, and shelves of sweaters not worn since the Reagan administration.After we separated, I had imagined that eventually I\u2019d move out and he\u2019d move back in, sparing me this overwhelming job. It was even more fraught because I felt an obligation to my kids, who were just teenagers when he died, to preserve his memory. Would they want his old cameras and slides? His favorite faded blue sweatshirt? If they said no, would they wish they had said yes years from now?Now I felt uneasy. Was it even legal to have this skull in my home? Didn\u2019t it belong in a school or museum?I was angry at Mark for leaving me with it and I wanted to make the skull disappear. I considered burying it in the backyard, the final resting place of my kids\u2019 four gerbils. But I pictured the future homeowners discovering it while gardening one fine spring day. \u201cHoney, what\u2019s this?\u201d the husband would say to his wife, and in a flash a cop from \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d would be grilling me about where I buried the rest of the body.Once we\u2019d moved into our apartment, I hid it in yet another closet, doing my best Scarlett O\u2019Hara: I\u2019ll think about it tomorrow. Tomorrow turned into three years and last summer I finally decided that, unlike those old magazines, I didn\u2019t want my kids to have to deal with this someday. Keeping it in a closet felt wrong and I wasn\u2019t about to display it in my curio cabinet. This skull needed a new home.I also found several reputable companies that trade in human bones. Want a male skull with 25 teeth? How about a Caucasian female with 28 teeth, one broken? Those were two of dozens of skulls \u2014 male and female, old and young \u2014 I found online, available if you\u2019re willing to part with about $2,000.\u201cTypically someone\u2019s parents passed away and they\u2019re cleaning out their belongings and they find the skeleton in the closet or the skull in the attic,\u201d he said, adding that skulls were required for many dental students. \u201cYour husband may have had to purchase it in school for $200, which was quite affordable at the time.\u201dThe skull I had looked smaller than the adult ones online. I went to a mirror and held it next to my head. They were close in size. I sent photos and measurements to Skulls Unlimited. They estimated it was from a 12-year-old, possibly female, likely from India.India? Why would a young girl there donate her body to American science? My question was well meaning but na\u00efve. Turns out that in the 1970s when my husband was in dental school, most skulls came from India, from families too poor to bury or cremate their dead, or because grave robbers dug up bones for profit. India banned the export of human bones in the mid-1980s and China later followed. The skull market soon dried up and prices skyrocketed.I was horrified that this skull might have belonged to a child who suffered such a fate. Questions swirled: Who was her family? How did she die? It was entirely possible she and I were born around the same year. I began to feel an odd mix of maternal tenderness and sisterly kinship for this skull, laced with a hefty dose of \u201cthere but for the grace of God go I.\u201dAlthough I couldn\u2019t return it to its original resting place \u2014 if it ever had one \u2014 maybe it would find peace among other bones that, for whatever reason, had landed far from home.I sold it to Skulls Unlimited and donated the proceeds to a program at Mark\u2019s dental school that provides free dental care to low-income kids. It seemed fitting: A child in India reaches across decades to give a disadvantaged child in New York a reason to smile.I liked knowing that Mark helped make it happen, not because he was a dentist, but because he was a pack rat. Something good emerged from all his clutter. It also feels pretty good to finally have closets in which, as far as I know, there are no more hidden skeletons.Advertisement"}

Now he\u2019s expanding his collection citywide, to showcase his love for all things vintage public schools. Supported byMaybe there is someone more crazy in love with New York City\u2019s public schools than Martin Raskin, but who else would collect a panel of hundred-year-old brass steam heat switches from Brooklyn\u2019s Manual Training High School that closed in 1959? Or load up his car trunk with a boiler gauge from P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village?His mock classroom showcased ink-stained attached desks, Regulator clocks, milky glass chandeliers, tall teacher\u2019s reading chair, class photos, oval brass doorknobs, wardrobe hooks, window pole, yellow report cards, merit certificates, black and white composition notebooks, even the original enamel number plate from his homeroom, 516.It\u2019s all still there, along with Mr. Raskin\u2019s prize piece, the chair splinter extracted from the rear of his principal, Charles G. Eichel, and preserved in an envelope with the (unlucky) date of the encounter, Friday, March 13, 1942. Mr. Raskin had scooped it up along with other discarded P.S. 202 material in the 1980s, a fateful discovery that set off his freely acknowledged obsession, since abetted by eBay, Etsy and other collectibles dealers.But that, it turns out, was only the beginning. \u201cI\u2019m now amassing a shrine to the whole educational system,\u201d Mr. Raskin said.Some items seem particularly historic. An 1805 booklet from the Society for Establishing a Free School in the City of New York for the Education of Poor Children. The June 1942 issue of the Boys High School magazine \u201cRecorder\u201d with the harrowing 1938 diary of a Jewish student who lived through the Nazi annexation of Austria. The author, Harry Lustig, made a narrow escape and became a noted physics professor, provost and vice president at the City College of New York.\u201cI\u2019ve spent a large amount of money \u2014 thousands,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cDon\u2019t say thousands. O.K., you can say it.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t begrudge it. \u201cI feel \u2014 maybe this sounds crazy to you \u2014 I feel I\u2019ve been chosen,\u201d he said. He returns regularly to his elementary alma mater to award scholarships and meet with the children.But now, he said, it was time to consider a better home for his ever-growing collection \u2014 a bow to the eye rolls from his long-resigned domestic partner and fellow teacher, Jerilyn Rubenstein.\u201cThere\u2019s a fire museum, a police museum, a food museum, even a sex museum,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing to honor teachers and students.\u201dHe is not looking to sell the collection and says he does not need a tax deduction.\u201cI want this done before I\u2019m 80,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Martin Raskin Room of Education. It doesn\u2019t need to have my name.\u201dThe city\u2019s Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers have taken note. How often does an unabashed admirer like Mr. Raskin come along?\u201cMarty is passionate about the promise of public schools,\u201d Mr. Arias said.\u201cHe\u2019s a rare bird,\u201d agreed Tom Murphy, a former U.F.T. political legislative director and leader of the Retired Teachers chapter who recently presented Mr. Raskin with a chinaware cup and saucer from Tottenville High School on Staten Island.The U.F.T. gave Mr. Raskin three tables to show off his collection at its Spring Education Conference at the New York Hilton on Saturday. He also exhibited at the teacher retirement conference in Florida in February.Once the largest high school in the country, finished in 1927 and broken up as a failing school into four smaller components in 2014, the columned Greek Revival colossus (alma mater of Art Buchwald, Paul Bowles and Francis Ford Coppola) drew oohs and aahs from Mr. Raskin, starting with the weathervane-topped copper-clad cupola and copper-edged clock in the pediment. \u201cLook at the brass doors!\u201d Mr. Raskin marveled. \u201cLook at the marble! Look at this brass banister!\u201dMr. Raskin stood in awe of a wall of vintage staff mailboxes. \u201cAlberto, this is what blew me away,\u201d he said. Mr. Arias reached in and pulled out a piece of mail from 2013, untouched for five years. \u201cAnd I have the dust to prove it,\u201d he said.For all his loquaciousness, Mr. Raskin turns uncharacteristically tongue-tied when asked to explain his passion for the public schools. \u201cGrowing up in Brooklyn in the 1950s, the school was central,\u201d he finally begins. \u201cIt was the life.

{"Headline": "At Rockefeller Auction, They Came. They Bid. They Mostly Lost.", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristopher Gohr had never attended an auction before \u2014 just \u201ceBay and stuff like that\u201d \u2014 and the one he walked into at Christie\u2019s was a dizzying place to start.The collection of David and Peggy Rockefeller, a vast trove of paintings, furniture, porcelain and other treasures, was on the block over three days, with Wednesday offering some of the relative bargains.\u201cFive-6-7-800 dollars already!\u201d the auctioneer announced, as bids came in at a frenetic pace.A split second later, $1,000. At $1,200 Mr. Gohr finally raised his paddle. Someone in the room bid $1,300. $1,500 from an online buyer in Hong Kong. Mr. Gohr\u2019s arm went up at $2,000, his self-imposed cap.No matter: A telephone bidder pushed the price to $2,400. The bid won the tea caddy, and with the buyer\u2019s commission tacking on another $600, it came in at six times the estimate.\u201cI definitely went a little more than I thought I was going to,\u201d Mr. Gohr, 48, said afterward, still processing what had happened. \u201cOnce I hit my cap, it was like, \u2018O.K., what the heck?\u2019\u201dThe pieces on sale Wednesday were more accessibly priced at three and four figures. Bidders without multiple estates could sit in the same room where, just the night before, a Picasso sold for $115 million, a Monet for $85 million (an auction high for the artist) and a Matisse for $81 million (ditto).But those like Mr. Gohr who filed into Christie\u2019s Rockefeller Center headquarters discovered that they were not the only ones drawn by the Rockefeller mystique.Among those who came up short was Diane Wolf, who traveled to Christie\u2019s from York, Pa. She and her husband own a company that makes corrugated boxes and live in a restored farmhouse that Ms. Wolf thought would be a great home for some Rockefeller antiques. She bid $4,000 on a John Berridge painting from around the late 1700s.The final hammer price was $4,200. \u201cI probably should\u2019ve gone one more time,\u201d Ms. Wolf, 60, said.Demand was so high because few other sales have matched this scale and level of anticipation. Among aficionados, it is in the league of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate auction at Sotheby\u2019s in 1996; the Elizabeth Taylor jewelry sale at Christie\u2019s in 2011; and the Yves Saint Laurent sale at Christie\u2019s in Paris in 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those magical sales that happens maybe once a decade where everyone is so exuberant, particularly for the decorative arts,\u201d said Barbara Deisroth, a veteran decorative arts adviser.\u201cThe auctioneers put the estimate out on what they are worth today,\u201d Ms. Deisroth said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re unable to factor in what the upside will be with the celebrity part of it. Is it going to be 10 percent? Is it going to be 50 percent? Or is it going to be 500 percent?\u201dAbout 50 people showed up to bid, while 30 or so Christie\u2019s staff members operated phone banks for those calling in. A screen at the back of the room indicated if an online bid, was coming in along with the geographical origin of the bid. Most of the winning bids came from outside the room.\u201cYou don\u2019t pass up opportunities like this,\u201d Mr. Polunsky said.The candlesticks were estimated to go for $1,500 to $2,500. Mr. Polunsky bid $4,000. The final price was $6,875.\u201cI think it\u2019ll look very nice in my office,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI probably will have to reupholster it.\u201dMr. Gohr, the line cook, left without any Rockefeller pieces, or regrets. \u201cIt\u2019s more or less a bucket list thing, to come to somebody\u2019s famous auction and just to be in the room and actually have a chance to bid on something,\u201d he said. He even dressed in a suit and tie: \u201cOrdinarily, it\u2019s just jeans and a T-shirt.\u201dOne of the hottest items online, a 14-karat-gold money clip depicting Rockefeller Center, was estimated to go for around $1,200.Advertisement"}

All of which makes it a perfect product to steal.New Port Richey, perched on a knuckle of Gulf Coast 35 miles northwest of Tampa, is a typically Floridian enclave of strip malls, subdivisions and brackish waterways. During the 1920s, it enjoyed a brief period of glamour when professional golfers and silent-film actors bought land, built handsome homes and socialized with visiting stars from Broadway and vaudeville at the Hacienda Hotel. But the town owed much of its success to the first of Florida\u2019s many real estate bubbles, and the fantasy ended around 1925, dashing forever New Port Richey boosters\u2019 hopes of its becoming a kind of Hollywood East.By November 2005, when Alexis and Ronald Dattadeen bought a home there \u2014 a cozy ranch house shaded by a generous oak \u2014 it was just another Tampa suburb. Alexis and Ronald, who were in their mid-20s, had recently welcomed their first child, A., and within a few years they had another son, D. (The children in this article are identified by their first initial only.) Like his brother, D. had dark hair and big brown eyes. But D. also had a rare genetic disorder that would require many visits over the years to gastroenterologists, neurologists and hospitals.Ronald worked long hours for low pay, maintaining pools during the day and scrubbing operating rooms at night. Alexis, who had held jobs sterilizing medical equipment and wrangling phone lines at a hospital, found D.\u2019s unpredictable need for medical attention incompatible with even part-time employment. You could change schedules only so many times before exasperating even the most understanding manager. And she soon found upsides to staying home \u2014 napping with D. during the day; the satisfactions of a clean car, folded laundry, the waft of pot roast from the oven. But homemaking could be boring and lonely \u2014 and Dattadeen wasn\u2019t earning any money, further limiting her life outside the house.In 2011, when D. was 2, Dattadeen had a realization: She could be selling her excess baby formula. D. needed an expensive brand called EleCare, which was designed for easy digestion. Dattadeen got it through Medicaid, and it arrived at her home automatically from a medical supplier. She always ended up with extra cans, so she posted an ad on Craigslist and quickly found a buyer, a man who indicated that the formula would go to a child in need. But before long, a second buyer \u2014 a buyer who would prove far more lucrative \u2014 responded to the ad. Her name was Alicia Tondreau-Leve.Dattadeen and Tondreau-Leve first met in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot about an hour\u2019s drive from New Port Richey. Soon Tondreau-Leve became a repeat client, meeting Dattadeen every few weeks to buy some of the EleCare. During one of their first meetings, Tondreau-Leve explained that she had a business distributing excess powdered formula to needy families. Dattadeen expressed interest in the venture, and Tondreau-Leve soon agreed to bring her aboard \u2014 emphasizing, though, that she wasn\u2019t an employer. Dattadeen would be an independent contractor, sourcing formula for resale to Tondreau-Leve. As in a multilevel marketing operation, her success would depend on her ability to create a large network. Still, for Dattadeen, the benefits would be manifold: She could set her own hours, earning an income while tending to D.\u2019s appointments.Like Mary Kay or Amway, Tondreau-Leve provided a start-up guide. She showed Dattadeen how to replicate a Craigslist ad she had been posting to promote the business. It had an elegant logo \u2014 a silhouette of a woman with flowing hair holding an infant aloft. \u201cFormula Mom,\u201d it read. \u201cHelping Other Moms ... Helps You!\u201d The ad outlined Formula Mom\u2019s services: free pickups and cash payments for brands including Gerber, Enfamil and Similac. Dattadeen would swap in her own phone number and a Formula Mom email address that Tondreau-Leve suggested she create. There was an invoice template and a price guide with photos of the formulas Tondreau-Leve accepted. She instructed Dattadeen not to stray far from the Tampa area and advised her to meet sellers in public places. Later, she even provided business cards.To help her get started, Tondreau-Leve gave Dattadeen a few leads. Craigslist ads \u2014 answering and posting them \u2014 yielded additional sellers, and Dattadeen\u2019s first weeks were successful. Attentive and patient, Tondreau-Leve guided her by phone and text. \u201cThat\u2019s great that you are so willing to help,\u201d Dattadeen texted her in early 2012. \u201cWe will make a great team.\u201d\u201cYes we will,\u201d Tondreau-Leve replied, \u201cYou have the same drive that I have.\u201dDattadeen was included in business decisions, providing input on flyer design and marketing. One day, she had an idea of her own. To make things more official and to better track sales, she thought, they should provide sellers with receipts. Taking initiative, she went to an Office Depot and designed a prototype. But before returning to print copies, she mentioned the idea to Tondreau-Leve, who saw things differently. Receipts wouldn\u2019t work for Formula Mom, Tondreau-Leve said, because that would leave a paper trail.A market with so little competition is bound to have generous margins, and formula makers have grown richer still because a single buyer accounts for roughly half of all domestic sales: the United States government. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, commonly known as WIC, provides needy mothers with cash assistance for certain foods, including powdered formula. When it began, in 1972, WIC represented a fresh, lush source of inelastic demand, by effectively eliminating from the formula market those customers most sensitive to price. During the \u201980s, formula prices rose by more than 150 percent, vastly outpacing increases in milk costs. By the middle of that decade, formula was absorbing 40 percent of WIC\u2019s food budget, prompting shortfalls that shunted many eligible families to a waiting list.In the \u201990s, the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights; the Federal Trade Commission; and attorneys general from 19 states pursued formula manufacturers for price-fixing and illicit marketing. Multimillion-dollar fines were assessed, but no firm admitted wrongdoing. Even today, formula prices bear the imprint of yesteryear\u2019s state-enabled gouging; according to a 2009 report by the Notre Dame economist David Betson, \u201cthe WIC program accounts for 91 percent of the increase in the growth of real formula prices\u201d between 1981 and 2002.Products like formula \u2014 expensive but with slim retail margins \u2014 are vulnerable to black-marketeers. Independent store owners, for example, don\u2019t buy enough formula to qualify for the bulk discounts that manufacturers offer big chains. But if they can acquire off-market formula at subwholesale prices and resell it for the usual rates, they can improve their bottom lines.By the middle of 2012, Dattadeen\u2019s formula business began to thrive. But certain irregularities emerged in her supply chain. Some of her \u201ccustomers,\u201d as she called the people from whom she bought formula, would sell her three to 10 cans every few weeks. That seemed about right. Why, after all, would anyone have more leftover formula than that? But others routinely had much more. There was a woman named Julie who met Dattadeen regularly, sometimes with more than $1,000 worth of formula. A couple named Krystal and Chris offered 80 to 150 cans at each transaction. Another couple, Brian and Jessica, often showed up to meetings with so much formula that they had to load it into their trunk.Dattadeen listened to explanations from such sellers about their sources: an aunt with a baby store, a warehouse-based wholesaling business. But when Dattadeen voiced reservations about them to Tondreau-Leve, Tondreau-Leve suggested that she accept the stories at face value, or adopt a don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell attitude. This all seemed out of step with a business predicated on buying up surplus product, but it soon became clear that Formula Mom did not function quite as advertised; Tondreau-Leve seemed most interested in \u201ccustomers\u201d who could offer formula in bulk. To ensure that Dattadeen could handle these large purchases, Tondreau-Leve had her set up an account with Bank of America, and wired her cash in advance of sales. Tondreau-Leve even began making requests. \u201cI need 35 Similac Advance cans,\u201d she wrote in a text message. \u201cCan you see if Julie can get that for us?\u201dDattadeen quickly found good uses for her new income. In June 2012, she traveled to a medical conference in Illinois for D. That July, she bought a new minivan, texting a photo to Tondreau-Leve. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe my dream is parked up in my driveway,\u201d she wrote. She bought a walker for D. and enrolled A. in the Cub Scouts. A. \u201cis going to call you tonight, to try and sell you popcorn for boyscouts,\u201d Dattadeen texted Tondreau-Leve soon after. \u201cIts more of a teaching thing for him so don\u2019t feel obligated to buy. I just had him make a list of everyone we are close to.\u201dDattadeen\u2019s social life had been limited, and perhaps as much as her job, she seemed to value the friendship that had blossomed between her and Tondreau-Leve. \u201cI missed talking to you today!!!! GIRLFRIEND,\u201d she texted in October 2012. \u201cDo u realize we\u2019ve known each other for like a year now.\u201dFifteen years older than Dattadeen, Tondreau-Leve had studied computer science at college; she was logical and organized \u2014 everything Dattadeen wasn\u2019t. But like Dattadeen, she had two sons. Her husband, a salesman, was often away from home, so she, too, was frequently alone. In Dattadeen she\u2019d found an openhearted prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, ever eager to please. Dattadeen sometimes called her Momma. Once, when Tondreau-Leve was swindled by an out-of state seller, she called Dattadeen in tears. When Dattadeen fought with her husband, Tondreau-Leve offered counsel. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for pushing him away,\u201d she texted. \u201cHe has to see that you still love him, but he has to build the relationship again.\u201d Outside work, they met for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, took their boys camping and saw a Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert. In 2013, Dattadeen took her first real vacation in years, staying not far from Tondreau-Leve\u2019s home on the Atlantic coast so that they could spend time together. On her last night in town, Dattadeen sent her a text: \u201cYou are the best friend a woman can have.\u201dLoss prevention is the rare topic about which competing retailers will trade intelligence, and from talking to his counterparts at Walmart, Target and Walgreens, Shultz learned that they were losing large volumes of formula, too. That sort of overlap tended to rule out the employee theft that often accounts for large-scale pilferage. To store-security officers and local cops, who were addressing the crimes on a case-by-case basis, the incidents didn\u2019t appear related. But Shultz had a unique perch, and as he dug deeper, the thefts began to take on a pattern \u2014 the work, he believed, of organized crime.Shultz joined Publix in 2006 after a long, varied career in law enforcement \u2014 time on the homicide squad in Plant City, Fla.; stints embedded with the United States Marshals and the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014 and was soon assigned to a newly created position, Organized Retail Crime (O.R.C.) Investigator, to help stem what retailers had come to recognize as a growing problem. Bob Moraca, the vice president of loss prevention at the National Retail Federation (N.R.F.), a trade group, says that in the last few years, O.R.C., which accounts for $30 billion in annual losses in the United States, has overtaken \u201cinternal shrink\u201d \u2014 that is, employee theft \u2014 as the greatest threat to retailers\u2019 bottom line. A 2016 survey by the N.R.F. found that 100 percent of respondents \u2014 a sample representing thousands of stores \u2014 had been victimized in the last 12 months by organized crime, more than in any other year.Retail-crime groups generally share a pyramidal structure: a boss up top, captains and lieutenants below and professional shoplifters, or \u201cboosters,\u201d at the base. The internet has been catalytic, providing those without underworld ties new ways of fencing goods: auction sites and payment methods that facilitate anonymity. Prime targets include clothing and handbags \u2014 expensive, high-demand goods that are relatively easy to conceal \u2014 as well as top-shelf liquor, pain-killers and laptops. Pharmacy wares are favorites, too. In 2008, Shultz helped neutralize a theft ring dealing in health and beauty products. The following year, he broke up a group of middle-aged Florida men who sometimes feigned infirmity \u2014 affecting a limp, using a motorized cart \u2014 to help them relieve retailers of countless razor blades. The third-most-targeted item, according to the 2016 N.R.F. report, was infant formula.Shultz\u2019s formula inquiry began in the usual way, with information flowing to him from lower-level personnel \u2014 mostly video and photo stills depicting shoplifters in various stages of the act. Shultz noted that the thefts did not seem attributable to people stealing for personal use \u2014 they were taking way too much. And they were craftier than your run-of-the-mill smash-and-grabber. One man, in Orlando, liked to select an opaque, lidded storage bin from a sales display, fill it with formula, then proceed through the exit doors, brandishing a phony receipt for the bin. Others worked in teams. One couple used their children as camouflage, stowing their take in a specialized diaper bag that retained its shape empty or full. Another hid formula in a stroller with a spacious undercarriage. Many thieves favored reusable Walmart bags, which had the advantage of a substantial, precise capacity: 18 12.5-ounce cans of formula (three layers of six), or nine 1.45-pound tubs (three layers of three).As Shultz identified repeat offenders, he circulated the footage to other stores he considered likely targets for the same thieves. But clever boosters are difficult to apprehend; store-security officers serve a largely deterrent purpose, and cashiers and stock clerks cannot be expected to confront criminals. To improve its prospects, Publix stepped up inventory checks in formula aisles, enabling the company to zero in on the window during which a theft occurred, alert nearby stores and swiftly fold the data into the case file.One night in July 2012, Shultz got a break \u2014 a phone call from a Publix in Pinellas County, about 20 miles from Tampa. Police officers there had apprehended a couple trying to steal 13 cans of formula. Shultz recognized them from security footage. They made a striking pair; slender, with brown hair, the woman looked slight beside her partner, a lumbering man with an ex-lineman\u2019s physique. Now, under arrest, they had names: Jessica Gordon and Brian Oliver, both about 30. Shultz hoped they could provide some clue about the organization he suspected they were working for. In an interview with Gordon arranged by the Pinellas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, he learned that the couple had two buyers. One proved, after a brief investigation, to be an online business trading in quantities too small to explain the losses retailers were seeing.The other was a 32-year-old woman named Alexis Dattadeen.One evening in September 2012, Dattadeen pulled her minivan into a Walmart parking lot in Palm Harbor, a community south of New Port Richey. Soon, Oliver arrived, driven by someone Dattadeen had never met. She got out of her car and greeted Oliver, who hulked over her in a green polo shirt. \u201cNice to see you again,\u201d she said, hugging him. The other man was introduced as Donnie. His real name was George Moffett \u2014 and he was a Pinellas County sheriff\u2019s deputy. From an unmarked car, another officer filmed the exchange. \u201cI\u2019ve stolen a lot of [expletive] in my day,\u201d Moffett says in the video. \u201cBut this [expletive] was hard.\u201d Dattadeen smiles bashfully, but doesn\u2019t otherwise respond. Moffett presents himself as Oliver\u2019s source. In his trunk are 90 tubs and 18 cans of Similac formula, which had been provided to the sheriff\u2019s department by Publix. \u201cSo you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s been getting all this?\u201d Dattadeen asks. \u201cDo you have a number \u2014 I could call you?\u201dIn the coming weeks, Dattadeen met \u201cDonnie\u201d three more times. In recordings of their interactions, she speaks in a high, soft voice, with the scattered animation of a teenager. Details about Formula Mom pour forth: Dattadeen has a partner, near Orlando, whom she meets on Mondays; the formula is shipped to Massachusetts, and also to China. \u201cShe\u2019s not as easygoing as I am,\u201d she said once, referring to Tondreau-Leve. \u201cI can tell you that.\u201dIn October, Shultz drove to a gas station off Interstate 4, which connects Orlando and Tampa. He had been guided there by the Pinellas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which had relayed intelligence to him about Dattadeen\u2019s movements gleaned from a GPS tracker that it had attached to her van. At the rear of the parking lot, he found Dattadeen\u2019s van backed against a white fence, with slats spaced widely enough that he could shoot video through them. Beside it, another van had backed in. Both trunks yawned open. Dattadeen and a woman unknown to Shultz moved formula from one van to the other. \u201cWhite female, appears to be middle-aged \u2014 late 40s, early 50s, shorter hair,\u201d Shultz narrates, describing the stranger over a Rascal Flatts song playing from his radio. \u201cMultiple cans of formula,\u201d he says. \u201cMultiple, multiple stacks.\u201d After the transfer was complete, Shultz followed the older woman to a house about 15 miles away, taking down a license-plate number that he traced to a rental contract signed by one Alicia Tondreau-Leve.Not long before Tondreau-Leve moved to Florida, Alan\u2019s cousin, Michael, presented her with an opportunity. He knew the secondary retail market well, having for years run a store in Massachusetts that took a commission for selling customers\u2019 goods on eBay. He suggested that formula might earn her some extra money: She could buy unused cans from Florida moms and ship them to him. Initially, Tondreau-Leve had little sense of how to go about things, so she simply did what she could; if she had to drive 15 miles to buy two cans, so be it. Gas costs could exceed the value of her purchases, but she viewed the legwork as an investment. Eventually, she learned to schedule all her deals in a given metro area \u2014 Tampa, say \u2014 on the same day. When she\u2019d gathered enough formula to fill a moving box, she shipped it to Michael, profiting about $2 per can.If Tondreau-Leve ever began to sense that her business was mutating from a wholesome D.I.Y. venture into something malignant, there was little in her outward presentation to suggest it. Soon after moving in, she told Cindy Lashomb, who lived next door with her husband, about a company she\u2019d started, dealing in surplus infant formula. There was nothing secret about it, Lashomb told me; Tondreau-Leve even affixed a magnet advertising the business to her car. Another neighbor, Donald Egan, knew about the business, too; he discerned in Tondreau-Leve the makings of a mogul, once describing her as \u201cthe pants in the family. She ran everything. You could tell by her attitude and the way she approached you that she was the alpha male, so to speak.\u201dIn the spring of 2012, Lashomb began to suspect that something was not quite right next door. Suddenly, it seemed, trucks were always coming and going, picking things up or dropping them off. Lashomb complained to Tondreau-Leve, but the traffic worsened \u2014 UPS deliveries gave way to tractor-trailers. Once, an 18-wheeler blocked the Lashombs\u2019 driveway, trapping them at home.Tondreau-Leve eventually shifted operations to a storage facility, renting a single unit, then a double, filling it to capacity with head-high stacks of formula. By early 2013, Formula Mom had statewide reach. A woman named April covered Fort Myers. A man named Angel, who owned a consignment store, handled Miami. Giulyanna took care of Orlando. To each subcontractor, Tondreau-Leve provided the same start-up guide. Each set up a Bank of America account. Having some experience with consignment stores, Dattadeen voiced concerns about Angel\u2019s supply, which arrived in huge quantities \u2014 a fact she happened to notice during a drop-off at Tondreau-Leve\u2019s storage unit. But Tondreau-Leve dismissed them. Having expanded her network, Tondreau-Leve was less dependent on Dattadeen, and she had cooled on her, berating her over botched invoices, and comparing her unfavorably with her other deputies.Demand had meanwhile grown alongside supply. That year, Tondreau-Leve stopped selling to Michael in favor of a California woman named Lissette, who ran a formula-wholesale business. Lissette had contacted Tondreau-Leve online, offering her a much better price than Michael did. By playing Lissette off yet another buyer, in Wisconsin, Tondreau-Leve negotiated an even better rate. Buyers from New York and New Jersey materialized, too. Tondreau-Leve did not much trouble herself about what became of her formula after she sold it, but the buyers mostly seemed to be wholesalers, redistributing the product to small stores. At least one owned a Brooklyn bodega, and Tondreau-Leve knew that Lissette had customers in China, where a tainted-formula scare in 2008 had stoked demand for foreign brands, which were seen as safer.Between January 2012 and July 2014, records from several freight carriers indicate that Tondreau-Leve shipped a total of roughly 60 tons of product. During that period, she received nearly $300,000 from her California client, $300,000 from buyers in Wisconsin and nearly $1 million from New York City buyers. No longer a neophyte, she proved herself an able businesswoman, adept at navigating complex logistics. In missives to underlings, she presents as a sober, precise manager. \u201cI appreciate everyone\u2019s patience over the last couple of months,\u201d she once wrote. \u201cBecause of the Chinese market not taking formula from the U.S., it has left a surplus of Nutramigen and Alimentum in everyone\u2019s hands. Hopefully now that the doors are open again in China, we will see some of this product move.\u201dHaving worked several previous RICO cases, Newcomb was familiar with the methods of the genre \u2014 turning lowly button men against capos and so on. But this time, rather than work up the chain of command, Newcomb would establish a pattern of criminality at the base of the pyramid, sketching a fuller portrait of the enterprise. Using a criminal informant to conduct a controlled sale, Newcomb quickly identified \u201cJulie\u201d as 30-year-old Giulyanna Guzman, Tondreau-Leve\u2019s Orlando deputy.One such supplier was Janine Piccirillo, who\u2019d learned the formula racket from a friend: what to look for; how to get it; and, most important, that there was a woman named Julie who would always buy it. Piccirillo could often manage to make off with two Walmart bags full of formula at a time \u2014 roughly $550 worth at retail. She worked with a driver, Jennifer Day, who would obscure her license plate with a sheet of paper and wait outside. They might hit three stores in a day. After selling their haul to Guzman, Piccirillo and Day usually drove straight to see their dealer.One day in 2013, Day was dope-sick, and went to work alone, visiting a Publix in the morning. Noticing someone filming her with a phone, she left and drove to Walmart. Her symptoms were worsening, and she resolved to steal as much as she could, leaving the store with a bag on each arm. But when she reached the parking lot, she was swarmed by masked police officers with their guns drawn.When I met him recently at an Orange County police station, Newcomb grinned at the memory, explaining that they\u2019d thought Day might be armed \u2014 she\u2019d been surveilled for about a month, and had once been observed leaving a gun shop. During the arrest, Guzman, who was listed in Day\u2019s phone as Formula Mom, called repeatedly \u2014 Day was late for their meeting. She also had numbers saved for Alicia and Alan Leve. In all, Newcomb said, he identified about 15 boosters associated with Guzman. I asked how many were drug users. He paused, considering. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a single one who wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Most if not all were addicted to opioids \u2014 using heroin, prescription painkillers or both.That April, an F.D.L.E. agent named Shawn Sloan went to the Dattadeens\u2019 home, accompanied by Shultz, hoping to turn Dattadeen against Tondreau-Leve. They did not lack leverage; Dattadeen had repeatedly discussed buying stolen property on tape. When her predicament was made clear to her, she quickly agreed to cooperate. Following Sloan\u2019s instructions, in a recorded meeting later that month \u2014 a meeting during which she was terribly nervous \u2014 Dattadeen told Tondreau-Leve that she didn\u2019t want to work with her anymore. Some of her suppliers, she said, were making her uncomfortable, particularly a man named Steve, who had said he could get whole shipping pallets\u2019 worth of formula.The ploy worked. Soon after their conversation, Tondreau-Leve contacted Dattadeen to ask for Steve\u2019s number. Dattadeen obliged. The phone number she provided belonged to William Powell, an F.D.L.E. agent posing as a supplier. \u201cGood morning,\u201d Tondreau-Leve texted him in early May. \u201cMy name is Alicia, and I received your number from Alexis.\u201d Powell/Steve wrote back: \u201cI can get it pretty regular, and Alexis said you\u2019re reliable.\u201dThe next day, Powell met Alicia and Alan in a CVS parking lot near their home, selling them 65 Similac tubs, which he indicated he\u2019d gotten from his brother, a Publix employee. As represented to Powell, Tondreau-Leve\u2019s vision of Formula Mom had changed markedly; she made no mention of needy mothers, of redistributing formula in the community. \u201cI\u2019m the go-to person here in Florida,\u201d she says in a recording of the meeting. \u201cI have an endless amount of money basically.\u201d Over the next month, they met twice more. Tondreau-Leve repeatedly sought assurances: \u201cPlease confirm that these cans are acquired legally!\u201d she texted when she first made contact. But when Powell equivocated, as invariably he did, she didn\u2019t seem deterred. \u201cI\u2019d love to know where he\u2019s getting it from,\u201d she says during their second meeting, meaning the brother. When Powell tells her, \u201cEverything\u2019s good, Alicia,\u201d for a moment on the recording, she appears flustered: \u201cNo, not \u2018everything\u2019s good,\u2019 because, you know, I don\u2019t steal \u2014 I don\u2019t buy stolen.\u201d Then she resumes loading her purchase.On July 2, Tondreau-Leve arranged to meet Powell in a Lowe\u2019s parking lot for what was to be the largest deal of her career: 3,300 tubs of formula \u2014 six pallets\u2019 worth. The load had a retail value of about $85,000. Tondreau-Leve had agreed to pay $33,000 in cash, which she stored for some days before the transaction in a coffee can on her kitchen counter. In the days beforehand, she seemed to overcome her trepidation about the formula\u2019s origins, texting Powell requests for future orders: 2,000 Similac Advance cans, 400 Enfamil boxes, Similac Go-and-Grow. But on the morning of the deal, after the pallets were transferred from Powell\u2019s truck to the one Tondreau-Leve had rented, she and her husband, who accompanied her that day, were arrested. Amid a blare of sirens from unmarked cars stationed in the lot, the police descended from all sides. Still in character, Powell cried out, \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to us, Alicia?\u201dWe were sitting in a sparsely decorated corner suite in Bondi\u2019s Tampa office with Paul Dontenville, the lead prosecutor in the case, and Nicholas Cox, Florida\u2019s statewide prosecutor. Before us on a table lay a binder of Formula Mom price lists and invoices. The documents made a polished, professional presentation. They suggested pride of ownership, looking to me not at all like the work of someone trying to hide something. I asked Dontenville if, for an organized crime boss, Tondreau-Leve hadn\u2019t gone about things in a rather unusual fashion. She had registered her company with the state \u2014 displaying related paperwork inside her rented storage unit \u2014 and handled payments via commercial wire transfer. She had printed business cards and sent email that amounted to evidence of conspiracy. Clean cut and rigidly matter-of-fact, Dontenville declined to ruminate on the subject. He\u2019d been surprised, though, when he received discovery materials from the defense, that they included Tondreau-Leve\u2019s text messages, which she hadn\u2019t been required to provide. Tondreau-Leve evidently considered them exculpatory; Dontenville found them useful in making his case.Before trial, the prosecutors presented a deal that would have meant much less prison time for Alicia and mere probation for Alan. But the charges to which they were asked to plead apparently did not comport with their sense of their actions, or of themselves. They turned the deal down. Soon after, the Leves met for a voluntary pretrial interview with prosecutors, during which they insisted stubbornly that Alicia had run a legitimate business. She had worked hard and become successful. If she\u2019d erred, it had been through na\u00efvet\u00e9, trusting the wrong people. She was a business owner like any other, victimized by dishonest underlings.Last July, I went to see Dattadeen at her house in New Port Richey. When I pulled up, she was outside, hanging wet towels and bathing suits. She wore a tank top and had a reddish tan, her hair damp and straight. From the corner of her mouth, she smoked a cigarette. She spoke in a high, soft voice \u2014 the voice from the surveillance footage \u2014 but she\u2019d grown less trusting than she was then, regarding me warily and declining to speak in detail about her experiences with Tondreau-Leve. Formula Mom had been a mistake, and she was moving on with her life. Ronald came outside and we talked in the deepening dusk under a full yellow moon. When Dattadeen went to make a call, Ronald asked me, a little bashfully, about \u201cthe lady,\u201d meaning Tondreau-Leve. When I told him she was in prison, he looked sorry. Then he said: \u201cThe others admitted they were wrong. She was in denial.\u201dWhen Dattadeen and Tondreau-Leve were still close, Tondreau-Leve often spoke to her of her anger at losing the home she and her husband had owned in Massachusetts \u2014 a stately four-bedroom Colonial on an acre of land. Visiting from Florida, while Alan was still living there, she found it so upsetting to be in the house, which she knew by then that they would lose, that she sometimes preferred to spend time in a rented R.V. Formula Mom became a means of redemption and reinvention. The Leves had been renting in Florida, but about five months before their arrest, they began thinking of buying property: Lot 6HH at Tralee Bay Estates, a new development where the homes had granite countertops, Bosch appliances and \u201cTuscan-inspired architecture.\u201dWhen law-enforcement officers spoke of Tondreau-Leve \u201cinsulating\u201d herself, they meant it in a legal sense, that the layered structure of Formula Mom had made prosecuting her more difficult. But Tondreau-Leve\u2019s regional deputies also largely buffered her from the sad, grimy underpinnings of her business: the furtive meetings in parking lots; the twitching, nauseated victims of dope-sickness. In a way, the architecture of her organization had insulated her too from a damning kind of self-knowledge, even as her daily duties \u2014 arranging cross-country shipments, negotiating rates, collating spreadsheets, tracking policy changes \u2014 encouraged her to indulge an entrepreneurial delusion. It seemed likely that what Tondreau-Leve knew or should have known had been at least partly occluded by what she badly wanted to believe.On July 2, 2014, when she drove to the Lowe\u2019s parking lot, Tondreau-Leve took with her an immaculate-looking receipt made out to Steve Riley, the full name provided to her by Agent Powell. It had been perhaps two years since she\u2019d told Dattadeen not to pick up her prototype receipt from Office Depot, and Formula Mom had become a different kind of company. In the pretrial interview, she would tell Dontenville that in her last transaction, she believed she was buying from Publix at a wholesale rate. At the top of the receipt for Riley, she\u2019d printed the Formula Mom logo \u2014 the woman with flowing hair holding an infant aloft.Chris Pomorski is a freelance writer who has contributed to The Guardian, New York, and Bloomberg Businessweek.

{"Headline": "The Leibers Are Gone. But Their Bling Is Back.", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne summer day in the mid-1990s, as she recounts it, Beth Gorenfeld was at her booth at the Sag Harbor Whaling & Historical Museum\u2019s antique show when two women made a beeline to her handbags. \u201cThey both stood looking at the bags for a while,\u201d Ms. Gorenfeld, a reseller of vintage fashion items, recalled earlier this month. \u201cI told them, \u2018These are my Judith Leibers.\u2019\u201d\u201cI know, dear,\u201d one of the women replied. \u201cI\u2019m Judith Leiber. Why are these bags so expensive?\u201dThe Collection reopened on Saturday with an era-defining exhibition, \u201cA Marriage of True Minds Remembered,\u201d displaying about 380 rarely seen bags. There are also four new Gerson Leiber paintings on view for the first time. The show contains one of the few known Leiber-to-Leiber pairings, \u201cThe Much Admired,\u201d in which Mr. Leiber\u2019s oil portrait of two fashionable night owls inspired his wife\u2019s corresponding handbag.The wit and whimsy of the Leibers\u2019 work will be celebrated at the East Hampton Library on June 23. And the Leiber Collection will hold a memorial garden tea party for the Leibers on July 28.The show summarizes a poignant love story even as it memorializes an era whose midcentury standards of elegance and wit have begun to recede. The Leibers\u2019 story began in Budapest in 1945. The future Mrs. Leiber \u2014 then Judith Peto \u2014 had escaped capture during the Holocaust by hiding inside a Swiss safe house.Mr. Leiber, serving in the United States Army, was stationed in the city as a Signal Corps radio operator. After the liberation, Miss Peto was outside peddling handmade purses when Sergeant Leiber strolled by. The two struck up a romance and were married the following year in the Petos\u2019 living room. Together they came to New York and moved into a hardscrabble work space near the Empire State Building.While Mr. Leiber completed his art studies, Mrs. Leiber worked for designers like Nettie Rosenstein, then opened her own label in 1963. Thanks in part to the publicity generated by a succession of first ladies toting her clutches to their husbands\u2019 inaugurations, the brand took flight. Mrs. Leiber wryly dismissed the notion that she was an artist; museum directors and gallery owners thought otherwise. Harold Koda, the longtime curator with the Costume Institute at the Met until he retired in 2016, was one of many influential collectors.The Leibers sold their business in 1993 for a reported $16 million to $18 million. In semiretirement, Mr. Leiber painted nearly every day while his wife haunted vintage markets, high-end consignment shops and later online auctions to track down her creations. Over all, Mrs. Leiber designed about 3,500 unique handbags, purses and accessories, according to Ms. Stewart. \u201cMrs. Leiber wanted to own a copy of each original bag and eventually put them on display,\u201d she said.Kelly Ellman, a fashion enthusiast and philanthropist from Paradise Valley, Ariz., has donated about three dozen bags, including the Judith Leiber Hollywood bag \u2014 a black carryall with silver stars recalling the iconic mountainside sign.Deftly preserving the tension between easy-access pop culture and luxury consumerism \u2014 her fanciest containers now fetch $6,000 and up \u2014 Mrs. Leiber\u2019s Hollywood bag, like many of her others, is pop art you can carry stuff in. \u201cThe bags are whimsical,\u201d Ms. Ellman said, adding: \u201cJudy was inspired by pop culture, as she was inspired by animals like frogs and pigs. Her bags are charming and beautiful, the craftsmanship impeccable. And yes, they are art.\u201dTina Plesset of East Hampton donated a 1967 chatelaine owned by her mother. The purse \u201cwas Judith Leiber\u2019s first metal handbag,\u201d Ms. Stewart said in an email. Mrs. Leiber \u201cwanted a metal handbag that \u2018the ladies\u2019 would not need to store in a safe deposit box, so she made it in gold-plated and silver-plated brass.\u201d Ms. Plesset said that her mother had worn it to the opera.\u201cWhen my mother gave it to me, I knew that unfortunately I wouldn\u2019t use it except perhaps occasionally,\u201d Ms. Plesset said. \u201cStyles have changed.

{"Headline": "Is Trump\u2019s Tax Incoherence Just a Way to Hurt Amazon?", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the Trump administration has rightfully been trying to thwart attempts by some European governments to impose a new corporate \u201cdigital tax\u201d on American high-tech giants. This campaign to block internet-inspired extraterritorial taxation \u2014 taxation of income earned outside of a jurisdiction \u2014 is strongly supported by the American business community. But the White House, in an odd twist that turns its European Union digital tax arguments upside down, just argued before the Supreme Court that the same kind of extraterritorial taxation is acceptable when carried out by American states on retail sales on the internet.Does the left hand of the Trump administration know what the right hand is doing on internet-related tax policy? Are American corporate leaders who have ignored the issue of internet sales taxes about to suffer a key setback in relation to the European Union tax grab? And does sound tax policy go out the window if the president seems to think Amazon is in the cross hairs?State governments want to see Quill overturned because they\u2019re eager to collect more sales tax revenues to balance their books instead of cutting spending. The desire to tax out-of-state businesses has been consistent over the decades, but the pitch is now that the internet changes everything. It makes doing business over large distances too easy, some argue, so government shouldn\u2019t be constrained by outdated considerations like borders and geographical business locations.Chief Justice John Roberts asked government lawyers about the impact on \u201cmicro-businesses\u201d because tax enforcement costs related to audits and litigation are a major concern for small businesses dealing with their own state and local tax officials. But how about when being online makes every state government the same as your local government? The internet is global. This line of reasoning points to a world where even a very small business on the internet is taxed and regulated as if it has facilities and employees everywhere in the world. On this key point, the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department came down strongly in favor of a world where an internet presence replaces traditional physical presence.What accounts for such an incoherent approach to tax policy? The administration argues in the Supreme Court that the borderless nature of e-commerce should subject someone selling potholders on Etsy or vintage Air Jordans on eBay to taxes in every state \u2014 but then it opposes European governments using the same rationale to tax billions in revenue by the largest American multinationals.A further twist is that a win by South Dakota will not undermine Amazon. Its national distribution network means it must collect sales taxes in every state. New rules are likely to help the company by increasing burdens on lesser-equipped small competitors. Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer both hinted at this during oral arguments, noting that expanding tax duties on the legions of smaller businesses would be likely to benefit the largest online businesses and exacerbate concerns about dominance by the few internet giants.The internet is global. It\u2019s not going away. Governments everywhere want to increase their power to tax internet commerce out of a fear that some tax revenues will go the way of music CD sales and newspaper classified ads. Mr. Trump may think he\u2019s changing the rules to increase Amazon\u2019s tax bill and help states raise more revenues, but if he succeeds it will lead to many American technology companies writing much bigger tax checks to foreign governments for years to come.Advertisement"}

And another debut.This is a construct borrowed from Yiddish, of course, where schlemiels spill soup, schlimazels get wet and words starting with \u201cschm\u201d actually exist and have meaning. In this puzzle, Mr. Nediger has taken eight examples of words using the \u201cschm\u201d prefix, seven nouns and a last name, and created cryptic clues that use the actual definition of the word in conjunction with another clue to create a rhyming, auditory pun.For example, at 23A: \u201cConversation over a few whiskeys?\u201d, whiskeys + conversation = BOOZE SCHMOOZE.At 111A, \u201cPuts a stop to sentimentality?\u201d, stops + sentimentality = HALTS SCHMALTZ (which might or might not really rhyme to you, but you get the idea).The rest of these are at 38A, 50A, 76A, 83A and 90A. The last one here has a last name instead of a \u201cschm\u201d term but if you\u2019ve ever watched \u201cThe Unbreakable Kimmy ____\u201d you\u2019ll be fine.Two fun facts about this one:1) SCHMEAR was a theme entry in my last Times puzzle, which means I\u2019ve had two in a row with schmear-related theme entries. Maybe I should just make it my thing.2) I originally had F THAT at 99-Down, although I figured it probably wouldn\u2019t fly in The Times. And indeed, Will [Shortz, crossword editor] had me replace it \u2014 luckily, it was an easy fix.What did you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}
