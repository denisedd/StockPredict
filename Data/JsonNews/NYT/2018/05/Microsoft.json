{"Headline": "Facebook Adds A.I. Labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, Pressuring Local Universities", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is certainly true in the important area of artificial intelligence, which Mr. Zuckerberg says can help the social media giant deal with some of those problems.Facebook is opening new A.I. labs in Seattle and Pittsburgh, after hiring three A.I. and robotics professors from the University of Washington and Carnegie Mellon University. The company hopes these seasoned researchers will help recruit and train other A.I. experts in the two cities, Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer, said in an interview.As it builds these labs, Facebook is adding to pressure on universities and nonprofit A.I. research operations, which are already struggling to retain professors and other employees.\u201cIt is worrisome that they are eating the seed corn,\u201d said Dan Weld, a computer science professor at the University of Washington. \u201cIf we lose all our faculty, it will be hard to keep preparing the next generation of researchers.\u201dWith the new labs, Facebook \u2014 which already operates A.I. labs in Silicon Valley, New York, Paris and Montreal \u2014 is establishing two new fronts in a global competition for talent.Over the last five years, artificial intelligence has been added to a number of tech products, from digital assistants and online translation services to self-driving vehicles. And the world\u2019s largest internet companies, from Google to Microsoft to Baidu, are jockeying for researchers who specialize in these technologies. Many of them are coming from academia.\u201cWe\u2019re basically going where the talent is,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said.But the supply of talent is not keeping up with demand, and salaries have skyrocketed. Well-known researchers are receiving compensation in salary, bonuses and stock worth millions of dollars. Many in the field worry that the talent drain from academia could have a lasting impact in the United States and other countries, simply because schools won\u2019t have the teachers they need to educate the next generation of A.I. experts.Over the last few months, Facebook approached a number of notable researchers in Seattle. It hired Luke Zettlemoyer, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in technology that aims to understand and use natural human language, the company confirmed. This is an important area of research for Facebook as it struggles to identify and remove false and malicious content on its networks.In the fall, Mr. Zettlemoyer told The New York Times that he had turned down an offer from Google that was three times his teaching salary (about $180,000, according to public records) so he could keep his post at the university. Instead, he took a part-time position at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle lab backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.Many researchers retain their professorships when moving to the big companies \u2014 that\u2019s Mr. Zettlemoyer\u2019s plan while he works for Facebook \u2014 but they usually cut back on their academic work. At Facebook, academics typically spend 80 percent of their time at the company and 20 percent at their university.Like the other internet giants, Facebook acknowledges the importance of the university system. But at the same time, the companies are eager to land top researchers.In Pittsburgh, Facebook hired two professors from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, Abhinav Gupta and Jessica Hodgins, who specialized in computer vision technology.Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, did not respond to a request for comment. But over the past several months, he has been vocal about the movement of A.I. researchers toward the big internet companies. Google also operates an engineering office near Carnegie Mellon.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d he said.The two new Facebook labs are part of wider expansion for the company\u2019s A.I. operation. In December, Facebook announced that it had hired another computer vision expert, Jitendra Malik, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He now oversees the lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.Even with its deep pockets, Facebook faces fierce competition for talent. Mr. Allen recently gave the Allen Institute, which he created in 2013, an additional $125 million in funding. After losing Mr. Zettlemoyer to Facebook, the Allen Institute hired Noah Smith and Yejin Choi, two of his colleagues at the University of Washington.Like Mr. Zettlemoyer, both specialize in natural language processing, and both say they received offers from multiple internet companies.The nonprofit is paying Mr. Smith and Ms. Choi a small fraction of what they were offered to join the commercial sector, but the Allen Institute will allow them to spend half their time at the university and collaborate with a wide range of companies, said Oren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute.\u201cThe salary numbers are so large that even Paul Allen can\u2019t match them,\u201d Mr. Etzioni said. \u201cBut there are still some people who won\u2019t go corporate.\u201dOthers researchers believe that companies like Facebook still align with their academic goals. Nonetheless, Ed Lazowska, the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said he was concerned that the large internet companies were luring too many of the university\u2019s professors into the commercial sector.Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, he said, are working on a set of recommendations for commercial companies meant to provide a way for universities and companies to share talent more equally. Mr. Lazowska added that every university should ensure that it did not become too close to one company.\u201cThe university must be a Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every company to collaborate with us and to feel like they have an equal opportunity to hire our students and work with our faculty.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ed Lazowska\u2019s position at the University of Washington. He is the Bill and Melinda Gates professor of computer science, not the chairman of the computer science and engineering department.Advertisement"}

The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.Michael J. de la Merced reported from London and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

{"Headline": "Uber Should \u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 for All of Its Workers", "Date": "2018-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Kim is a former attorney who writes about labor issues.Arbitration is an informal proceeding, in which an arbitrator, usually someone who works frequently with the same employer, decides on an employee\u2019s claim. It\u2019s a poor substitute for a court of law, with lopsided, inconsistent rules of evidence. When coupled with a ban on group activity, mandatory arbitration can deter aggrieved workers from coming forward in the first place.The technicalities of arbitration rules are dreary, which is why it has taken the #MeToo movement to highlight why they are so unfair to employees. Survivors of sexual harassment and assault have rightly demanded an end to the practice, in which the proceedings are kept secret. High-profile employers are responding to this criticism cynically, at best, by agreeing to eliminate mandatory arbitration only for #MeToo-type claims.\u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019ve started talking about forced arbitration, but it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019re only talking about it in the context of harassment, not pregnancy discrimination or pay discrimination or wage theft,\u201d said Juno Turner, a lawyer with Outten & Golden, a firm based in New York City that represents employees. \u201cAnd there is no attention brought to the issue of class and collective waivers, which also have an impact on the ability of multiple women victimized by the same harasser to speak out.\u201dIt\u2019s to the tremendous credit of the #MeToo movement that Americans are now talking so openly about the disproportionate abuse faced by women on the job. The current focus on sexual harassment and bodily violence, however, should not blind us to other workplace indignities. Being cheated out of overtime pay or the minimum wage is no less a violation, nor is discrimination on the basis of illness or age. Each is an affront that must be dealt with appropriately \u2014 in state or federal court.\u201cIf the Supreme Court holds that class-action waivers are perfectly legal, it\u2019s going to continue the trend of making it difficult to enforce wage laws in any systemic way,\u201d said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for Uber drivers and other low-wage workers.E.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How well did Flipkart\u2019s investors do?\u2022 What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen?\u2022 What the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world.\u2022 The bottom line on Vodafone\u2019s big deal with Liberty Global.The story of Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here\u2019s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart\u2019s management some degree of independence.In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India\u2019s two biggest e-commerce services.Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday\u2019s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart\u2019s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s how well some of them did:Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart \u2014 including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent \u2014 could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedWhat exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer?- Peter EavisDetails\u2022 Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm.\u2022 The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart\u2019s eventual shareholding in Flipkart.\u2022 Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year.It\u2019s a risky bet for Walmart\u2022 Although India\u2019s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny.\u2022 Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India\u2019s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there.\u2022 While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon\u2019s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap.The big winners\u2022 Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire.\u2022 SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion.The advisers\u2022 Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side.\u2022 Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & DavidsonCritic\u2019s CornerUna Galani of Breakingviews writes: \u201cAfter buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart\u2019s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company\u2019s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.\u201dSturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation.The vote was a rebuke to the company\u2019s leaders and a victory for gun control activists.Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company\u2019s reputation and finances.\u2014 Tiffany HsuSears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears\u2019s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months.AT&T said Essential was \u201cone of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February.\u201cRight around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,\u201d the person said. \u201cHow does he think?

Indians come in all stripes, from the chief executives of Google and Microsoft to the Apus of Deli Marts and Kwik-E-Marts to the taxi drivers of New York City.I myself am Indian and a professor at Rutgers Business School, and I am not in the least offended by Apu\u2019s accent. Mr. Bajaj, smile and get over it.MARK CASTELINO, NEWARKTo the Editor:Vikas Bajaj raises important questions. Stereotypes in a comedy are meant to generate laughter, but Apu is simply not funny anymore, and the grossly exaggerated South Asian accent and behavior are tiresome.It is the successful sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d that has appropriated the modern comedic stereotype of an Indian-American. Raj is nerdy, highly educated with a professional job, video-chats with his parents on a laptop, doesn\u2019t handle alcohol well and is inept with women.Raj is not an Indian role model by any measure, but Apu\u2019s character invokes the worst kind of stereotyping and socioeconomic exclusion. Moreover, it belies American society\u2019s willingness and capacity to assimilate and empower the immigrant. In 2018, Apu\u2019s America appears claustrophobic, static and without hope. Where\u2019s the fun in that?RAJIV THIND, BRISBANE, AUSTRALIATo the Editor:Most of us know a friendly, hardworking and thrifty Apu somewhere. An endearing person. If Apu has to go for political correctness\u2019s sake, then other \u201cSimpsons\u201d characters have to go as well, since they all are representations of bumbling people of one kind of another. As a grandfather, I object to Grandpa. I look much better and \u2014 obviously \u2014 I am a lot smarter.But the one character who definitely has to go is Homer. He is a white working-class guy, with limited education and skills, and not very good judgment. I even suspect whom he voted for in the last presidential election. I say if Apu has to go, so does Homer. And Grandpa. Marge, you may be next.To the Editor:Instead of dumping the character Apu from the show, the writers of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d should introduce two new characters: Apu\u2019s Ivy-educated son and daughter, the software engineer and the doctor.To the Editor:Please don\u2019t terminate Apu for the sins of others. I am very sorry that Vikas Bajaj is offended by the character Apu. But the real offense is that people don\u2019t teach their children to show kindness and respect to others, and are not held to account. The real offense is that in this Trumpian era, people who would have been hesitant to display their bigotry no longer feel the need to keep it under wraps, but are content to use Apu as a tool to tease, humiliate or exclude other people.Now that many people from South Asia are living and working in the United States, they are targets of the ignorant, offensive behavior that is always the lot of immigrants, for at least one generation. Apu is a wonderful, vivid character, and I\u2019m glad to have met him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the G.D.P.R., Europe\u2019s Tough New Data Law, Means for You", "Date": "2018-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what it means for you.The law, which goes into effect on May 25, strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.Europe is attempting to push back.It\u2019s too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally.Not really.Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn\u2019t likely to see a difference.If you live in one of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome \u2014 you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping.As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads \u201cfine tuned,\u201d but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, which makes tools to help companies work around ad-blocking software.Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information.The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps.That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience.Even if you don\u2019t notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about.But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn\u2019t been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data.The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered.But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look.A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear.Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed.He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share.Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the \u201cspirit\u201d of the law.It\u2019s too soon to tell.That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won\u2019t be known for years.Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders.A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data.The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal.Advertisement"}

The key assumption of that era was that markets work best when the government focuses exclusively on enforcing contract and property rights.This sort of agreement is now illegal, but businesses have nevertheless found new and creative ways to achieve monopoly profits, while antitrust enforcers have fallen behind.According to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.To revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.We also need a renewed public awareness of the dangers of monopolies to ensure that in the future antitrust enforcers feel the pressure to keep up with the ever-changing faces of monopoly power.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tariff Impact Colors a Key House Race in Boeing Country", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUBURN, Wash. \u2014 President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president\u2019s recent moves on trade.Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces.\u201cI\u2019m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,\u201d Mr. Cesmat said. \u201cThousands of people\u2019s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.\u201dThe spat with Beijing has rattled the state\u2019s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm.\u201cTrade issues are high on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. \u201cThey are wondering and worrying how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201dThat anxiety is particularly acute in the Eighth Congressional District, a comma-shaped expanse that will hold one of the most closely watched midterm races in November as the Democrats battle to win back the House. Several political handicappers rate the race as a tossup.The district\u2019s quirky boundary, which encompasses the vast airplane-making ecosystem to the west and thousands of acres of cherry and apple farms on the other side of the Cascade Mountains, makes the territory uniquely vulnerable to the president\u2019s actions on trade. Boeing is probably the American company with the most riding on a healthy relationship with Beijing.China is projected to buy more than 7,000 planes worth around $1 trillion in the next 20 years, more than Boeing\u2019s current backlog for the entire world. Most commercial aircraft in China are made by Boeing, the company says, but if the trade pressures escalate, China could choose to award more work to Europe\u2019s Airbus.For now, Beijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on some airplanes, including older 737 models made in the Renton factory where Mr. Cesmat works, which is just outside the district.\u201cChina knew exactly where to target,\u201d said Kim Schrier, the Democratic candidate who has built the biggest campaign war chest ahead of the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting districts where this could be problematic for Republicans.\u201dMs. Schrier is among half a dozen or so Democrats gunning for a seat that became catnip for the party the moment that the seven-term Republican incumbent, Dave Reichert, announced his retirement in September. Despite Mr. Reichert\u2019s success, the district favored Hillary Clinton by three percentage points over Mr. Trump, and it went twice for Barack Obama. Ms. Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate, has been hammering Dino Rossi, the likely Republican nominee, on the tariff issue.\u201cThese tariffs are a direct response to the policies of a president you helped elect. Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she tweeted to Mr. Rossi last month.Mr. Rossi, a former state senator, is careful to note that the bluster could be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating style. But he said he understood why everyone was so worried. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get down to a trade war. In the end it will be very disruptive,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHopefully this is more posturing than anything.\u201dBut voters in the district say the escalating trade drama has already begun to complicate their daily lives. Companies that supply construction materials have suspended orders, waiting to see what happens to metal prices. Employees at a builder of truck components say managers have been hastily reassessing supply chains that run through China and Mexico. A local hard-cider brewer is reconsidering an expansion after the steel and aluminum tariffs made new tanks and cans more expensive.And at Boeing, a company that employs grandfathers next to granddaughters and has introduced generations of Washingtonians to their spouses, the unease has been evident from the executive suite to the factory floor.Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on trade didn\u2019t used to inspire so much teeth-grinding among Boeing workers. A lot of union mechanics were happy last year when he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have reinforced the nation\u2019s embrace of free trade. And the president earned a lot of fans in Washington when he criticized the company on the campaign trail in 2015 for setting up a new plant outside Shanghai, saying it would \u201cend up taking a tremendous number of jobs away from the United States.\u201dJim McKenzie, a union machinery repairman, remembered that comment when, several months ago, he came across a package of dorsal-fin parts at the Boeing plant in Auburn where he works. Mr. McKenzie pulled back the Bubble Wrap and saw a label that made him feel as if he were sinking into quicksand: Boeing China.\u201cWe drill it and assemble it, but they ship the parts in from China,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThere are people who have worked here for 25 years making those parts, and they\u2019re proud of that.\u201dBut Mr. McKenzie, 56, isn\u2019t eager to blow up the Beijing relationship. \u201cChina will just buy all their planes from Airbus,\u201d he said, leaning his chair back against a wall in the machinists\u2019 union hall in Auburn.He doesn\u2019t have much hope that Mr. Trump will do anything to stop Boeing from setting up shop in China \u2014 he saw how Carrier shipped work from Indianapolis to Mexico even though the president had railed against the move. In Boeing\u2019s case, Mr. McKenzie said, hiring some Chinese workers might be unavoidable. \u201cYou have to provide them jobs to sell them airplanes,\u201d he said.Ms. Schrier recently won the endorsement of the machinists\u2019 union, which represents more than 26,000 Boeing workers. Mr. Cesmat, 27, plans to volunteer for her campaign. \u201cShe pledged to support our jobs,\u201d he said.Boeing\u2019s political action committee donated $2,000 to Mr. Reichert\u2019s campaign, but hasn\u2019t contributed to any candidates vying to succeed him, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. It did donate $8,000 to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is facing a strong Democratic challenge in her quest for re-election in Washington\u2019s Fifth District.The fear over trade tensions has spread beyond Boeing\u2019s hulking factories, all the way to Schilling Cider, a hard-cider company founded here five years ago by two friends, Mark Kornei and Colin Schilling. The business grew quickly, thanks in part to the state\u2019s abundant apple orchards, but now it\u2019s staring down an uncomfortable new reality.The company that sells Mr. Kornei stainless-steel tanks told him recently that prices for its raw materials might rise by 20 percent. A single tank costs around $50,000. He has also heard from the manufacturer of his aluminum cans that prices could increase by 10 percent. Mr. Kornei will buy 11 million of them this year, so that uptick alone could cost him more than $100,000, he said.\u201cStirring the pot unnecessarily doesn\u2019t help business whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Kornei said. \u201cGive us a steady set of rules so we can figure out what we are going to do.\u201dMr. Rossi acknowledged that some of what the president says and does \u201ccan at times\u201d make it harder for him on the campaign trail. But he has raised more than $2 million, about twice as much as Ms. Schrier.The Republican tax cuts are a big selling point for Mr. Rossi, who has a ready figure for exactly how much a typical household will save because of the law (\u201c$3,357 \u2014 that\u2019s real money\u201d). He\u2019s also counting on a personal bond with Republican voters east of the Cascades.Kirk Johnson contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bitcoin Sees Wall Street Warm to Trading Virtual Currency", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to Bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world.The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential.The moves by Goldman and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment.The new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of Bitcoin.The virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn\u2019t be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations.But instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies.While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions \u2014 without any financial institutions getting involved \u2014 it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver.Details of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment.Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer\u2019s account at the end of the trade.ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day \u2014 with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws \u2014 something today\u2019s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.\u201cThe reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,\u201d Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. \u201cWe deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction.\u201dGoldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoin\u2019s price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins.Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms.Several big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved.LedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into it.The interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved.ICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said.Mr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether.With Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved.\u201cThe industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It\u2019s a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions \u2014 I think we\u2019re finally there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He added that \u201cthe quality of the glasses is getting so much intensely better\u201d over the three years he has been experimenting with virtual reality.\u201cYou can put your hand in the rain and swish the drops around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a challenge to give it an ephemeral quality, but I am very excited about the result.\u201dIn April, Acute Art\u2019s VR Museum introduced a subscription program to experience works by Mr. Eliasson and the performance artist Marina Abramovic while distributing the output of five other artists free of charge for nonsubscribers.The website works with three brands of virtual-reality headsets.While a painting is acquired through a single sale payment, Mr. Klaris said, virtual-reality works may demand a monetization plan more along the lines of the film industry. An artist who creates such a work \u201cmight be paid every time it is sold or distributed,\u201d he said.Khora Contemporary was founded, however, with the main objective of helping established and young artists translate their work into the realm of virtual reality. The company was inaugurated at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale with commissioned works by Paul McCarthy and Christian Lemmerz.Ms. Nedvetskaia cited a \u201ctriangular\u201d business model involving the artist, production company and gallery. The structure varies on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d Khora Contemporary is also in talks with film festivals on both sides of the Atlantic. Down the line, Ms. Nedvetskaia envisions creating pay-per-view versions of artwork online.She pointed to virtual reality as a new frontier for artists at a time when all other forms and genres have been explored. \u201cThere is little today which is brand new,\u201d she said.But the collector base is just developing. \u201cIt is too early to talk about at this point,\u201d she said of \u201ca very nascent market\u201d while mentioning sales in Asia and the interest of private museums and collections.The Salon Berlin of the Museum Frieder Burda \u2014 a private collection in Baden-Baden, Germany \u2014 is displaying its first virtual-reality component with \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d by the Ukranian artist Nikita Shalenny.The salon\u2019s curator, Patricia Kamp, pointed to the irony that, in an exhibition exploring the alienation from nature in modern society, virtual reality represents a crucial means of harnessing younger visitors.\u201cWhen art doesn\u2019t move people emotionally, it has no purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next generation only grows up with screens. They have a totally different point of access.\u201d\u201cThe Bridge\u201d is juxtaposed with both modern and contemporary paintings in an effort to create dialogue between the different mediums. Ms. Nedvetskaia also mentioned the possibility of exhibiting virtual-reality works alongside the physical material on which they were based, such as Shalenny\u2019s watercolors or video directed by Mr. McCarthy.\u201cIt makes it more believable,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt gives people the confidence that it can be taken seriously as a real art form.\u201dAs Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, said during the Art Leaders Network panel \u201cThe Future of Art Museums,\u201d contemporary art had transcended formal labels.\u201cThere use to be these categories,\u201d he said. \u201cHigh art, fashion, commerce, you name it.

{"Headline": "At a New York Gallery, Confronting the Art World\u2019s Existential Crisis", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne gallery owner, Sean Kelly, is trying to change that. This week, he launches an initiative called Collect Wisely, an advertisement- and event-driven campaign that, he hopes, will reinvigorate the collecting class\u2019s interest in actual art. The campaign includes ads placed in various publications (including The New York Times) featuring phrases like \u201cWill history remember you as an investor or a collector?\u201d And near Kelly\u2019s shop on 10th Avenue is a billboard carrying the slogan \u201cConnoisseurship is not a dirty word.\u201d\u201cFor me, collecting is not about whether I\u2019m going to make a lot of money,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether I found something that I can\u2019t live without.\u201d But now, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s only about money.\u201dThat\u2019s a complaint many people who work in the art market have made in private, but as dissent grows with the direction of the business, it\u2019s become an increasingly public grievance among even successful galleries, like Kelly\u2019s.Still, saying that art has become too much about money is something of an odd position to take when you own a business that only exists if people spend money on art. Kelly is cautious about not calling out anyone in particular: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to criticize anybody or say that anyone is doing something wrong,\u201d he says. He has ventured further into the belly of the beast by launching this initiative during the week of another major art fair \u2014 Frieze New York, which opens to collectors on Wednesday \u2014 where he will also be exhibiting. But in addition to trying to sell art at the fair, he\u2019ll be recording live conversations with collectors \u2014 which will eventually be published as part of a recurring podcast on the gallery\u2019s website \u2014 about what it means to be a connoisseur of art, rather than merely a shopper. A final tier of Collect Wisely will be a series of invite-only salons held at the gallery, where people from a variety of backgrounds \u2014 collectors, but also, Kelly hopes, writers, musicians and scientists \u2014 will gather for dinner and to discuss art\u2019s emotional, rather than monetary, value.\u201cOf course, we sell expensive things, and I\u2019m not trying to be na\u00efve,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not King Canute trying to hold the waves back. But I want to start a conversation that emphasizes the pleasure of collecting, rather than the value of it. It\u2019s about passion, which is what all the great collections have been formed by. They haven\u2019t been investment strategies \u2014 it\u2019s about passion.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the sale of a Willem de Kooning painting at Art Basel in Hong Kong.

Doctors, philanthropists and companies are trying to solve it. Supported byPANIPAT, India \u2014 Shivam Kumar\u2019s failing eyesight was manageable at first. To better see the chalkboard, the 12-year-old moved to the front of the classroom, but in time, the indignities piled up.Increasingly blurry vision forced him to give up flying kites and then cricket, after he was repeatedly whacked by balls he could no longer see. The constant squinting gave him headaches, and he came to dread walking home from school.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t see a motorbike until it\u2019s almost in my face,\u201d he said.As his grades flagged, so did his dreams of becoming a pilot. \u201cYou can\u2019t fly a plane if you\u2019re blind,\u201d he noted glumly.The fix for Shivam\u2019s declining vision, it turns out, was remarkably simple.He needed glasses.Then there are the tens of millions of children like Shivam across the world whose families cannot afford an eye exam or the prescription eyeglasses that would help them excel in school.The initiative\u2019s backers point out that responding to the world\u2019s vision crisis does not require the invention of new drugs or solving nettlesome issues like distributing refrigerated vaccines in countries with poor infrastructure. Factories in Thailand, China and the Philippines can manufacture so-called readers for less than 50 cents a pair; prescription glasses that correct nearsightedness can be produced for $1.50. But money alone won\u2019t easily solve systemic challenges faced by countries like Uganda, which has just 45 eye doctors for a nation of 41 million. In rural India, glasses are seen as a sign of infirmity, and in many places, a hindrance for young women seeking to get married. Until last year, Liberia did not have a single eye clinic.\u201cPeople in rural areas have never even seen a child wearing glasses,\u201d said Ms. Sirleaf, who was president of Liberia from 2006 to this year. \u201cDrivers don\u2019t even know they have a deficiency. They just drive the best they can.\u201dFor most, it was the first time anyone had checked their eyesight. The students were both excited and terrified. Roughly 12 percent were flagged as having weak vision and sent to an adjacent classroom where workers using refractor lenses conducted more tests.Shivam, the boy who dreamed of being a pilot, walked away with a pair of purple-framed spectacles donated by Warby Parker, the American eyewear company, which also paid for the screenings.\u201cEverything is so clear,\u201d Shivam exclaimed as he looked with wonder around the classroom.Anshu Taneja, VisonSpring\u2019s India director, said that providing that first pair of glasses is pivotal; people who have experienced the benefits of corrected vision will often buy a second pair if their prescription changes or they lose the glasses they have come to depend on.Ratan Singh, 45, a sharecropper who recently got his first pair of reading glasses, said he could not imagine living without them now. Standing in a field of ripening wheat, he said his inability to see tiny pests on the stalks of his crop had led to decreasing yields. He sheepishly recalled the time he sprayed the wrong insecticide because he couldn\u2019t read the label. \u201cI was always asking other people to help me read but I was becoming a burden,\u201d he said.Last month, after he accidentally broke his glasses, Mr. Singh, who supports his wife and six daughters, did not hesitate to fork out the 60 rupees, roughly 90 cents, for a new pair.That\u2019s what happened to D. Periyanayakam, 56, a power company employee whose job requires him to read electrical meters. His failing eyesight also made it hard to drive or respond to text messages from customers and co-workers.Mr. Periyanayakam returned to work that day with a $2 pair of glasses. He was among 400 people who showed up at a daylong clinic in a high school run by ophthalmologists, lens grinders and vision screeners.Aravind dispenses 600,000 pairs of glasses each year in India and has expanded its efforts to Nepal, Bangladesh and countries in Africa through local partners.\u201cThese men are always on the move and they are pressed for time, so we try to make it as easy as possible for them,\u201d said Ameen, a Sightsaver employee who uses a single name.On a recent morning, dozens of drivers, many wearing flip-flops and oil-stained trousers, lined up in front of an eye chart taped to the wall of a trucking company in the town of Chapraula. Asked why they had waited so long to have their vision checked, some shrugged. Others said they were too busy. A few cited fears they would be fired if an employer discovered that their vision was flawed.About half the men, it turned out, needed glasses. They included Jagdish Prasad, 55, a father of nine with a deeply lined face who had never had his eyes tested.\u201cI haven\u2019t had an accident in 35 years,\u201d Mr. Prasad exclaimed \u2014 but then reluctantly admitted that he has lately been squinting to see whether a traffic light had changed.Then he gestured to the cavalcade of honking vehicles behind him and told a story. Four days earlier, he said, a mentally ill man had been lying on the edge of the road, forcing drivers to swerve to avoid him. One of those vehicles, a truck not unlike his own, tried to avoid the man but ended up killing two students who were crossing the road on their way to school. The next day, the mentally ill man was also struck and killed, Mr. Prasad said.He paused and then considered the piece of paper in his hand. It contained the prescription for his first pair of glasses. Mr. Prasad hesitated and then gently placed it in his pocket.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for Google", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fei-Fei Li is among the brightest stars in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, somehow managing to hold down two demanding jobs simultaneously: head of Stanford University\u2019s A.I. lab and chief scientist for A.I. at Google Cloud, one of the search giant\u2019s most promising enterprises.Yet last September, when nervous company officials discussed how to speak publicly about Google\u2019s first major A.I. contract with the Pentagon, Dr. Li strongly advised shunning those two potent letters.\u201cAvoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,\u201d she wrote in an email to colleagues reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWeaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI \u2014 if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.\u201dDr. Li\u2019s concern about the implications of military contracts for Google has proved prescient. The company\u2019s relationship with the Defense Department since it won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, has touched off an existential crisis, according to emails and documents reviewed by The Times as well as interviews with about a dozen current and former Google employees.It has fractured Google\u2019s work force, fueled heated staff meetings and internal exchanges, and prompted some employees to resign. The dispute has caused grief for some senior Google officials, including Dr. Li, as they try to straddle the gap between scientists with deep moral objections and salespeople salivating over defense contracts.The advertising model behind Google\u2019s spectacular growth has provoked criticism that it invades web users\u2019 privacy and supports dubious websites, including those peddling false news. Now the company\u2019s path to future growth, via cloud-computing services, has divided the company over its stand on weaponry. To proceed with big defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; to reject such work would deprive it of a potentially huge business.Executives at DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer based in London that Google acquired in 2014, have said they are completely opposed to military and surveillance work, and employees at the lab have protested the contract. The acquisition agreement between the two companies said DeepMind technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes.Those emails and other internal documents, shared by an employee who opposes Pentagon contracts, show that at least some Google executives anticipated the dissent and negative publicity. But other employees, noting that rivals like Microsoft and Amazon were enthusiastically pursuing lucrative Pentagon work, concluded that such projects were crucial to the company\u2019s growth and nothing to be ashamed of.Many tech companies have sought military business without roiling their work forces. But Google\u2019s roots and self-image are different.\u201cWe have kind of a mantra of \u2018don\u2019t be evil,\u2019 which is to do the best things that we know how for our users, for our customers and for everyone,\u201d Larry Page told Peter Jennings in 2004, when ABC News named Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, \u201cPeople of the Year.\u201dThe clash inside Google was sparked by the possibility that the Maven work might be used for lethal drone targeting. And the discussion is made more urgent by the fact that artificial intelligence, one of Google\u2019s strengths, is expected to play an increasingly central role in warfare.Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, made a much-publicized visit to Google in August \u2014 shortly after stopping in at Amazon \u2014 and called for closer cooperation with tech companies.\u201cI see many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry,\u201d he said.A number of colleagues weighed in, but generally they deferred to Dr. Li, who was born in China, immigrated to New Jersey with her parents as a 16-year-old who spoke no English and has climbed to the top of the tech world.Dr. Li said in the email that the final decision would be made by her boss, Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google Cloud. But Dr. Li thought the company should publicize its share of the Maven contract as \u201ca big win for GCP,\u201d Google Cloud Platform.\u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,\u201d she wrote in the email.Asked about her September email, Dr. Li issued a statement: \u201cI believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI.\u201dAs it turned out, the company did not publicize Maven. The company\u2019s work as a subcontractor came to public attention only when employees opposed to it began protesting on Google\u2019s robust internal communications platforms.The company promised employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the ethical minefield of defense and intelligence contracting. Google told The Times on Tuesday that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice.At a companywide meeting last Thursday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Google wanted to come up with guidelines that \u201cstood the test of time,\u201d employees said. Employees say they expect the principles to be announced inside Google in the next few weeks.The polarized debate about Google and the military may leave out some nuances. Better analysis of drone imagery could reduce civilian casualties by improving operators\u2019 ability to find and recognize terrorists. The Defense Department will hardly abandon its advance into artificial intelligence if Google bows out. And military experts say China and other developed countries are already investing heavily in A.I. for defense.But skilled technologists who chose Google for its embrace of benign and altruistic goals are appalled that their employer could eventually be associated with more efficient ways to kill.Google\u2019s unusual culture is reflected in its company message boards and internal social media platforms, which encourage employees to speak out on everything from Google\u2019s cafeteria food to its diversity initiatives. But even within this free-expression workplace, longtime employees said, the Maven project has roiled Google beyond anything in recent memory.When news of the deal leaked out internally, Ms. Greene spoke at the weekly companywide T.G.I.F. meeting. She explained that the system was not for lethal purposes and that it was a relatively small deal worth \u201conly\u201d $9 million, according to two people familiar with the meeting.That did little to tamp down the anger, and Google, according to the invitation email, decided to hold a discussion on April 11 representing a \u201cspectrum of viewpoints\u201d involving Ms. Greene; Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who is a leader in the anti-Maven movement; and Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who is considered one of the fathers of the internet for his pioneering technology work at the Defense Department.Because there was so much interest, the group debated the topic three times over one day for Google employees watching on video in different regions around the world.According to employees who watched the discussion, Ms. Greene held firm that Maven was not using A.I. for offensive purposes, while Ms. Whittaker argued that it was hard to draw a line on how the technology would be used.Last Thursday, Mr. Brin, the company\u2019s co-founder, responded to a question at a companywide meeting about Google\u2019s work on Maven. According to two Google employees, Mr. Brin said he understood the controversy and had discussed the matter extensively with Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai. However, he said he thought that it was better for peace if the world\u2019s militaries were intertwined with international organizations like Google rather than working solely with nationalistic defense contractors.Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ many of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence researchers. Some researchers work inside an A.I. lab called Google Brain in Mountain View, Calif., and others are spread across separate groups, including the cloud computing business overseen by Ms. Greene, who is also an Alphabet board member.Many of these researchers have recently arrived from the world of academia, and some retain professorships. They include Geoff Hinton, a Briton who helps oversee the Brain lab in Toronto and has been open about his reluctance to work for the United States government. In the late 1980s, Mr. Hinton left the United States for Canada in part because he was reluctant to take funding from the Department of Defense.Jeff Dean, one of Google\u2019s longest-serving and most revered employees, who now oversees all A.I. work at the company, said at a conference for developers this month that he had signed a letter opposing the use of so-called machine learning for autonomous weapons, which would identify targets and fire without a human pulling the trigger.DeepMind, the London A.I. lab, is widely considered to be the most important collection of A.I. talent in the world. It now operates as a separate Alphabet company, though the lines between Google and DeepMind are blurred.DeepMind\u2019s founders have long warned about the dangers of A.I. systems. At least one of the lab\u2019s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, has been involved in policy discussions involving Project Maven with the Google leadership, including Mr. Pichai, according to a person familiar with the discussions.Certainly, any chance that Google could move quietly into defense work with no public attention is gone.

Penn was one of the primary architects of President Bill Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign in 1996 and served as chief strategist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008. Few people have done more to advance the Clinton cause in the last couple of decades.Which makes it all the more striking that in his current campaign the longtime Democratic political consultant has essentially switched sides and accused associates of the Clintons of helping to orchestrate a politically driven, manufactured \u201cdeep state\u201d investigation into President Trump that Mr. Penn says should be shut down.In a series of recent newspaper columns and appearances on Fox News, Mr. Penn has endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was instigated by secret Democratic intriguing. The inquiry, Mr. Penn said, has resorted to \u201cstorm trooper tactics\u201d and has become a \u201cscorched-earth effort\u201d to \u201cbring down Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Penn goes further, however, by associating his former clients with the sort of wrongdoing that Mr. Trump often alleges. Mr. Penn wrote that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department \u201cbroke their own rules\u201d to end the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. He implied that Mr. Clinton\u2019s encounter with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch on a Phoenix airport tarmac in 2016 really was as suspicious as Republicans found it. And he suggested that \u201cClinton Foundation operatives\u201d got the F.B.I. to investigate Mr. Trump.A New York native who was captivated by numbers since childhood and parlayed a Harvard education to become a top Democratic pollster, Mr. Penn, 64, was one of three strategists brought into the White House by Mr. Clinton after Republicans swept the 1994 midterm elections and took control of Congress.The three helped Mr. Clinton pivot toward the political center to undercut the House speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republicans and regain popular support to win re-election two years later. Mr. Penn\u2019s internal rivals grumbled that he cared more about statistics than people and pushed a bloodless form of politics that focused on trivial symbolism like school uniforms over meaningful policy.Mr. Penn considered such criticism to be sour grapes by advisers who were held hostage by the left wing of the party, unable to see the popular middle and resentful of his ascendance. He boasted a record of helping elect two dozen heads of state around the world. He has also worked for corporate giants like Microsoft.The other two members of that rescue team brought in after 1994, Dick Morris and Douglas E. Schoen, would also go on to become sharp critics of the Clintons and favorite guests on Fox News. But Mr. Penn lasted longer with the Clintons than any of them and had been most associated with their campaigns. He helped steer Mrs. Clinton to win a Senate seat from New York in 2000 and set the original course of her 2008 presidential bid against Barack Obama, including the famous ad asking voters who would they trust for a 3 a.m. crisis phone call.Today, he is the president of the Stagwell Group, a digital investment firm that owns a series of public affairs agencies, including one that has worked for Republicans like Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate.He attributes his criticism of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation to lingering disgust with the inquiry by the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr that led to Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment by the House in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the president\u2019s efforts to cover up an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Clinton was subsequently acquitted in a Senate trial in 1999.\u201cI spent a year working with President Clinton against Ken Starr and that effort,\u201d Mr. Penn said on Fox this month. \u201cI just find that that was child\u2019s play to what\u2019s going on here.\u201dIn another Fox interview, he said he \u201csaw on the inside how these investigations affect people trying to do their job in the White House or political campaigns or in our democracy,\u201d adding that \u201cunless there\u2019s something really incredibly significant there, to continue and drag this on, drags down the ability for people to do their job for this country.\u201dBut his arguments have gone beyond denouncing Mr. Mueller or the investigation\u2019s effect on the White House. He has come to see the Clinton team as unprincipled schemers, much as the Republicans he long opposed do.In his column this week, he said the Australian diplomat who told the F.B.I. about an incriminating bar conversation with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, was responsible for a $25 million contribution to the Clinton family\u2019s foundation.\u201cYou don\u2019t need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the F.B.I. to complete the loop,\u201d Mr. Penn wrote. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.\u201dHe likewise dismissed Mr. Clinton\u2019s explanation of a conversation he had with Ms. Lynch during the 2016 investigation into his wife\u2019s email server. Ms. Lynch \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t playing mah-jongg in a secret \u2018no aides allowed\u2019 meeting with former President Clinton.\u201d And he implied that the F.B.I. was wrong not to charge Mrs. Clinton in that case.Spokesmen for Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton did not respond to messages on Monday, but some former colleagues from his days advising Mrs. Clinton saw no moral conversion on the part of Mr. Penn. To them, Mr. Penn appeared intent on ingratiating himself with Mr. Trump for some unknown benefit.\u201cI caught him saying something crazy on Fox a week or so back but figured he was playing to the crowd,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut he\u2019s not dumb. He wasn\u2019t even trying to not look like a shill. So he\u2019s making a play for something.\u201dIn his writings and television appearances, Mr. Penn has said he was not motivated by party politics but by concern for the state of the country.\u201cStopping Mueller isn\u2019t about one president or one party,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about all presidents and all parties. It\u2019s about cleaning out and reforming the deep state so that our intelligence operations are never used against opposing campaigns without the firmest of evidence.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The boomlet of skepticism about college comes disproportionately from upper-middle-class people who have the luxury of airing hypothetical concerns about education, without having to worry that their own children will be influenced by them. Yet the misplaced skepticism can do real damage to poor and working-class teenagers who hear it and take it seriously.The evidence remains overwhelming: College is the single most reliable path to the middle class and beyond. No, it doesn\u2019t guarantee a good life. Nothing does. But earning a good living without a college degree today is difficult.The advisers are needed because many high-school guidance counselors are overworked. Nationwide, the average counselor is responsible for almost 500 students, according to Nicole Hurd, the founder of College Advising Corps.

{"Headline": "Berkshire\u2019s Annual Meeting: Buffett Approves of Apple\u2019s Buyback Plan", "Date": "2018-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Saturday. Welcome to a special DealBook Briefing of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting.\u2022 What is Berkshire doing to promote gender equality?\u2022 Apple\u2019s buyback plan gets a thumbs up.\u2022 Warren Buffett isn\u2019t backing off his comments about guns and is sticking by Wells Fargo despite the scandals.\u2022 Where does Berkshire\u2019s health care venture with JPMorgan and Amazon stand?\u2022 Is Mr. Buffett now semi-retired?\u2022 Trade \u2018is a win-win situation.\u2019Asked what Berkshire Hathaway was doing to promote gender equality, Warren Buffett said Berkshire\u2019s recent choices of chief executives to run its businesses reflected fairness. \u201cBefore we made this management change, I probably named only six or seven C.E.O.s in the last five or six years. I would say that half of them that I\u2019ve named have been women,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\u201cI feel very good about the decisions we\u2019ve made about our C.E.O.s,\u201d he added.He did not answer whether Berkshire would push for gender equality on the boards of the companies that Berkshire is invested in.Mr. Buffett also said it was clear that women had been treated unfairly in the past.\u201cI have two sisters who are absolutely as smart as I am, and they have better personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t remotely have the same opportunities as I had.\u201dMr. Buffett said there was still a \u201cpipeline problem\u201d in corporate America, making it hard to find as many qualified women to lead companies.But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t use that excuse forever.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterBerkshire is quickly building its stake in Apple.Since Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the stake has grown into Berkshire\u2019s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.So what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201dCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Given Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.Mr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.Here\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201dAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201dHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.The discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:Warren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.Mr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.But his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201dThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.Mr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201dMr. Munger then added:\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201dOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.Berkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.In response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201dMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterThe question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has been a thread through many of the exchanges with shareholders.\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201dHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201dCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201dAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.The shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen GrocerThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.Warren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.But just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.Mr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201dCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\u2014 Emily FlitterThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.So it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d\u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201dSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.In the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.Given the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.Berkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\u2022 What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? \u2014 Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\u2022 What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this?Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\u2022 What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? \u2014 Jason Lu, Shanghai\u2022 Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? \u2014 Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\u2022 He\u2019s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? \u2014 Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\u2022 How long he plans on doing this. \u2014Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\u2014 Elisa Mala(As Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting has grown over the years, it has become a three-day event. Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)Shareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.What was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.Investors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth). There were Justin cowboy boots embroidered with the words \u201cBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Shareholders Meeting\u201d and guests had the option to \u201cPut yourself in Warren Buffett\u2019s boots,\u201d as the marketing materials suggest, and purchase a style that had been owned by the man himself.Jim Van Fossen, a retired financial planner, bought matching Berkshire Hathaway boxers for himself and his son, Conner Van Fossen. In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders\u2019 meeting.Of course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses. See\u2019s Candies displayed Scotch Kiss confections \u201cmade by Warren,\u201d and one staff member\u2019s uniform bore Mr. Buffett\u2019s autograph.The most photographed autograph was at the Benjamin Moore paint booth, where Mr. Buffett had signed his name in permanent marker next to a wall-size mural of his face. All day long, revelers followed suit, decorating the wall with their own signatures in dry-erase ink, and snapping selfies to preserve the memory.\u2014 Elisa Malahealth carepriceyear endAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will Trump\u2019s moves on Iran and trade push markets over the edge?\u2022 What\u2019s next for business after Eric Schneiderman?\u2022 D.E. Shaw grapples with an ousted executive who\u2019s fighting back.\u2022 What Rupert Murdoch will weigh if Comcast makes another bid for Fox assets.President Trump\u2019s antagonistic foreign policies have yet to cause serious losses in the stock market.But investors\u2019 stoicism could face greater tests in the coming weeks. They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years. It beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth. But even that strong performance was shadowed by analyst concerns over maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, never mentioned Comcast and presented the Fox deal as a fait accompli. \u201cWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved.\u201dMany analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.Mr. Schneiderman has denied the women\u2019s allegations.The NYT\u2019s Mark Landler reports:\u201cPresident Trump told President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday morning that he plans to announce the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord \u2014 and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said.\u201dHere\u2019s what Joe Papa, the company\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe Bausch name embodies the rich history of innovation, fortitude and dedication to patient health dating back to when J.J. Bausch opened his first optical goods shop more than 165 years ago. These qualities form the foundation of who we are today as we continue to build an innovative company striving to improve the health of patients globally.\u201d \u2014 Michael de la MercedSo where does the deal stack up among big acquisitions? Here\u2019s a breakdown courtesy of Dealogic:\u2022 It is the biggest deal announced this year, beating Cigna\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Express Scripts.\u2022 It is not just the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, but the biggest by a Japanese company. The $63 billion price tag just barely tops the $62.88 billion Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group paid for UFJ Holdings in 2005.The former acting attorney general has returned to King & Spalding as a partner in its special matters team and will head up in the firm\u2019s investigations group, according to a news release.Ms. Yates began her career at King & Spalding before spending 27 years at the Justice Department. She served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration asked her to stay on as acting attorney general until Jeff Sessions was confirmed to be attorney general.Ms. Yates worked at King & Spalding as a civil litigation associate from 1986 to 1989.The firm\u2019s bullying and threats against me over the last week, however, have revealed that the firm is so concerned with creating the appearance of supporting women that it is willing to cast false aspersions on me (and perpetuate false aspersions cast by others) and make me a scapegoat with a proverbial hanging in the town square.\u2022 Mr. Murdoch already spurned a Comcast offer 16 percent higher than what Disney\u2019s, saying regulators were more likely to block it. (Comcast would move again only if AT&T gets its Time Warner deal.)\u2022 He prefers receiving stock, as he would from Disney, because that\u2019s a tax-free transaction.The context: Comcast is also making life difficult for Mr. Murdoch and Disney by challenging Fox\u2019s bid for full ownership of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster.\u201cA number of people also requested that I distill it down to its essential concepts in a 30-minute animation, like I did with my Economic Principles in How the Economic Machine Works. So I\u2019ve done that in an 8 episode ultra mini-series adventure called \u2018Principles for Success,\u2019 which I\u2019m releasing today\u201dMore from Andrew:Whether they have been dug by a company\u2019s experienced hand, the good will of its customers or the heavy machinery of governmental regulation, moats remain a formidable form of protection, even from the most willing of raiders.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.D.P.R., a New Privacy Law, Makes Europe World\u2019s Leading Tech Watchdog", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world\u2019s toughest rules to protect people\u2019s online data. And with the internet\u2019s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe.Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe\u2019s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\u201cWe want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,\u201d said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in S\u00e3o Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was \u201cpushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.\u201dEurope is determined to cement its role as the world\u2019s foremost tech watchdog \u2014 and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union\u2019s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies.\u201cThe E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,\u201d said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google.Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone\u2019s data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies.European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cIf we can export this to the world, I will be happy,\u201d said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a \u201cglobal challenge.\u201dBrazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe\u2019s standards.\u201cMany countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,\u201d said Mr. Buttarelli.Europe\u2019s fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches \u2014 both share elements with the European rules.Europe\u2019s influence is not going unnoticed by America\u2019s tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them.The new privacy rules are part of a \u201cstrong European tradition\u201d of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does \u201cconstrain business,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top antitrust official.To meet G.D.P.R.\u2019s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers.\u201cIn the absence of another approach, it\u2019s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,\u201d said Mr. Garfield.Whether Europe\u2019s tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region\u2019s regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers.Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing.Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have rules on the books,\u201d said Mr. Tene. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued,the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.First Schwab looked at the bright side:The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many \u201cworkers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,\u201d he said, and the \u201cmiddle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.\u201dIn this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends.Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, \u201cPatterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century\u201d:The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier.There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative.With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences:As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor.The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations \u2014 a factor of about 200,000 difference \u2014 and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second.In point of fact, the use of robots \u2014 and of other methods of replacing workers with machines \u2014 has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.The authors note that \u201cboth technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.\u201d\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.Assessing the full range of employment, West observes thatRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:AI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage workinto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.Levy writes:A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks thedark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.While operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.The result is a cascading effect causedboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.The history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.A short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology.Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade.Furman lists some initiatives:expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice.Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income.These proposals \u2014 some underwhelming or undoable \u2014 find strong support among Democratic elected officials.Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant \u2014 not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans.Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect.Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups.The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants \u201ctakes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.\u201dIn other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well.The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval \u2014 and the success of this strategy to date \u2014 suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics \u2014 if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.Advertisement"}

Minh Uong, a visual editor for The Times\u2019s business section, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Can you explain your creative process for making and planning illustrations for The Times?Being the visual editor for the business section, I\u2019m responsible for providing artwork that illuminates stories that are hard to photograph. It\u2019s a challenging task at times, since our section features articles with topics that are difficult to visualize. Try to think of images that relate to private equity, net neutrality or the trade deficit.I doodled my first thought in my sketchbook using a black Paper Mate pen showing people stealing and running away with images of Mark and Sheryl. Then I sketched a different concept showing a group of scammers hiding behind Mark and Sheryl masks.My second sketch got approved. To finish the illustration would require some time to draw the masks of Mark and Sheryl. I was planning to use Adobe\u2019s drawing program, Illustrator, and my old 10-inch Wacom tablet. But with only a few hours before our print deadline, I decided to pursue creating the art with photography instead, and needed to create props for people to hold during a photo shoot.So I printed out 10 full-size faces of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on our color Canon copier-printer combo. I trimmed them with my X-Acto knife. Luckily, I had saved disposable chopsticks from my Chinese takeout orders, and they made perfect handles for the masks. I proceeded to Scotch tape all the chopsticks to the back of each mask.After I finished with the props, I wrangled eight colleagues to be in our photo shoot. We went to our in-house photo studio in the basement, where our staff photographer tried several lighting techniques to capture the moody and surreal picture.You also hire illustrators for The Times. Have tech tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil, or Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablets, made it easier for people to draw things and lowered the barrier to entry for becoming a professional illustrator?But I believe you still need certain artistic skills to become an illustrator. You need to have a discerning eye and to be able to communicate by creating a visual vocabulary that\u2019s uniquely your own. As an illustrator, you have to establish your point of view to solve problems and to go beyond just tracing a picture.Are the works by illustrators you commission created by pen and paper or on the computer?Time is of the essence when dealing with editorial illustration. Today, most artists are tech savvy. Some will start their project using traditional techniques like drawing in ink or painting with acrylics. Then they finalize it in Photoshop or a graphics program. This ultimately will save a lot of time.Working digitally makes it even easier to send in the final artwork. Before, I used to wait for overnight packages from FedEx or U.P.S. Now artists can take work right until the deadline and then just send their projects by email.The beauty of that is the artists get to keep their original work. And since The Times buys only the first-time printing rights, original artwork has to be sent back to its creators. I don\u2019t miss having to repackage artwork to send back to people in the mail.Have you tried doing your entire workflow on a tech product such as the iPad or a drawing tablet? Is there anything that tech companies could do to improve their products to get you to adopt a completely digital workflow?I wish there were a better tablet out there that could convert my sketches into editable vector images while I am drawing. There could be one out there that I\u2019m not aware of.Outside of work, what tech products do you and your family use heavily? As for me, I stare at my monitor at work all day. When I\u2019m home, I try to limit my time playing with other devices. But I\u2019m perfectly content with my iPhone. Every day, I enjoy using the usual apps, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Words With Friends, Pinterest \u2014 and of course The Times\u2019s app!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Keep Track of the Trade Fights: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Italy\u2019s political chaos could rock Europe\u2019s finances.\u2022 Congress doesn\u2019t want to go easy on ZTE.\u2022 Silicon Valley founders still want total control of their start-ups.A word of advice: Dates are your friend.So why would the Trump administration bring back the threat of tariffs now? One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote:Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up.This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China.Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs.So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible.\u2014 Peter EavisThe $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval.What\u2019s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department\u2019s antitrust chief. They emphasize \u201cstructural\u201d changes to the company \u2014 as in sales of businesses \u2014 rather than \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct.To Mr. Delrahim\u2019s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That\u2019s something that he has said the department would not do.What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday\u2019s agreement:\u201cThis comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns\u2014the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States\u2014preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. \u201cWe commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedHis suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led \u201cMarshall Plan for Africa\u201d that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration.But that runs counter to the E.U.\u2019s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more:Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases.Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it\u2019s attractive to belong to:Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project.All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeThe nation\u2019s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out.But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating \u2014 and postnatally influential \u2014 around the world.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeMaking smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world\u2019s first trillion-dollar company.People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more \u2014 and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.)The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple\u2019s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020.Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don\u2019t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones.Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of? Certainly.\u2014 Jamie Condliffe\u201cWith more than 10,000 customers and 6,000 employees, BMC is a global leader in managing digital and I.T. infrastructure with a broad portfolio of software solutions,\u201d Herald Chen, the head of KKR\u2019s technology, media and telecom team, and John Park, another KKR executive, said in a statement.In this case, KKR is buying BMC from Bain Capital, Golden Gate Capital, Singapore\u2019s G.I.C. sovereign wealth fund, Insight Venture Partners and Elliott Management.The advisers on the deal: For BMC: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.For KKR: Macquarie Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Financing will come from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedCTRL-Labs, a three-year-old start-up whose co-founders include the creator of Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, has a vision of how humans could one day interact with computers: It\u2019s making an armband that reads electrical impulses sent from users\u2019 brains to their fingers.\u201cIf we can recreate virtually what the hand is doing, then we\u2019ve captured all the information that\u2019s coming out of the muscles themselves,\u201d Thomas Reardon, a CTRL-Labs co-founder and the Internet Explorer creator, told me in an interview. (Mr. Reardon argued that smartphones actually represented a step backward, introducing an imperfect way to control computers even as it let consumers gobble up more information.)And the start-up has signed up some heavyweight investors.

Can CTRL-Labs do it? And will developers and consumers buy in if they can?\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe coffee shop giant will close 8,000 stores for four hours this afternoon. Why? To put employees through racial bias training. The move has drawn jeers, but Andrew argues it\u2019s a laudable effort \u2014 if only because so few American corporations have been willing to tackle race issues.Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday.All eyes have been on the E.U.\u2019s sweeping new digital privacy rules. But an even stricter set of laws known as ePrivacy \u2014 meant to come in at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation, but slowed down by disagreements among officials \u2014 could give tech companies still larger headaches.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.Unsurprisingly, companies and trade associations are trying to derail those rules.C.E.O. Adam Neumann, who has 65 percent voting control, is one of two members of his board\u2019s compensation committee, along with longtime company investor Benchmark, according to WeWork\u2019s recent bond-offering documents.Venture capitalists have surrendered some oversight of many companies they\u2019ve invested in just to maintain relationships with them.\u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Gains Ground Under the New Volcker Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump is imposing tariffs on China. Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those. But it shows that the company is engaging in the debate on social issues all the same.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2014 Michael de la MercedOne day you\u2019re earning $1.5 million per year, the next the figure has $10.9 million. According to the WSJ, that\u2019s what happened to David King, the C.E.O. of the health care diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America.At least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10 percent for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows.Many changes, like LabCorp\u2019s, are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others can reflect changes in how the company decides to present the perks it has provided. In at least one case, the revised figure was the result of a retroactive pay cut.Microsoft\u2019s leapfrogging Alphabet in market value and new hardware from Nvidia are the latest signs that democratizing artificial intelligence tools is a lucrative business.The world is rapt by A.I. and the way it could be used to transform all kinds of industries. The problem: The technology requires stacks of computing power and significant expertise. So some companies have been creating A.I. software that\u2019s easier to use, then hosting it on their own cloud servers so people can pay for just the processing that they need to do, rather than shelling out for their own exotic hardware.That will allow other organizations to build more capable cloud A.I. systems and benefit from the wind filling Microsoft\u2019s sails.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeInvestors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.Elsewhere in tradeThe bottom line from the Justice Department\u2019s approval of Bayer\u2019s $66 billion deal for Monsanto: The department wants asset sales, not behavioral changes, in exchange for approving mergers.The question now: Will the cancellation lead to a big conservative backlash \u2014 perhaps led by President Trump, a supporter of Ms. Barr?\u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside a Powerful Silicon Valley Charity, a Toxic Culture Festered", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Silicon Valley technology executives have amassed enormous fortunes in recent years, one relatively obscure group \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation \u2014 has emerged as the local charity of choice.Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has donated stock worth more than $1.8 billion to the foundation. Reed Hastings, the founder and chief executive of Netflix, has given $100 million. And many other tech titans, including the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Microsoft\u2019s co-founder Paul Allen, have donated millions.According to interviews with a half dozen former and current employees, some of whom agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, Mari Ellen Loijens, the foundation\u2019s top fund-raiser, routinely bullied and demeaned colleagues, made sexually and racially insensitive remarks and at times even threatened physical violence.The employees say that Emmett Carson, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, ignored multiple complaints about abusive behavior by Ms. Loijens because she was responsible for much of the organization\u2019s growth.\u201cShe brought in the money, made the place bigger, and he could go out and be a superstar,\u201d said Rebecca Dupras, an executive who said she left the foundation last year because she no longer wanted to work with Ms. Loijens. \u201cHe could have stopped this and reined her in, and he didn\u2019t.\u201dCiting the ongoing investigation, Sue McAllister, a foundation spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about the allegations against Ms. Loijens and Mr. Carson.\u201cThe investigation will be thorough, and will include a focus on workplace culture, including among other things, how teams are managed and what type of working environment is being fostered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not able to comment on confidential internal H.R. matters.\u201dMr. Carson initially suggested on Twitter he was unaware of the problems at his foundation, and has not spoken publicly since being placed on leave. He and Ms. Loijens did not respond to requests for comment.The foundation\u2019s upheaval has sent shock waves through the philanthropic world. Mr. Carson was a respected nonprofit executive with a rising national profile, and his ambition to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation a national powerhouse was well-known.The foundation was formed in 2007 through the merger of two local charities that decided to pool their resources. Mr. Carson, who had worked at the Ford Foundation and was chief executive of the Minneapolis Foundation, was brought in to raise the group\u2019s profile.Community foundations have historically been local affairs, vehicles for wealthy individuals to give back to their communities by investing in regional nonprofit groups.But Mr. Carson had a grander mission. With huge fortunes being created by technology companies, there was a chance to make the Silicon Valley Community Foundation one of the nation\u2019s biggest philanthropies, an institution that could rival the foundations created with Gilded Age wealth a century ago.Mr. Carson pushed his team to raise as much money as possible, and the foundation increasingly gave grants not just to local groups, but to national and international causes, ranging from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Sweden.\u201cThere was this bigger is better mentality,\u201d said Dory Gannes, who worked at the foundation for two years, leaving in 2016 after what she said was a dispute with Ms. Loijens. \u201cOur world was driven by scale \u2014 how many clients we had, how many grants we processed, how many countries we made grants to.\u201dMs. Loijens, who came from the Junior League of San Jose, distinguished herself as an accomplished fund-raiser and made herself indispensable to Mr. Carson. Yet to her colleagues, Ms. Loijens was known as a bully who regularly made offensive remarks.During one meeting, Ms. Dupras said she mentioned to the group that she wasn\u2019t feeling well, eliciting a sexually charged retort from Ms. Loijens.\u201cShe said I was pretty good looking and might be pregnant,\u201d Ms. Dupras said. \u201cShe said, \u2018You might want to get that checked out.\u2019\u201dElizabeth Dressel, who left the foundation in 2012, said that one evening, a young black woman on her team was working late. Ms. Loijens approached the young woman and said, \u201cWork, slave, work.\u201dAt another meeting, Ms. Dupras said Ms. Loijens threatened her staff. Employees were supposed to take meetings with donors or their advisers in pairs, but Ms. Loijens learned that someone had met with a donor without a partner.\u201cThen she said, \u2018If I ever catch you having a meeting by yourself, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dupras said.\u201cI personally went to H.R. on more than five occasions, and I was only there for one year,\u201d Ms. Dressel said. \u201cBut the culture was supported by Emmett because the sole focus was to increase the size of the funds.\u201dMs. Dupras said she attempted to discuss the toxic workplace culture with Mr. Carson twice, but was brushed off. \u201cHe was definitely not open to a conversation about her at all,\u201d she said.Despite the internal turmoil, money kept flowing into the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Since 2011, Mr. Zuckerberg has donated some 45 million shares of Facebook stock to the organization, worth roughly $1.8 billion at the time they were given. In 2014, GoPro\u2019s founder, Nicholas Woodman, donated stock worth $500 million to the foundation. That same year, WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder, Jan Koum, donated stock worth $566 million.It was a distinction that grated on former employees. \u201cThis guy is enabling bullying in the workplace, then he\u2019s walking around promoting philanthropy,\u201d Ms. Dupras said.After the allegations first surfaced last month, Mr. Carson took to Twitter.But a former employee, Maria Moreno, quickly called out Mr. Carson.The next week, a group of 65 current staff members sent the foundation\u2019s board a statement that accused the foundation\u2019s leadership team, including Mr. Carson, of ignoring complaints about Ms. Loijens.\u201cThey knew about her behavior,\u201d read the statement, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times. \u201cAnd, through their inaction, senior leadership and HR has created and reinforced a toxic culture of fear, blame and intimidation.\u201dWithin days, Mr. Carson was placed on leave and the human resources director, Daiva Natochy, had left the foundation.Donors to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation have had little to say about the turmoil at their charity of choice. Representatives for Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Hastings said they support the actions of the foundation\u2019s board, which placed Mr. Carson on leave and began the investigation.Former employees said they anguished over their decision to come forward, fearing it would jeopardize their careers, but felt they had a responsibility to do so.\u201cThe focus was on bringing dollars in the door, rather than creating a culture where people were supported and respected,\u201d said Ms. Dressel, who added that it was her four daughters who encouraged her to speak out publicly.Ms. Dressel said she hoped the departure of Mr. Carson and Ms. Loijens would allow the foundation to start fresh. \u201cIt could be an amazing organization doing wonderful charitable work,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the United States foundations that are larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations are larger; the Gates Foundation is not the only one larger than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why A.I. and Cryptocurrency Are Making One Type of Computer Chip Scarce", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two technology booms \u2014 some people might call them frenzies \u2014 are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity.Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin.With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers.\u201cThe chips are simply going out of stock,\u201d said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Beijing in 2014. \u201cAnd the problem is getting worse.\u201dMalong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip.When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier.\u201cWe need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThere is a tangible impact to our research work.\u201dBut he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. \u201cWe have never had this problem before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.\u201dG.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips.Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining.Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards \u2014 flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers \u2014 worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades.That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners \u2014 not to mention gamers \u2014 has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day.\u201cIt is a tough moment,\u201d said Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWe could do more if we had more of these\u201d chips in data centers. \u201cThere are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.\u201dAMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company\u2019s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough.This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I.Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices.\u201cYou want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,\u201d said Mr. Scott of Microsoft.The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year.Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia\u2019s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing.Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless.Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow.Mr. Zeiler said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures.\u201cThe demand,\u201d he said, \u201cis definitely crazy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a researcher who tracks graphics processing units. He is Jon Peddie, not Joe.Advertisement"}

The company has been reordering its international business to free up cash and resources so that it can focus on high-growth markets and leave those that are lagging.In China, Walmart is deepening its ties and taking a small stake in JD.com, which competes with Amazon and the country\u2019s own e-commerce giant, Alibaba.While such moves make sense on the grand chessboard of global retailing, Walmart will need to deliver. It is going to cost billions for Walmart to turn Flipkart into a profitable business.The deal will cut into Walmart\u2019s overall earnings by about 60 cents per share next year.Oct. 2017Parcel AcquisitionMarch 2018Grocery DeliveryEverybody has to eat, and that essential truth is embedded in Walmart\u2019s growth strategy.Walmart is the largest grocery store in the United States and when it comes to fresh food it has a major head start on Amazon, which has been ramping up its efforts after acquiring Whole Foods last June.But mastering food delivery is a steep challenge for Walmart.The company has experimented with partnerships with Uber, and store workers are making deliveries on their way home from work.\u201cThe grocery business is hard,\u201d said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cOnline grocery is even harder.\u201dAug. 2016Jet AcquisitionMarch 2017Modcloth AcquisitionJune 2017Bonobos AcquisitionKelly green golf pants.

But that deal has shown signs of trouble. Last quarter, analysts said Jet\u2019s growth had slowed and the company said it would focus its efforts on finding new customers through its flagship website, Walmart.com.\u201cA lot of the e-commerce push has been trying to appeal to higher income demographics,\u201d said Mr. Mushkin. \u201cThe problem is that the Walmart brand doesn\u2019t always translate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Eliminates Forced Arbitration for Sexual Misconduct Claims", "Date": "2018-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber said on Tuesday that it was eliminating forced arbitration agreements for employees, riders and drivers who make sexual assault or harassment claims against the company.Before they could use Uber\u2019s ride-hailing app, customers have had to consent to a terms-of-service agreement that required them to resolve any legal claims with the company in an arbitration hearing, rather than in open court. Now, customers can take those claims to court, the company said.The decision to yield to pressure from critics who had pushed Uber to forgo the controversial legal practice is the company\u2019s latest move to improve its badly tarnished image since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive last August.With hopes for an initial public offering sometime in 2019, Uber is eager to move past a series of scandals that rocked the company over the past year and is trying to distance itself from behavior that prompted a grass-roots campaign urging riders to #DeleteUber.That new direction includes ending the use of forced arbitration agreements. The practice \u2014 common to many industries \u2014 has been denounced for allowing companies to keep sexual misconduct claims out of the court system and away from public view. Because the claims are kept under wraps in confidential hearings, critics say bad behavior is allowed to perpetuate without warning to future victims.Uber already allows drivers and employees to get out of arbitration agreements, as long as they opt out within the first 30 days of signing a contract with the company. The changes detailed on Tuesday will also eliminate that 30-day requirement.In a blog post, Uber said anyone bringing a sexual assault or harassment claim against the company would not be forced into arbitration and could pursue the matter in court. Uber also did away with a clause requiring people who settle such claims with Uber to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would forbid them from speaking about their experience.\u201cIt\u2019s important to give sexual assault, and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims. So moving forward, survivors will be free to choose to resolve their individual claims in the venue they prefer,\u201d wrote Tony West, Uber\u2019s chief legal officer. \u201cThey will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.\u201dAfter Uber\u2019s announcement, its rival Lyft said it would also waive mandatory arbitration agreements around sexual misconduct claims against the company and forgo confidentiality requirements for people who settle claims with Lyft.Uber also said it planned to publish a safety transparency report that would provide data on sexual assaults and other episodes that take place on the \u201cUber platform.\u201d That would include rides and deliveries, as well such incidents that happen before pick up or after drop off.The company said it planned to publish the review after it completed a system for reporting incidents. Uber said it hoped to have the system, which it is working on with 80 women\u2019s groups, in place by the end of the year.\u201cThese kind of clauses are pretty common, but to have a company come out in front of it and say \u2018it\u2019s not the right thing to do\u2019 is significant,\u201d said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer for Raliance, an advocacy group working with Uber.In December, Microsoft announced it was eliminating forced arbitration agreements with employees who made sexual assault or harassment claims.In an interview, Mr. West, a former Justice Department official who joined Uber in November, said its new policy applied to people currently in arbitration with Uber over sexual assault of harassment claims.He said waiving of arbitration only applied to those claims and not for other legal claims, like discrimination. Also, Uber will not lift the nondisclosure agreements on people who agreed to remain quiet in past settlements with the company.Mr. West said the company struggled with the decision to commit to a safety transparency report for its rides, because he knows that it will be \u201cdisturbing\u201d when the actual number of assaults that happen on Uber is announced \u2014 in part because of the company\u2019s size and the ease with which customers can report an incident.Also, there is no common terminology in law enforcement for reporting sexual assaults and sometimes the definitions of \u201csexual assault\u201d differ from organization to organization, he said.Mr. West said he expected the number of reported assaults to increase in the first six to nine months after reporting the initial figures because \u201cpeople will see that we are paying attention, that we are counting, that we looking to act on this data and that will encourage more reporting.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a change to Uber\u2019s terms-of-service agreement. The company\u2019s customers can now take individual claims of sexual assault or harassment to court, rather than forced arbitration. They cannot join class-action lawsuits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Cracked the Lottery", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "It\u2019s pricey, it\u2019s portable, its users need it constantly, and retailers love to buy it at a discount. All of which makes it a perfect product to steal.Insys Therapeutics paid millions of dollars to doctors.

Despite holding the contents of an investigation still open after more than two years, the file was barely half an inch thick. \u201cHappy birthday,\u201d his boss said.It was not Rob Sand\u2019s birthday. His boss, an Iowa deputy attorney general named Thomas H. Miller, was retiring in July 2014 after nearly three decades of prosecuting everything from murder to fraud. He hired Sand about four years earlier and made him the youngest prosecutor in a nine-attorney team that handled challenging cases all over the state. Now Miller was offloading cases to colleagues. This one, having to do with a suspicious lottery ticket worth $16.5 million, was full of dead ends. Investigators didn\u2019t even know if a crime had been committed. The most tantalizing pieces of evidence were on a DVD: two grainy surveillance clips from a gas station. Sand slid the disc into his laptop and pressed play.A man walked into a QuikTrip convenience store just off Interstate 80 in Des Moines. It was a weekday afternoon, two days before Christmas. The hood of the man\u2019s black sweatshirt was pulled over his head, obscuring his face from two surveillance cameras overhead. Under the hoodie, he appeared to be wearing a ball cap; over the hoodie, he wore a black jacket. The man grabbed a fountain drink and two hot dogs.\u201cHello!\u201d the cashier said brightly.The man replied in a low-pitched drawl, a voice that struck Sand as distinct: \u201cHell-ooooh.\u201d\u201cCouple hot dogs?\u201d the cashier asked.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the man replied quietly, his head down.The man pulled two pieces of paper from his pocket. They were play slips for Hot Lotto, a Powerball-like lottery game available in 14 states and Washington, D.C. A player \u2014 or the game\u2019s computer \u2014 picked five numbers between 1 and 39 and then a sixth number, known as the Hot Ball, between 1 and 19. The prize for getting the first five numbers right was $10,000. But a much larger prize that varied according to the number of players who bought tickets went to anyone who got all six numbers right. The record Hot Lotto jackpot of nearly $20 million had been claimed in 2007. The jackpot at the time of this video was approaching the record. The stated odds of winning it were one in 10,939,383.The cashier took the man\u2019s play slips, which had already been filled out with multiple sets of numbers. At 3:24 p.m., the cashier ran the slips through the lottery terminal. An older man with a cane limped by the refrigerated section. A bus drove by. The cashier handed over his change. Once outside, the man pulled down his hood and removed his cap, got into his S.U.V. and drove away. The gas-station parking lot gleamed; there had been snow flurries that afternoon.Two years into the case, that was virtually all the investigators had. Sand watched the video again and again, trying to pick up every little detail: the S.U.V.\u2019s make; the man\u2019s indistinct appearance: most likely in his 40s, and 100 pounds overweight, maybe more; the tenor of his voice.Sand, a baby-faced Iowan who turned down Harvard Law School for the University of Iowa College of Law, had a background that seemed perfect for the case: a high school job writing computer code and doing tech support, a specialty in white-collar crime. His recent cases included securities fraud and theft by public officials.The ticket in the video was purchased on Dec. 23, 2010. Six days later, the winning Hot Lotto numbers were selected: 3, 12, 16, 26, 33, 11. The next day, the Iowa Lottery announced that a QuikTrip in Des Moines had sold the winning ticket. But one month after the numbers were drawn, no one had presented the ticket.The Iowa Lottery held a news conference. Phone calls poured in; dozens of people claimed to be the winner. Some said they had lost the ticket. Others said it was stolen from them. But lottery officials had crucial evidence that wasn\u2019t publicly available: the serial number on the winning ticket and the video of the man buying it. One by one, they crossed off prospective claimants. One caller said his friend was a regular Hot Lotto player who had just died in a car wreck \u2014 should he go to the junkyard to search through his deceased friend\u2019s car?Three months after the winning ticket was announced, the lottery issued another public reminder. Another followed at six months and again at nine months, each time warning that winners had one year to claim their money. \u201cI was convinced it would never be claimed,\u201d says Mary Neubauer, the Iowa Lottery\u2019s vice president of external relations. Since 1999, she had dealt with around 200 people who had won more than $1 million; she\u2019d never seen a winning million-dollar ticket go unclaimed. \u201cAnd then comes Nov. 9, 2011.\u201dA man named Philip Johnston, a lawyer from Quebec, called the Iowa Lottery and gave Neubauer the correct 15-digit serial number on the winning Hot Lotto ticket. Neubauer asked his age \u2014 in his 60s, he said \u2014 and what he was wearing when he purchased the ticket. His description, a sports coat and gray flannel dress pants, did not match the QuikTrip video. Then, in a subsequent call, the man admitted he had \u201cfibbed\u201d; he said he was helping a client claim the ticket so the client wouldn\u2019t be identified.This was against the Iowa Lottery rules, which require the identities of winners to be public. Johnston floated the possibility of withdrawing his claim. Neubauer was suspicious: The winner\u2019s anonymity was worth $16.5 million?One year to the day after the winning numbers popped up on the random-number-generator computers \u2014 and less than two hours before the 4 p.m. deadline \u2014 representatives from a prominent Des Moines law firm showed up at the Iowa Lottery\u2019s headquarters with the winning ticket. The firm was claiming the ticket on behalf of a trust. Later, the Iowa Lottery learned that the trust\u2019s beneficiary was a corporation in Belize whose president was Philip Johnston, the Canadian attorney. \u201cIt just absolutely stunk all over the place,\u201d says Terry Rich, chief executive of the Iowa Lottery. The Iowa attorney general\u2019s office and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation opened a case.In an interview in Quebec City, Johnston told investigators that he had been contacted about the ticket by a Houston attorney named Robert Sonfield. Johnston also pointed investigators toward a Sugar Land, Tex., businessman named Robert Rhodes. A trip to Texas by Iowa investigators proved fruitless; during their several days there, both Sonfield and Rhodes managed to avoid them.By the time the file ended up on the desk of Rob Sand in 2014, the case had acquired cultlike status in his office. It was spoken about with gallows humor: \u201cWe\u2019ll find the guy who bought the ticket ended up getting offed,\u201d Sand said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is going to turn out to be, a murder case.\u201dMiller had mentored Sand and saw in him a kindred spirit, someone for whom practicing law was a calling. Sometimes Sand\u2019s moral compass was so steady that he came off as a square; his brothers-in-law nicknamed him Baby Jesus. Sand grew up in Decorah, in northeast Iowa, the son of a small-town doctor who still made house calls. He wanted to get into white-collar criminal prosecution because it focused not on crimes of desperation but on crimes of greed. \u201cCrimes against gratitude,\u201d Sand called them.But all he had was grainy video of a man buying a lottery ticket worth $16.5 million. \u201cWe only had one bullet left in our revolver,\u201d Sand says, \u201cand that was releasing the video.\u201dOn Oct. 9, 2014, nearly 46 months after the man in the hoodie left the QuikTrip, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation put out a news release that included a link to a 74-second clip of the surveillance footage. A few days later, in Maine, an employee of the Maine Lottery opened an email forwarded from his boss. The employee recognized the distinct voice in the video: It belonged to a man who had spent a week in the Maine Lottery offices a few years earlier conducting a security audit.In Des Moines, a web developer at the Iowa Lottery who watched the video also recognized that voice: It belonged to a man she had worked alongside for years. A receptionist in another lottery office handed her earbuds to Noelle Krueger, a draw manager, and told her to listen. \u201cWhy am I listening to a video or listening to a tape of Eddie?\u201d Krueger replied.By Eddie, she meant Eddie Tipton, the information-security director for the Multi-State Lottery Association. The organization runs lotteries for 33 different states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was based in the Des Moines suburbs. Among the games it ran was the Hot Lotto.Tipton built a 4,800-square-foot, $540,000 house in the cornfields south of Des Moines. The house had five bedrooms and a huge basement, including a pool table, a shuffleboard table, a stadium-style home theater with couches and a space he considered turning into a basketball court. Friends wondered why a single man needed such a big house and how he could afford it on a salary just shy of $100,000 a year. In private moments, Tipton told them he was lonely and wanted a family more than anything, so he poured his savings into the house he hoped to fill with a wife and children. But the right partner never came. Instead, he hosted office Christmas parties, and he constantly asked friends to visit. His family, still in Texas, checked on him frequently.His life revolved around his job. The Multi-State Lottery Association was a small organization, and Tipton felt overextended. He wrote software and worked on web pages. He handled network security and firewalls. And he reviewed security for lottery games in nearly three dozen states. He was putting in 60-hour weeks and staying at the office until 11 p.m.When Ed Stefan, the chief information officer and chief security officer at the Multi-State Lottery Association, saw the surveillance video, he didn\u2019t want to believe it. This wasn\u2019t just some co-worker. This was Eddie Tipton, a man he had known for more than two decades, since they were in calculus class at the University of Houston. Stefan met his future wife while he and Tipton were on a charity bike ride in Texas; Tipton would later be in their wedding. Stefan helped Tipton get his job at the association. They bought some 50 acres of land together and built adjacent houses. They even applied for a joint patent for computer-based lottery security.Jason Maher was another friend and colleague who didn\u2019t want to believe what he was seeing on the video. He and Tipton had met at Taki, a Japanese restaurant outside Des Moines that they both frequented. The lifelong computer aficionados and gamers hit it off; Tipton joined Maher\u2019s gaming clan, and they spent hours playing the multiplayer online game World of Tanks. Tipton suggested Maher apply for a job at the lottery association as a network engineer. Tipton, Maher told me, \u201chad a heart of gold.\u201dSo when Maher saw the video and heard that familiar low-pitched voice, he did what a computer whiz does. \u201cThat night I sat down \u2014 there\u2019s no way Eddie did this,\u201d Maher said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something wrong.\u201d He put the file of the surveillance tape into audio software, removed white noise and isolated the voice. Then he took footage from security cameras in his house \u2014 Tipton had just visited the night before \u2014 and compared Tipton\u2019s voice in that footage with the convenience-store video. \u201cIt was a complete and utter match, sound wave and everything,\u201d Maher said. The next day, he went to the QuikTrip where the ticket was purchased and measured the dimensions of the tiles on the floor, the height of the shelving units, the distance between the door and the cash register. He used the results to compare the hand size, foot size and height of the man in the video with the man he had become friends with.\u201cWhen the F.B.I. guys came in, I wanted to be able to tell them it wasn\u2019t Eddie,\u201d Maher said. \u201cOnce I did this, it was like, \u2018Well, [expletive] \u2014 it\u2019s Eddie.\u2019\u2009\u201dTipton was arrested in January 2015 and charged with two felony counts of fraud. Half a year later, on a hot, sticky July morning, Rob Sand stood before a jury at the Polk County Courthouse. \u201cThis is a classic story about an inside job,\u201d he began. \u201cA man who by virtue of his employment is not allowed to play the lottery, nor allowed to win, buys a lottery ticket, wins and passes the ticket along to friends to be claimed by someone unconnected to him. This story, though, has a 21st-century twist.\u201dThe prosecution knew Tipton had bought the winning ticket. The video, specifically the distinct voice that colleagues had recognized, made that pretty clear. So did cellphone records, which showed Tipton was in town that day, not out of town for the holidays as he claimed, and that he had been on the phone for 71 minutes with Robert Rhodes, the man who briefly had possession of the ticket. Investigators believed he\u2019d fixed the lottery. But how?Jason Maher, Tipton\u2019s gaming buddy, told them about Tipton\u2019s interest in rootkits: malicious software that can be installed via flash drive in order to take control of a computer while masking its existence until it deletes itself later. Sand theorized that Tipton went into the draw room six weeks before the big jackpot and, despite the presence of two colleagues, managed to insert a thumb drive into one of the two computers that select the winning numbers. That thumb drive contained the rootkit; the rootkit allowed Tipton to direct which numbers would win the Hot Lotto on Dec. 29, 2010.Tipton\u2019s defense attorney, Dean Stowers, called this the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theory. Stowers characterized the story of a malicious, self-destructing rootkit (\u201cmagic software\u201d), installed while two colleagues looked on, as preposterous. His closing arguments referenced a quotation attributed to Albert Einstein: \u201cLogic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you anywhere.\u201dBut Sand called Stowers\u2019s focus on this complicated rootkit theory a red herring. Sand told the jury to focus on the many ways Tipton could have fixed the lottery: He wrote the code. He had access to the random-number-generator machines before they were shipped to other states. You don\u2019t have to understand the exact technology to convict Tipton, Sand argued; you just have to realize the near-impossible coincidence of the lottery security chief\u2019s buying a winning ticket and that ticket\u2019s being passed to his best friend. The prosecution had to prove only that Tipton tried to illegally buy lottery tickets as a Multi-State Lottery Association employee and tried to claim the prize through fraudulent means.The jury found him guilty on July 20, 2015. He would be sentenced to 10 years in prison, and he would appeal. The State Supreme Court later dismissed his conviction on one charge, tampering with lottery equipment, and the case was sent back to District Court.Six weeks after the trial concluded, Sand had returned to his desk. It had been a busy summer. But in the back of his mind, he was still thinking about Eddie Tipton. Sand knew white-collar criminals aren\u2019t usually caught on their first attempt. The fact that Tipton\u2019s attorney had demanded a 90-day speedy trial, an unusual maneuver that cut short the prosecution\u2019s time to investigate, made Sand suspicious. His gut said other fraudulent lottery tickets were out there.One morning Sand\u2019s office phone rang, and an area code he recognized popped up: 281, from Texas, where Tipton used to live. Sand picked up. The caller had a drawl and told Sand he\u2019d seen an article in the La Grange, Tex., newspaper about Tipton\u2019s conviction. \u201cDid y\u2019all know,\u201d the tipster asked, \u201cthat Eddie\u2019s brother Tommy Tipton won the lottery, maybe about 10 years back?\u201dA man named Tom Bargas had contacted local law-enforcement authorities in early 2006 with a suspicious story. Bargas owned 44 fireworks stands in Texas. Twice a year \u2014 after the Fourth of July and after New Year\u2019s \u2014 he had to handle enormous amounts of cash, more than a half-million dollars at once. A local justice of the peace who shod Bargas\u2019s horses called him around New Year\u2019s. The justice of the peace caught Bargas off guard: \u201cI got half a million in cash that I want to swap with your money.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your money?\u201d Bargas replied.What\u2019s a justice of the peace who makes around $35,000 a year doing with that much cash? Bargas thought. He called the sheriff and the police, who called the F.B.I. Soon, the bureau contacted Bargas. Federal agents outfitted him with a wire. Bargas met with the man, who pulled out a briefcase filled with $450,000 in cash, still in their Federal Reserve wrappers. As the F.B.I. listened, Bargas swapped $100,000 of worn, circulated bills for $100,000 of the man\u2019s crisp, unused bills. To the F.B.I., this smelled like public corruption, and they went to work investigating the serial numbers on the bills.One day a couple of months later, Rennison got a call from the Fayette County sheriff in La Grange, a place best known for the Chicken Ranch, the brothel that inspired \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\u201d The sheriff was laughing so hard he could hardly speak. He told Rennison the justice of the peace was holed up in a Houston hospital with two shattered legs. He had fallen 31 feet out of a tree. He had been hunting Bigfoot.\u201cMy grandmother was raised on a farm in Arkansas where this creature would come in and harass all the farm animals,\u201d this man later told investigators. \u201cMy grandmother would tell me all these stories of this animal that harassed my family.\u201d He went on: \u201cI started hitting the woods. It was always that doubt in your mind. And then something happened to me in Louisiana where I actually watched these animals for a couple of hours, and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since.\u201dRennison visited the man in the hospital and then set up an interview once he was discharged. The man was a member of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. He told Rennison he\u2019d won the lottery in Colorado while on a Bigfoot hunt. He was on the outs with his wife and was trying to keep the lottery winnings from her. A Bigfoot-hunting friend claimed the prize in exchange for 10 percent of the money. It all checked out. Case closed.\u201cRight before I leave, we\u2019re still sitting down at this nice conference table, and he looks over at his attorneys and says, \u2018Can I show him?\u2019\u2009\u201d Rennison recalled. \u201cHanging off the back of his chair is a plastic grocery bag. He pulls out a plaster cast of a footprint.\u201dRennison put the footprint next to his own foot. They were roughly the same size. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like Bigfoot,\u201d the F.B.I. agent said. \u201cIt was a juvenile,\u201d the man snapped. The man\u2019s name was Tommy Tipton.The investigators collected a decade\u2019s worth of winners from lotteries around the country associated with the Multi-State Lottery Association. They loaded data from approximately 45,000 winning tickets into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and searched for any connections to Eddie Tipton. They reviewed Tipton\u2019s Facebook friends, pulled phone records and looked for matches with the spreadsheet.In September 2015, they learned that a $783,257.72 payout for Wisconsin\u2019s Very Own Megabucks Game had been claimed in early 2008 by a Texas man named Robert Rhodes, who wanted to deposit it into the account of a limited-liability corporation. That drawing took place on Dec. 29, 2007 \u2014 the same day the winning numbers on Tipton\u2019s $16.5 million Iowa ticket were selected three years later. Rhodes was Eddie Tipton\u2019s best friend. Another hit.One evening over the holidays, Sand was at his parents\u2019 house working on his laptop, sifting through records, using search commands on his computer again and again. He noticed that a Kyle Conn from Hemphill, Tex., won a $644,478 jackpot in the Oklahoma Lottery some years back. Tommy Tipton had three Facebook friends named Conn. Sand got a list of possible phone numbers for a Kyle Conn and cross-referenced them with Tommy Tipton\u2019s cellphone records. Another hit.Investigators noticed two winning Kansas Lottery tickets for $15,402 apiece were purchased on Dec. 23, 2010 \u2014 the same day Tipton had purchased the Iowa ticket, and the same day that cellphone records indicated he was driving through Kansas on the way to Texas for the holidays. One of the winning tickets was claimed by a Texan named Christopher McCoulskey, the other by an Iowa woman named Amy Warrick. Each was a friend of Eddie Tipton\u2019s.Early one morning, Sand and an investigator knocked on the woman\u2019s door. She told them she\u2019d gone on one date with Tipton, but their relationship became platonic. Tipton told her he wasn\u2019t able to claim a winning lottery ticket because of his job. If she could claim it, Tipton said, she could keep a significant portion as a gift for her recent engagement.Investigators in Wisconsin discovered they still had the random-number-generator computers used for the 2007 jackpot sitting in storage. Unlike Iowa\u2019s computers, the hard drives had not been wiped clean; their software was the same as the day Robert Rhodes won $783,257.72. Wisconsin enlisted a computer expert named Sean McLinden to conduct an investigation that included forensic analysis and reverse engineering.On Jan. 7, 2016, Sand\u2019s phone rang. It was David Maas, an assistant attorney general in Wisconsin. He told Sand to check his email. Maas had sent him an attachment with 21 lines of \u201cpseudocode,\u201d a common-language translation of McLinden\u2019s forensic analysis that showed part of Tipton\u2019s malicious computer code. The code was small enough that it would not radically change the size of the file, which might create suspicion. And the code hadn\u2019t been hidden. You just needed to know what to look for.\u201cThis,\u201d Maas says, \u201cwas finding the smoking gun.\u201dThe smoking gun would help lead to a guilty plea from Tipton. In the plea deal, Sand insisted that Tipton come clean about how he fixed the lottery. This could help the lottery industry improve its security. If Tipton lied \u2014 or if another fraudulent ticket were found later \u2014 the deal would be voided, and Tipton would be subject to further charges.Tipton\u2019s program was called QVRNG.dll: Quantum Vision Random Number Generator. In Tipton\u2019s telling, his wasn\u2019t an evil plan to get rich. This was just a computer nerd\u2019s attempt to crack the system. \u201cIt was never my intent to start a full-out ticket scam,\u201d Tipton told investigators. \u201cIt occurred to me, like, Wow, I could do this, I could be making a living doing this.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf this was, like, some mob-related thing, I\u2019d just give this information to the mob and they would go out and win the lotteries left and right. Nobody would know. But that \u2014 I don\u2019t have any mob ties. I don\u2019t know anybody. I gave tickets to friends or family.\u201dMore than a decade ago, Tipton told them, he walked past one of the organization\u2019s accountants at the Multi-State Lottery Association. Tipton was conservative, the accountant liberal, and they often ribbed each other.\u201cHey, did you put your secret numbers in there?\u201d the accountant said, teasing Tipton.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWell, you know, you can set numbers on any given day since you wrote the software.\u201dAnd that\u2019s when the idea first came. \u201cJust like a little seed that was planted,\u201d Tipton said in his proffer. \u201cAnd then during one slow period I just had a \u2014 had a thought that it\u2019s possible, and I tried it and I put it in.\u201d The code wasn\u2019t a brazen \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d stunt of sneaking into the draw room with a malicious thumb drive. It was a simple piece of code, partly copied from an internet source, inserted by the one man responsible for information security at an organization that runs three dozen United States lotteries.Here\u2019s how the Multi-State Lottery Association\u2019s random-number generators were supposed to work: The computer takes a reading from a Geiger counter that measures radiation in the surrounding air, specifically the radioactive isotope Americium-241. The reading is expressed as a long number of code; that number gives the generator its true randomness. The random number is called the seed, and the seed is plugged into the algorithm, a pseudorandom number generator called the Mersenne Twister. At the end, the computer spits out the winning lottery numbers.Tipton\u2019s extra lines of code first checked to see if the coming lottery drawing fulfilled Tipton\u2019s narrow circumstances. It had to be on a Wednesday or a Saturday evening, and one of three dates in a nonleap year: the 147th day of the year (May 27), the 327th day (Nov. 23) or the 363rd day (Dec. 29). Investigators noticed those dates generally fell around holidays \u2014 Memorial Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 when Tipton was often on vacation. If those criteria were satisfied, the random-number generator was diverted to a different track. Instead, the algorithm would use a predetermined seed number that restricted the pool of potential winning numbers to a much smaller, predictable set of numbers.So Tipton knew what no one else knew: For the Iowa Hot Lotto drawing on Dec. 29, 2010, there weren\u2019t really 10,939,383 sets of possible winning numbers. There were only a few hundred. Late at night before a draw that fulfilled his criteria, Tipton stayed in his messy, computer-filled office. He set a test computer to the date and time of the coming draw, and he ran the program over and over again. For the first lottery he rigged, the Nov. 23, 2005, drawing in Colorado, Tipton wrote down each potential set of winning numbers on a yellow legal pad. He handed the pad \u2014 each sheet had 35 or so sets of six numbers \u2014 to his brother.It was a cheat sheet; instead of playing every possible number combination to ensure one combination won, he had to play only a few hundred. \u201cIf you want a chance to win, you need to play all of these,\u201d Tipton told his brother. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of them will win, but you\u2019re going anyway\u201d \u2014 his brother was about to go on a Bigfoot-hunting trip to Colorado \u2014 and \u201cthese have a good chance of winning based on my analysis.\u201cPlay them,\u201d he said. \u201cPlay them all.\u201dIn statements to prosecutors, Tipton painted himself in the most generous way possible, a kind of coding Robin Hood, stealing from the lottery and helping people in need: his brother who had five daughters, his friend who\u2019d just gotten engaged. \u201cI didn\u2019t really need the money,\u201d Tipton said. The judge noted that Tipton seemed to rationalize his actions \u2014 that Tipton didn\u2019t think it was necessarily illegal, just a taking advantage of a hole in the lottery\u2019s system. It wasn\u2019t all that different, Tipton believed, from insider trading, except laws didn\u2019t specifically prohibit him from fiddling with the random-number-generator code. His attorney equated what he did with counting cards at a casino. Tipton wasn\u2019t robbing the casino at gunpoint; he was cheating the house.The other side disagreed. Tipton was \u201cnothing but a common thief who happened to be handed the keys to the candy store,\u201d Miller, Sand\u2019s former boss, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of Sherlock Holmes\u2019s archnemesis, Moriarty, being a criminal genius. This is just a regular schlub, who is a thief who happens to have knowledge of computer security.\u201dFrom Tipton\u2019s point of view, it was complicated. He had done something to see if he could do it. To his surprise, it worked. He said he inserted that code only once; after the code was approved by Gaming Laboratories International, machines containing it were shipped all over the country. He had created a beast and sent it into the world. \u201cYou plant that money tree in your backyard,\u201d as Maas, the Wisconsin prosecutor, put it, \u201cand it\u2019s hard not to keep picking at it.\u201dIn interviews, investigators had asked Tipton if he was proud of the success of his code. \u201cIt was more like I\u2019m ready for it to be gone,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cIt was never my intent to go out there and start winning all these lotteries. It was just, like I said, step by step it happened.\u201dAt sentencing, the judge asked if Tipton had anything to say. After a long pause, Tipton cleared his throat. Family members and former co-workers were in the courtroom. \u201cWell,\u201d Tipton said matter-of-factly, \u201cI certainly regret my actions. It\u2019s difficult to say that with all the people behind me that I hurt. And I regret it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d As the case was being litigated, Tipton had confessed to friends that he was racked with guilt. At another point during the proceedings, Tipton leaned across a divide and extended his hand to Sand. Sand took the handshake as a sign of respect, as if Tipton had thought he outsmarted the system but the system figured him out. On the day of his sentencing, Tipton told the judge he\u2019d been taking classes to go into ministry. A deputy placed Tipton in handcuffs and led him away.Earlier in the summer, Tipton sat in a conference room with Sand and law-enforcement and lottery officials to give his full confession, as promised in his plea agreement. Eventually he would head to Clarinda Correctional Facility in southern Iowa, near the Missouri border, where he remains today, Offender No. 6832975. (Through his attorney, he declined interview requests for this article; Tipton did not respond to nearly a dozen emails through the prison email system.)During a lunch break in Tipton\u2019s hourslong confession, Sand and others involved in the prosecution walked a few blocks to the High Life Lounge. They ordered bacon-wrapped tater tots to celebrate. \u201cEddie sees himself as much brighter than the rest of the world, the sharpest tool in the toolbox,\u201d Sand says. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing I see in white-collar case after white-collar case, people who think they\u2019re better than everybody else, that people trust them and love them, and that no one will be able to figure this out.\u201dThe judge sentenced Tipton to a maximum of 25 years in prison. His restitution payments to the various state lotteries came to $2.2 million even though, according to his attorney, Tipton pocketed only around $350,000 from the scam, the rest going to those who claimed the tickets. (Prosecutors did not believe that, pointing to Tipton\u2019s massive house as well as the fact that Tipton and his brother owned 11 pieces of property either jointly or individually in Fayette County, Tex.) In Iowa, which has indeterminate sentencing, a 25-year sentence could mean Tipton is released much sooner; Sand expects Tipton to be released by the Iowa Board of Parole within seven years.Sand says he felt a deep intellectual satisfaction in solving the puzzle: \u201cThe justice system at its best is really about a search for truth.\u201d But it couldn\u2019t go back in time and correct wrongs. At the end of this yearslong case, he came to a realization: He had grown weary of dealing with criminals. \u201cIn so much darkness,\u201d Sand says, \u201cI started to lose my light.\u201dA few months after the highest-profile case of his career, Sand went up to his boss and quit. He had decided to run for state auditor in the coming November election, so he could make positive changes. If he wins, he will be investigating government waste, abuse and fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I would make a move to get away from the darkness of prosecution without finishing this case first,\u201d Sand says. \u201cSo finishing it, to me, was not merely satisfying. It was liberating.\u201dIt\u2019s pricey, it\u2019s portable, its users need it constantly, and retailers love to buy it at a discount. All of which makes it a perfect product to steal.Insys Therapeutics paid millions of dollars to doctors. The company called it a \u201cspeaker program,\u201d but prosecutors now call it something else: a kickback scheme.In 2016, a mysterious syndicate tried to steal $951 million from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank - and laid bare a profound weakness in the system by which money moves around the world.When the Iowa attorney general\u2019s office began investigating an unclaimed lottery ticket worth millions, an incredible string of unlikely winners came to light - and a trail that pointed to an inside job.How the biggest scammers get away with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Assume the Worst\u2019: This Isn\u2019t Your Ordinary Graduation Speech", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReader\u2019s NotebookIn days of yore, graduation speeches were fiery or throat-clenched battle cries, highly reliant on one or more familiar themes. Be bold, these call to arms exhorted: Dare to tilt at windmills with your own handmade pole vault. Question everything, they counseled \u2014 light a fire underneath your inner Ralph Nader. Make the world a better place, they goaded \u2014 you\u2019ll be too tired to do so once your newborn is power-blasting your shoulder with boysenberry-hued vomit.But today\u2019s commencement speeches, as evidenced by a new book (\u201cAssume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You\u2019ll Never Hear\u201d) by the novelist Carl Hiaasen and the cartoonist Roz Chast, and another (\u201cIn Conclusion, Don\u2019t Worry About It\u201d) by the actress Lauren Graham, are less fife-and-drum than plaintive bagpipe. Inspiration is superseded by skepticism or a shiny decal that might read: \u201cYou Are Enough.\u201dIn his offering, Mr. Hiaasen advises graduates that \u201clowering your expectations will inoculate you against serial disappointments,\u201d then debunking four \u201clame platitudes\u201d (\u201cLive each day as if it\u2019s your last,\u201d \u201cTry to find goodness in everyone you meet,\u201d etc.) that clog the graduation and self-help industries. The result is a Dave Barry-esque shuffle of loony sarcasm.Mr. Hiaasen applies pragmatic scorn to \u201cIf you set your mind to it, you can be anything you want to be,\u201d pointing out that if Bill Gates had tried to be a professional bronco rider, \u201che wouldn\u2019t have made it past his first rodeo \u2026 and Microsoft would today be a brand of absorbent underwear.\u201d Meanwhile, Ms. Chast breaks up the text with her signature blend of bug-eyed bedragglement.Whence this penchant for resignation and passive self-acceptance amongst commencement speakers? While an armchair sociologist might be tempted to scapegoat the current political climate or lagging attention spans in the face of spoken rhetoric, it\u2019s probably more useful to acknowledge the huge success of similarly skeptical and unbreathy commencement speeches of the recent past.The climax of TV titan Shonda Rhimes\u2019s best-selling memoir from last year, \u201cThe Year of Yes,\u201d recounts how Ms. Rhimes \u2014 an introvert who once hired a publicist to avoid public appearances \u2014 summoned the courage to give the 2014 commencement speech at Dartmouth. Her speech was full of rue: \u201cShonda, how do you do it all? The answer is: I don\u2019t. Whenever you see me succeeding in one area of my life, that almost certainly means I am failing in another area of my life. If I am killing it on a \u2018Scandal\u2019 script for work, I am probably missing bath and story time at home. If I am at home sewing my kids\u2019 Halloween costumes, I\u2019m probably blowing off a rewrite I was supposed to turn in.\u201dIf these young peoples\u2019 implied circumstances have been reduced, he suggests, their resultant actions needn\u2019t be. \u201cSky is not the limit,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt is only the beginning.\u201d Then: \u201cLift off.\u201dIn the end, maybe it\u2019s only fitting that graduation speeches now sometimes come in a new flavor (bitter melon). Graduating seniors, in the eyes of these texts, are neither lumps of clay nor young warriors equipped with lightsabers. As young folk take their seats and wonder what sort of medicine they\u2019ll be dispensed of \u2014 wide-eyed cheerleading? grim v\u00e9rit\u00e9? \u2014 they are getting a powerful preview of the suspense and open-endedness that their next few years will bring them.Welcome to life.Follow Henry Alford on Twitter: @henryalford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quilts, Cows, Money and Meaning: College Essays That Stood Out", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIn all my years of studying up on taxes, I\u2019d never read \u2014 or knew I wanted to read \u2014 an essay about how filling out Form 1040 can teach profound lessons about the enduring power of the human spirit.But then I came across a piece of writing by Caroline Beit, one of the nearly 300 high school seniors around the world who answered our open call this year with college application essays that touched on money, work and social class.Her tale of life in the trenches as a volunteer tax-preparer hits all the pleasure points of this particular form. You learn something about her character and how she spends her time that you could not find in a college application any other way. It is uniquely hers, and not just because there aren\u2019t many teenagers writing essays about doing other people\u2019s taxes.Ms. Beit, who lives in Bronxville, N.Y., reckons with money and feelings and their intersection in a manner that makes you see the world in a new way. \u201cI need much more than just technical knowledge,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is also essential to connect on a human level. I make it a point to put each person at ease by actively listening to his or her story.\u201d[Read the five essays that stood out.]The stories she tells in her essay include one about the young woman who cares for her grandmother, for whom the earned-income tax credit is 20 percent of her income. A mother whom Ms. Beit helped took the money that she would have spent on tax preparation at H&R Block and bought new track shoes for her son instead.\u201cOne of the people who read the application commented that they\u2019d never been so moved by the idea of doing taxes in their entire life,\u201d said Jeremiah Quinlan, the dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale, where Ms. Beit will start college in the fall of 2019 after a gap year.But why shouldn\u2019t money be moving and have meaning? It is a powerful force, but a confusing one precisely because we don\u2019t talk about it as much as we should. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have more money than average, it may be especially challenging to reckon with that fact.Jeffrey Yu, also accepted by Yale, wrote an essay about his stay-at-home father. \u201cMy family is a matriarchy in a patriarchal community,\u201d writes Mr. Yu, who lives in Endicott, N.Y. and whose mother is a physician. He describes the furtive glances and surprise he encounters when he explains that his dad \u201cdoes\u201d nothing. But he means everything to his son.In an essay set partly in Kenya, Eric Muthondu writes movingly about the daily life of his extended family there and the struggles of his immediate family in Texas. \u201cI ponder whether my parents \u2014 dregs floating across a diasporic sea before my time \u2014 would have imagined their sacrifices for us would come with sharp pains in their backs and newfound worries,\u201d he writes.To his relatives in Kenya, however, he\u2019s the young man with the braces. They want to know how many shillings it cost to fix his teeth that way and they mock him for his lack of soccer prowess. Mr. Muthondu will attend Harvard in the fall.At Colgate, as with most of the colleges that see large piles of application essays each year, admissions staff don\u2019t take off points for character flaws or stories about the mistakes their writers have made. In fact, they often seek people who can truly come into their own if they just get into the right school.\u201cWith my father incarcerated, the women in my family went to work,\u201d writes Kataryna Pi\u00f1a, who will attend Colgate in the fall. \u201cAt the age of 11, I started working for the very first time as a cleaning lady with my grandparents. Even though I wanted to help my family, I was ashamed to be a cleaning lady. I argued with my mother against living a life like that, a life in which I gave up my childhood for my family\u2019s stability.\u201dHer family calls her ungrateful, and eventually her grandmother inspires her to get past her resentment. Much of the essay explores those feelings of shame and Ms. Pi\u00f1a\u2019s feelings about those feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s really mature, that level of metacognition,\u201d said Jamiere Abney, senior assistant dean of admission at Colgate.Mr. Abney was also taken with the thread that ran through Ms. Pi\u00f1a\u2019s essay: a quilt that her grandmother began, patch by patch, and that Ms. Pi\u00f1a plans to complete now that her grandmother has grown ill. At the end, Ms. Pi\u00f1a\u2019s grandmother tells her to go make her own quilt now. \u201cThe metaphor works very well when we think about how students will move through campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things they might clean up or smooth out or add, all moving towards an end goal. But you don\u2019t get there without that first piece.\u201dThe single best sentence of the 2018 batch of essays was written by Alison Hess, an Illinois native who attends boarding school in Wisconsin. It is the last line of her essay about cows, farming, feminism and her father, and I won\u2019t give it away here.But it\u2019s clear that every sentence charmed her readers at the University of Chicago, where she will begin college this fall. \u201cThere is no pretense or calculation in this essay,\u201d said James G. Nondorf, dean of college admissions and financial aid. \u201cThere is loyalty and respect and deference but challenging ideas, too. That\u2019s hard to do for a 17-year-old.\u201dMr. Nondorf said that the university gets plenty of essays each year about work, but they\u2019re often about a company that a student has started or a patent won or sold to Microsoft. Rural applicants are somewhat rare; farmers rarer still.\u201cQuite honestly, the transcript and testing here were not perfect,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is a great example of how kids can represent themselves in so many ways. It doesn\u2019t require money or going to Andover \u2014 just being who they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations.

{"Headline": "Trying to Put a Value on the Doctor-Patient Relationship", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEBy KIM TINGLEYIn its push for profits, the U.S. health care system has made it difficult for patients to get personal attention from doctors. But what if hands-on medicine actually saves money \u2014 and lives?More than a decade later, my grandfather, who was 78 by then and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, developed pneumonia. When he was admitted to the county hospital, it was the same doctor \u2014 now my doctor, too \u2014 who came to his room to describe his options: go on a ventilator and go home, where he would most likely remain bedridden for the remainder of his life (probably months), or let the illness run its course and die within a few days. My grandfather asked if the latter would hurt much. The doctor said no, he could make him comfortable. All right, then, my grandfather replied.By the time the doctor abruptly tendered his retirement notice, I had long since moved away. I had lived with high-deductible health insurance for years and, after a few surprise bills I could not afford, I avoided medical professionals whenever possible. Often, when I didn\u2019t have a primary-care physician or couldn\u2019t remember his or her name (which changed with my ever-changing insurance policy), I filled out forms with my hometown doctor\u2019s name instead: George P. Fitzgerald III, M.D. But until my father told me about his letter, I had not reflected on his role in my life. I\u2019d rarely seen him more than once a year, and any problems I did have were unremarkable, easily treatable by someone else. And yet his departure felt like a loss.My father, after his final checkup, reported why the doctor was leaving: He objected to the increasing industrialization of medical care, in particular a new Medicare mandate that he update patients\u2019 medical histories electronically \u2014 not because he was old-fashioned or contrary (though he was both), but because the idea of dividing his attention between a computer screen and a patient offended him. This shift to electronic health records, intended to improve communication between a patient\u2019s various physicians as well as \u201cautomate and streamline provider workflow,\u201d was the latest in a series of incentives that the health-insurance market created over the past 20 years to maximize efficiency. In this payment system, the time-consuming process of cultivating a relationship with a patient is essentially worthless, because doing so is not a finite, billable procedure. For the doctor, however, the fourth generation of his family to practice medicine, it was vital to his craft.The question of what the role of a primary-care physician should be, and how it should be valued, has perhaps never been more urgent. That figure, typically a general practitioner, family doctor or internist, is a patient\u2019s first and often most personal connection to the rest of the health care system. But well-known corporations are betting that Americans would prefer to have health care \u201cdelivered\u201d by a trusted brand rather than a trusted physician. At least 10 of the nation\u2019s largest tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have designed tools and software for medical use and increased their involvement in health care start-up deals in recent years; the size of those deals went to nearly $3 billion in 2017 from under $300 million in 2012. Amazon, in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, has announced its intent to disrupt the industry \u2014 among other ways, by reinventing primary-care delivery. Walmart now offers primary-care services in some of its stores.Surprisingly little is known, though, about what the relationship between a patient and his or her primary-care doctor is actually worth, in terms of that patient\u2019s overall well-being or medical costs, regardless of who bears them. In fact, David Meltzer, an economist and a primary-care physician at the University of Chicago, may be the first and only researcher in the country trying to quantify that relationship\u2019s value in a randomized clinical trial, the most rigorous scientific method.\u201cI\u2019m a complete believer that it\u2019s going to change health care in America,\u201d he told me nearly two years ago. Meltzer continues to believe as much, now that his trial has produced preliminary results, which he plans to present at the end of June at the annual research meeting of AcademyHealth, a health-policy organization. His experiment suggests that strengthening the patient-doctor relationship can significantly reduce patients\u2019 hospitalizations and expenses (to hospitals and Medicare) and improve their mental health; it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to influence the plans that corporations, drawing on their expertise in efficiency and customer service, have to redesign the health care system.In 2016, I spent three weeks over four months at the University of Chicago Medical Center observing Meltzer\u2019s experiment. Its centerpiece was a primary-care practice that consisted of five physicians, a small staff and, at its peak, 1,000 high-risk Medicare patients. I saw more than 90 patient-doctor interactions there; in every instance, the university\u2019s media-relations manager made sure that the patients understood they could quite reasonably refuse me access. Yet almost everyone allowed me to sit in and write about whatever took place. The receptiveness to the presence of a stranger \u2014 potentially representing millions of other strangers \u2014 in these private moments puzzled me but did not seem to surprise Meltzer. Only much later did the question of why they said yes come to seem central to both his project and mine.But not long after physicians coalesced into a professional class, advances in research and technology made it increasingly untenable for any practitioner to master the entire medical canon. At the same time, many experienced physicians argued that medical schools were churning out experts in ever-narrower portions of the body who lacked empathy for the whole person. In 1927, Francis Peabody, a professor at Harvard Medical School, famously defined the trade-off in The Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe treatment of a disease may be entirely impersonal; the care of a patient must be completely personal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe significance of the intimate personal relationship between physician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it.\u201dUltimately, these unique relationships empowered physicians to reject intervention by any regulatory third party, including national government. But doctors\u2019 control over pricing gave rise to inflated costs and gradually sowed anger and mistrust among the public. Demand for reform led to the passage of Medicare in 1965, but the program, eager to avoid angering doctors and hospitals, embraced the same reimbursement practices of most private insurance plans, arbitrarily assigning flat fees to services, like outpatient checkups, regardless of the benefit to patients. For primary-care doctors \u2014 paid the same for a simple exam of a relatively healthy patient as for a more involved consultation with a chronically ill one \u2014 this created a perverse incentive: see as many healthy people and as few sick people as possible.As health-insurance providers prompted physicians to reorganize their patient pools, they simultaneously pushed patients to switch doctors by creating \u201cnetworks\u201d of physicians whose services were covered. (Those physicians, in turn, agreed to care for patients in accordance with the insurance companies\u2019 policies.) Consequently, and as a result of shifting benefits, as more working Americans signed up for employer-sponsored health insurance, many of them \u2014 41 percent, in one survey \u2014 \u201csevered established relationships with their physicians in order to seek new providers,\u201d according to a 1996 study in The American Journal of Public Health. The same study estimated that more than a third of Americans on Medicare who were 65 and older and who had a regular physician had been seeing him or her for a decade or more \u2014 and those with the longest ties had lower medical costs and were less likely to be hospitalized than those with the shortest.Yet concrete proof that the patient-doctor relationship was responsible for these better circumstances remained elusive. \u201cDespite a consensus that longitudinal care is important,\u201d the study\u2019s authors, Linda J. Weiss and Jan Blustein, then of the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, wrote, \u201cremarkably little is known about the actual value \u2014 in terms of health care processes, outcomes or costs \u2014 of long-term provider-patient relationships.\u201d Reliable data on such relationships simply didn\u2019t exist.One afternoon I watched one doctor, Ram Krishnamoorthi, examine L.A. Kizer, who had just turned 70. He was wearing a new-looking ball cap with a trout on it and pulling an oxygen tank. \u201cDid you go fishing?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked. He had been Kizer\u2019s doctor for more than two years, but he could never tell when such an innocuous question might turn out to be significant: If Kizer said yes, Krishnamoorthi could try using the activity to motivate healthful behavior, or he might find out that someone who could be tapped as a source of support had accompanied Kizer on the outing.\u201cUsed to,\u201d Kizer said. He suffered from congestive heart failure and was still breathing heavily from the trip down the hall.\u201cLet me see you walk over,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cThis is a lot worse than before. What happened?\u201d\u201cI saw you two weeks ago,\u201d Kizer said, \u201cand it feels like I woke up and I can\u2019t move.\u201d He added that he had gained four pounds. Krishnamoorthi rolled up his pants legs and probed his ankles. He pressed a stethoscope to his back. A doctor who had not seen Kizer so recently would have no reason to investigate his sudden decline (and Kizer, who said he didn\u2019t like doctors, might not have told an unfamiliar doctor that anything had changed). \u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d Krishnamoorthi asked.\u201cBus.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fluid,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said, referring to Kizer\u2019s added weight and difficulty walking and breathing. He asked if Kizer wanted to be admitted to the hospital, where he could get additional medications; Kizer declined. Krishnamoorthi eventually agreed to let him go home if he turned off his tank, waited for 10 minutes and had his blood-oxygen level checked. This would take up more of Krishnamoorthi\u2019s time \u2014 without generating additional reimbursement \u2014 but it would mean vast savings for the health care system if it helped him prevent Kizer from having an emergency on the bus later. Heeding Kizer\u2019s preference probably made him more likely to keep future appointments.\u201cWhy am I doing so bad?\u201d Kizer asked as Krishnamoorthi clipped an oxygen meter to his finger. \u201cIs it all the meds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d Krishnamoorthi read the meter display: \u201c98 percent. I think you\u2019re safe. Don\u2019t croak on the bus.\u201d\u201cIf I do, you won\u2019t find out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find out. They call the doctor first. What\u2019d you do for your birthday?\u201d A physician in a hurry might not have noticed the date \u2014 or accepted his first answer.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing now. Nothing.\u201d\u201cDid you have guests over?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201cPlayed cards.\u201d\u201cDid you eat chips while you were playing cards?\u201d\u201cA couple. You know I do.\u201d\u201cDo you think that might be part of the reason for the weight?\u201d Extra sodium can cause fluid buildup.What I couldn\u2019t quite believe was that these lengthy conversations were economically sustainable. Nationwide, primary-care physicians often can\u2019t afford to spend more than 15 minutes with each patient, because of the way the health care system values their time. I had seen Krishnamoorthi and colleagues take that long to sort through patients\u2019 medications, often more than a dozen, which they asked patients to gather up and bring to appointments. During one visit, Grace Berry, another doctor, Google-mapped a patient\u2019s new address to locate a nearby pharmacy, transferring her prescriptions there and helping her secure reliable transportation to and from the clinic.Meltzer insists that doctors spending more time with their patients actually saves money. After a year in his clinic, for instance, patients have 20 percent fewer hospitalizations than their control-group counterparts. Because hospitalizations make up the greatest portion of these patients\u2019 annual cost to Medicare, which averages $50,000 to $75,000 each, that reduction is worth several thousand dollars per person in the first year, or a combined several million dollars; by comparison, the doctors\u2019 annual salaries add up to less than $1 million.In a traditional primary-care clinic, patients\u2019 medication \u2014 prescribed to them by multiple specialists who are not in communication with one another \u2014 might not have been systematically sorted by a single person. Or if it had been, it might have been checked by a professional-care coordinator in consultation with doctors. In Meltzer\u2019s view, that increases labor costs, introduces inevitable miscommunications, as in a game of \u201ctelephone,\u201d and runs the risk of not seeming as important to the patient as instructions personally delivered by the physician.By contrast, Meltzer\u2019s doctors run their clinic in partnership with two nurses, a social worker and a project manager; the leanness of the staff means that most of its internal communication can take place during a 30-minute group meeting each morning. That permits more face time between doctors and patients, according to Meltzer. \u201cAnd face time is possible if you decrease back-room time,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople fail to recognize that when you have a $200 person here and a $200 person here and a $100 person communicating between them, the real cost of that is all of their time.\u201d In this setup, which describes a coordinator relaying a message from a doctor in one setting to a doctor in another, the cost is $300 per hour of conversation, or $600 total. What Meltzer has done, in effect, is consolidate the first two physicians into one, simultaneously doubling their time with patients and eliminating the need for a go-between, cutting out that $600 cost altogether. To accomplish this feat, he employs the oldest, slowest, least-innovative health care delivery model imaginable: general practitioners who oversee almost all aspects of their patients\u2019 care and, in doing so, come to know them personally.In the early 1990s, primary-care doctors typically made daily rounds at their hospitals to oversee the treatment of their patients there. But this was about to change. In 1996, an influential article in The New England Journal of Medicine by Robert M. Wachter and Lee Goldman, then physicians at the University of California, San Francisco, predicted that the \u201cexplosive growth of managed care\u201d emphasizing efficiency would lead to \u201cthe rapid growth of a new breed of physicians we call \u2018hospitalists\u2019 \u2014 specialists in inpatient medicine \u2014 who will be responsible for managing the care of hospitalized patients in the same way that primary-care physicians are responsible for managing the care of outpatients.\u201dAs an economist, Meltzer read their forecast with interest. The appearance of hospitalists was, he recognized, a textbook example of specialization or \u201cdivision of labor,\u201d whereby a task is split into simpler ones that workers can perform more quickly, as on an assembly line. In this case, the split eliminated the need for a primary-care doctor to travel to and from the hospital, enabling him to move patients through his clinic faster; meanwhile, the hospitalist, with his experience treating acute illness and getting the most out of his hospital\u2019s unique facilities, would presumably be able to care for patients admitted there more efficiently and effectively. When, soon after the publication of the article, the University of Chicago Medical Center hired its first two hospitalists, Meltzer volunteered to study their impact. His plan was to compare how patients fared when they were cared for by a specialist (a hospitalist) versus a generalist. He began keeping records \u2014 which physicians treated which patients, for example \u2014 and hired two students to interview patients in the hospital and then again over the phone a month after they were discharged to learn about their health.On its face, Meltzer\u2019s research and that of others seemed to show that hospitalists were a great boon. They reduced patients\u2019 medical expenses (by nearly $800, he as well as Wachter, Goldman and their colleagues found), shortened their hospital stays (by about half a day) and modestly decreased mortality rates. But the effects of the nascent hospitalist specialty were only being analyzed rigorously at teaching hospitals like Chicago\u2019s, where the attendings (supervising doctors who spend most of their time caring for ambulatory patients) did not know the patients any better than the hospitalists did. No one was investigating how the hospitalist model performed beyond academic settings, where it was replacing patients\u2019 primary-care doctors. Meltzer noticed, though, that when the Chicago hospitalists got the weekend off and an attending took over their patients for just 48 hours, the handoff completely erased the cost benefits the model otherwise seemed to generate. It stood to reason, then, that separating patients in community hospitals from their longtime doctors might be having a significant negative impact.But running a clinical trial in a community hospital to directly compare the hospitalist model to the primary-care model it was rapidly replacing was widely considered impossible. How many longtime patients of a general practitioner who was still making hospital rounds would agree to swap her for a hospitalist so that researchers could see whether doing so was good for them?By 2010, the hospitalist model had become the norm. That year, Meltzer published a theorem describing why the model had taken hold so quickly; in the past 15 years, the number of practicing hospitalists had jumped from several hundred to 30,000. (Meltzer practices as a hospitalist himself.) The math itself was basic. But, staring at his final equation, Meltzer had a revelation: increasing one variable \u2014 the likelihood that a primary-care physician\u2019s patients would be hospitalized \u2014 would decrease the odds that the physician would cede his hospital duties to a hospitalist out of financial necessity, halting, at least mathematically, the specialty\u2019s rapid spread.This gave Meltzer an idea. In 2012 he won a grant from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an organization created by the Affordable Care Act to test novel \u201cpayment and service-delivery models,\u201d to set up an experimental outpatient clinic at the university medical center. For patients, he recruited Medicare recipients who had been hospitalized in the past year and were therefore statistically likely to require future hospitalization. In practice this meant that most of them, like half of Americans, were managing at least one chronic illness; most were also from the impoverished and violent neighborhoods of Chicago\u2019s South Side. Their average annual income at the time of enrollment was $10,000 to $15,000.If they volunteered, they were told, they would be randomly assigned to either a primary-care doctor for outpatient needs and a hospitalist in the hospital, or they would join Meltzer\u2019s new clinic, which he called the Comprehensive Care Program, and receive inpatient and outpatient care from the same doctor. Meltzer\u2019s team would directly compare the two groups using a medley of metrics: how often patients were hospitalized and for how long; whether they did not refill their prescription medications because of expense; and their total costs to Medicare. A standard survey would assess their overall health. Finally, to try to understand how patients\u2019 relationships with their doctors might differ between the two groups and affect the outcomes, the team devised a survey in which patients rated their doctors in categories like trust and interpersonal relationships. Did he or she know their values and responsibilities? Give clear instructions? Seem caring and kind?Meltzer\u2019s biggest fear, at first, was that the patients\u2019 existing primary-care physicians would accuse him of stealing them. It turned out that many hospital patients his team approached did not have one. Within four years, the researchers had signed up 2,000 subjects. \u201cIn a funny way, the study that we\u2019re doing now was the same study that should have been done in 1999,\u201d Meltzer told me. \u201cThe difference is that we could never have gotten people out of having their own doctor until now, when they don\u2019t have it, and we offer it back.\u201dThat Monday morning, his first patient had head and neck cancer and needed an M.R.I. Krishnamoorthi had him practice lying flat and slid pillows under his head and adjusted the bed angle until they found a position the man could tolerate in the scanner that afternoon. (If the patient balked, he would have to be hospitalized longer, increasing his risk of developing an infection and reducing the potential profit for the hospital, which earns money when it admits a patient and loses it for every additional day that patient stays.)Then, Krishnamoorthi jogged upstairs to check on Jamal Johnson, a 34-year-old with cystic fibrosis. Johnson was sitting on the edge of his bed, hunched over his lunch tray. Krishnamoorthi dragged a footstool over and plopped down on it, stretching out his legs. \u201cWhen I woke up, I felt kind of draggy,\u201d Johnson said. But physical therapy, which consisted of wearing a vest that vibrated his chest to break up sputum, had helped. \u201cSee?\u201d Krishnamoorthi said. \u201cIt always works.\u201d\u201cIt hurts like hell, though. That\u2019s something I can say.\u201d Five years earlier, Johnson broke a rib playing basketball, making therapy treatments for his cystic fibrosis excruciating and initiating a cascade of hospitalizations. When he met Krishnamoorthi a year ago, he hated him instantly. Krishnamoorthi wanted him to consider a lung transplant; Johnson refused. He didn\u2019t want to hear about further treatment options. When Krishnamoorthi broached the subject of staying in a nursing facility, Johnson told him that the doctors and nurses there were \u201cjust paid to like you.\u201d The remark stuck. Krishnamoorthi asked around until he found a nurse he thought Johnson might connect with; eventually, Johnson agreed to enter her facility and came less frequently to the hospital. On occasions when he was admitted, Krishnamoorthi would, with his permission, call his mother with updates \u2014 an overture, she later told me, that none of the countless doctors who had treated her son over the years had ever made and for which she was especially grateful. Johnson never wanted to worry her.The new arrangement was more beneficial for Johnson, less stressful for his mother, less expensive for Medicare and less expensive for the hospital, but it had taken Krishnamoorthi weeks to orchestrate. It was increasingly clear to him how rewarding \u2014 but equally taxing \u2014 it was to try to do more for his patients than what was absolutely required. \u201cLast year, I would go home worried whether he liked me or not, if he would \u2018fire\u2019 me,\u201d he told me after we left Johnson\u2019s room. \u201cIt would have affected me a lot.\u201dThe next major test of the model will be whether it can be implemented in different sets of financial, geographic and demographic circumstances. Already, more than half a dozen organizations, from a senior-living community in Florida to the National University Health System of Singapore, have consulted Meltzer about creating versions of his program. One of them is the health-insurance company Kaiser Permanente. The Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, an organization of more than 1,400 primary-care physicians who serve members of Kaiser\u2019s health plan, ran a pilot of the program in 2015. Two physicians were assigned to its 400 sickest patients. Unlike Meltzer\u2019s team, which relies on hospitalists for after-hours care, Kaiser made the doctors available 24/7 and were surprised to find that patients very rarely called late or on holidays and weekends. Still, the number of times they were admitted to the hospital or E.R. fell drastically, by 80 percent, prompting Kaiser to expand the program to seven doctors and 800 patients. In the summer of 2016, Vanderbilt University Hospital started a similar pilot and observed a 20 percent decrease in hospital admissions. The school is also expanding its program.\u201cAll of us, I think, are struggling with how we can provide care to an aging population with resources drying up left and right,\u201d Bernadette Loftus, a clinician and the executive medical director of the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group, told me. \u201cDavid and I both came of age at the birth of the hospitalist movement. It\u2019s a great efficiency movement, but it takes about two decades of living in that environment to see the flaws in it.\u201dMeltzer has broadened his experiment, with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to offer additional resources with the hopes of reaching his clinic\u2019s patients who rarely engage with its services; the clinic can now refer them to an additional community-health worker and a neighborhood arts-and-culture program designed with Urban Labs, a center at the university that studies approaches to combating health problems and other social challenges. But he believes versions of the model could also apply to primary-care practices with patients who have a more traditional range of incomes and health issues. For instance, to increase patient-doctor familiarity and streamline communication, a practice might partner with a single hospitalist who takes care of all of its hospitalized patients. In Meltzer\u2019s view, his model\u2019s key mechanism, the prioritizing of the patient-doctor relationship, makes it flexible enough to export anywhere. \u201cTo have a relationship,\u201d Meltzer says, \u201cis to mean that the big incentive is to want them to do well because you care about them and to have the time to really understand what that means and deal with it, because sometimes figuring that out just takes time. When price is the only lever you have, you\u2019re either paying people to do something or paying them not to do something. And it goes only one way or the other, more or less. Whereas when you have a relationship, there\u2019s just so many more nuances.\u201dCurrent metrics are still too crude to capture the intricate effects of these relationships, however, even as they point to their collective impact being quite large. By contrast, day-to-day, patient-to-patient progress has often seemed glacial at best and demanded considerable energy from the clinic doctors and staff. As I observed Meltzer\u2019s team at work, I couldn\u2019t help wondering how long its young, idealistic caregivers would last. Unknown to Meltzer, several of them had lent patients cash for bus money or delivered medications on their way home \u2014 gestures they hadn\u2019t felt inspired (or pressured) to make in previous jobs. When, that October, Jamal Johnson passed away, Krishnamoorthi, upon visiting his bedside to say goodbye, was surprised to find he couldn\u2019t stop crying. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t feel finished,\u201d Lauren Wiklund, the project manager, told me one particularly hectic morning. \u201cI just feel like I have to carry on with the rest of my life or I will die.\u201dWhy, then, did they do it? \u201cI became disenchanted with primary care because I was constantly having to cut people short,\u201d Joyce Tang, who spent seven years at her previous practice, told me. \u201cI was always an hour late. Always. My patients just knew to expect that.\u201d One morning, I watched her examine a man who seemed to prefer the accommodations of the hospital to those of his assisted-living facility and habitually took a cab to the emergency room. Tang had brainstormed with him, his sister, his insurance company and a nurse at the facility, about possible solutions. She was carrying a housing application for a faith-based facility she thought he might like better, but so far, nothing had worked to change his patterns. In cases like his, how did she measure success?\u201cThere are traditional metrics: fewer hospitalizations, better compliance with medicines,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then for patients there are more specific goals \u2014 so understanding those.\u201d She gave the example of a patient who was immobilized by her weight. \u201cFor her, the big intervention was I got her a motorized wheelchair, and the next time I saw her she was just smiling. She said it totally transformed her outlook just to be able to get outside and get some fresh air.\u201d Another woman had been on large doses of opioids. For a year she and Tang saw each other every two weeks and gradually reduced her dose until, recently, she flushed the rest of her pills down the toilet. \u201cNow when she comes to the hospital, she doesn\u2019t want IV pain meds,\u201d Tang said. \u201cShe\u2019s so happy. She\u2019s really proud of herself. That\u2019s a big success story. A lot of people don\u2019t come back when we say \u2018taper.\u2019 I asked her, \u2018What made you come back?\u2019 She hated me when I said that. But she said: \u2018I trusted you. I knew you wanted what\u2019s best for me.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe morning after Winslow\u2019s death, Meltzer hosted a weekly meeting with the clinic and research teams. Once everyone had settled in with a paper-wrapped sandwich, he said, \u201cCase of the week?\u201d and the conversation turned to Winslow. She had been hospitalized with minor injuries after a fall and developed an infection; together, her son and Verma had wrestled with when to stop treating it. \u201cHer son last night asked: \u2018Do you think I\u2019m doing the right thing? What do you think I should do?\u2019 He said, \u2018I know you care about her, so I trust you.\u2019 Not, \u2018I trust you because I know you\u2019re a doctor, or I know you\u2019re a professional\u2019 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t happen with a hospitalist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing that the struggle was more with your own feelings,\u201d Meltzer said, and Verma agreed.By then, I had watched her and her colleagues confront a breathtaking variety of indignities that age and sickness force upon human beings: impotence, incontinence, immobility, dementia, death. It occurred to me that perhaps the explanation for patients\u2019 allowing me to witness these conversations was as simple as wanting, even at their most vulnerable \u2014 perhaps especially then \u2014 to be seen and heard, and that this was also precisely what they prized in Meltzer\u2019s doctors. What both doctors and patients were after, it seemed, was not just an assignation of \u201cvalue\u201d but of meaning. The better they knew one another, the harder their relationship was to define wholly in medical terms. \u201cEverything\u2019s just too late sometimes, and then what do you do?\u201d a farmer who had recently learned he had metastatic cancer told Tang one morning. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of sad to me and the wife, too. It\u2019s just like a death sentence.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Tang said softly, \u201cI know.\u201d There was little else she could do medically. And yet, it was difficult to imagine the farmer saying the same to a friend or a relative or a social worker or a priest and receiving the same affirmation.Meltzer characterized this singular connection for me one afternoon. \u201cBeing able to even just touch in for a little bit, have the conversation and talk about it, there\u2019s an intimacy to it,\u201d he said, shortly after telling one of his own primary-care patients in the hospital that she had cancer. The subconscious swap of \u201ctouch in\u201d for \u201ccheck in\u201d evoked the laying on of hands \u2014 an antiquated, unbillable and, in the face of cancer, useless gesture, but quite possibly not a worthless one.Source photographs from ClassicStock/Alamy.By MICHAEL POLLANBy SULEIKA JAOUADBy ABRAHAM VERGHESEAdvertisement"}

Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook\u2019s building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea.Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world\u2019s most consequential regulators.She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThere\u2019s a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,\u201d Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview.Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That\u2019s roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations.Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science.Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved.But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland\u2019s financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater.\u201cThe question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?\u201d said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. \u201cWe need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.\u201dBudgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley.Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland\u2019s history of lax oversight of the technology industry.Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints \u2014 not as common in Europe as the United States \u2014 that could result in sizable damages against businesses.\u201cWe should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you\u2019re not mandated by the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cEither they don\u2019t care or they actively oppose what we\u2019re doing.\u201dRepresentatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon\u2019s team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law.\u201cWe\u2019ve really leapt into explaining what we\u2019ve done and the thinking that\u2019s gone into that,\u201d said Stephen Deadman, Facebook\u2019s global deputy chief privacy officer. \u201cI\u2019ve got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon\u2019s office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media.\u201dGoogle and Twitter declined to comment.Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers \u201cto the fullest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank\u2019s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis.The nation\u2019s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests \u201cperiodically.\u201d These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks\u2019 risk management.

Earlier in April, it said it would open its fourth fulfillment center in Nevada, bringing more than 1,000 jobs to North Las Vegas. In March, it revealed plans to build its first such facility in Missouri.\u201cThey\u2019ve been on a pretty blistering pace, getting a lot of space everywhere,\u201d said Greg Melich, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.Building research and development centers to support new technology, while also enlarging its vast network of distribution centers, has increased Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures so that they now roughly equal Walmart\u2019s, Mr. Melich said.In Boston, Amazon confirmed on Tuesday that it would move into 430,000 square feet in WS Development\u2019s Seaport project, bringing 2,000 jobs in machine learning, speech science, cloud computing and robotics engineering. That will double its technology work force in the metropolitan area.The emphasis on speech science is a sign that Amazon is betting that its Alexa digital assistant is at the vanguard of voice-based commerce, a form of shopping that Mr. Melich said was poised to grow at a rapid clip the way mobile buying did several years ago.It was not clear if Amazon\u2019s investment in the Boston Seaport project offered any clues to the city\u2019s chances of landing HQ2. The company is expected to announce its selection this year.\u201cEveryone wants the cake, which is the headquarters, but if not, they\u2019ll take the icing,\u201d said Dennis Frenchman, a professor of urban design and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Boston officials approved $5 million in property tax incentives over 15 years for Amazon to occupy its Seaport offices, and have dangled another $5 million in breaks if the company agrees to more local expansion and job creation.The facility will add 3,000 tech jobs to Amazon\u2019s current head count in the area.Vancouver did not land on Amazon\u2019s short list of possible headquarters locations. But it is a three-hour drive from Seattle, where Amazon is based, and a short flight from the California tech centers where Amazon likes to recruit employees.Vancouver has also drawn attention from Microsoft, which is based across the border in Washington State.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Vowed to Make France a \u2018Start-Up Nation.\u2019 Is It Getting There?", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet a year after Mr. Macron unveiled an aggressive agenda to turn France into \u201ca start-up nation,\u201d it is unclear if reality has kept pace with his rhetoric. While the country has quickly become one of the most talked-about destinations in Europe for tech companies and start-ups, France still faces an uphill path in its bid to usurp London as the region\u2019s technology leader.The French president has carefully cultivated a tech-savvy image, promoted a steady drumbeat of high-profile events, and even pushed through a raft of economic and labor reforms to make his country more appealing to investors. But France continues to lag Britain in tech-related investments and in the business of artificial intelligence. Start-ups still face challenges in scaling up. And a lot of seed funding comes from the French government itself.Companies have been pledging to do more in France. In January, for example, the chief executives of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies announced 3.5 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, in new investments and the creation of at least 2,200 jobs in the next five years.Those figures are minuscule compared with investment in Silicon Valley, and even London. Mr. Macron nevertheless sought to build on France\u2019s momentum on Wednesday, when he convened 60 tech chief executives for meetings in Paris. The French president met individually with the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and with the leaders of IBM, Microsoft and Uber later Wednesday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.Facebook has faced a barrage of public criticism over its handling of user data and vast powers, points Mr. Macron intends to press further on Wednesday. The president\u2019s office also said that Mr. Macron would have frank discussions with the various chief executives over the taxation of tech companies and fighting the proliferation of rumors and misinformation spreading online. The meetings come as French lawmakers are expected to debate additional transparency measures for social media companies like Facebook.But Mr. Macron president is also expected to seize the moment to announce more tech-related investments in France.\u201cClearly there has been a Macron effect,\u201d said Franck Sebag, a Paris-based partner at the professional services firm Ernst & Young, who has studied France\u2019s digital trajectory.\u201cFew people were even talking about France as a tech country a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Sebag said. \u201cHe\u2019s ignited a willingness to invest.\u201dAs President Trump pursues an increasingly protectionist agenda for the United States, and Britain veers away from the European Union, Mr. Macron has promoted a policy of open borders and being business-friendly in a country that has long had a reputation for being anything but. Multinationals are venturing to create more jobs in France as Mr. Macron overhauls French labor laws, despite protests by French workers.\u201cThe U.K. is no longer the undisputed capital of European venture capital,\u201d Dealroom said in a recent report. \u201cContinental Europe is catching up, while France is almost on par already.\u201dFor all the hype, France must confront a number of longstanding hurdles.The trend here is shifting, though.Big businesses are increasingly tallying the advantages, especially since Mr. Macron convened 140 chief executives of global companies at an ornate gathering at the Palace of Versailles in January. He told them that he was pursuing a strategy to make France more productive and competitive, and announced more than \u20ac3.5 billion in foreign investments, including a large chunk for tech.Fujitsu of Japan is one of several Asia-based companies that plan to invest in expanded artificial intelligence research here.

{"Headline": "Is Capital or Labor Winning at Your Favorite Company? Introducing the Marx Ratio", "Date": "2018-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxWho benefits the most when a company is successful: its shareholders or its employees? Capital or labor?It is a question that speaks to some of the oldest debates in economics. But now, thanks to a minor provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, we have a tool for measuring, in rough terms at least, how much any given publicly traded firm rewards its shareholders relative to its rank-and-file employees.Behold, the Marx Ratio.We named it for the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx, who argued that the interests of capital and labor are inherently in tension. His intellectual adversaries argued that those interests are in fact aligned, as successful companies inevitably reward both capital and labor.We take no stand in that debate. But we have come up with a simple way of calculating how the fruits of any given company\u2019s success are distributed.The Marx Ratio, as we\u2019re calling it, captures the relationship between a company\u2019s profits \u2014 the return to capital, on a per-employee basis \u2014 and how much its median employee is compensated, a rough proxy for the return to labor.Companies with high Marx Ratios offer particularly strong rewards to their shareholders relative to workers. For example, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer had a Marx Ratio of 2.64, meaning the per-employee earnings captured by shareholders were about 2.6 times as high as the compensation a typical employee received. Numbers below 1 signal the reverse: a more favorable return to labor. The  Marx Ratio of 0.498 for the health insurer Aetna means that it earned only half as much per worker for its shareholders as it paid its median employee.Companies with high Marx Ratios also included the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International; consumer products companies like Kraft-Heinz and Colgate-Palmolive; fast food giants McDonald\u2019s and Yum Brands (parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut); and almost all real estate investment trusts.Those that favored workers more tended to be in labor-intensive industries. They included the huge retailers Walmart and Amazon, hotel companies like Marriott and Hilton, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Companies that record a net loss consequently have a negative Marx Ratio. For those companies, which in 2017 included General Electric and Citigroup, shareholders lost money while workers still got paid.Of the 394 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 that had reported their median compensation number by May 3, the median Marx Ratio was 0.82, meaning at a typical company the median pay was higher than the profit generated per worker.Beginning this year, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies in the United States to disclose their median employee compensation: how much pay the person in the middle of their distribution receives. The research firm MyLogIQ compiled the data; the remaining companies have more time because of the dates of their fiscal year. We spell out the math, and its limitations, below.Median compensation is an imprecise measurement of how much of a company\u2019s returns flow to labor. Among other things, it can be distorted by companies\u2019 use of contract and part-time labor, and a median pay number inherently fails to capture the full range of how a company\u2019s workers are paid.Given those flaws, the Marx Ratio isn\u2019t some definitive measure of how a company affects the economy and society. Rather, it is a tool for understanding the differences between companies and industries. In particular, the more a company\u2019s ability to generate profits is driven by things shareholders own \u2014 patents, a well-known brand or capital goods like machines and real estate \u2014 the higher its Marx Ratio will tend to be.To see how the Marx Ratio can help you understand the competitive dynamics and economic structure of an industry, consider how the numbers vary across well-known companies in some prominent industries.Wall Street may be the ultimate bastion of capitalism. But some of the highest Marx Ratios in the financial industry aren\u2019t found at the companies stocked with cutthroat traders and deal makers. Rather, the business of commercial banking \u2014 accepting deposits and making loans from branches around the United States \u2014 features a higher return to capital relative to labor.So for example, Wells Fargo has a Marx Ratio of 1.4, and JPMorgan Chase came in at 1.2. By contrast, Goldman Sachs\u2019s number was only 0.9 and Morgan Stanley\u2019s was 0.8.In effect, the profitability of those commercial banks is driven by things the company controls: their network of branches, their information technology systems, their brand reputation. Their employees, who include lots of bank tellers and loan officers, have little leverage with which to demand high pay; the median compensation at Wells Fargo was around $60,000.By contrast, the investment banks employ a lot more highly compensated, highly sought-after professionals, who in turn can demand premium salaries. The median compensation at Goldman was about $135,000. Those workers were more successful at claiming the value the organization created.Meanwhile, BlackRock, the giant asset management company, pays Goldman-esque salaries (median compensation: $141,987)  but manages to have a higher Marx Ratio than either commercial or investment banks, as it is able to manage a huge $6.3 trillion with a lean 13,900 workers.You see similar divides among the most powerful giants of the technology industry.Facebook is wildly profitable, generating almost $635,000 in earnings per employee for shareholders. It also pays those employees extremely well, with median compensation of $240,340, for a Marx Ratio of 2.64.More of Facebook\u2019s success accrued to capital \u2014 to the company\u2019s owners \u2014 than to labor. Its profits are driven by the network effects that keep both users and advertisers wedded to it, which are owned by shareholders. Rank-and-file software developers and advertising sales workers have less ability to extract a big chunk of the value being created.By contrast, Amazon is not very profitable \u2014 it is plowing most of the earnings from its mature businesses into longer-term investments in emerging ones. And its core retail business has low profit margins and requires vast armies in distribution centers and, with the acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery stores.With earnings per employee of only $5,359 and median compensation of about $28,000, Amazon has a Marx Ratio that is a mere 0.19. So far, neither the median Amazon worker nor Amazon shareholders are being rewarded very handsomely.Other prominent tech companies are somewhere in between. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, generates a healthy $158,000 in profit per employee, but like Facebook has a high median pay of $197,000. That\u2019s good for a Marx Ratio of 0.8. Other notable tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have not yet reported a median compensation number, but are also likely to end up in that middle ground once they do \u2014 Apple had earnings per employee in the most recent fiscal year of $393,100, and Microsoft came in at $171,000.The highest Marx Ratios were found at real estate investment trusts: companies with a favorable tax structure devised to invest in real estate. Publicly traded REITs in the sample had a median Marx Ratio of 4.13, higher than any other category of companies.This makes sense, as these companies work more as vehicles through which to deploy capital toward real estate than as conventional operating businesses. The highest Marx Ratio, for example, at 38, was for Duke Realty, an Indianapolis-based company that manages $6.2 billion worth of industrial real estate with a mere 400 employees (who, we might add, are well compensated, with median pay of $109,695).Some of the highest Marx Ratios \u2014 as well as some of the lowest \u2014 are to be found at oil- and gas-related businesses. This also makes sense. Energy companies are making huge bets, often with borrowed money, the success of which depends on the future market price and on their ability to extract petroleum.That explains how EQT Corp., a Pittsburgh-based natural gas producer, had one of the highest Marx Ratios among non-REITS (7.1), while Houston-based oil giant Marathon Oil had the lowest in the sample (-18.9). Marathon\u2019s $5.7 billion loss was due mainly to the sale of a Canadian oil sands business.Low oil and gas prices were bad news for many energy shareholders. Over all, the energy sector accounted for four of the five lowest Marx Ratios, a list that also included Hess, Noble Energy and NRG Energy.It is a good business for shareholders to be in when things are going well, but the risk they are taking on is real.Here are the calculations behind the Marx Ratio \u2014 and some of the limitations to the underlying data that make it an imperfect measure of how a company rewards capital versus labor.The numerator is the net income of the company in question per employee. Note that net income is subject to big year-to-year fluctuations, and doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect a company\u2019s continuing operating performance in any given year.Note what the numerator isn\u2019t \u2014 this isn\u2019t about the returns shareholders could earn through stock price appreciation, or dividends. This is focused on the underlying economics of the business; returns through the stock market can fluctuate for all kinds of reasons.The denominator is the compensation to the median employee, as disclosed in the company\u2019s proxy statement, which can create distortions in representing rank-and-file employees.Companies also have some degree of flexibility in how they calculate median pay, so comparisons are not necessarily apples-to-apples. For example, they may choose to use statistical sampling instead of actual payroll records, and may exclude non-U.S. employees depending on privacy rules in overseas markets.A better number for the idea we\u2019re really trying to get at would be average compensation for nonexecutive employees, but companies aren\u2019t required to report that publicly.We intentionally kept the math of the Marx Ratio simple. But if you want to make it a little more sophisticated, there are options.For one, you might adjust the calculation based on how much capital a company required to make its money. Shareholder\u2019s equity, for example, captures the book value of a company\u2019s assets minus its liabilities. If two companies generate similar profits but one requires much less equity to do it, it is essentially more efficient at generating returns for capital.You also might consider adjusting the measure of profitability to smooth out a company\u2019s returns to shareholders. After all, when a company records some enormous loss, it is frequently because the company is marking down the value of an earlier acquisition for which it paid too much, meaning it is capturing a past bad decision rather than providing information about future operating performance.Given all those limitations, the Marx Ratio should not be used as a definitive measure of how a company does or does not contribute to inequality. Rather, think of it as an important clue about how it is organized, how its economic structure works, and to whom its greatest rewards tend to flow.Advertisement"}

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets.

But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority. The court\u2019s decision on the matter could affect some 25 million employment contracts.She tweeted:Steven Mnuchin said this weekend, \u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold.\u201d S.&P. 500 futures were up on the news. But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Wabtec was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Jones Day.The chief executive of G.E., John Flannery, has pledged to reduce the company\u2019s byzantine structure and focus on its fastest-growing core businesses.

{"Headline": "What the Microsoft Antitrust Case Taught Us", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.\u00a0Mr. Wu is a law professor who who specializes in antitrust.Twenty years ago today, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general (including one of us, Mr. Blumenthal, of Connecticut) for violating federal antitrust law.Microsoft, the world\u2019s dominant software firm, and Bill Gates, the world\u2019s richest man, faced a challenge from the upstart company Netscape and its internet browser, Netscape Navigator. The suit accused Microsoft of illegally protecting its operating-system monopoly and seeking a new monopoly for its own browser, Internet Explorer. The fear was that Microsoft would kill Netscape, monopolize the browser market and use that point of control to dominate the coming age of the web.After a tough fight, the government won the case. There is now no browser monopoly, and the world has come to rely on the many apps, firms and ideas that were born after Microsoft\u2019s control was broken. Microsoft has become a gentler giant, and Mr. Gates has become a philanthropist.Yet it is worth remembering that at the time, challenging Microsoft was not a popular decision. Microsoft was a well-liked company and Mr. Gates was widely heralded as a visionary genius. Many, Microsoft most of all, argued that enforcing the antitrust laws against Microsoft would damage innovation and impede the economic growth fueled by the technology sector.This view turned out to be wrong. Innovation surged in the newly opened markets and the United States continued to spearhead growth in the technological world. The enduring lesson of the Microsoft case was that keeping markets open can require a trustbuster\u2019s courage to take decisive action against even a very popular monopolist.Imagine a world in which Microsoft had been allowed to monopolize the browser business. Holding a triple monopoly (operating system, major applications and the browser), Microsoft would have controlled the future of the web. Google, the tiny start-up, would have faced an unfair fight against Bing. Microsoft-Myspace might have become the default social network instead of Facebook. And who knows whether Netflix or any other online video service would have been started?It took the power of law enforcement to rebut Microsoft\u2019s claims that everything it was doing was pro-competitive, innovative and innocent. The discovery of candid internal company memos, a famously revealing deposition of Bill Gates and a full trial made it clear that Microsoft saw the internet as a major threat to its monopoly rule and was seeking to tame it.The presiding judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was right to propose that Microsoft be broken into two companies \u2014 one for the Windows operating system, one for other products. In the end, unfortunately, Microsoft was kept whole.Some limitations were placed on Microsoft\u2019s behavior, such as a requirement that it share certain programming information with third-party companies. The appropriateness of that remedy is still debated. But what we do know is that the remedy pushed Microsoft to act with more caution, creating an essential opening for a new generation of firms.It might seem like a cruel irony that the immediate beneficiaries of the Microsoft antitrust case \u2014 namely, Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 have now become behemoths themselves. But this is how the innovation cycle works: It creates room for saplings to grow into giants, but then prevents the new giants from squashing the next generation of saplings. (Microsoft was itself, in the early 1980s, the beneficiary of another antitrust case, against IBM, the computing colossus of its time.)Which takes us to the present day. Unfortunately, ever since the Microsoft case there has been remarkably little oversight of the technology sector, despite the obvious signs of corporate consolidation and outsize market power. Enforcement of the antimonopoly laws has fallen: Between 1970 and 1999, the United States brought about 15 monopoly cases each year; between 2000 and 2014 that number went down to just three.Antitrust efforts have become too fixated on the idea that the only real harm consists of raising of prices for consumers. Yet in the Microsoft case, Internet Explorer was \u201cfree,\u201d even though Microsoft was bent on destroying competition with it. Today, both Google and Facebook offer products that are free. Society has grown to rely on them, but because they have no dollar price, antitrust regulators have been hesitant to take action.Any American can tell you that there is no free lunch. Everything has a price. We pay for these products and services with our time and our data. And like Microsoft, these firms have come to exert too much control over our shared technological future.At a hearing before the Senate, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was asked to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor \u2014 a company providing a similar service that consumers can go to if they are unhappy with Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg could not name one. Part of the reason for this is that Facebook bought its most obvious competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp, and continues to acquire upstart companies before they can reach that point.The pattern is familiar. And if the Microsoft case showed us anything, it is that we should not trust any one company to decide our future.Richard Blumenthal is a Democratic senator from Connecticut.

A small room on the upper floor, furnished with cross-stitches and other Etsy crafts sent from fans, doubles as a makeshift studio where they record their weekly podcast. \u201cEven \u2018victim\u2019 can be such a throwaway word because it implies they didn\u2019t have a family or life,\u201d Ms. Hardstark said, as she petted one of her three cats. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason this couldn\u2019t be any of us.\u201dIt\u2019s not all scare tactics, however. Despite, or maybe because of, the grisly subject matter, Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff talk freely about their personal lives, like friends at Sunday brunch.Ms. Hardstark has been frank about her anxiety and depression, and Ms. Kilgariff has talked about her mother\u2019s death from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They frequently mention that they see a joint therapist (in addition to attending one-on-one sessions).\u201cWe\u2019re both from California rural families where talking about mental health was second nature and not something to be ashamed of,\u201d Ms. Hardstark said. \u201cIn the same way people don\u2019t talk about murders a whole lot, people don\u2019t talk about how hard the struggle is to live a happy life.\u201dFittingly, both women offer psychoanalytic explanations for their lifelong fascination with the macabre. Growing up in Irvine, Calif., in the 1980s, Ms. Hardstark said she was struck by how the women Ted Bundy kidnapped looked like her mother. Ms. Kilgariff, who grew up about seven hours away by car in Petaluma, Calif., said her mother, a psychiatric nurse, used to diagnose the mental disorders of strangers they passed on the street as a kind of game. \u201cEveryone just started walking away horrified,\u201d she said. But Ms. Hardstark, who was dressed as the musician Glenn Danzig, wanted to hear every last gory detail. A month later, over a five-hour lunch, the idea for \u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d was born.\u201cWe\u2019re just having conversations about people who got murdered,\u201d Ms. Kilgariff said, before gulping down her last sip of coffee at their home studio.Ms. Hardstark looked over at her co-host affectionately. \u201cThe only way we know how to deal with the horrors of life is through humor,\u201d she said.Then they both blurted out in unison, \u201cThank God.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn.If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people\u2019s explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive \u2014 which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls \u2014 by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users\u2019 electronic communications: obtaining consumers\u2019 explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.\u201cDo you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?\u201d Ms. Sippel asked. \u201cConsumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.\u201dBut tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy\u2019s consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.\u201cEvery stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,\u201d he said.Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law\u2019s final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country\u2019s officials were committed to the bill\u2019s progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country\u2019s representatives had met with on ePrivacy.The \u201cBulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,\u201d she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would \u201cadd meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.\u201dMichela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill\u2019s restrictions on handling user content and metadata: \u201cThat is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities\u201d for many industries that rely on data.Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.\u201cIn my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. \u201cSo, for the time being, they haven\u2019t found a common position.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Tries a New Role: Moral Leader", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s Microsoft, a giant that spent most of the 1990s and early 2000s as tech\u2019s biggest company and villain. It now seems to be auditioning for a different role: the industry\u2019s moral conscience.Among the five most valuable tech companies, Microsoft is the only one to avoid sustained public criticism about contributing to social ills in the last couple of years. At the same time, Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president, have emerged as some of the most outspoken advocates in the industry for protecting user privacy and establishing ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Echoing a theme he talked about at the conference last year, Mr. Nadella said the industry had a responsibility to build technology that empowered everyone.\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d he said.Microsoft\u2019s new role is partly due to the fact that the company isn\u2019t a major player in social media, video streaming and smartphones \u2014 the products behind the current dark mood around tech. It no longer squeezes the oxygen out of markets as Amazon can.But while the company\u2019s power has diminished since a couple of decades ago, when it controlled computing through Windows, Microsoft remains an influential voice. On Monday, its market capitalization of $733 billion made it the third most valuable technology company, behind Apple and Amazon and ahead of Google parent company, Alphabet, and Facebook.\u201cThe irony for Microsoft is that they lost in search, they lost in social networks and they lost in mobile, and as a consequence, they have avoided the recent pushback from governments and media,\u201d said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cThis has given Microsoft the freedom to take the high road as the ethical leader in technology.\u201dSince taking the reins at Microsoft in 2014, Mr. Nadella has brought a more sensitive style of leadership to the company than his two predecessors, Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. That shift has proved to be more suitable for Microsoft in this era.In a phone interview, Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, called its legal problems in past decades a \u201cgut-wrenching experience\u201d that had shaped Microsoft in its current form. \u201cIt made Microsoft a better and more responsible company,\u201d he said.\u201cNot only did Microsoft learn from its mistakes, Satya is a unique and caring individual,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Reilly, a tech industry publisher and conference organizer. \u201cHe understands deeply that Microsoft must help others to succeed.\u201dFacebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have defended their advertising businesses for allowing them to deliver services for free. They\u2019ve promised to add more human moderators and invest in software tools that can screen out misinformation and other prohibited content.Mr. Cook has not turned his ire toward Microsoft, which gets most of its revenue from software, hardware and cloud computing services. The company has investments in internet services that are supported in part by advertising, including its Bing search engine and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals it acquired in 2016.Mr. Nadella has been more hesitant than Mr. Cook to publicly criticize other technology companies, turning to more subtle types of persuasion. A low-key leader, Mr. Nadella peppers his speeches and interviews with references to literature, warning that careless creators of technology could contribute to a dystopian world of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d or Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World.\u201d His lieutenant, Mr. Smith, has become a ubiquitous ambassador for Microsoft on the big social issues facing technology in Washington, in Brussels and on the conference circuit.Still, the Microsoft of 2018 is a long way from the company that was once portrayed as a corporate predator.\u201cMicrosoft lived through negativity that these companies are experiencing now, and it doesn\u2019t want to go back to those days,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow with Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Silicon Valley campus.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said the greater scrutiny on the tech sector would not always fall on the same companies.\u201cAt any given moment, there may be one or two companies in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think one should assume the same one or two are always going to be in the spotlight or always on the defensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He should expect a suspicious audience: Europe has been critical of the social network\u2019s privacy policies, its influence on elections, and the spread of misinformation and inflammatory content on its platform. Though he initially only agreed to meet with a group of lawmakers in private, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s questioning is now set to be live streamed, according to the president of the legislature.\u2014\u00a0Adam SatarianoTRADE\u2014\u00a0Ana SwansonRETAILTarget is expected to report first quarter results on Wednesday. Quarterly results from other big retailers have painted a mixed picture of the industry. Last week, Macy\u2019s blew away expectations with a big increase in sales, raising investors\u2019 hopes that the company\u2019s restructuring efforts were paying off. But first quarter sales from Nordstrom and J.C. Penney disappointed investors, and Walmart\u2019s operating profits remained under pressure even as its e-commerce business rebounded. \u2014 Michael CorkeryECONOMY\u2014 Jim TankersleyECONOMYTwo reports are expected to show that home sales remained elevated in April, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, despite rising interest rates and tax changes that removed incentives for homeownership. Sales of new homes, which make up about 10 percent of all sales, hit a four-month high in March, and revisions have shown that home sales throughout the first quarter were stronger than initially reported. The Census Bureau will report Wednesday on sales of new homes, and the National Association of Realtors will report Thursday on sales of existing homes. \u2014 William P. DavisBANKINGDeutsche Bank will hold its annual meeting on Thursday in Frankfurt and, considering that the bank\u2019s stock price has fallen by a third since last year\u2019s gathering, the shareholders are not likely to be a happy bunch. Paul Achleitner, the supervisory board chairman, will probably bear the brunt of the abuse because of a messy management shake-up that raised questions about his oversight. But he still has enough support to survive a motion to oust him. \u2014 Jack EwingTECHNOLOGYThe world\u2019s most sweeping data privacy regulations go into effect across the European Union on Friday. The rules intend to make it harder for companies to harvest data on the more than 500 million people living in the 28-nation bloc. The law requires organizations to get permission from their users before collecting any personal information, and companies could face steep fines \u2014 of up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 for noncompliance. But enforcement will be a challenge: Oversight falls to whichever country has a company\u2019s European headquarters within its borders, and many of those countries have small data-protection agencies. The data protection office in Ireland, with a budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to about $8.8 million, will be responsible for overseeing tech giants including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple. \u2014 Adam SatarianoMEDIAMemorial Day weekend has been on the decline as a reliable, bonanza sales period for Hollywood. \u201cBaywatch\u201d (Paramount) got stranded on a sand dune last year. \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass\u201d (Disney) fizzled in 2016. \u201cTomorrowland\u201d (Disney) drew yawns from ticket buyers in 2015.

The record for the period belongs to \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End,\u201d which took in $140 million in 2007, or $172 million in today\u2019s dollars. \u2014 Brooks BarnesAdvertisement"}
