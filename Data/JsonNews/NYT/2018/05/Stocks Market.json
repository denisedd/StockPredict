{"Headline": "Apple Says It Will Buy Back $100 Billion in Stock", "Date": "2018-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple said it would buy back an additional $100 billion in stock, by far the largest increase in its already historic record of returning capital to investors. The company didn\u2019t provide a timeline for the repurchases. Apple also increased its dividend by 16 percent to 73 cents a share, pushing past Exxon Mobil to become the largest dividend payer, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.But critics say the actions can take money away from potential investments in hiring or research and development, and can increase economic inequality because they typically benefit wealthier people.Investors should want companies to reinvest in themselves and their employees versus repurchasing their own stock to increase the share price, said William Lazonick, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, who studies stock buybacks. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a manipulation of the stock market.\u201dLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that Apple was making significant investments in hiring, research and development, and manufacturing, \u201cbut we also have a very, very profitable business.\u201dHe said that \u201cbecause we\u2019re making all the right investments all around the company, it makes perfect sense for us not to keep the cash on our balance sheet but return it to investors.\u201dNo company has ever done stock buybacks like Apple. In the most recent quarter, Apple repurchased $23.5 billion in stock \u2014 the largest single stock buyback ever and more than the market value of 275 of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices.Apple said Tuesday that it had now returned $275 billion to shareholders since 2012 and that it planned to finish its previous stock-buyback program in the current quarter, about nine months early.Other academics and investors cheered Apple\u2019s continued returns to shareholders.\u201cPeople like to believe the stories that C.E.O.s do things to boost the short-term stock price and line their own pockets,\u201d said Alex Edmans, a finance professor at the London Business School. \u201cBut if you look at hundreds of examples, you find that stock buybacks do increase long-term value.\u201dHe said that companies typically bought back stock only when they had extra cash that they would not reinvest otherwise, and that investors would spend that money elsewhere.Apple said its profit increased 25 percent to $13.8 billion in the most recent quarter on the back of strong revenue growth for iPhones, the Apple Watch and its services business. Apple earned $2.73 a share, it said, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion.The three months ending with March were Apple\u2019s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone, the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs, including the financial results of Apple\u2019s suppliers, that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple\u2019s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result.Apple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price \u2014 driven by the $1,000 iPhone X \u2014 helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, hit back at the notion that the iPhone business, which accounts for 62 percent of the company\u2019s overall revenue, had little room to grow. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the view that the market is saturated,\u201d he said.Investors have also worried that Apple\u2019s influence in China, the company\u2019s No. 2 market, is waning amid stronger competition from Chinese rivals. But Apple\u2019s results suggest that Chinese consumers are willing to pay for the pricier iPhones. Apple said revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion, the largest increase in 10 quarters.And Apple\u2019s services revenue, which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales, rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion. Apple said consumers had paid for more than 270 million subscriptions for its services or ones sold via its App Store, up from roughly 170 million a year earlier.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Tried to Curb Gun Sales. Now Republicans Are Trying to Stop Them.", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Congress decided not to take significant action after a spate of mass shootings this year and last, some big banks opted to take matters into their own hands by restricting financing for gun sellers.Now, Republican lawmakers are pressing regulators to stop banks from doing so, over concerns they are veering too far into social activism.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn us into a nation of red banks and blue banks, you\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican and member of the banking committee, said in a recent interview before the latest shooting. \u201cDon\u2019t come crying to us when you screw up and you want the American taxpayer to bail you out.\u201dMr. Kennedy said he planned to file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against banks that are effectively restricting gun sales by setting their own rules on legal products and refusing to do business with gun makers and retailers that do not comply. He is also working to get Republican colleagues to join him in writing legislation to stop banks from discriminating against gun buyers.BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said it would begin offering a new line of investment funds that do not include producers of firearms or retailers that sell them, cutting off a potential avenue of financing for gun makers and retailers.Gun advocates have viewed the moves as a direct assault on the industry.Senator Michael D. Crapo, the Idaho Republican who heads the banking committee, sent blistering letters in late April to the top executives at Citigroup and Bank of America, accusing them of using their market power to manage social policy. He told them not to go any further and warned them against developing ways to monitor gun transactions through their payments systems, a move that gun advocates view as a dangerous step toward using data to block law-abiding customers from buying guns.\u201cI am concerned when government agencies use their power to try to cut off financial services for lawful businesses they may disfavor,\u201d Mr. Crapo wrote to Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI am also concerned when large national banks use their market power for similar purposes.\u201dMr. Crapo reminded the banks that he had fought against Operation Choke Point, an Obama-era initiative in which the Department of Justice and bank regulators worked to discourage banks from doing business with companies such as payday lenders and gun sellers. The Trump Justice Department decided to end the policy last year.At a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, a departing Republican commissioner, Michael Piwowar, assailed Citigroup executives over the bank\u2019s gun policies. Mr. Piwowar, according to Bloomberg News, warned that the bank could struggle to get Republican support on the commission for easing derivatives regulations. He declined to comment on the exchange.\u201cWe tried to balance respect for law-abiding gun owners and respect for the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Skyler said, explaining that the bank\u2019s goal was just to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. \u201cThe sense was nothing was really changing in our society.\u201dGun lobbyists that usually direct their resources at attacking Democrats have now jumped into the fray to take on banks, pressing Republican lawmakers to use their influence to make the banks back down.The website of the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, has been accusing bankers of infringing on constitutional rights from the comfort of New York City skyscrapers.Lawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said his organization had been lobbying lawmakers in hopes they would take action against banks. He said businesses should not be able to tell consumers what legal products they could and could not buy.\u201cWe are very concerned that banks enter into this hotly contested political issue,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThese are matters for the policy arena. Banks shouldn\u2019t be interjecting themselves into this issue.\u201d\u201cPlease do not support the Dodd-Frank reform legislation without the inclusion of an amendment that stops federally funded banks from discriminating against the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment,\u201d said John Velleco, director of government operations at Gun Owners of America. No such amendment was included, and President Trump signed the bill into law on Thursday.Mr. Trump, who has not hesitated to publicly attack companies such as Amazon for policies that he opposes, has not yet weighed in on the banking industry\u2019s efforts to curb gun sales. However, members of his administration have expressed doubt that there is much their regulatory agencies could do.During congressional hearings this spring, Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Randal K. Quarles, vice chairman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, faced questions from Republican lawmakers about whether regulators could intervene.Mr. Quarles indicated that the issue was outside of the scope of the Fed\u2019s mandate. Mr. Mulvaney said that what the banks were doing to the gun industry was \u201ctroubling,\u201d but that he did not think it was his agency\u2019s role to intercede.While lawmakers have been mulling how to respond, legislation, at the moment, appears unlikely.The gun restrictions are one of the few areas where Democratic lawmakers have been supportive of the banks, and Republican leaders in the House have expressed reluctance about interfering in the financial sector despite their strong belief in gun rights.Thus far, other banks have remained quiet about their intentions, but more action against the gun industry could bring reluctant Republican lawmakers off the sidelines.\u201cI\u2019m still thinking through this, because I generally don\u2019t like to tell businesses how to conduct their business,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut it is certainly problematic if it were to be the case that the major banks that provide the infrastructure for so much of our financial services decided that they were going to practically shut down a perfectly legal industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was 76.The cause was mesothelioma, said Gus Davis, her partner in the prominent antique and estate jewelry firm that they formed nearly three decades ago and that bears her name.Ms. Bergeron was an economics major who had worked as an investment analyst when she joined with other partners in 1973 to found Furman, Selz, Mager, Dietz and Birney, a boutique financial firm.Bernard Selz, now a hedge fund manager and philanthropist, was the chairman. Roy Furman, who later became a Tony Award-winning Broadway producer, was the president. Their research, brokerage and investment banking firm, initially capitalized at $500,000, was sold as Furman Selz Holding Corporation to the Xerox Corporation in 1987 for $110 million.Ready to consider a career change, and coping with multiple sclerosis (she navigated Manhattan on a motorized scooter), Ms. Bergeron was introduced by her friend Lillian Vernon, the mail order retailer, to Mr. Davis, then a 25-year-old assistant at Sotheby\u2019s.Ms. Bergeron made herself clear from the start: Women should choose their own engagement rings rather than be surprised, they should not be allowed outside the house without earrings, and their jewelry should say, \u201cHello, I\u2019m clever and witty and stylish\u201d rather than \u201cHello, I\u2019m rich.\u201d\u201cShe told me that she had an idea of starting an antique and estate jewelry business that catered to women who made their own financial decisions,\u201d Mr. Davis recalled, \u201cand did not need to ask their husband or boyfriend if it was O.K. to spend money.\u201dMr. Davis thought at the time that the conversation was idle chatter, but in August 1989 Ms. Bergeron telephoned.\u201cI had my gemology degree, but did not have the business background,\u201d he recalled. \u201cCamilla had the business background, the taste and the beauty. We talked, and she asked me to consult. I thought this is another person with way too much money with a crazy idea, but Camilla had charm and determination. She sent out a letter to her entire list of Wall Street clients stating the following: \u2018If you or your Aunt Tilly has jewelry to sell, call me.\u2019 \u201dUnlike those of stocks, antique jewelry prices were less volatile, though they varied widely. Bangles in the store\u2019s online catalog range in price from an antique amethyst and seed pearl ring for $950 to a 10.37 carat emerald cut diamond platinum engagement ring for $425,000.Elizabeth Camilla Dietz was born on March 11, 1942, in Covington, Ga., just east of Atlanta. Her father, Harry, an immigrant from Russia, owned a dry goods store. Her mother Iola (Parker) Dietz, was a librarian.After graduating from Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 1964 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics, she was hired as an investment analyst by Chase Manhattan Bank. She later joined Seiden & de Cuevas, a brokerage and investment banking firm, and traveled extensively making institutional sales in Europe, where she began collecting antique jewelry, silver, perfume bottles and other items.She left with several colleagues to found the brokerage firm, where she specialized in consumer goods. It was sold to Xerox in 1987 six weeks before the stock market collapsed.She is survived by her husband, Jean Maurice Georges Bergeron; and her sister, Harriet Nunnally.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Drop as Italy\u2019s Political Anxiety Spills Across Its Borders", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets in the United States dropped Tuesday amid concerns that growing political uncertainty in Italy and simmering tensions over Chinese trade could weigh on global economic growth.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent, marking the its third straight decline. Financial shares were among the worst performers, as developments in the European markets seemed to reawaken fears of a debt crisis among investors.Amid that uncertainty \u2014 which has left open the prospect of early elections and the formation of another populist alliance \u2014 investors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy\u2019s benchmark stock index fell nearly 2.7 percent, and worried investors sold off government bonds, sending prices down and yields up. The yield on Italy\u2019s main 10-year bond rose to its highest level in more than four years, spiking by more than a half percentage point to roughly 3.20 percent, according to data from Tradeweb, a bond trading platform.The euro fell to its weakest value against the dollar in nearly a year, and prices for government bonds issued by other heavily indebted European countries like Spain and Portugal also tumbled on Tuesday, pushing their yields up as well.The so-called spread between yields on debt from such countries and debt from Germany \u2014 Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which is seen as having the region\u2019s safest government bonds \u2014 widened sharply. That dynamic recalled the worst days of the European debt crisis that began in 2010, when investors first began to consider the risk that Greece may default on its debt, and then cast a worried eye at countries including Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Since then, European policymakers have been able to ease investor concerns, in part through a European Central Bank policy of effectively printing money in order to push interest rates down and speed economic growth.But the uncertainty in Italy reverberated across the continent on Tuesday. The main stock indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris dropped. In a sign that investors were looking for safer assets, the yields on 10-year bonds from Britain, France and Germany all fell.In the United States, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note also fell to 2.80 percent as investors flocked to the safety of American sovereign debt. Yields on those notes had topped 3 percent in recent weeks on optimism about American economic growth and expectations of ongoing rate increases from the Federal Reserve.The decline in Treasury bond yields \u2014 which serve as benchmarks for private lending rates \u2014 weighed on shares of financial institutions. The financial sector was the worst performing part of the S.&P. 500-stock index, dropping by more than 3 percent, as falling long-term bond yields fanned concerns about crimped bank profitability.In a note to clients, bond market analysts from BMO Capital Markets thought that the shift toward investor demand for safety would probably last.\u201cThe cracks that we\u2019ve seen in risk appetite are only likely to widen,\u201d they wrote.Industrial stocks also dragged on markets in the United States, as trade tensions with China continue to create ongoing uncertainties for manufacturers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turmoil for Turkey\u2019s Trump", "Date": "2018-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAn anti-establishment leader takes power after a contentious election. His administration quickly proves itself remarkably corrupt; but he subverts the legal system and is able not only to suppress investigations into his corruption \u2014 his supporters denounce it all as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d \u2014 but also to consolidate his rule and undermine institutions (the \u201cdeep state\u201d) that might have limited his power.But does it matter? In America, stocks are up and the economy keeps chugging along. Erdogan has presided over an actual economic boom. Investors and markets don\u2019t seem to mind the craziness at the top. The fact that economic policymakers have no idea what they\u2019re talking about doesn\u2019t seem to make any difference.Until it does.The truth is that most of the time the quality of economic leadership matters much less than most people \u2014 economic leaders included \u2014 believe. Really destructive policies, like those driving Venezuela into the ditch, are one thing. But run-of-the-mill policies like changes in tax law, even if they\u2019re pretty big and clearly irresponsible, rarely have dramatic effects.Basically, as long as the economy isn\u2019t being hit by major shocks, political posturing hardly matters. Someone looking at U.S. growth in G.D.P. or employment over the past few years who didn\u2019t know we\u2019d had an election in 2016 would have no reason to suspect that anything important had changed.But when big shocks do hit, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a lot. Which is what we\u2019re seeing in Turkey now.An aside: Even if the quality of economic leadership matters a lot only during crises, you might expect markets to think ahead and incorporate the risk of badly handled future crises into stock and bond prices. Somehow, though, that almost never happens.What we get instead are long stretches of complacency followed by sudden panic. Students of international macroeconomics are fond of quoting \u201cDornbusch\u2019s law\u201d (named after my late teacher Rudiger Dornbusch): \u201cCrises take longer to arrive than you can possibly imagine, but when they do come, they happen faster than you can possibly imagine.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening in Turkey is a classic currency-and-debt crisis, of a kind we\u2019ve seen many times in Asia and Latin America. First, a nation becomes popular with international investors and runs up substantial foreign debt \u2014 in Turkey\u2019s case, largely debt owed by domestic corporations.Then it starts, for whatever reason, to lose its luster: Right now, emerging markets in general are being weighed down by a rising dollar and rising U.S. interest rates. And at that point a self-reinforcing crisis becomes possible: External factors cause a loss in confidence, which causes a country\u2019s currency to drop, but the falling currency causes the domestic value of those foreign debts to explode, worsening the economy, leading to further declines in confidence, and so on.At such a time, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a great deal. You need officials who understand what\u2019s happening, can devise a response and have enough credibility that markets give them the benefit of the doubt. Some emerging markets have those things, and they are riding out the turmoil fairly well. The Erdogan regime has none of that.So is the turmoil in Turkey a preview of what will happen under Trump?

{"Headline": "The Next New Thing in Finance \u2014 Bonds Linked Directly to the Economy", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWhen the next big recession comes, we\u2019ll be much better off if governments have established a new kind of bond tied to the ups and downs of the economy.In fact, just such a financial innovation is almost ready for the marketplace.The investment vehicle, called a G.D.P.-linked bond because it is tied to fluctuations in a country\u2019s gross domestic product, would be immensely valuable to cash-strapped governments when revenue fell and debt-service costs climbed. In those circumstances, payments on G.D.P.-linked bonds would decline. That\u2019s because the bonds automatically reduce debt payments as the economy weakens, a boon to governments but not obviously a good thing for investors.In boom times, on the other hand, investors would profit as national economies grow and payouts on the bonds increase. If G.D.P-linked bonds had been on the market, global investors could have cashed in on the rapid growth of China\u2019s economy over the past few decades by buying the Chinese version of such bonds. This would not have been the same as investing in Chinese stocks, which would have represented a claim only on earnings of then-traded corporations based in China.The idea behind these bonds may seem strange. But many financial innovations that are now commonplace also seemed strange at one time.Consider the inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. They are standard, unexciting and very useful now. But that wasn\u2019t always the case.Many people are interested in buying them now.In December, T.I.P.S. accounted for 9 percent of the federal debt held by the public, or more than $1 trillion. While inflation is low now, people perceive that there remains a risk it could rise, which has sustained a strong market for those bonds.Basically, once the market sets an appropriate price for G.D.P.-linked bonds, their benefits are straightforward.From the Treasury\u2019s standpoint, the bonds would be helpful in a major financial crisis, when economic growth, inflation and tax revenue fall but conventional debt stays burdensome. Without G.D.P.-linked bonds \u2014 or extraordinary intervention by government or multilateral institutions, as happened in the most recent global financial crisis \u2014 a nation can find itself at risk of default.In a crisis like that, investors would suffer as bond payments declined. In expansions, however, investors would benefit. In the United States, for example, bondholders can probably expect strong long-term growth in gross domestic product, which has risen 3.2 percent a year in real dollars, or 6.1 percent in nominal dollars, since 1929. Foreign investors should want such bonds to diversify their holdings.Purchases of G.D.P.-linked bonds by investors outside the United States would be good for the American government because foreigners would be assuming part of this country\u2019s economic risks from all causes, including global warming.Furthermore, if countries around the world issued G.D.P.-linked bonds, truly diversified global portfolios would be possible, allowing investors to share in risk and to benefit from growth. Modern finance tells us that this would lead to safer, not riskier portfolios.Some technical details still need to be worked out.It is not clear, for example, how credit rating agencies would rate these new bonds. They do not rate equities today and might conclude that individual G.D.P.-linked bonds were too similar to stocks in their risk/return profiles to permit a bond rating.One legal issue to be resolved is whether G.D.P.-linked bonds would come with provisions that allowed disputes to be settled by a vote of a supermajority of investors, who have come to expect this protection from so-called collective action clauses in other types of sovereign bonds.Specifically, a trill would pay an annual dividend equal to one trillionth of that particular year\u2019s G.D.P., and would do so without any end date. This would define the bonds in a transparent way, implying that they are natural extensions of stock markets, which are also perpetual. The trills would go even further because they encompass everything that goes on in an economy.The remaining issues need not be major obstacles. In fact, an advanced country\u2019s government could issue G.D.P.-linked bonds now, setting an example for others to follow. Eventually, a vibrant market for the bonds could exist worldwide.Once that happens, we can use G.D.P.-linked bonds as diversification tools, providing another way to protect vulnerable people and governments against economic fluctuations. One day, we may well take these bonds for granted, as if they had always existed.An earlier version of this article misstated the year John Y. Campbell and Robert J. Shiller wrote a research paper about inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. It was 1996, not 1966.Robert J.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Good for Pharma Isn\u2019t Good for America (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut promise-breaking aside, would introducing a policy of bargaining drug prices down have been good for America? Actually, yes.Oddly, I never got around to doing my homework on the economics of drug-price bargaining \u2013 partly because I was realistic enough about the political economy to realize that it wasn\u2019t going to happen in America any time soon. Still, the fact that Trump promised to do something makes it somewhat relevant, even if he did predictably break that promise. And it turns out that the economic case for doing what Trump just didn\u2019t do, for putting caps on drug prices, is remarkably strong.[Personal note: why am I doing this on a Saturday night? Because I just finished two days of meeting with men in gray suits talking about money and banking, I have to leave for the airport at 4:45 AM tomorrow, and I\u2019m about to order in room service and go to bed. Life of the party, me.]Let\u2019s start with where things are right now. After a drug company gets a patent, it has a temporary monopoly on sales of its drug. So its situation looks like that of a standard monopolist, as shown in Figure 1:It charges a price that is above the marginal cost of producing the drug \u2013 usually well above marginal cost. Nonetheless, consumers gain from the drug\u2019s availability: the marginal consumer is willing to pay the drug\u2019s price, and all the inframarginal consumers gain consumer surplus. Meanwhile, the drug company makes a profit, which is also a gain to the economy (although we haven\u2019t deducted the cost of developing the drug; more about that in a minute.)So overall, society gains from the drug\u2019s existence. However, as Figure 2 shows, society would gain more if someone \u2013 regulators, purchasing managers at government agencies, whatever \u2013 forced the drug company to charge less than the monopoly price:Consumer surplus would rise; the drug company would earn less profit per unit sold, but this would be partially offset by the profits earned on increased sales. Overall welfare would rise by the green-shaded area.But wait: wouldn\u2019t bargaining drug prices down reduce the incentive to develop new drugs? And wouldn\u2019t this mean in some cases forgoing the welfare gains that come about, even with unregulated monopoly, from the mere fact that a drug becomes available?Yes, it would. But despite this effect, the United States would almost certainly be better off with a moderate level of bargaining/price control than it is under the current hands-off regime. Why? I count at least four distinct reasons.Finally, it\u2019s a global market \u2013 which means that much of the consumer surplus from drug development accrues to foreigners, not U.S. citizens. Maybe there should be more drug development from the point of view of global welfare. But given the unique unwillingness of the U.S. to bargain over prices, we end up paying a much larger share of the costs of that development than we receive of the benefits. Funny how Trump is America first on everything, except when a nationalist position might be bad for Big Pharma.Yes, Trump says he wants to force other countries to raise drug prices. Good luck on that.What this comes down to is that there is a very strong case for doing what Trump promised to do but didn\u2019t. I\u2019m aware that simply saying \u201clet\u2019s bargain over drug prices\u201d isn\u2019t effective unless coupled with a willingness to say no \u2013 to tell a drug company that an overpriced drug will be excluded from the formulary. So it wouldn\u2019t be politically easy. But it would be good economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Wealth Gap Hits Families the Hardest", "Date": "2018-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe writers study demographic changes in families and social inequality.What does economic inequality really look like?Income alone doesn\u2019t give a complete picture. Income inequality describes the gap between a six-figure salary and minimum wage. But the more alarming gap occurs in wealth \u2014 a household\u2019s total assets minus debts. To understand how inequality is playing out in the United States, we need to look more closely at the wealth gap.The extreme wealth inequality we have identified is a result of years of policies that have eroded both public spending and private income for families with children.The demographer Samuel Preston warned in 1984 that the United States had made \u201ca set of private and public choices that have dramatically altered the age profile of well-being,\u201d by devoting resources toward improving conditions for the elderly while neglecting to do the same for families with children. \u201cThe constituency for children in public decisions simply appears too feeble to fight back,\u201d he wrote.We are seeing the consequences of these policies now, and they will follow today\u2019s children throughout their lives.Unlike income, which can change quickly because of a booming economy or a rise in the minimum wage, changes in wealth usually happen slowly. The recently passed tax law, for example, may increase your take-home pay, but it\u2019s unlikely to increase the value of your house.To understand how wealth and wealth inequality have changed among families with children and elderly households, we examined data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, a large survey conducted approximately every three years that catalogs the total assets and debt of American households.The data we used comes from several thousand representative households in each of the nine survey years between 1989 and 2013. We examined the wealth of households headed by someone age 65 or older, and families headed by someone under age 65 and with children under age 18.Our research shows that in terms of wealth, those over 65 have weathered the past quarter-century much better than families with children, despite two major recessions. The net worth of older people\u2019s households increased by 45 percent from 1989 to 2013. And for the past 25 years, the distance between the rich elderly and the poor elderly remained stable. The very wealthiest elderly households grew richer, but so did those of working-class and middle-class older people.Families with children fared worse as a group. Overall, their wealth declined by 56 percent in the same period. More important, they also faced a wide and growing divide: Wealth inequality for these households grew significantly from 1989 to 2013. The top 1 percent saw their wealth increase by 156 percent, while parents in the bottom half saw their wealth shrink by 260 percent. About a third of all families with children in 2013 had no wealth, only debt.In 2013, the top 1 percent of these families had a median wealth of $5.1 million, thanks to skyrocketing incomes, increasing home values and strong returns on stocks and investments. They have millions in savings and generous trust funds for their children.Families on the bottom rungs live very differently. They may not even own a home, and if they face an unexpected expense, like a medical emergency, they don\u2019t have a cushion of savings or other assets to draw on. And when their children start college, some of these parents may still be paying off their own student loans.Why are so many parents with children faring so poorly? In part, it\u2019s a result of long-term changes in employment. Over the period we studied, employment became more unstable, as companies replaced full-time jobs with part-time work and short-term contracts. These employment changes affected families with children more than the elderly, who are mostly retired. That means not only less income but also less money to save or invest in homes or other wealth-producing assets.The other problem for families with children is debt: not credit card or car loan debt, which hasn\u2019t changed much since the late 1980s, but student loan and mortgage debt.Education debt has been rising throughout the period in our study, in part because federal Pell Grants failed to keep up with rising tuition costs. Pell Grants now cover only 29 percent of the cost of a four-year degree at a public college, the lowest percentage on record. Even earning a two-year degree at a community college usually means taking on debt.In the mid-2000s, housing debt also started to rise, especially as subprime lenders opened the housing market to more first-time buyers. After the collapse of the housing market, home prices were down one-third from their pre-recession peak. For many families, that wiped out the value of their main asset.Why did older households fare better? First, older Americans\u2019 incomes were largely stable. Their primary source of income, Social Security, is indexed to inflation. With stable income, fewer older people dipped into savings to pay their bills, and they had more money to invest. Second, most of them bought their homes before the housing bubble, and third, they graduated from college before the era of high student loan debt. Thanks to these three factors, the median net worth of poor and middle-class older people rose by 70 percent from 1989 to 2013.There are a few policy changes that may help. Increasing the purchasing power of Pell Grants and then indexing it to rising tuition costs would be a start. The government could also expand tax credits that benefit families, and compensate families who were victims of predatory lending practices.But the magnitude of the problem is so great that these measures are not enough. The United States needs a fundamental rethinking of public policy priorities to improve the lives of the next generation of children.Christina Gibson-Davis is an associate professor of public policy at Duke.

Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201dRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201dAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H.

The truth is that failed government policy has ruined the economy, resulting in hyperinflation and severe shortages, and millions of Venezuelans cannot afford to buy food on the open market. Government-controlled rations are their only option.The country held an election last July to effectively replace the opposition-controlled National Assembly legislators with a pro-government Constituent Assembly. Mr. Maduro told voters to scan their special IDs after voting, adding \u201cwe will know who fulfilled their obligations to the Fatherland.\u201d Venezuelan law does not require citizens to vote.This is not just about recording whether someone voted. Many Venezuelans remember when under former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, government employees who supported a referendum on his presidency were fired from their jobs or the state-owned oil company, or when the same thing happened to supporters of a referendum against Mr. Maduro two years ago.In a country where people desperately need the food boxes, many see the government\u2019s demand to use the special ID near the voting site as a threat: Vote for Mr. Maduro or your family won\u2019t eat. Defying the authorities in the polling booth is too big of a risk.For example, one night last year, in the middle of an antigovernment protest in Caracas, one of us spotted a woman on the street talking to a member of an armed pro-government gang.Protesters recognized the woman as the neighborhood distributor of the government\u2019s food boxes.

In the coming days, foreign governments should press the Maduro government to abandon any effort to use the carnet to record if they voted.And representatives from the Americas and Europe should urgently convene a high-level meeting with key international aid groups to look for ways to open a humanitarian channel so there are no more hostages of hunger in Venezuela.Food should not be used to intimidate hungry people.Rafael Uzc\u00e1tegui is the director of the Venezuelan rights group Provea.

I would say that half of them that I\u2019ve named have been women,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\u201cI feel very good about the decisions we\u2019ve made about our C.E.O.s,\u201d he added.He did not answer whether Berkshire would push for gender equality on the boards of the companies that Berkshire is invested in.Mr. Buffett also said it was clear that women had been treated unfairly in the past.\u201cI have two sisters who are absolutely as smart as I am, and they have better personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t remotely have the same opportunities as I had.\u201dMr. Buffett said there was still a \u201cpipeline problem\u201d in corporate America, making it hard to find as many qualified women to lead companies.But, he added, \u201cyou can\u2019t use that excuse forever.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterBerkshire is quickly building its stake in Apple.Since Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker about two years ago, the stake has grown into Berkshire\u2019s largest holding. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.So what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201dCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Given Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.Mr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.Here\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201dAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201dHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.The discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:Warren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.Mr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.But his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201dThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.Mr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201dMr. Munger then added:\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201dOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.Berkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.In response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201dMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\u2014 Emily FlitterThe question of who will succeed Warren Buffett has been a thread through many of the exchanges with shareholders.\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201dHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201dCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201dAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.The shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen GrocerThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.Warren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.But just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.Mr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201dBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201dCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\u2014 Emily FlitterThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.So it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d\u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201dSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.In the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.Given the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.Berkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett. Here is a sampling:\u2022 What is the single greatest important investment in your lifetime? Is it a company? Is it a relationship? \u2014 Conner Van Fossen, Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass.\u2022 What are your thoughts about the future/sustainability of health care and Medicare, and how is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon going to address this?Timothy Liu, San Francisco Bay Area.\u2022 What does he see in the cryptocurrency market? Is it going to be the future? Is it going to replace the way we exchange value? Is it worth the hype? \u2014 Jason Lu, Shanghai\u2022 Where do you see the job market going, given the rise of Artificial Intelligence? \u2014 Ralph Humphrey, Hillside, N.J.\u2022 He\u2019s been technology averse in the past. What makes him so bullish on Apple? \u2014 Brian Hanks, Salt Lake City, Utah\u2022 How long he plans on doing this. \u2014Bill Skidmore, Omaha, Neb.\u2014 Elisa Mala(As Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting has grown over the years, it has become a three-day event. Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)Shareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.What was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.Investors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth). There were Justin cowboy boots embroidered with the words \u201cBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Shareholders Meeting\u201d and guests had the option to \u201cPut yourself in Warren Buffett\u2019s boots,\u201d as the marketing materials suggest, and purchase a style that had been owned by the man himself.Jim Van Fossen, a retired financial planner, bought matching Berkshire Hathaway boxers for himself and his son, Conner Van Fossen. In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders\u2019 meeting.Of course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses. See\u2019s Candies displayed Scotch Kiss confections \u201cmade by Warren,\u201d and one staff member\u2019s uniform bore Mr. Buffett\u2019s autograph.The most photographed autograph was at the Benjamin Moore paint booth, where Mr. Buffett had signed his name in permanent marker next to a wall-size mural of his face. All day long, revelers followed suit, decorating the wall with their own signatures in dry-erase ink, and snapping selfies to preserve the memory.\u2014 Elisa Malahealth carepriceyear endAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Just Saying Yes to Drug Companies", "Date": "2018-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistAnd if someone tries to convince you that Trump really is getting tough on drug companies, there\u2019s a simple response: If he were, his speech wouldn\u2019t have sent drug stocks soaring.None of this should come as a surprise. At this point, \u201cTrump Breaks Another of His Populist Promises\u201d is very much a dog-bites-man headline. But there are two substantive questions here. First, should the U.S. government actually do what Trump said he would do, but didn\u2019t? And if so, why haven\u2019t we taken action on drug prices?Bear in mind that the way the drug business works can\u2019t and doesn\u2019t bear any resemblance to the Econ 101, supply-and-demand stories beloved by free-market enthusiasts. What we have, instead, is a patent system in which the company that develops a drug is granted a temporary legal monopoly over sales of that drug. That system is O.K., or at least defensible, as a way to reward innovation; but nothing about the logic of the patent system says that patent owners should be free to exploit their monopolies to the max.There is, in fact, a very strong case for government action to limit the prices drug companies can charge, just as there is a strong case for limiting monopoly power in general. And the fact that taxpayers pay a large share of drug costs both reinforces the case for limiting drug prices and gives the government a lot of leverage it could use to achieve that goal.So why aren\u2019t we doing something about drug prices?But questions about the details aren\u2019t what\u2019s stopping action on drug prices, since we haven\u2019t even gotten to the point of letting Medicare try to bring prices down. And the reason we haven\u2019t gotten to that point is, sadly, both simple and crude: Pharma has bought itself enough politicians to block policies that might reduce its profits.I\u2019m not just talking about campaign contributions, either. I\u2019m talking about the personal enrichment of politicians who serve pharma\u2019s agenda.The bottom line is that American exceptionalism has prevailed again: We\u2019re still the only major nation that lets the drug companies charge whatever they like.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Profits Are Soaring. The Stock Market Has Barely Noticed.", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesEarnings season is underway on Wall Street and, thanks to a heady combination of core business strength and tax windfalls, the results have been exceptional.In fact, based on the numbers so far, profits among the biggest American corporations are growing so fast that you may expect the stock market to be soaring like a rocket.That\u2019s not the direction the market has been heading, of course. Since February, most stocks have been sluggish \u2014 or downright negative \u2014 and the spectacular earnings reports have received less fanfare than they probably deserve.Add the negative impact of rising interest rates and heightened expectations for inflation \u2014 both of which tend to hurt share prices \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why the stock market weakened as much as it did.Tax windfalls are certainly inflating the numbers, but the core earnings of American corporations look solid, nonetheless.Consider the picture for the first three months of 2018, the period for current earnings reports. By one measure, the quarter is actually turning out to have been the best for corporate America in decades. The tax cuts that went into effect this year have transformed excellent earnings into exceptional ones.David Aurelio, a senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters, says nearly 80 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that have reported so far have outstripped the expectations of Wall Street \u2014 16 percentage points higher than the average number of companies that beat expectations. \u201cThat performance is the best since our records started in 1994,\u201d he said.Earnings per share have grown 26 percent since the same quarter a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Net operating income \u2014 essentially, profit after taxes \u2014 has risen nearly 25 percent in the same period. Almost half of that gain, 11.6 percentage points, comes from the big cut in corporate taxes that took effect this year.The tax windfall alone accounts for a larger earnings increase than the stock market typically receives from conventional sources, the data shows. Expectations of a tax cut may help explain the run-up in stocks in 2017 and earlier this year.But writing off the current earnings surge entirely as a pure artifact of tax cuts would be a mistake. Before taxes, earnings grew 13.2 percent for the quarter. That is a breathtaking figure.\u201cWhenever you get double-digit earnings growth coming from core earnings, it is really healthy,\u201d Mr. Aurelio said. \u201cWhat I find surprising is that, aside from the tax cuts, fundamentals are really looking strong,\u201d he added.The tax changes mean that Apple suddenly has \u201cincreased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash,\u201d which had been stranded abroad, said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer. So Apple announced a $100 billion increase in what had been a $300 billion share buyback program, as well as a 16 percent dividend increase.Apple\u2019s operating income rose more than 10 percent in the quarter, an impressive figure in its own right, and the end of the Apple profit machine is nowhere in sight.Apple isn\u2019t the only company to have churned out outstanding earnings. Profits have been rising for most big American companies, and Wall Street expects that to continue for at least the next year or two.Edward Yardeni, an independent market strategist, points out that double-digit earnings growth isn\u2019t likely to be sustained by corporate America. Profit growth is likely to decline to the roughly 7 percent annual rate that has been the historic norm, he says. And the norm is that stock market will rise at about that rate over the long run. He expects that to continue.While the market has barely noticed the current avalanche of profits, the combination of stagnant prices and rising earnings means that market valuations have already improved rapidly. If that trend continues, many stocks will again begin to look like bargains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Market\u2019s Trump Test Is About to Get Real: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will Trump\u2019s moves on Iran and trade push markets over the edge?\u2022 What\u2019s next for business after Eric Schneiderman?\u2022 D.E. Shaw grapples with an ousted executive who\u2019s fighting back.\u2022 What Rupert Murdoch will weigh if Comcast makes another bid for Fox assets.President Trump\u2019s antagonistic foreign policies have yet to cause serious losses in the stock market.But investors\u2019 stoicism could face greater tests in the coming weeks. They have to contend with the repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran and the increasing likelihood of a trade war with China and the European Union. And all this is happening at a time when a boom in corporate earnings, the chief driver of the stock market, appears to be cooling.Up until January, investors were willing to pay high valuations for stocks because they expected corporate earnings to accelerate this year. But the best may already be behind us. Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, on Monday wrote that analysts now believe that earnings growth for this year likely peaked in the first quarter (at 23 percent over last year\u2019s first quarter.) After such peaks, the stock market tends to remain weak for a while, she added.Investors likely won\u2019t have a big new jump in profits to look forward to. Earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s. Without sustained support from corporate earnings, investors may be more willing to sell stocks in response to geopolitical events.And in the coming weeks, there will be plenty of potential trade war triggers. The Trump administration could decide to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from a number of countries, including those in the European Union, when exemptions expire at the end of this month. Proposed tariffs on $50 billion of goods from China could also be imposed this month, and the White House could release details on a second batch of tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese products.Since neither the European Union nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate and a full-blown trade war is possible.Investors may continue to hang tight, of course. The stock market is flat for the year, not a bad performance for a period in which the underpinnings of the international economic order are under assault.But that support will most likely convince him that he is on the right track \u2013 and he will press on with his hard-edged international policies. But more than at any time in his presidency, he should not expect the stock market to tag along.\u2014 Peter EavisDisney reported its strongest quarterly results in two years. It beat Wall Street expectations for profit and revenue growth. But even that strong performance was shadowed by analyst concerns over maneuvering by Comcast to upend Disney\u2019s pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, never mentioned Comcast and presented the Fox deal as a fait accompli. \u201cWe are confident that the assets that we are in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved.\u201dMany analysts have recoiled at such a bid, which could leave Comcast with more than $170 billion in debt \u2014 a sum that would make it one of the largest corporate debtholders in American history. \u201cWe do not believe Comcast needs another media asset,\u201d Gregory Williams, a Cowen and Company analyst, wrote in a research note.Recently, he pushed himself to the forefront of the #MeToo movement, announcing a lawsuit against the company once run by the former filmmaker Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of decades of sexual misconduct. \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said at the time.Mr. Schneiderman has denied the women\u2019s allegations.The NYT\u2019s Mark Landler reports:\u201cPresident Trump told President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday morning that he plans to announce the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\u201d\u201cThe United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the nuclear accord \u2014 and impose additional economic penalties as well, the person said.\u201dHere\u2019s what Joe Papa, the company\u2019s C.E.O., said:\u201cThe Bausch name embodies the rich history of innovation, fortitude and dedication to patient health dating back to when J.J. Bausch opened his first optical goods shop more than 165 years ago. These qualities form the foundation of who we are today as we continue to build an innovative company striving to improve the health of patients globally.\u201d \u2014 Michael de la MercedSo where does the deal stack up among big acquisitions? Here\u2019s a breakdown courtesy of Dealogic:\u2022 It is the biggest deal announced this year, beating Cigna\u2019s $55 billion acquisition of Express Scripts.\u2022 It is not just the largest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, but the biggest by a Japanese company. The $63 billion price tag just barely tops the $62.88 billion Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group paid for UFJ Holdings in 2005.The former acting attorney general has returned to King & Spalding as a partner in its special matters team and will head up in the firm\u2019s investigations group, according to a news release.Ms. Yates began her career at King & Spalding before spending 27 years at the Justice Department.

{"Headline": "Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2018-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistBut they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut, and who doesn\u2019t, are accurate, a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback.To be fair, the notion that a big tax cut for corporations \u2014 which was the main element of last year\u2019s law \u2014 might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn\u2019t crazy. But the two key words here are \u201cmight\u201d and \u201ceventually.\u201dThe story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations, Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity, driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages.But what does \u201cbringing money to America\u201d mean? Apple didn\u2019t have a huge, Scrooge McDuck-style pile of gold sitting in Ireland, which it loaded onto a homeward-bound ship. It has digital claims \u2014 a bunch of zeros and ones on some server somewhere \u2014 which in effect used to bear a label saying \u201cthis money is in Ireland.\u201d Now it has changed the label to say \u201cthis money is in America.\u201d What difference does this make?Well, it alters the company\u2019s tax liabilities to the U.S. and Irish governments, which was the point of the change. But otherwise it makes no difference at all.But why aren\u2019t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers?One answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run, it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn\u2019t as global as all that \u2014 the investment world, we might say, is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy, and even in the long run it can\u2019t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return \u2014 which means more for stockholders and less for workers.And at a deeper level, tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from.Apple, however, is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position \u2014 its brand, if you like. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist; what matters is that given its position, it can and does charge what the market will bear, pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes, it gets to keep more of its profits, but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by, say, building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks.And these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it; there are still businesses \u2014 say, trucking companies \u2014 whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic \u201crents,\u201d profits not tied to physical capital, are a big, growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents, there\u2019s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty, even in the long run.The bottom line \u2014 which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise \u2014 is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is, in fact, a big giveaway to wealthy investors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Oil Prices Hit $70 a Barrel for First Time Since \u201914", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cutback in world oil output, engineered by some of the biggest producers, has more than doubled prices from their ebb two years ago. Now, a looming decision by President Trump on the Iran nuclear agreement is pushing them even higher.Benchmark prices for American crude oil closed above $70 a barrel on Monday for the first time since 2014 as traders factored in a prospective United States withdrawal from the accord, which eased international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.Investors fear that a withdrawal would lead to new sanctions on Iran, the world\u2019s fifth-largest producer of crude oil last year, further curtailing a global supply that is already relatively tight.\u201cThe market is watching nervously,\u201d Ann-Louise Hittle, an oil analyst at the market research firm Wood Mackenzie, said of the deadline.Analysts estimate that reimposing sanctions on Iran could reduce the country\u2019s daily oil sales by 300,000 to 600,000 barrels, or perhaps as much as one million barrels. But imposing new sanctions would most likely take time. And if prices stay high, Iran could increase its earnings from oil sales in the short run.\u201cOur base case is the rollout of sanctions will be quite slow and messy,\u201d said Ben Cahill, an analyst at the market research firm Energy Intelligence.\u201cIn the very short term,\u201d he added, \u201cthe price run-up could benefit\u201d Iran.OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has a spotty track record of carrying out production cuts, but compliance has been strong this time. \u201cI think we are where we are because OPEC got their groove back,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.The flow of oil to the global market has been further constricted in recent years as a result of the political and economic crisis plaguing Venezuela, another major producer of crude.The reduced global supply \u2014 combined with the solid global economy \u2014 has helped push oil prices higher since they fell below $30 a barrel in early 2016. The rising tide has lifted the price of the international benchmark, Brent crude, above $75.\u201cIt is mostly a fundamentals-driven market, but the icing on the cake is the worry about Iran,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm.A boom in production in the United States has helped offset some of the tightening in supply in recent months. But higher prices elsewhere have prompted American producers to sell on the global market, driving oil exports to record highs and pulling domestic oil prices higher.That has benefited energy companies, as well as and oil-producing states like Texas. Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell recently reported quarterly profits comparable to what they generated four years ago, when prices topped $100 a barrel.But for large swaths of corporate America, the higher prices mean a hit to profits. Airline stocks fell by more than 1 percent Monday as investors took fuel-price pressures into account.Likewise, consumer incomes will be pinched by elevated gasoline prices. The national average price for unleaded regular has risen above $2.80 in recent days, according to AAA, and is up roughly 20 percent over the last 12 months. That far outstrips the 2.6 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly earnings through April.As a larger chunk of workers\u2019 paychecks goes to fuel, less disposable income is left to be spent elsewhere, a potential problem for an economy heavily reliant on consumer spending. Consumer spending slowed sharply in the first quarter, when it inched up at a 1.1 percent annual clip.Much of that had to do with a slowdown in auto sales after a surge in car-buying late last year to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.Higher fuel prices could also weigh on auto sales. Low gasoline prices have shifted car purchases heavily toward pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which tend to be less fuel-efficient than passenger vehicles.\u201cI think you have to get $4 to $5 per gallon before you start having a psychological impact,\u201d said Joseph Amaturo, who covers the automotive industry for Buckingham Research.Oil companies responded to the price crash that began in 2014 by cutting exploration and other spending and negotiating sharply lower rates from drillers and other contractors, who do much of the work in the oil industry.As a result, oil and gas projects that are going forward tend to have sharply lower costs than those begun in the $100-a-barrel era. Jessica Uhl, Shell\u2019s chief financial officer, said recently that a United States oil field in the Gulf of Mexico that Shell was developing would break even at less than $35 a barrel thanks to a 70 percent reduction in its original projected capital costs. \u201cBy applying industry-standard designs, we simplified the scope,\u201d she said.Lower costs, combined with higher oil prices, are likely to raise profits as long as these conditions hold. Of course, cost inflation may return to the industry, and the cash rolling in may eventually loosen spending discipline, as it did a few years ago.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an oil analyst for Wood Mackenzie.

{"Headline": "Uber Finds Profits in Leaving Tough Overseas Markets", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber, which has had a reputation for aggressive pursuit of market share even at the expense of profitability, reported a rare quarterly profit on Wednesday that was driven by taking the opposite approach: Waving the white flag in challenging overseas markets.Both deals closed during the first three months of 2018, swinging the money-losing company into profitability. Take away those transactions, and Uber\u2019s business is still burning cash \u2014 albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters.Uber said it made $2.45 billion in the first three months of 2018 on revenue of $11.33 billion. That is an improvement over the previous quarter, when the company recorded a loss of $1.1 billion on revenue of $10.9 billion. Stripping out one-time gains and charges, Uber reported a loss of $601 million.Uber said it was winding down its driverless car operations in Arizona because it wanted to focus its testing efforts near its autonomous vehicle engineering hubs in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uber said it hopes to resume testing its self-driving cars on streets in Pittsburgh this summer, after the federal investigation concludes.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to self-driving technology, and we look forward to returning to public roads in the near future,\u201d said Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman.In a statement, William Peduto, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor, said he learned of Uber\u2019s plan to start testing again in the city through social media and that the company had not informed him its plans. \u201cThis is not the way to rebuild a constructive working relationship with local government, especially when facing a public safety matter,\u201d he said.But Ms. Abboud, Uber\u2019s spokeswoman, said the company has been engaged in ongoing discussion with the mayor\u2019s office and the state about restarting testing.As a private company, Uber is not obligated to report quarterly results. It provides a fairly detailed earnings statement, but its results are not audited and excludes some useful data like user growth and a breakdown of its ride-hailing business versus food delivery.Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, said in a statement that the performance of its ride-hailing service exceeded its internal \u2014 and undisclosed \u2014 projections. He said it planned to continue investing in other areas this year, an indication to investors that they should not expect regular profitability from the company in the near future.Mr. Khosrowshahi has pledged to take Uber public within the next year, raising the pressure on the company to prove that it can turn those losses into profits.The latest offering will again allow some of Uber\u2019s earliest investors and employees to sell shares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Risk to the Economy \u2014 A Slowdown in Lending: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy.\u2022 Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year?\u2022 Walmart\u2019s journey to its biggest deal.\u2022 How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper.\u2022 The latest fallout from Trump\u2019s foreign policy.With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years.Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production.Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn\u2019t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect.In March, bank loans to companies (commercial and industrial loans, in the Federal Reserve\u2019s statistics) rose 2.5 percent from a year ago. That is well below the 7 percent average monthly growth rate of the past three years. Real estate and consumer loans also grew below their three-year average rates.Tough comparisons are in part to blame for the lackluster growth. This year\u2019s borrowing is being compared with totals notched up during a surge in lending. And since that boom petered out in early 2017, growth rates in credit may soon look better.But something else may hinder a strong revival in borrowing. Companies may have taken on so much debt that they may not want to borrow much more, or their creditors may not be as willing to lend. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday noted that the \u201cnet leverage\u201d of investment-grade corporations is now at its highest level since 2002. Debt, after subtracting cash holdings, is 1.82 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the companies, excluding financial firms and corporations in the energy, utilities and metals sectors.Of course, we may now just be in a lending lull that will soon give way to a rebound. But the longer credit growth remains subpar, the less likely a Trump boom becomes.- Peter EavisAnalysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch argue that there is a risk of that happening.They cite collapsing production in Venezuela, continued production restraint by OPEC and Russia, and the rising tensions in the Middle East, which seem set to worsen in the wake of President Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from Iran nuclear deal.The analysts raised their forecast for Brent, the global benchmark for oil, to $70 a barrel this year and to $75 a barrel next year and that there was a possibility of oil going to $100 a barrel.Why the risk of $100 a barrel? There could be a greater than expected drop in Iranian oil exports and OPEC and Russia could continue to curb production. The BofA analysts write:\u201cIf a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or OPEC/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further.\u201dAnd United States shale likely will not make up for the falloff in productionBrent last saw $100 a barrel in September 2014.On the earnings call for his Third Point Reinsurance, Mr. Loeb said:Over the past two years, markets were boosted by positive surprises in growth and benign inflation, but during the first quarter, uncertainty returned in each of these areas. Investors have become increasingly concerned about multiples, particularly since after many years of low rates, there\u2019s finally an alternative to equities in the form of relatively riskless 2-year money.We\u2019ve also seen manufacturing indices start to decline from elevated levels.As the markets today grapple with multiples and which inning of the late cycle we\u2019re in, we\u2019re watching closely to see if a recession, which we don\u2019t think is close, might be getting closer.Historically low yields have push investors into increasingly risky assets since the financial crisis and provided crucial support for the stocks. Now that two-year Treasuries yield is more than 2.50 percent, that critical pillar of the nine-year bull market has been weakened somewhat.By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business.Down the road: Flipkart and its remaining investors still hope the company will go public someday.

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Political Crisis: The Danger It Poses for the Global Economy", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably across countries in times of financial disruption.Italian political dysfunction is nothing new. Italian political dysfunction that ripples through global financial markets and has the potential to upend Europe is something the world woke up to Tuesday morning.What are markets really signaling, and how much danger is there for the global economy? To answer, it helps to tease apart the crosscurrents between Italian politics, European institutions, financial markets and economies worldwide.The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, rejected an anti-E.U. nominee for economy minister, setting the stage for elections later in the year that, if a recent pattern repeats, could put in place a parliamentary majority that is hostile to European institutions.In effect, those events have made it more likely that there will be a showdown between authorities in Rome and officials in Brussels, Berlin and Frankfurt over deficit spending, with an unraveling of the European Union one potential outcome, even if not the most likely one.New Italian elections would help decide whether that is the case. In the last elections, in March, populist parties skeptical of European institutions won a comfortable majority of seats in parliament, but included both right-wing and left-wing parties that have struggled since then to form a coalition.If the populists maintain or expand their advantages in elections, it raises the prospect of serious friction between Italian politicians looking to increase spending and a European Commission, European Central Bank and German government that insist upon fiscal austerity as a condition for, among other things, continued E.C.B. purchases of Italian bonds.The movements Tuesday \u2014 a spike in Italian bond yields, and drops in the euro and stocks worldwide \u2014 suggest that the risk of some calamitous outcome for Europe has risen after a weekend of political drama in Rome, but that it\u2019s still an unlikely outcome. So far, there are few signs of \u201ccontagion effects,\u201d in which developments in Italy could create a self-fulfilling crisis in other countries with similar economic challenges. But Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone (and fourth largest in Europe, after Germany, Britain and France) and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.The Italian government\u2019s borrowing costs for two years soared from 0.94 percent to 2.42 percent Tuesday, as investors demanded greater compensation against the risk that the Italian government might repay them not with the rock-solid euro but with less valuable newly issued currency.Meanwhile, Spanish two-year bond yields rose only slightly Tuesday \u2014 by 0.07 percentage points, not the 1.48 percentage points of Italian yields.\u201cThe contagion has been really muted,\u201d said Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. \u201cI think investors are correctly looking at this as an Italy-specific risk for now.\u201dOther European countries, especially powerful Germany, will have little desire to subsidize what they view as fiscal profligacy in Italy. The push toward greater economic unity across Europe since the Greek crisis has included jointly guaranteeing the continent\u2019s banks and the E.C.B.\u2019s purchase of government bonds.If there is conflict, both sides have reason to work things out. Germany and European institutions certainly don\u2019t want a crackup of the eurozone. And within Italy, the economic consequences of peeling away from Europe \u2014 high inflation and lost savings in the near term and the long-term growth consequences from being a less appealing place for investment \u2014 are severe enough that there would be reason to strike a deal.Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro, puts the chance that Italy will exit the euro at only around 10 percent to 15 percent. He argues in a research note that European institutions will probably seek to de-escalate the tensions in the coming months.So far the damage to markets outside Italy is mostly limited to a sell-off in global stock markets, including a 1.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index Tuesday. As is often the case when the rest of the world looks risky, money flowed into Treasury bonds, lowering interest rates in the United States.No doubt Italy has the most at risk economically, followed by the rest of Europe. But one thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably in times of financial disruption.For the last decade, the world has experienced a rolling series of crises, in which financial turmoil fuels economic despair which intensifies political dysfunction which \u2014 through financial markets \u2014 can spread across oceans and repeat the pattern.No one would have thought that a crisis centered on home mortgages in the United States would prove the trigger for crises in Greece and across Europe all those years ago. If things go badly in Italy, there\u2019s no telling where the damage could end up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Blockchain Building in Bushwick", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the outside, 304 Troutman Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, looks fairly ordinary. In most ways, it is. But this nondescript three-story, five-unit rental building is part of an experiment in using the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to transform the New York housing market.\u201cThis is going to be a paradigm shift,\u201d said Mo Shaikh, a founder of Meridio, a Brooklyn-based company looking to introduce blockchain technology to real estate.As a secure, decentralized way to register and store payments and transactions online through \u201csmart contracts,\u201d blockchain technology will give each of the eight investors who currently own the building cryptocurrency tokens that can be traded and secure access to a crypto-protected database that stores individual transaction data. In theory, the technology will make it nearly impossible for hackers to do widespread damage and will protect against the kind of identity theft that conventional investors might be vulnerable to.\u201cBlockchain is just an efficient way of asset exchange: The assets can be cryptocurrency, stocks, bonds, art or real estate,\u201d said Corbin Page, Mr. Shaikh\u2019s partner in Meridio, an offshoot of a larger company called Consensys.Blockchain is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin, but instead of tracking who owns a digital currency, Meridio\u2019s Troutman Street pilot project aims to demonstrate that blockchain can enable online sales of fractional shares of residential or commercial real estate properties.The experiment at Troutman Street is one of many across the country attempting to move real estate records onto blockchain, and it is part of a larger movement in corporate America to transfer all kinds of records onto blockchain. Many of these experiments promise to fundamentally change industries, but many have also been plagued by delays and questions about whether and how they will actually be an improvement on the existing systems.If words like cryptocurrency and blockchain make your eyes glaze over, blockchain boosters point out that a user-friendly system can mean you don\u2019t need to fully understand the technology any more than you understand the programming code that allows you to order from Amazon or follow politics on Facebook. You can buy or sell \u201ctokens\u201d \u2014 which, in this case, represent shares of a building in cryptocurrency \u2014 the same way you would trade online stocks.Meridio\u2019s website will be as easy to use as eTrade and Zillow, Mr. Page said: \u201cWe want it to be for everybody. We will have blockchain in the background, giving the efficiency without it being in your face.\u201dIn real estate deals, he said, blockchain can reduce paperwork and the need for lawyers and other third parties by allowing people to buy and sell portions of buildings more efficiently than by crowdfunding or creating LLCs.Blockchain proselytizers also say that the technology can reduce fraud, speed transactions, lower costs and help democratize real estate.\u201cReal estate has been slow to adopt new technology, and this is bringing energy and excitement, which is welcome in a staid industry,\u201d said Jamie Wiseman, a founder of Cayuga Capital Management, a developer and property manager in Brooklyn and Queens whose holdings include 304 Troutman Street.Doubters, however, point out that fraud cannot be eliminated so easily and that the primitive title recording system in the United States will thwart modernization efforts. They also raise questions about the effect on neighborhood development and gentrification.\u201cI am skeptical of some of the claims about the impact of blockchain\u201d on real estate, said Aaron Wright, a professor who created the Blockchain Project at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and coauthored \u201cBlockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code.\u201dMr. Wright said that the lack of regulation could lead to volatility in trading and cause rapid changes in neighborhoods. And claims that blockchain can dramatically reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual real estate fraud, he added, may be overblown. While blockchain will make information much less vulnerable to hacks and its instantaneous transaction confirmation could cut down on scams, he said, if fraudulent information enters the system, blockchain is not designed to stop it.The revolution, if it comes, will likely be gradual.Mr. Shaikh said they are still teaching Blockchain 101 to most in the real estate industry, through conferences, blog posts and marketing campaigns. And after partnering with the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield, Mr. Page said, it took \u201c20 different conversations to find Cayuga, with executives who understood blockchain\u2019s potential and were willing to act.\u201dCayuga bought 304 Troutman in 2005, and the eight initial investors in the building are now getting cryptocurrency tokens. Starting this summer, they will be able to trade with one another and sell to the tenants there. Meridio is already prepping more properties in New York and beyond, and expects to have them available for trading among accredited investors on their website this summer as well.\u201cWe think blockchain gives us the killer app to make that model work,\u201d Mr. Page said. There are no minimums and trading can be done immediately, with lower costs and possibly without a lawyer.Mr. Shaikh and Mr. Page believe that blockchain will gain traction by allowing people to invest relatively small amounts of money in real estate \u2014 unlike crowdfunding and LLCs, which often require a large minimum investment and have \u201clockup periods\u201d before a property can be flipped. A long with large transfer costs, that has created a high bar for entry to the real estate investment market.Natalia Karayaneva, the chief executive and founder of Propy, another blockchain company, said this fractionalization of properties could allow investors to buy a piece of high-end homes in Manhattan that are often owned by ultra-wealthy foreign oligarchs.But Mr. Wright, the Cardozo professor, offered another perspective: The lack of regulation, he said, could mean that foreigners looking to move money out of their home countries and people with \u201cill-gotten gains\u201d could use the technology to spread their dollars around multiple properties.Ms. Karayaneva and Meridio\u2019s founders, however, believe the fractionalization will bring a bigger and broader pool of capital into real estate. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the money to buy your house or apartment, you can buy a piece of it, allowing you to build wealth,\u201d Mr. Shaikh said. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting for middle-class Americans.\u201dThere are potential pitfalls, of course \u2014 among them, that cryptocurrency has proved quite volatile, and if the value of a home, apartment or retail building were to skyrocket or plummet the way Bitcoin has, the impact could ripple out through an entire neighborhood.\u201cIt depends on how the law plays out with the product, but if there\u2019s massive trading without sensible guardrails there\u2019ll be potential problems with volatility,\u201d Mr. Wright said.Mr. Page argued that the large scale and tangible nature of real estate should make it less volatile than Bitcoin, and Mr. Shaikh said they would consider implementing rules, like one that allows only a certain number of trades on a property per day, to ease concerns.But Mr. Wright pointed out that while more capital pouring in from around the world sounded good, if all those people decided New York was the place to invest and that helped drive prices up for local residents, it would \u201clead to issues on the ground and change the character of a neighborhood.\u201dMr. Wiseman agreed. \u201cBlockchain may bring costs down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will accelerate gentrification.\u201dThere is also the possibility that fractionalization could allow communities to band together to battle gentrification, Mr. Page suggested. Community groups or immigrant-centered organizations, he said, could help coordinate neighbors\u2019 efforts to buy up small chunks of apartments or houses, or even commercial real estate.\u201cMaybe that is a solution,\u201d Mr. Wright said, noting that this would have multiple benefits in strengthening a sense of community, although it would take years before it could be widespread.The effects on individual transactions, however, would be more immediate. Mr. Wright recently ran a demonstration in Australia that showed how smart contracts on blockchain could reduce the \u201ccumbersome half-day process\u201d of a transaction to a matter of minutes.\u201cIt was super exciting,\u201d he said, although it would be difficult to implement these changes in the United States, he added, because real estate records here are \u201cvery, very fractured\u201d and governed on a county-by-county basis. \u201cEfforts to even digitize records that started in the 1980s haven\u2019t fully happened yet.\u201dThat is sadly true, said John Mirkovic, deputy recorder of deeds for Cook County, Ill., which ran a pilot program in Chicago that successfully demonstrated how blockchain technology could be used to more safely and efficiently record real estate transactions.But many counties around the country still use paper for record-keeping, Mr. Mirkovic said, while more technologically advanced ones may have upgraded to Windows 95.\u201cGetting people to do something new is not easy,\u201d he said. Still, he added, citizens and politicians should push for blockchain as a \u201cgood government\u201d issue, making it \u201ca populist technology.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Gains Ground Under the New Volcker Rule: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Trump is imposing tariffs on China. Again.\u2022 What deal makers can learn from Bayer\u2019s new antitrust agreement.The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street \u2013 regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration\u2019s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs.Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit.The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn\u2019t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule\u2019s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway.Here are three ways in which traders gain ground.\u2022 Currently, a bank\u2019s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators.\u2022 Under the Volcker rule now, banks have to show that trading positions held for customers are in line with what those customers\u2019 might actually demand in the near term. Assessing a legitimate level of demand can be difficult. Customers\u2019 appetites can change quickly \u2013 and the metrics used to predict demand were complex. To try and simplify this exercise, the new rule would allow banks to establish ahead of time the \u201crisk limits,\u201d or position sizes, they set for each trading desk. If a bank does not exceed those limits, they would be presumed to have a position that meets customer demand. Regulators on Wednesday said they would try to make sure that the banks\u2019 risk limits was in fact in line with customer demand, but the change clearly gives the initiative to the banks.In theory, as they relaxed the Volcker rule, regulators could have found simple new ways to increase the chances of compliance. For instance, they could have strengthened the part of the rule that requires C.E.O.s to attest that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker rule. But no changes appear to give it more bite.Some of the regulators argue that the Volcker rule was overly prescriptive and that the changes make it more like other banking rules, which, in their opinion, they enforce effectively. Indeed, on a conference call on Wednesday officials said the changes would make it easier to ensure banks comply.But the rank and file regulators can be expected to follow the lead of the political appointees who lead the agencies. If those people want to give the banks a break, the changes to the Volcker rule would clear the way for such a bonanza. \u201cThe proposed changes also put a lot of faith in banks\u2019 own internal risk models and put the onus on Trump-appointed regulators to vigorously police trading activities \u2014 a task I\u2019m not confident they are up for,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said.- Peter EavisStorm clouds are gathering over the global economy, threatening a recovery that seemed to be gaining strength just a few months ago. The winners of Italy\u2019s election are at loggerheads with the E.U.; President Trump is stirring up trouble with America\u2019s biggest trading partners; and the markets and economies of developing countries once again look vulnerable.Blame the trilemma. The \u2026 what?He on Tuesday acknowledged that Italy is facing the trilemma:Here\u2019s how it works.For years, a country may have elected governments that accepted rules entwining it with other economies, reducing its national sovereignty. Italy accepted the fiscal and financial requirements of being part of the E.U., while the U.S. mostly embraced the free trade rules of the postwar era. But then governments came to power in Italy and the U.S. that questioned whether all that international integration was actually good for their respective countries.The United States is probably big enough that it can pull back from international trade agreements without causing itself severe near-term pain. But Italy is in a much weaker position, as the recent sell-off in Italian government bonds shows. Pressure from investors and leaders within the E.U. may well persuade Italy to back away from policies that diverge from the bloc\u2019s orthodoxy. But abiding by the E.U.\u2019s rules may not stimulate Italy\u2019s economy. That could, in turn, increase support for the populists.As Mr. Rodrik wrote:Finally, we can downgrade our ambitions with respect to how much international economic integration we can (or should) achieve. So we go for a limited version of globalization, which is what the postwar Bretton Woods regime was about (with its capital controls and limited trade liberalization). It has unfortunately become a victim of its own success. We have forgotten the compromise embedded in that system, and which was the source of its success.\u2014 Peter EavisHighly targeted research efforts and global collaboration are toward the top of the nation\u2019s checklist for dominating the world of technology.Nothing particularly new there, really. But he also explained some of his plans for making sure that China dominates the R.&D. underpinning those technologies.Part of that includes a focus on basic scientific research into carefully chosen areas with clear, real-world applications \u2014 a \u201cproblem-oriented\u201d approach, as he put it. Much of that might be done at a series of new national laboratories, which will focus on those themes.Also interesting was his insistence that seeking talent and collaborating with other nations would be a vital part of China\u2019s success. He said that solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems,from climate change to food security, would require a global effort. And he called out human talent as a precious resource, and an area in which, he feels China, still lags.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeBeyond scoring points on Twitter, Sanofi inserted itself into the broader issue of how companies should respond to social justice issues.Sanofi\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t nearly the same broad gesture as those. But it shows that the company is engaging in the debate on social issues all the same.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2014 Michael de la MercedOne day you\u2019re earning $1.5 million per year, the next the figure has $10.9 million. According to the WSJ, that\u2019s what happened to David King, the C.E.O. of the health care diagnostics company Laboratory Corporation of America.At least 16 companies in the S&P 500 have changed 2016 pay figures by more than 10 percent for one or more executives, while 17 did so for 2015 pay, a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from MyLogIQ LLC shows.Many changes, like LabCorp\u2019s, are errors caught after companies send proxies to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others can reflect changes in how the company decides to present the perks it has provided. In at least one case, the revised figure was the result of a retroactive pay cut.Microsoft\u2019s leapfrogging Alphabet in market value and new hardware from Nvidia are the latest signs that democratizing artificial intelligence tools is a lucrative business.The world is rapt by A.I. and the way it could be used to transform all kinds of industries. The problem: The technology requires stacks of computing power and significant expertise. So some companies have been creating A.I. software that\u2019s easier to use, then hosting it on their own cloud servers so people can pay for just the processing that they need to do, rather than shelling out for their own exotic hardware.That will allow other organizations to build more capable cloud A.I. systems and benefit from the wind filling Microsoft\u2019s sails.\u2014 Jamie CondliffeInvestors have suddenly shifted away from riskier investments like stocks and commodities and taken refuge in the relative safety of German and American government bonds, the United States dollar and the Japanese yen.Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world.

{"Headline": "What Will Italy\u2019s Next Government Do? A Leak Jolts Stocks", "Date": "2018-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Talks between two anti-establishment parties to form a new Italian government seemed to be regaining momentum on Wednesday, even as financial markets were spooked by leaked documents that suggested the two sides shared a desire to radically change Italy\u2019s relationship with the European Union.The leaders of the Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League party dismissed the leaked document Tuesday night as \u201cold.\u201dBut the draft, which was on the negotiating table as of Monday morning, was apparently not \u201cold\u201d enough to avoid raising jitters. On Wednesday, investors shed Italian assets, and shares trading on the Milan stock market slipped.In a series of joint statements, the two parties tried to distance themselves from the positions in the document, but in doing so only seemed to further betray their real ambitions for what they called \u201ca rethink\u201d of Italy\u2019s relationship to the European Union and the common currency of most of its members, the euro.In a joint statement Tuesday night, they protested that the proposals in the leaked document had been \u201cradically changed\u201d in subsequent meetings. \u201cFor example, on the euro, the parties have already decided not to put in discussion the single currency,\u201d it said.That statement said they preferred to return to the arrangement before the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which created the framework and fiscal rules for the euro \u2014 a time when the Italian lira was the coin of the realm.\u201cThe structure of European economic governance, based on the dominance of the market, and the respect for rules that are stringent and unfounded from a social and economic point of view, requires a rethink with our European partners,\u201d they said. \u201cThe spirit must be to return to the pre-Maastricht setting.\u201dLeft unaddressed was the document\u2019s proposed request to the European Central Bank that it cancel 250 billion euros, or almost $300 billion, in Italian debt, which some analysts think violates a European Union treaty.The document showed that they would also like to revisit Italy\u2019s contributions to the European Union budget and protect Italian small businesses from the bloc\u2019s free market and expanded work-hour rules.The proper relationship with Europe has apparently been a sore spot between the parties, and between the parties and Mr. Mattarella, in this week\u2019s tense negotiations.As a result, either they form a government together or Italy will return to new election, probably in the fall.During the campaign and in the days of negotiations, Five Star had sought to ease concerns, perhaps including those of Mr. Mattarella, about their antagonism toward the European Union.But the leaked document, the authenticity of which has not been disputed, revealed that their anti-establishment and euroskeptic heart still pulsed.\u201cWe confirm our membership of the North Atlantic alliance, with the U.S. as a privileged ally and an opening to Russia, which should not be viewed as a threat but an economic and commercial partner,\u201d the document reads.As part of the immediate fallout, the spread between Italy\u2019s and Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yields grew.Mr. Salvini, speaking on Facebook live, relished the angst.Then he took aim at the elites in Washington, Berlin and Brussels, saying that he would ignore their concerns about the potential new Italian government and put Italians first.\u201cIf, in the little salons where they decided our children should live precariously and with fear, they are worried,\u201d he said, \u201cif these little salons who massacred our future are worried, it means that we are doing something right.\u201cThe more they insult us, the more they threaten us and the more they blackmail us, the more they make me want to take this challenge on,\u201d he said, adding that he and Mr. Di Maio had already agreed on a rollback of pension overhauls, fiscal reforms, the use of a flat tax and a universal basic income.He made the case that an interior minister from his party would slam shut the door for illegal immigrants, and speed up asylum requests in camps outside Italy.Speaking directly into the phone on a sunny field, Mr. Salvini showed a disposition remarkably sunnier than he had on Monday afternoon, when he suggested the fledgling alliance could be in peril.\u201cWe have taken big steps forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be crazy to fall in the moment of truth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Musk vs. Buffett: An Invitation for Investors to Take Sides", "Date": "2018-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElon Musk and Warren E. Buffett clashed over the weekend after Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, derided as lame Mr. Buffett\u2019s concept of companies having \u201cmoats\u201d to keep potential competitors at bay. When Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman, cited his confectionery maker, See\u2019s Candies, as proof to the contrary, Mr. Musk pledged to launch his own candy maker. It\u2019s an invitation for investors to take sides; many already have.For the 40,000 shareholders who flooded Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting on Saturday, Tesla looks like the epitome of a terrible investment. Mr. Buffett prizes companies with healthy management incentives, simple operations and little competition. Mr. Musk\u2019s electric-car maker flunks on all three counts.Take incentives. Mr. Musk is remunerated in part for pumping up Tesla\u2019s share price \u2014 his new 10-year bonus plan could net him $55.8 billion in stock if the company\u2019s market capitalization hits $650 billion and bull\u2019s-eyes certain revenue and profitability targets. Investors won\u2019t be complaining if he gets there, but it\u2019s an incentive to take huge risks. If the company misses those goals, or fails outright, Mr. Musk has other irons in the fire. He holds a significant stake in the rocket company SpaceX, recently valued in a private transaction at around $26 billion.The cultural divide is mirrored on the balance sheet: While Berkshire Hathaway holds $116 billion in cash, Tesla has just $2.7 billion in cash \u2014 roughly equivalent to one year\u2019s capital expenditure \u2014 yet is burning greenbacks and has $500 million in debt coming due in a few months.The Oracle of Omaha and the Playboy of Palo Alto have taken opposing positions before, including when Mr. Buffett\u2019s Nevada energy company clashed with Mr. Musk\u2019s solar-panel group SolarCity in 2016. Yet they share some common ground, too. Both think deeply about their customers. Mr. Musk often responds personally to Twitter requests \u2014 such as for a service center in Iceland or a hardtop convertible. He\u2019d probably agree with Mr. Buffett that thinking like a consumer is paramount.For now, at least, shareholders have Mr. Musk trailing Mr. Buffett. Tesla\u2019s highly volatile shares are down 4 percent over the past year, whereas Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s are up 19 percent. And investors have piled into short-selling Tesla, with almost one-quarter of the stock out on loan, according to Thomson Reuters data.Of course, Tesla doubters could end up burned if the shares rise in the short term, as Mr. Musk says they will. And Mr. Buffett himself doesn\u2019t bet against stocks falling. So buying Berkshire Hathaway and shorting Tesla makes ample sense for those who believe Mr. Buffett\u2019s teachings \u2014 but not those who actually copy him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fidelity, Bruised From Crises, Searches for Life After Mutual Funds", "Date": "2018-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Few star fund managers have shone brighter than Steven S. Wymer, who runs a portfolio of stocks at Fidelity Investments, the mutual-fund giant.His $42 billion fund, Fidelity Growth Company, has outpaced 97 percent of its rivals since 2008, making it one of the best performers in what is arguably the most competitive category for mutual funds.But here is the curious thing: Over that same period, investors have pulled $17 billion from the fund, taking out more money every year than they put in.In each of the last 10 years, Fidelity\u2019s fabled mutual funds have leaked money, no matter how well they have performed. It is one of the longest stretches of outflows in the company\u2019s 72-year history, the result of investors moving more heavily into cheaper index-tracking funds.And now, Fidelity finds itself contending not just with market forces but social forces. Two portfolio managers were forced to leave the company following accusations of sexual harassment and other misconduct, shaking the mutual-fund division and the company as a whole.Cleaning up the mess falls to one of the few women leading a major American financial institution: Abigail P. Johnson. As chairwoman and chief executive, Ms. Johnson must weigh whether Fidelity\u2019s once-dominant stock pickers are stuck in the past, in more ways than one.The granddaughter of Fidelity\u2019s founder, Edward C. Johnson II, Ms. Johnson joined the company in 1988 as an analyst in the mutual-fund division. The job was similar to the one her father, also named Edward, took in 1957, when he started on his own path to run the family firm.In those days, Fidelity\u2019s portfolio managers were the root of the firm\u2019s success. Men like Peter Lynch, the revered manager of Fidelity\u2019s Magellan fund, often became minor celebrities, popularizing the view that shrewd stock picking was the key to a comfortable retirement.Although Fidelity has been better than most financial institutions at offering prominent management roles to women \u2014 Kathleen Murphy heads the firm\u2019s personal investing unit, Nancy Prior is president of fixed income, and Pam Holding was recently appointed co-chief of Fidelity\u2019s trillion-dollar stock division \u2014 roughly 90 percent of the company\u2019s portfolio managers are men. That included Gavin Baker, a technology expert whom Fidelity fired late last year after harassment complaints from female employees. Mr. Baker has denied the accusations.Top executives have played down the severity of the harassment that reportedly took place. \u201cA couple of people did stupid things,\u201d Ms. Murphy said.Nonetheless, Ms. Johnson has started a broad review of the firm\u2019s culture. A sexual harassment response committee has been set up. The 800 men and women with investment roles \u2014 traders, analysts and portfolio managers \u2014 all have taken diversity training classes run by an outside consultant.Fidelity is also considering a move to a team-based system for picking stocks, instead of today\u2019s prevailing model: star fund managers, who are mostly male, supported by junior analysts, many of them female. The hope is that such an approach would encourage a more collaborative \u2014 and equitable \u2014 style of financial brainstorming.And then there is the challenge facing Fidelity\u2019s traditional funds business.Since 2010, investors have pulled $181 billion from Fidelity\u2019s actively managed mutual funds, according to Morningstar. Such funds have become less popular, especially among younger investors, who have flocked to lower-cost index funds.\u201cPeter Lynch captured the imagination of the American investing public in the late 1980s \u2014 and that was an incredibly powerful thing for us,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cToday, you are looking at a generation that is debt-heavy and wary of equities.\u201dMs. Johnson\u2019s goal is to persuade clients that Fidelity can administer assets as well as it can manage them. The company can no longer rely on baby boomers dialing an 800 number after seeing a newspaper ad featuring Mr. Lynch, she said.\u201cAssets under administration\u201d is a catchall term for money held in custody for brokers and hedge funds, the running of corporate retirement plans, savings overseen by investment advisers and the operation of a vast financial supermarket for independent financial institutions, large and small.It is dull but profitable. And once the money comes into Fidelity\u2019s possession, it tends to stay there, unlike the assets that flow in and out of its mutual funds.Since 2011, the nonmanaged money that Fidelity administers has doubled to $4.4 trillion. By comparison, the wealth in its mutual funds and other investment vehicles is up 58 percent to $2.4 trillion.At 56, Ms. Johnson is ranked by Forbes as the eighth-richest woman in the world, with a net worth of $14 billion. But like her father before her, she keeps a low public profile. In a 40-minute interview at Fidelity\u2019s headquarters here, held in the presence of two watchful public relations executives, she spoke cautiously, measuring every word.But she is unequivocal that the firm\u2019s identity is no longer shaped by the mutual-fund managers so exalted in an earlier era.\u201cWe need to figure out how to capture the imagination and attention of the next generation of investor,\u201d she said.Much of that attention remains focused on the 14th floor of the company\u2019s headquarters, where the stock pickers work.On a recent day, corporate entourages from around the world clutched their briefing books and suitcases, waiting to enter one of 26 conference rooms. Inside, they would face questioning from Fidelity analysts and fund managers about every aspect of their businesses.These days, though, these Fidelity managers are mostly anonymous.Take Mr. Wymer. His ability to sniff out technology winners like the chip-maker Nvidia, where he was an early investor, has given him one of the industry\u2019s best track records.Yet in mutual-fund circles he is virtually unknown, seldom seen on CNBC or in the financial media.Sitting in his small, cluttered office, Mr. Wymer had little interest in talking about himself or his successes.As for the eight years of outflows, he said they reflected aging customers cashing out and the fact that the fund had been closed to new investors since 2006. (Existing investors can continue to put money in.)But even Fidelity funds that are open to new investors, like its largest actively managed offering, the $124 billion Contrafund, are experiencing consistent outflows \u2014 $26.2 billion in the Contrafund alone since 2011, according to Morningstar.But Fidelity\u2019s growth no longer hinges on people buying mutual funds. Instead, it comes from corporations hiring Fidelity to oversee their 401(k) plans, wealthy investors handing their savings over to one of its financial advisers or fast-growing investment firms selecting it as their custodian.Fidelity is a private company, and it doesn\u2019t disclose much financial data. The limited information it does reveal makes clear that the boom in assets under administration has been driving the firm\u2019s profitability in recent years.Since 2014, Fidelity\u2019s revenue has increased to $18 billion from $14.9 billion and its operating profit to $5.3 billion from $3.4 billion. That profit is slightly more than BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, made last year.\u201cThe goal has always been to grow the business beyond the success of the active equity funds,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. \u201cThese businesses started small and we worked at them, and now they aren\u2019t so small anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Investment on Your Wrist", "Date": "2018-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersLike other men with a passion for watches, Cade Mlodinoff began his obsession by coveting one model. It was a Tag Heuer. It cost him $400 when he bought it at age 10.\u201cAt the time, it was every dime I had,\u201d said Mr. Mlodinoff, 33. \u201cMy obsession kind of grew from that.\u201dFor decades, watches have been symbols of luxury, wealth and personal taste. But their potential as investments is now more easily tracked and understood. You can credit technology for shining a light in dusty watch shops.But that\u2019s rarefied air.\u201cQuality vintage watches can be bought for a few thousand dollars,\u201d said John Reardon, the international head of the watches at Christie\u2019s. And the market for watches that cost less than $10,000 \u201cis one of the areas of most aggressive growth at the moment.\u201dUntil recently, collectible or vintage watches were generally bought at watch shops or through auction houses. Mr. Mlodinoff, who lives in Chicago, said he remembered going shop to shop, trying to find what he was looking for.\u201cThere was the Rolex guy, the Cartier guy, the Omega guy \u2014 that\u2019s what you did back in the day,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the disposable income for five or 50 watches. I had the income for one, two or three watches, so if I wanted something new, I sold something old.\u201dHe now has about 20 watches, but he is still selling as well as buying.\u201cWe\u2019re monetizing a wristwatch as if it\u2019s an asset,\u201d said Danny Govberg, the chief executive of WatchBox. \u201cWatches have an underlying value, just like a diamond. You can take a diamond anywhere in the world and sell it. We\u2019re creating a worldwide market for watches.\u201dMr. Govberg, whose family has been in the jewelry business for three generations, said certain watches trade like the most liquid of stocks. A Rolex Submariner is popular in new and vintage styles, so its price range is tight, he said. WatchBox recently had nine on offer, from $9,000 to $13,000.But markets for brands like Audemars Piguet or Breguet are not as fluid. Those companies make fewer watches, but their brands also lack the easy association with luxury that Rolex has.Mr. Govberg said part of his hope was to make markets for these and lesser-known watch brands. He wanted his site to serve as a platform to certify vintage watches, similar to the way a luxury automaker sells certified pre-owned models of its cars.Its fee for doing this varies depending on the watch. But Mr. Govberg said if he bought a Rolex for $8,500, he\u2019d sell it for about $10,000.\u201cWe\u2019re basically saying we are going to value these timepieces and support the prices of them,\u201d Mr. Govberg said. \u201cBut we\u2019re also going to resell them at a high standard, not like it\u2019s some flea market.\u201dWhen it comes to watches as investments, the market is dominated by two brands: Rolex and Patek Philippe. But that does not mean all of their watches are great investments.Rolex watches span the gamut from affordable to exclusive, starting at less than $6,000 and soaring to limited-edition models that cost more than $300,000. It\u2019s like the range of Mercedes cars between a basic C Class sedan, which has no rarity value, and a more coveted AMG Cabriolet that tops $300,000.\u201cRolex has become a cultural symbol and a status symbol,\u201d said Benjamin Clymer, founder and chief executive of Hodinkee. \u201cThe quality you receive in a Rolex is above most other watches at that price point.\u201dPatek has invested heavily in marketing campaigns that focus on its watches as heirlooms. But Mr. Clymer said the brand does not translate immediately into appreciation.He said that the company\u2019s signature watch, the Calatrava, which costs about $20,000, is like any new car. \u201cIf you bought it and tried to sell it the next day, you\u2019d take a bath,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not always great investments, but there is a track record for them becoming great investments,\u201d he said of the Patek Philippe timepieces.Discerning the investment potential of watches can be as complex as the intricate machinery that runs them.\u201cThings can change very rapidly in the watch world, the way they can with other investments,\u201d said Daryn Schnipper, chairwoman of Sotheby\u2019s international watch division. \u201cOne of the things I suspect people should be tuned into is production quantities and trends of a company \u2014 is it a solid company or a new company?\u201dAs with most investments, she said, supply drives watch prices. For instance, new Rolex Daytonas are not easy to find, so the price for vintage ones has ticked up.Watches that are known beyond aficionados have a tendency to increase in value, Mr. Clymer said. Mr. Newman\u2019s Rolex Daytona is one. The Omega Speedmaster, which astronauts wore on the Apollo 11 moon mission, is another.\u201cThat Speedmaster has a place in world history,\u201d he said.But sometimes the high prices that watches fetch have as much to do with luck as anything else.At a recent Sotheby\u2019s auction in Geneva, Ms. Schnipper had a Rolex Daytona with a dial that had faded to a brownish color, an aging process that results in a rare \u201ctropical dial.\u201d The person who had consigned it paid less than $200 for it in the 1970s. Ms. Schnipper expected the watch to fetch $200,000 to $400,000; it went for $950,000 with the auction fee. A regular Daytona from that time would sell for around $150,000.Dave Terry, a watch collector and chief executive of Hub International Insurance Brokers, tries not to get swayed by auction prices.He said he focuses on collecting four brands: Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and F. P. Journe, which he thinks will hold their value. He tracks the values of many models in different conditions on a variety of sites and at auction to get a sense of their worth, but he believes the value at auction is not always accurate.\u201cYou get a bunch of boys in a room with testosterone who\u2019ve had a few drinks and they can bid up a watch,\u201d he said.As Mr. Mlodinoff bought and sold watches over the past decade, he experienced both the highs and lows of the investments.On the plus side, he has an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, a large sports watch that he bought three years ago for $23,000. He believes the model he has is worth about $30,000 because the demand for the watch has remained strong.Yet seven years ago, he bought an IWC Big Pilot\u2019s Watch for $40,000. He said it\u2019s probably worth half that much today.\u201cIf we\u2019d had this conversation back then, I\u2019d say it was a historical watch,\u201d Mr. Mlodinoff said before listing his reasons for buying it: \u201cIt was a reissue in a precious metal, they only made 500 of them, it\u2019s going to be super valuable.\u201dSo what happened? He said the company had made too many of them. \u201cThey kept doing different limited editions, and that hurt the market for it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where I learned I\u2019m not the smartest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gross, Revered Fund Manager, Is Having a Year to Forget", "Date": "2018-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam H. Gross, one of the world\u2019s best-known investors, is having a very bad year.There was an acrimonious divorce. And now he is getting pummeled in the markets.On Tuesday, the mutual fund that he runs at Janus dropped 3 percent \u2014 an extraordinary one-day decline for a bond fund. Mr. Gross had been betting that interest rates on German and American government bonds would rise, but fears that Italy could leave the eurozone have prompted investors to seek safety in those bonds, increasing their prices and pushing down their yields.That left his fund, the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, down 6 percent for the year. It now ranks at the bottom of its category of similar funds for this year as compiled by the investment research firm Morningstar.Bond funds like Mr. Gross\u2019s aren\u2019t supposed to lose 3 percent in a day or 6 percent in half a year. Compared with their counterparts that invest in the stock market, bond funds are generally considered safer and more stable places for investors to park their money.Years after the eurozone debt crisis, Mr. Gross apparently didn\u2019t anticipate the return of political and financial turmoil. But the possibility that a populist government in Italy could try to pull out of the common currency raised questions about the safety of the country\u2019s government bonds and sent global bond markets on a roller coaster.But it isn\u2019t just the European uncertainty that is ravaging Mr. Gross\u2019s fund, which invests in derivatives and other complex financial instruments as well as traditional corporate and government bonds. He has long been known for his bets that markets would remain mostly calm, and his portfolio has also taken a hit from recent volatility, which was ignited in February by the expectation that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates faster and further than anticipated.It has been a steep fall for Mr. Gross, who was once the undisputed king of bonds. He popularized the concept of bond funds for the everyday investor, a shift from the days when retail investors dabbled only in stocks. He helped found Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, and his main fund, Pimco Total Return, managed $292 billion. It was the largest fund of its kind in the world.Approaching his 70s and with a net worth of more than $2 billion, Mr. Gross might well have opted for retirement then. Instead he chose revenge.Mr. Gross set up shop at Janus, a competing fund company, in an office with a full view of his former employer\u2019s building in Newport Beach, Calif.His new fund was a fraction of the size, with $2 billion in assets. And a substantial portion of that was Mr. Gross\u2019s personal money. But it was enough for him to do daily battle with a rival fund at Pimco.At the time his returns were superior, by quite a margin.But not anymore: Over the past three years, a similar Pimco fund is up 10 percent. Mr. Gross\u2019s offering is up just 1 percent, according to YCharts, a data provider.All of this is happening as Mr. Gross\u2019s personal life has been unraveling because of a contentious divorce with his ex-wife, Sue.For years, Mr. Gross would cite the 31-year marriage in his quirky investment letters, a down-home touch that endeared him to his loyal following of investors.In the 2016 interview with The Times, he talked of kissing his wife each day upon his return from work.Just a few months later, Ms. Gross moved out of the mansion they shared on top of a bluff in Laguna Beach. She cited her husband\u2019s \u201cirrational and frightening behavior,\u201d according to court papers.In November 2016, she filed for divorce. The split was finalized last October.During that personal turbulence, Mr. Gross sought refuge in trying to divine the ups and downs of the bond market.Even so, court documents from the divorce proceedings, filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles, suggest that his legal fights have taken their toll. He complained of being on edge, short on sleep and rattled. \u201cMy peace of mind has been severely disturbed,\u201d he said.But there was no sign that the man who brought bond investing to the masses, now 74, would call it quits.\u201cAlthough I am 73,\u201d he said in a filing last year, \u201cI still work full time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the late 1930s theft was almost entirely associated with the poor. As he saw it, his fellow sociologists had come to the conclusion that crime was a result of \u201cfeeblemindedness, psychopathic deviations, slum neighborhoods and \u2018deteriorated\u2019 families\u201d; it was believed that less than 2 percent of crime came from members of the upper echelons of society. But Sutherland believed this outlook was not only biased, but blinkered, failing to take into account theft that was taking place in plain sight. \u201cThe \u2018robber barons\u2019 of the last half of the 19th century were white-collar criminals,\u201d he told the crowd of the American Sociological Society in 1939, recounting the time Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt more or less confessed that his family wealth was ill gotten, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes, do you?\u201dAccording to people on both sides of the law, today, thanks to the internet and tax havens, it is even easier for white-collar crime to slip under the radar: Cash is stashed in untouchable island accounts; corporate checks can be forged and deposited; money laundering takes the form of a prepaid debit card; insider trading is just a conversation over cocktails. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn just how simple it is to rob and steal while maintaining a veneer of respectability.Checks can be useful tools when it comes to engaging in both corporate theft and what are called account takeovers. Each requires a basic understanding of forgery. To steal from a business, says Frank Abagnale, whose criminal exploits inspired the movie \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d the best forgers \u201ccapture a corporate logo and maybe the front of the building \u2014 layer it in the background, and you can make a check 10 times better looking than the actual check.\u201d Then they call the company and ask to speak to someone in accounts receivable. After they explain that they want to pay an invoice by wiring money to the institution, they are told where it does its banking and are given its routing and account numbers. They add that information to the fake check.Next they find someone in corporate communications to give them a press statement, which will include the signature of the C.E.O. or C.F.O. They scan the document and print the signature onto the check. It is not likely be scrutinized unless the amount is more than $2,000. \u201cNo human being sees the check \u2014 it goes through a high-speed processor,\u201d Abagnale says. For the last 40 years, he has been a consultant to financial institutions and government agencies, telling them how to combat forgery. Around 17 billion checks, with a value of roughly $27 trillion, were written in 2015, according to the Federal Reserve.Another, more common way to use checks fraudulently is to take over an individual\u2019s account. \u201cLet\u2019s say you gave me a check for $9,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAll I would do is go to checksinthemail.com \u2014 they have every style of check you can imagine.\u201d It\u2019s possible for fraudsters to match the style of check they\u2019ve been given \u2014 to duplicate the trees in the background, say \u2014 and then to order with a different name on the check along with the bank account information of the unsuspecting person. When the other person\u2019s bank receives those checks, it will debit that account. The swindler can pay rent and credit-card bills or visit a local check-cashing operation and walk away with thousands of dollars. \u201cIt\u2019s months later that anyone would discover it,\u201d Abagnale says. \u201cAnd the bank is responsible for paying both parties even if the business files a complaint within 30 days.\u201dScammers have long mounted schemes to pressure gullible customers to buy assets, especially penny stocks, with promises of hot tips and inside information. But today, the pump-and-dump playbook is being applied to the new frontier of cryptocurrency. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing in the virtual-currency space is an application of these old schemes to new conduct,\u201d says James McDonald, the director of enforcement for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. What pump-and-dump schemes need is a thinly traded market where a price swing is easy to manipulate and disproportionately large compared with how little the asset costs. \u201cIf I buy a hundred shares of Apple, that\u2019s not going to move the price,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a new currency, if I buy a hundred tokens or shares, that could be 50 percent of the trading for that day. If it was trading at 10 cents, that could triple the price or more.\u201dThe scammers begin by investing a large sum in a currency that is relatively unknown. Then they spread misinformation on social media, claiming, say, that a famous investor like Warren Buffett is investing in the currency. They might post false news articles that say it has been granted a line of credit by bank or a company like Mastercard, and then circulate links to the fake news on social media \u2014 spreading the news on Twitter accounts known to promote stocks, for example. It\u2019s a risk if the stories are too appealing. An article claiming that the Fed chairman is endorsing an unknown currency for the Reserve or that the United States is going to use a specific coin will not be believed.Scammers often cultivate an online identity on Twitter or Facebook that becomes known for specializing in recommending currencies or stock picks \u2014 then recommend the one they want to pump up and wait for followers to buy it. \u201cThen you have trading that corroborates the misinformation,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cYou get the false reports, the currency spikes and then it looks believable.\u201d Monitoring the enthusiasm for the currency, they sell when it seems to be at a peak. Because they hold the majority of the currency, its price will plummet once they dump the holdings. \u201cThis can happen in a matter of minutes,\u201d he says.People who want to keep their money away from the tax collector will move it to a foreign country. Those who are rich enough will hardly even have to seek out such a tax haven \u2014 the opportunities will come to them. \u201cWhen you have more than $20 million, then you\u2019re going to start being targeted by these financial institutions \u2014 you will be invited to sporting events like golf or galas,\u201d says Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of \u201cThe Hidden Wealth of Nations.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t sell in an aggressive way, but they will talk about legal tax immunization and strategies.\u201dUntil the financial crash in 2008, according to Zucman\u2019s research, Switzerland controlled approximately 50 percent of the \u201coffshore\u201d accounts used by the world\u2019s wealthiest; today that figure is roughly 25 percent. More wealth is now stored in Asia: Singapore and Hong Kong are home to 30 percent of offshore accounts in use, while the rest are in the Caribbean, Panama and Europe.A lawyer or financial adviser can set up a shell corporation. \u201cThere are intermediaries \u2014 law firms that can connect people to banks, and they supply these anonymous shell companies,\u201d Zucman says. Once the shell company is established, it will send an invoice for phony services like investment advice. Payment for these services then goes to the offshore bank account attached to the shell company. The resulting paper trail looks legitimate.Zucman estimates that an amount equivalent to 8 percent of the world\u2019s household financial wealth is held, untaxed, in offshore accounts \u2014 around $8.6 trillion in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of opacity,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see all this wealth that belongs on paper, and authorities don\u2019t have a good way to pierce this veil of secrecy. They rely on the good will of bankers, which is not sufficient.\u201dAccessing money in an offshore account is as easy as using a debit card from the offshore bank or taking out a loan in the United States against the assets held abroad. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show up,\u201d Zucman says. \u201cIt can all be done remotely.\u201dEmployees at publicly held companies often possess something quite valuable to outside investors: knowledge about their employers\u2019 prospects beyond what has been issued in news releases. Those who would share \u2014 and perhaps illegally profit from \u2014 this intelligence in order to play the stock market know to circulate among their company\u2019s various departments, says Roomy Khan, a former analyst at Intel who went to prison for passing nonpublic information to Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder and former chief of the Galleon Group hedge fund and others.\u201cI was always trying to make connections in the company\u2019s finance department and the marketing chain,\u201d Khan says. \u201cIn sales they know what the bookings are; in marketing they know what people are looking for.\u201d Because Intel controlled nearly 90 percent of the PC market for microchips when she was there, the intelligence gathering she did for Rajaratnam gave him the ability to predict the fortunes of Intel and the entire PC market.When it comes to buying or selling stocks based on those predictions, insider traders must avoid being consistently accurate. Too many on-the-spot and out-of-the-ordinary trades that are correct can raise flags. \u201cThe government spots insider traders,\u201d says Khan, who now gives speeches to companies about the dangers of insider trading. The feds aren\u2019t the only ones monitoring unusual trades. Companies can get in trouble if they have too many leaks, and so can investment funds if they act on them, so both types of businesses are looking out for suspicious activity.Social and professional circles can be used to draw out information from anyone willing to share secret details of products or strategies. \u201cLet\u2019s say Samsung was having battery issues, and if my friend said something about the issues, I would start probing him. I know what the market is looking for,\u201d Khan says. \u201cI would ask more and more detailed questions.\u201d Manipulation is the key to gaining confidential information, but insider traders try to be casual and friendly; people are more easily persuaded to share if they are made to feel powerful, wanted and included in the upper echelons of financial society. Khan says: \u201cI used my lifestyle, my success, the trappings of success.\u201dIllegal enterprises seek every possible way to get their cash back into circulation. To launder this dirty money in the United States requires them to \u201cstructure\u201d their deposits of ill-gotten cash. Banks are required to report transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash, so their deposits need to be much smaller than that. \u201cCriminals understand that U.S. banking laws have become a lot stricter in the last several years,\u201d says Adam Braverman, United States attorney for the Southern District of California. \u201cThey used to deposit $9,999 in 10 or 20 different banks. Now we look for those suspicious activities.\u201d Would-be launderers try to avoid triggering the software banks use to maintain anti-money-laundering controls by varying their deposits by amount, location \u2014 both geographically and institutionally \u2014 and even timing.Prepaid debit cards like Green Dot offer more anonymous (and less labor-intensive) means of working dirty money into the system. \u201cA new way organizations launder money is by purchasing gift cards or debit cards that they can resell and transfer money easily,\u201d Braverman says. Because anyone can buy such cards at a drugstore, for example, they\u2019re harder to trace than bank deposits, which require accounts. Purchasers still need to limit how much they put on debit cards to less than $10,000.If launderers want to do things the old-fashioned way, they can smuggle cash across a border. It\u2019s best to vacuum-seal it or pack it with plastic wrap to reduce the bulk \u2014 a million dollars can take up a lot of space \u2014 and hire a courier to transport it in duffel bags to a country with lax banking laws. Once the money is in, say, a South American location where that\u2019s the case, dollars can be exchanged for the local currency at a casa de cambio.The United Nations estimates that up to $1.6 trillion is laundered annually worldwide. Pop culture would have us believe that cash-driven businesses like strip clubs, car washes and casinos are the best places to clean up money. Dealing with the burden of running a legitimate business and paying actual taxes is anything but easy money.It\u2019s pricey, it\u2019s portable, its users need it constantly, and retailers love to buy it at a discount. All of which makes it a perfect product to steal.Insys Therapeutics paid millions of dollars to doctors. The company called it a \u201cspeaker program,\u201d but prosecutors now call it something else: a kickback scheme.In 2016, a mysterious syndicate tried to steal $951 million from Bangladesh\u2019s central bank - and laid bare a profound weakness in the system by which money moves around the world.When the Iowa attorney general\u2019s office began investigating an unclaimed lottery ticket worth millions, an incredible string of unlikely winners came to light - and a trail that pointed to an inside job.How the biggest scammers get away with it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Italy\u2019s Political Turmoil Is Causing Financial Angst Elsewhere", "Date": "2018-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s political convulsions have raised new fears about the future of the euro, the single currency of the European Union that was introduced 16 years ago.The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.Here is a look at why the fears could escalate into a major crisis, and what it could mean for Italy, the euro, Europe and the world.Italians have actually been talking about the euro since they began using it in 2002. For years, they have complained that their spending power has diminished under the euro. But the populists who did well in the election also say euro membership has subverted Italy\u2019s sovereignty \u2014 an increasingly resonant theme in the country.Before Italy adopted the euro, it had the power to raise or lower interest rates to affect the value of its currency \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economic competitiveness. A cheaper lira made Italian exports more affordable in other countries, strengthening the economy at home. But under the euro system, Italy \u2014 like all members of the eurozone \u2014 has no control over interest rates, which are set by the European Central Bank.The two parties that won the March 4 elections, the Five Star Movement and the League, have expressed hostility toward rules that govern the 28-nation European Union and the 19 members that have adopted the euro.Italy was one of the euro\u2019s founding members, and its economy is one of the largest in Europe, dwarfing that of Greece. An Italian exit could cause severe economic disruptions internationally and subvert investor confidence far beyond Italy and Europe. Interest rates could spike all over the world, reflecting a rising atmosphere of risk.The euro, on the other hand, has fared better in Italian public opinion, partly because of the financial convenience it has created. \u201cThe euro is a tight fit. Italians aren\u2019t happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean they want to go,\u201d said Maurizio Pessato, president of the polling firm SWG.The country\u2019s Democratic Party, the biggest loser in the last elections, has never questioned belonging to the eurozone.Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and center-right politician who still wields major political influence, has delivered a mixed message.But his off-again-on-again partner in the center-right bloc, Matteo Salvini, has campaigned for years against a single currency and is known to wear shirts printed with \u201cBasta Euro\u201d \u2014 \u201cEnough with the Euro.\u201d His party, the League, has called for a vast overhaul of the treaties that regulate eurozone membership.For years, the Five Star Movement promulgated euro-skepticism, and initially promised a nonbinding referendum on the euro. That stance softened when it became clear that many investors feared a euro exit. On Monday, the party\u2019s leader, Luigi Di Maio, said his party had never supported leaving the euro. Still, the party wants Italy to have more sovereignty in economic choices.Experts are debating how that would be possible. Italy would have to change some articles of its Constitution, which is deeply intertwined with European principles, and draft a constitutional law. A referendum could be called.Even if Italians voted to exit the euro, the procedure could be lengthy and messy. Experts say that Italy would need to stop economic and banking activities for months to avoid speculation. Financial analysts say it is probable that many investors would avoid Italy.Just the possibility of an Italian government skeptical of the euro has created financial market volatility that could indirectly lead to problems in Italy, one of Europe\u2019s most indebted countries. If volatility continues, Italy may have difficulty selling government bonds that are used to pay its debts and finance salaries and pensions. The only solution would be a rescue from European Union financial authorities, with the acceptance of the same kind of austerity requirements imposed on Greece.Many experts agree that Italy would be poorer, with uncertain economic prospects for years. Italy would likely default on its debts, and its replacement currency would be greatly devalued. A default could lead to retaliation from other countries, asset freezes abroad and economic isolation. Italy sells more than half its goods within the European Union.Financial markets and speculators might see the euro as an untrustworthy currency, throwing into doubt the premise of stability and strength its founders envisioned. The effects could corrode confidence in the European Union itself.\u201cThe contagion would be enormous,\u201d said Massimo Bordignon, professor of economics at Milan\u2019s Catholic University. \u201cAnd the cost for Italy and for the other European countries would also be enormous.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Also, we answer your question about investing, not just divesting, to make a difference.In the Arctic Ocean, some ice stays frozen year-round, lasting more than a decade before melting. This multiyear ice is considered one way to determine the region\u2019s climate health, because older ice tends to be thicker and more resistant to melting. But this winter, the region hit a record low for ice older than five years.And as darker, heat-absorbing water replaces reflective ice, it hastens warming in the region.Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has just wrapped up fielding questions from lawmakers about allegations of ethical abuses and excessive spending.The hearing, before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, was Mr. Pruitt\u2019s third congressional appearance in a month. It was the first opportunity, though, for senators to ask Mr. Pruitt about his stewardship of the agency. His earlier appearances were in the House.Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the full appropriations committee, did not hold back, calling Mr. Pruitt \u201ca laughingstock.\u201dHere are the highlights from Wednesday\u2019s hearing.And here is some of our recent reporting on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s activities at the E.P.A.:Pruitt\u2019s Dinner With Cardinal Accused of Abuse Was Kept Off Public SchedulePruitt\u2019s Plan for Climate Change Debates: Ask Conservative Think TanksNew Files Shed Light on the Day Guards Smashed Scott Pruitt\u2019s DoorNew Files Detail the Threats Made Against Scott Pruitt at the E.P.A.E.P.A.

To what extent are they taking the important next step, reinvesting in clean energy and energy efficiency stocks?\u201d\u201cWe felt the investment side of the equation had to be much more explicit,\u201d said Ellen Dorsey, executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, the private philanthropy that helped found DivestInvest.More than 850 organizations and nearly 60,000 individuals have aligned themselves with the movement\u2019s goals, and 170 foundations have pledged to devote at least 5 percent of their portfolios to areas like renewable and clean technologies, energy efficiency and sustainable energy access for the developing world. Together, the organizations and individuals have assets under management totaling $6 trillion.Still, in many ways, the market is driving investors toward renewable sources of energy as fossil fuels like coal and tar sands decline in value. And companies are taking actions to support environmental goals that go beyond investing for profit, as Apple and other companies have done by committing to using only renewable sources of energy.In other words, things are happening.

{"Headline": "Bond Market Indicates Doubt About Trump\u2019s Economic Targets", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a candidate, President Trump said he would increase United States economic growth to 4 percent annually \u2014 and in one debate even added, \u201cI think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.\u201dOnce he was in the White House, his administration revised those projections lower, saying its approach \u201cmeans sustained 3 percent economic growth.\u201dAfter the economy grew by 2.3 percent in 2017, investors in some of the world\u2019s largest markets are betting that the United States will continue to fall short of the White House goal.The Federal Reserve has started raising short-term interest rates to reflect the economy\u2019s recovery, but longer-term rates \u2014 over which the Fed traditionally has far less influence \u2014 have not moved nearly as much. To many in the bond markets, that suggests investors think little has changed about long-term growth prospects.\u201cThey\u2019re not expecting growth to move up to 3 percent on a sustained basis,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for inflation to break out in any meaningful way on a sustained basis. It\u2019s not ominous. But it does sort of confirm that investors are still seeing the world in that way.\u201dThat does not mean the United States is about to enter a recession. By most measures, the economy is in fairly good shape as the current expansion \u2014 the second-longest on record \u2014 stretches into its ninth year. At 3.9 percent, unemployment hasn\u2019t been this low since 2000. Corporate profits are strong. Manufacturing activity has picked up.But with rates in Fed-sensitive short-term government bond markets rising while longer-term rates are relatively flat, the gap between them has narrowed. And the plotting of those data points, known as the yield curve, occupies an outsize space in the minds of those who consider the markets a crucial barometer of economic health.The gap between short-term and long-term rates tends to shrink \u2014 a phenomenon known as flattening \u2014 whenever the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates, which the Fed started doing in December 2015. Over the last year, the gap between interest rates on 10-year and two-year Treasuries flattened from more than 1 percentage point to less than half a percentage point, its lowest point in more than a decade.But as the yield curve flattens, long-term interest rates run the risk of falling below short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. And when the yield curve inverts, as it did most recently in 2006-7, it amounts to an economic warning from the financial markets to watch out: Recession is on the way.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re getting progressively closer,\u201d said Steven Abrahams, head of investment strategy at the broker dealer Amherst Pierpont. \u201cAnd I think we will get closer, faster than the market currently anticipates.\u201dIn a speech last month, the San Francisco Federal Reserve president, John Williams, described an inverted yield curve as \u201ca powerful signal of recessions.\u201dIn part, that\u2019s because the yield curve is more than just an economic indicator. It actually helps determine decisions that are crucial to the health of the American economy. That\u2019s because a flattening yield curve makes banking \u2014 basically the business of borrowing money at low short-term rates, and lending it at higher long-term rates \u2014 less profitable. If the yield curve inverts, it effectively slams the doors on lending. And because debt is the fuel that drives the economy\u2019s engine, a recession often follows.Mr. Williams emphasizes that he does not see an inverted yield curve, or recession, coming any time soon. And most economists agree. Over the next few years, private forecasters see United States economic growth peaking at 2.8 percent in 2018 before slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019 and 1.9 percent in 2020, according to Bloomberg data. That\u2019s a bit faster than the 2.2 percent growth rate of the United States economy since 2012.But it\u2019s basically the same as the 2.6 percent average growth rate since 1980, suggesting that the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law by Mr. Trump in December is expected to have a negligible effect on long-term economic growth. Doing better would depend on increasing the supply of workers and raising productivity, a poorly understood process generally thought to depend on making large-scale investments in things like education, infrastructure and expensive equipment for companies.Not everyone agrees that the bond market is sending a warning sign. For much of the last decade, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been buying government bonds with the aim of pushing interest rates lower to support economic growth.So the relatively low long-term rates partly reflect the large bond holdings of central banks, said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. That means those low rates contain \u201cmuch less of a signal about negative growth in the future,\u201d Mr. Luzzetti said.But some view the flattening of the yield as a sign that the economy is weaker than it might appear.Hoisington Investment Management, a bond investment firm based in Austin, Tex., has long held the view that long-term interest rates will go lower. Its chief economist, Lacy Hunt, ticked off a list of current trouble spots: slowing auto sales, skimpy inflation-adjusted wage growth, low savings rates and sluggish construction.\u201cThere are signs out there, they don\u2019t receive much attention,\u201d said Mr. Hunt, whose firm manages more than $4 billion for insurance companies, nonprofit organizations and pension plans. \u201cBut the flattening of the yield curve is an indication that there is a body of people that do think the future outlook is not nearly as good as the current conditions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Tesla Seems Worried It\u2019s Consuming Too Much Cash: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s plan to cut back on capital expenditures.\u2022 Why Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors.\u2022 Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\u2022 How activist investors shook Xerox.Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car.Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries.While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to \u201csignificantly cut back\u201d the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash.Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it\u2019s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers.In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in.But the company is running out of room for maneuver. Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.Analysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.-- Peter EavisTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.But Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year. That, of course, came with a major caveat: Tesla achieving its latest goals for Model 3 production, which is well behind schedule.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Tesla\u2019s net loss increased to $784.6 million from a loss of $397.2 million a year ago.\u2022 Tesla\u2019s adjusted loss per share came in at $3.35. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a loss per share of $3.58.\u2022 Revenue climbed to $3.41 billion, topping analyst expectations of $3.28 billion.Shares had run up 3 percent in regular trading on Wednesday, and analysts said investor expectations may have been overblown and voiced concerns that discounts were eating into the company\u2019s average revenue per user.Here\u2019s a look at the numbers:\u2022 Spotify reported a first-quarter loss of \u20ac169 million ($202 million), or \u20ac1.01 a share, from \u20ac173 million, or \u20ac1.15, in the same period a year earlier.\u2022 Spotify posted a first-quarter operating loss of 41 million euros, a sharp improvement from a loss of 139 million euros a year ago\u2022 Revenue rose 26 percent to 1.139 billion euros. Analysts had expected 1.143 billion euros.\u2022 Monthly active users increased 30 percent from a year ago to 170 million.\u2022 Paid subscribers rose 45 percent from a year ago to 75 million.\u2022 Average revenue per user fell to 4.72 euros from 5.32 euros in 2017.\u2022 Gross margins were 24.9 percent.What is in the executive order, which could be released within days:\u2022 It is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China\u2019s most prominent technology firms.\u2022 Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology.\u2022 On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said it was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.As expected, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.The central bank acknowledged rising inflation but provided little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.Perhaps the biggest change to the Fed policy statement was the use of the word \u201csymmetric\u201d to describe its inflation target.\u201cThe Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.\u201d\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201dApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.Apple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.Apple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.Apple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\u2014 Peter EavisMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.But investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.Here\u2019s what to watch:\u2022 Any new signs of officials expressing concern about an acceleration in prices. Investors would likely interpret any new worries about inflation to mean the pace of rate hikes could quicken.\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d said Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive.Critics\u2019 cornerRoss Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes that there was little positive to point to in Snap\u2019s first-quarter results.\u201cSNAP remains a volatile story and execution since the I.P.O. has been less than desirable (outside of 4Q17), but we think a lot of the problems around pricing and Android may start to resolve in 2H.\u201d\u201c1Q:18 miss and forward ad commentary speak to continued challenges SNAP faces in turning its business model around.\u201dSam Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said:\u201cSnap is a poorly structured company that is demonstrating a clear pattern of mismanagement.\u201dXerox chose to settle with the activists after a judge last week temporarily blocked the Fujifilm transaction, siding with Mr. Deason in a lawsuit and saying the talks were conflicted by Mr. Jacobson\u2019s tenuous position. Seeking a settlement would avoid a distracting fight over its board and uncertainty about the future of the deal, Xerox\u2019s existing board said Tuesday.The fight may not be over: Fujifilm said today that it\u2019s appealing the injunction.\u2022 The Justice Department, which has been harder than expected on M.&A., will assess whether consumers face higher prices.\u2022 The F.C.C. will consider whether it\u2019s in the national interest to let the national wireless market shrink from four providers to three.\u2022 Cfius will rule on how the deal might affect national security.The F.C.C. chairman has sounded warm about consolidation, and controlling shareholders of both companies have passed Cfius reviews before. But regulatory approval is still an open question, and Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s share prices reflect that.Next stop: The judge in The Weinstein Company\u2019s will decide whether to approve Lantern\u2019s deal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italian President\u2019s Loyalty to the Euro Creates Chaos", "Date": "2018-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 He\u2019s been called \u201cgray,\u201d \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cgentle to the point of seeming fragile.\u201d Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, once compared him to \u201ca monk.\u201dMr. Mattarella\u2019s defenders hailed him as the courageous protector of Italy\u2019s democracy, institutions and financial health, while fuming populists sought to make the usually revered figure of the Italian head of state the country\u2019s public enemy No. 1. They called for his impeachment, saying he had overstepped his constitutional bounds with delusions of grandeur, blocked the will of the people and destroyed Italian democracy.In response, Mr. Mattarella privately plugged along.On Monday morning, as markets rose and fell with the whiplashing events in Italy, Mr. Mattarella gave a new mandate to form a government to Carlo Cottarelli, a respected economist, former International Monetary Fund official and Italian government appointee, who told reporters that he would form a caretaker government only with the goal of passing a budget and guiding Italy to new elections.If Parliament votes in support of his caretaker government, elections would take place in early 2019. If it does not, which seems much more likely, he would quit \u201cimmediately\u201d and elections would take place sometime after August.Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s main goal in speaking on Monday seemed to be to assure nervous investors in Italy and abroad that the country was in good hands. He guaranteed, \u201cin the most absolute way, that a government led by me would assure a cautious management of our national accounts,\u201d and that Italy\u2019s \u201ccontinuous participation in the eurozone\u201d was essential.It was Mr. Mattarella\u2019s loyalty to the euro that prompted the 11th-hour collapse of the nascent government of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League.He determined that the alliance\u2019s proposed economy minister, Paolo Savona, the co-author of a guide to leaving the eurozone, could lead Italy to abandon the euro without sufficient public debate, being that the parties maintained vague and shifting positions on the issue during the campaign leading up to the March 4 elections.But in deliberately forcing a new election over the euro, which a majority of Italians say they support, the usually careful and measured Mr. Mattarella expressly put an explosive issue with the potential of transforming Europe front and center. And by using his constitutional powers to block the new government in order to protect Italian savings accounts from increasingly wary markets, he also handed the gifted and gleefully hostile populist parties the talking point of a lifetime before the elections.The coming vote \u201cwill be a referendum on Europe, on the euro and on the Italian constitutional model,\u201d Francesco Verderami, a political analyst, wrote in Corriere della Sera on Monday. \u201cBecause it is equally clear that the presidency of the republic \u2014 which has been threatened with impeachment \u2014 during the electoral campaign is sure to be one of the targets of the populist and nationalist forces.\u201dIt did not take long for that to come to pass.Luigi Di Maio, Five Star\u2019s political leader, called on party members to demonstrate their opposition to Mr. Mattarella and \u201cthe darkest night of Italian democracy\u201d by hanging Italian flags out their windows, marching in the streets and flooding the social networks where the party developed its support.In a Facebook post, Mr. Di Maio said that Mr. Mattarella had prompted problems in the markets by creating uncertainty. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave the euro,\u201d he insisted, calling the party\u2019s well-documented ambivalence to the common currency \u201ca lie created by the counselors of Mattarella.\u201dOn Monday, several analysts and politicians accused Mr. Salvini, who rebuffed Mr. Mattarella\u2019s appeal to substitute the proposed economy minister with a top League official, of purposely blowing up the government in order to bank increased electoral support in new elections. He wants to be prime minister.Leading members of the Five Star Movement proclaimed the new technical government dead on arrival and said they would introduce impeachment proceedings against Mr. Mattarella in Parliament.But their efforts to intimidate Mr. Mattarella last week, saying he should not get in the way of Italian voters, failed. Some supporters argued that the potential blowback and risk in coming elections was worth keeping the populists, who have shown disregard for Italian institutions, away from power.Mario Calabrese, the editor of the left-leaning daily La Repubblica, wrote in a front-page editorial, \u201cIf the president had given in, folding before the ultimatums and threats, and if he went back on his only objection, the state\u2019s checks and balances would have broken into pieces.\u201dMr. Berlusconi, the former prime minister and coalition partner of Mr. Salvini, also gave his support to Mr. Mattarella, saying the Five Star Movement was \u201cirresponsible as always, talking about impeachment.\u201d\u201cForza Italia waits for the determination of the head of state, but when necessary will be ready for the vote,\u201d he added, referring to his party.Both he and the Five Star Movement unveiled campaign language in which they accused Italy of being held hostage by Germany, international markets, bankers and the overreaching president who did their bidding.Constitutional scholars debated on Monday whether Mr. Mattarella was within his rights. In Corriere della Sera, Italy\u2019s leading paper, Massimo Luciani, a professor of constitutional law at La Sapienza University in Rome, said Mr. Mattarella \u201cexercised his constitutional rights\u201d because he \u201cbelieved that the choice of a certain minister for a key government position put the interests of our country at risk.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis is an institutional evaluation.\u201dBut Paolo Flores D\u2019Arcais wrote in the political magazine MicroMega that while the president can object to the appointment of a minister if \u201che finds in the candidate\u2019s past behavior something that conflicts with honorability,\u201d Mr. Mattarella\u2019s problem with the economy minister was his position on the euro.\u201cIt falls beyond the powers of the president of the republic to judge the candidates\u2019 political opinions in the single ministries,\u201d he wrote.At first, markets seemed more appreciative of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s rejection of the populist government, but they then fell sharply, with stocks and bonds falling as investors digested the increased uncertainty.\u201cDevelopments in Italy are likely to keep the financial markets on tenterhooks,\u201d analysts at the German lender Commerzbank said in a note to clients Monday morning. Referring to polls that indicate that Italy\u2019s populist parties are likely to win any snap election called this year, they continued, \u201cThe entry into office of an Italian government that is on a confrontational course with the E.U. and disregards its rules is only postponed.\u201dItaly\u2019s benchmark stock index, the FTSE MIB, was down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in Europe, and the country\u2019s bonds took a beating. The yield on the main 10-year Italian government bond, which moves inversely to its price, rose to as much as 2.69 percent, its highest level since August 2014.The \u201cspread\u201d between Italian government bonds and their German counterparts, in particular, has widened considerably since the start of the year, indicating investors see Italian debt as a riskier investment.That \u201cspread,\u201d a word often uttered with venom by Italian populists, was also the focus of Mr. Mattarella\u2019s remarks Sunday night, and Mr. Cottarelli\u2019s on Monday morning.But it is the coming election, and the promised centrality of the euro in it, that makes many in Europe nervous. Mr. Mattarella, a 76-year-old Sicilian, has shown he is not easily shaken.The son of a government minister, he decided to go into politics after his older brother, Piersanti, then the governor of Sicily, was shot and killed by the Mafia. Mr. Mattarella pulled his bloodied brother out of the car.The first time he ran for office was in the 1970s, when he ran for a position in his university. He regretted it right away, his friend Vito Riggio once told La Repubblica, recalling that the quiet Sicilian had found himself surrounded by screaming, rabid student protesters.\u201cThe more they screamed, the more he lowered his voice,\u201d Mr. Riggio was quoted as saying. \u201cAt a certain point, he said to the most enraged one, \u2018Excuse me, but why are you screaming? We are here to discuss. No?\u2019 \u201dPrashant S. Rao contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Policing Cryptocurrencies Has Become a Game of Whack-a-Mole for Regulators", "Date": "2018-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe lure of quick riches has attracted a growing number of investors to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. It has also drawn scam artists.But fighting fraud in virtual currencies has almost become a game of Whac-A-Mole for regulators and federal prosecutors, who find each new iteration seemingly a few steps ahead them.The challenge the authorities face is that cryptocurrencies are so new that they do not fit neatly into laws that were passed decades ago prohibiting misconduct in the securities and commodities markets. It will take time for those regulations to catch up.The S.E.C.\u2019s jurisdiction only covers investments used to help fund companies, and Bitcoin hardly fits that model. Instead, the agency has focused on companies using initial coin offerings to raise money, arguing that doing so is the same as selling stocks or bonds to investors, and therefore the complex securities registration rules must be followed.The decision was the first designating cryptocurrencies as a commodity. Whether other courts will agree is an open question. Defendants are sure to challenge any charges based on violating the commodity laws. They would most likely argue that virtual currencies are a medium of exchange rather than a commodity like gold or wheat.One challenge to proving a defendant tried to inflate (or deflate) the price of cryptocurrencies is that, unlike stocks, they are not traded on centralized exchanges. Even simply gathering information on trades may be a challenge for prosecutors and regulators trying to prove manipulation. Moreover, virtual currencies can be traded from just about anywhere on the planet, so even if there is a pattern of suspicious orders the perpetrators may be beyond the reach of federal authorities.Although cryptocurrency trading firms often call themselves \u201cexchanges,\u201d they are not registered with the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C, and their clients have none of the protections afforded investors who trade stocks and commodities. If the government is serious about monitoring the markets for cryptocurrencies, it will need to require the trading firms to comply with the rules for exchanges, which include extensive record-keeping provisions.Although becoming a broker would be costly, Coinbase could use that status as a marketing tool by telling potential customers that they will be much safer trading through its platform rather than unregulated firms that could see assets stolen or prices manipulated. Much like car companies tout their safety measures under rules they long fought, a broker can offer much greater client protection that customers may be willing to pay for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Are Worrying Investors, Again", "Date": "2018-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdd a familiar item to the list of worries for investors: turmoil in the emerging markets.Turkey\u2019s central bank lifted interest rates sharply Wednesday, an emergency measure aimed at stopping the riptide of capital pouring out of the country in recent days.The central bank announced that it would raise a key borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, to 16.5 percent, after Turkey\u2019s lira dropped by as much as 5 percent during the day. In currency markets, moves of even 1 percent are viewed as exceptionally large.Argentina made a similar move this month after investors abruptly lost faith in the government\u2019s reform efforts. The Argentine peso plunged more than 20 percent, before the central bank lifted interest rates to 40 percent. The government is now negotiating a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund.The question on the minds of investors: Is this the start of a bust that could shake the world economy, similar to those that battered Russia, South Korea, Mexico and most of Southeast Asia in recent decades?Or is this merely a market hiccup, akin to the temporary setback that hit emerging markets in 2013?A checkered history of booms and busts hasn\u2019t stopped investors from pouring trillions of dollars into emerging markets in recent years, lured by the promise of higher rates of return than safer bets in the United States, Europe and Japan.Central banks in those large, developed economies had pushed interest rates sharply lower after the 2008 financial crisis, making the higher yields in riskier countries all the more attractive.Last year, investors pumped $1.2 trillion into fast-growing developing economies, especially those that were perceived as having responsible budget and central bank policies. That amount exceeded the totals in 2015 and 2016 combined.Many of those bets have paid off handsomely. Investors earned more than 9 percent on emerging-market bonds last year, much better than the roughly 3.5 percent they could have earned investing in the American bond markets. Emerging-market stocks did even better, rising more than 30 percent in 2017, compared with a 19 percent increases in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.But now money is flowing the other way. Some $8 billion has fled bond and equity markets in developing countries over the past month and a half, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking industry trade group. And the sharp drops in Argentine and Turkish markets suggest that trickle is turning into a gusher.Many emerging-market enthusiasts say the recent anxiety simply reflects that investors are locking in gains and temporarily taking their money home.\u201cWhat is driving this is a massive bout of profit-taking \u2014 it\u2019s the first pullback in the past 10 quarters,\u201d said Jan Dehn, an emerging-market bond specialist at Ashmore Investment Management in London. \u201cTurkey and Argentina are weak spots \u2014 but they are just two countries out of 80. Over all, the fundamentals are incredibly strong.\u201dOthers think that Turkey and Argentina, while more fragile than their peers, may merely be the first dominoes to fall as the decade-long environment of low interest rates comes to an end.With the American economy strong, the Federal Reserve is gradually lifting short-term interest rates. Those act as a magnet for money from around the world, pushing the value of the dollar higher. All currencies are relative, so a stronger dollar translates into a decline in the value of other currencies. That trade-off is especially pronounced in emerging markets, whose economies rely on money from foreign investors.This can fuel a vicious cycle in which a strong dollar weakens emerging-market currencies, prompting investors to pull even more money out of those economies. That, in turn, further weakens their currencies.The concern is that the pattern could spread.\u201cIt is not just Argentina and Turkey,\u201d said James Donald, the head of emerging markets at Lazard Asset Management in New York. \u201cThere are some sizable countries suffering from current account deficits.\u201dA country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money \u2014 in investments and trade \u2014 from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially.So far, the rise in the United States dollar hasn\u2019t been especially sharp, especially compared with its rise in 2013, when the Fed first said it would start tapering off the support that the central bank had provided since the financial crisis. That ignited a phenomenon that market players labeled the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d and it caused a sharp drop in emerging markets such as South Africa, India and Turkey.The fact that the slight rise in the dollar is already putting emerging markets under pressure is a red flag to some experts, because it suggests the situation could get much more severe if the dollar keeps climbing.\u201cIf we\u2019re getting these kinds of moves for a shock that\u2019s really quite a bit smaller than the \u2018taper tantrum,\u2019 it makes me quite worried,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.Advertisement"}

Mr. Flannery said last fall that he wanted to sell off $20 billion in assets.Since the end of the financial crisis, G.E. has sold roughly $200 billion of assets. The company has moved to exit its finance arm, sold NBCUniversal and divested its appliance business that most people associated with G.E.Here\u2019s a timeline of some of G.E.\u2019s biggest transactions since the financial crisis.Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund lost when it took on Samsung three years ago. But the activist investor has claimed victory in its latest battle with a South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol.Here\u2019s how the hedge fund prevailed.The contextElliott said that the restructuring plan showed management \u201chas failed to act in the best interest of the companies and their respective shareholders.\u201d It instead proposed turning Hyundai Motor into a holding company that it said was more tax efficient and sustainable.Why Elliott could win this timeIn a presentation earlier this year, the hedge fund noted that Hyundai\u2019s proposed transaction was similar to what Samsung wanted to do in 2015, where the company sold an affiliate to the chaebol\u2019s holding company. There, Samsung was able to rally individual investors, who accounted for nearly a third of its shareholder base, to its cause.By contrast, retail investors comprise some 5 percent of Hyundai\u2019s shareholder base. Big international institutions, which make up the bulk of Hyundai\u2019s investors, are likely to be more immune to the entreaties of companies under attack from an activist if the campaign makes sense financially.\u2014 Michael de la MercedStock markets are up so far this month, suggesting in part that investors were betting that tensions between the United States and its largest trading partners would ease.That seemed to occur this weekend. The United States and China issued a joint statement on trade and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said planned tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods were on hold. China did not seem to commit to much that is concrete to gain a reprieve from the tariffs, a notable achievement for the country\u2019s negotiators.The joint statement said China would significantly increase its imports from the United States, but it did not say how much more it would buy and over what time period. The parts of the statement about investing in each other\u2019s country and protecting intellectual property were even vaguer.President Trump on Monday nevertheless promoted the statement as a win. But influential members of his administration who are still spoiling for a big trade fight will no doubt want to keep up the pressure on China \u2014 and Mr. Trump may at times share their desire in the coming months. Still, the events of recent weeks show that the United States was largely isolated in its trade fights and the Trump administration may have lacked the resolve or unity to keep up its hard-edged approach. The Trump administration can, of course,reintroduce the threat of tariffs if it believes China is failing to make concessions in the proceeding trade talks. But after stepping back this weekend, it will be harder for the Trump administration to make an aggressive stance appear credible.Indeed, the big question hanging over the Trump administration: Why did it withdraw its tariff threat now, before exacting hard, quantifiable concessions from China? One reason may be that the United States needs China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un planned for June. Another reason may be that China was up for a long fight with the United States and signaled so. Whatever the cause, the takeaway for investors is that the Trump administration passed up an opportunity to show China that it meant what it said.Still, investors may not want to relax too much. Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity has been rising even as he made combative moves on the trade front that at times roiled the market. In other words, there does not appear to be much political risk domestically, if any, to taking on China, and so Mr. Trump may use belligerent trade talk to stir up his base ahead of the midterm elections in November.But as long as he steps back from taking tough actions, investors will most likely take his rhetoric in stride. That stance has served them well. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is now up from where it was in mid-February when the Trump administration outlined its case for steel and aluminum tariffs.- Peter EavisAnalysts over at Goldman Sachs are out with a report on Monday looking at the holdings of 848 hedge funds with a combined $2.3 trillion in stock market bets.Here are some takeaways:Individual stocks\u2022 Hedge funds added bets on Facebook more than any other stock during the first quarter, followed by Microsoft, Aetna and Monsanto.\u2022 Amazon had the biggest reduction in wagers on it, followed by Apple, McDonald\u2019s and Citigroup.Sectors\u2022Tech remained the biggest holding among hedge funds but their holdings overall decreased during the first quarter.\u2022 Hedge funds boosted their bets on the energy sector.\u2022 They remain the most bullish on shares of consumer discretionary companies.\u2022 The hedge funds cut their exposure to financial stocks.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court\u2019s more conservative justices in the majority.

But the pressure is on the Trump administration to back up its tough talk on China \u2014 a task that may be more difficult without the leverage of potential tariffs.The fight inside the White House is still real. Free-trade supporters like Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, are still slinging arrows at hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro. (While Mr. Mnuchin said the tariffs were \u201con hold,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said they were still possible.)The two sides have agreed on a \u201cframework\u201d under which China would increase its purchases of American goods, while putting in place \u201cstructural\u201d changes to protect American technology and to make it easier for American companies to compete in China.G.E. was advised by Morgan Stanley and Dyal Company, the boutique investment bank founded by the former Goldman Sachs deal maker Gordon Dyal, as well as the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.

In 2009, global debt was 213 percent of G.D.P.We used the I.M.F. database to measure the change in debt levels at six countries from 2006 until 2016, and then, using other I.M.F. statistics, we looked at their average G.D.P. growth in that decade. Notably, average growth in that period was slower than in the preceding 10 years, sometimes by a lot. The slowdowns were no doubt largely due to the negative impact of the financial crisis.

One of them: making it easier for customers to sign up for a Visa-branded credit card within minutes when they\u2019re buying something online, then completing that transaction using a virtual version of the card, without having to wait for a physical one.The ultimate goal, according to Mr. Salazar, is simple. \u201cThe largest opportunity in the industry is in displacing cash,\u201d he said.\u2014 Michael de la MercedThere\u2019s an opening for Comcast.

At least until the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, started talking.Mr. Musk\u2019s contentious conference call with analysts after Tesla\u2019s earnings announcement on Wednesday sent shares of the electric-car maker sharply lower. And the losses extended into Thursday\u2019s trading session.Tesla\u2019s stock price fell 5.6 percent on Thursday, after Mr. Musk butted heads with analysts on the call who wanted updates on the company\u2019s continuing production issues and high cash-burn rate. At one point Mr. Musk even told one analyst: \u201cWe have no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders. I couldn\u2019t care less. Please sell our stock and don\u2019t buy it.\u201dShareholders were listening. The stock sell-off gained pace in after hours trading Wednesday after the conference call began at 5:30 p.m. Eastern.

But since peaking in September 2017, the shares have slumped by more than 26 percent, as concern has grown about ongoing production problems for the Model 3, and the prodigious amount of cash the company is burning through.Many expect that its need for cash will require the company to again turn to markets to raise more capital. In light of that, some analysts have suggested that Mr. Musk\u2019s attitude toward Wall Street could be self-defeating.\u201cThe analysts on the call represent the providers of capital that Tesla has throughout its history depended upon,\u201d wrote Adam Jonas, who covers Tesla for Morgan Stanley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobless Rate Looks Like Old Times, but the Economy Doesn\u2019t", "Date": "2018-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time the unemployment rate fell below the 4 percent threshold was in 2000, during a period of frenetic activity remembered as the dot-com boom.Nine years into a sustained, if less feverish, economic recovery, that milestone has been achieved again.The Labor Department said Friday that the jobless rate in April fell to 3.9 percent, raising anew the question of just how tight the labor market can get, and for how long.In the past half-century, only the late 1960s brought an extended period when the rate stayed below 4 percent.\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to add jobs routinely every month for so long, and the unemployment rate we have reached is amazing,\u201d said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, \u201c4% is Broken!\u201dThe steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride \u2014 or, as it was branded, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d \u2014 went before a fall.But the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.The most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven\u2019t been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.Friday\u2019s report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.\u201cA 3.9 percent rate today doesn\u2019t suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief United States economist.A lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it\u2019s easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.In fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.The population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.In 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.Fifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it\u2019s not even one in 10.The tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s \u2014 a feat not repeated since.Average hourly earnings were 2.9 percent higher in January than a year earlier, a hopeful sign that wages might be gaining traction in a tight labor market. Their stubborn failure to do so is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year.\u201cNo one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.Mr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers\u2019 complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.More recently, Mr. Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.Uncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\u201cA faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.However mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. \u201cWe are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don\u2019t know exactly when it is going to happen,\u201d she said.A wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy\u2019s roofing company in Clive, Iowa.Three years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour. No longer. In March, the latest month measured at the state level, the jobless rate in Iowa was 2.8 percent, one of the nation\u2019s lowest. Mr. Steffy now pays roofers $25 an hour, including benefits.His rate for subcontractors has been spiking. It went up 7 percent in March, and will rise another 7 percent in May. There will be bumps in June and August, too. It\u2019s all Mr. Steffy can do to keep himself in the game.\u201cThere\u2019s a price war going on for labor,\u201d he said. He has had crews leave job sites before finishing a roof because they got a better offer from another contractor. \u201cThe next 18 months are going to be crazy,\u201d he said.Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Get Help Paying for Your Wedding", "Date": "2018-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time when the parents were fully expected to foot the bill for a wedding. But with costs steadily climbing and many couples waiting longer to marry, this long-held tradition no longer seems to apply.Many parents still pick up the tab, though financial responsibility increasingly is being shared \u2014 among the couples, both sets of families and even friends.You\u2019ll also need to establish a comfortable (and reasonable) budget and savings plan after setting a date, especially if you think you may be responsible for all or most of the bills. \u201cLook for ways to reduce expenses or increase income, like maybe adding freelance work,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said.Being flexible (and maybe frugal) can certainly help. There are many ways to save on cost, namely by shopping around or even negotiating with potential wedding vendors. You may also consider booking a venue outside the peak season, which runs from late spring through early fall, or on a day other than a Saturday, when prices are at their highest. Or, even opt for a buffet instead of a sit-down meal. (One of Ms. O\u2019Neill\u2019s favorite money-saving tips: \u201ccardboard tiered cake with a small top-cake layer to cut for photos and a basic sheet cake to serve to guests.\u201d)And don\u2019t be afraid to think outside the box. Instead of a fancy hall or event space, Eric Roberge, 38, and Kali Hawlk, 28, of Boston are having both ceremony and reception this June at a rented waterfront house on Cape Cod, where their families also are staying.Mr. Shagawat offers similar advice to his financial planning clients, and also bluntly suggests: \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have enough money, you can always extend the date.\u201dFor those of you who are unwilling or unable to change the date, or who happen to come up short at the last minute, here are some money-raising options to consider.Most financial advisers see borrowing of any sort as a last resort. But these all-dressed-up personal loans \u2014 unsecured, or without collateral \u2014 can cover all or part of the wedding and honeymoon. One big plus: The lending process is usually pretty quick, with borrowers often receiving funds the same day they apply.Wedding loans come in all shapes and sizes, with fixed and variable interest rates, and with or without origination fees. The rates and terms are largely determined by credit worthiness \u2014 the higher your FICO score, the lower the cost. (A score of 750 to 850 is considered excellent; 700 is good.)\u201cThis is a better value for consumers than putting everything on a credit card,\u201d said Ms. Shuff of Lightstream, which offers personal loans at 5.49 to 14.24 percent; $5,000 to $100,000 can be borrowed for 24 to 84 months. The average loan last year, she said, was $16,630.While personal loans are far better than carrying credit card balances indefinitely, they only work if you can comfortably afford the monthly payments. \u201cThe good thing is you have a fixed time frame to pay it off,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said.Financial advisers may especially cringe at the thought of loading up cards with wedding expenses, especially if you\u2019re in the habit of carrying monthly balances. But credit cards can be helpful if used wisely. They offer fraud protection, for one thing, and often provide perks likes bonus points or cash-back rewards.\u201cYou have to be strategic,\u201d said Kristina Whyte, a certified public accountant who is in an M.B.A. program at Yale, \u201cand be willing to do the research and be very careful in terms of budget reassessing.\u201dMs. Whyte, 33, and her husband, Philippe Milord, 39, an associate director for revenue data analytics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, paid for most of their wedding and honeymoon in 2014 with plastic. Each used two cards offering zero percent interest promotions for 15 to 18 months, and increased the credit limits on them so they covered most of the $50,000 total wedding costs.\u201cWe paid them off before they started accumulating interest,\u201d said Ms. Whyte, adding that she and Mr. Milord cut back on daily expenses to make the pre-interest payments.The couple also accumulated bonus points that helped cover a portion of their honeymoon to the Maldives. \u201cWe were all on our own,\u201d Ms. Whyte said. \u201cWe paid for our bridal shower, engagement party, everything.\u201dBut even she cautions against relying too heavily on credit cards. \u201cI would only do this if you\u2019ve been diligent in the past about paying off your balances. I hate paying interest!\u201dMs. O\u2019Neill agreed. \u201cDo not put wedding expenses on a credit card unless you plan to repay the balance quickly and are just charging expenses to earn reward points,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll be paying for your wedding for decades.\u201dIf you (or your parents) own a home that has risen in value, you could easily tap into the equity to help pay wedding bills. The main risk: Default on the loan and you could lose your home. And, you\u2019re tying up money that may be better used for longer-term goals, like paying for college or retirement.There are advantages, though, to either a home-equity loan, which provides a fixed amount in a lump sum, or home equity line of credit, a.k.a. Heloc, which gives you access to a revolving credit line.Like personal loans, they have fixed terms. But because the loan is secured, interest rates are generally lower than on personal loans or credit cards. According to Bankrate, they average 5.56 percent for a home-equity loan and 5.90 percent for Heloc. There may be other fees, however, like closing costs or account maintenance.

{"Headline": "Trump Promises Lower Drug Prices, but Drops Populist Solutions", "Date": "2018-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump vowed on Friday to \u201cbring soaring drug prices back down to earth\u201d by promoting competition among pharmaceutical companies, and he suggested that the government could require drugmakers to disclose prices in their ubiquitous television advertising.But he dropped the popular and populist proposals of his presidential campaign, opting not to have the federal government directly negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare. And he chose not to allow American consumers to import low-cost medicines from abroad.He would instead give private entities more tools to negotiate better deals on behalf of consumers, insurers and employers.Speaking in the sun-splashed Rose Garden of the White House, Mr. Trump said that a \u201ctangled web of special interests\u201d had conspired to keep drug prices high at the expense of American consumers.\u201cEveryone involved in the broken system \u2014 the drugmakers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and many others \u2014 contribute to the problem,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cGovernment has also been part of the problem because previous leaders turned a blind eye to this incredible abuse. But under this administration we are putting American patients first.\u201dHis proposals hardly put a scare into the system he criticized.Ronny Gal, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the president\u2019s speech was \u201cvery, very positive to pharma,\u201d and he added, \u201cWe have not seen anything about that speech which should concern investors\u201d in the pharmaceutical industry.Shares of several major drug and biotech companies rose immediately after the speech, as did the stocks of pharmacy benefit managers, the \u201cmiddlemen\u201d who Mr. Trump said had gotten \u201cvery, very rich.\u201d The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index rose 2.7 percent on Friday. CVS Health, which manages pharmacy benefits for many insurers and employers, finished up 3.2 percent.Mr. Trump and other Republicans are eager to show an achievement on health care this year to counter arguments by Democrats who say that Americans are losing coverage because of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Soaring pharmaceutical prices are directly hitting consumer wallets, and high-profile cases \u2014 like the sudden jump in the price of EpiPens or the jailing of the hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, who greatly increased the price of a drug under his control \u2014 have turned pharmaceuticals into a hot political topic.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas can be put into effect through regulations or guidance documents. Some will require legislation.Republicans in Congress welcomed the president\u2019s attention to high drug prices and promised to review his proposals, which Mr. Trump said would \u201cderail the gravy train for special interests.\u201dDemocrats embraced the opportunity to push health care back to the center of the political debate.\u201cPresident Trump offered little more than window dressing to combat the rising cost of drugs \u2014 a problem that is pinching the pocketbook of far too many Americans,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said after the speech. \u201cWe Democrats have offered a better deal on prescription drugs through true transparency, Medicare Part D negotiation, and a cop on the beat to police and stop exorbitant price hikes.\u201dAfter supporting some of those same proposals on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump pivoted to a different approach. He said his administration would provide new powers for Medicare\u2019s private prescription drug plans, known as Part D, to negotiate lower prices but he would not use the purchasing power of the federal government to conduct direct negotiations. He said he would make it easier for pharmacists to inform patients of cheaper alternatives and would speed the approval of over-the-counter drugs \u201cso that patients can get more medicines without prescription.\u201dMr. Trump also denounced foreign countries that he said \u201cextort unreasonably low prices from U.S. drugmakers\u201d so that their citizens often pay much less than American consumers for the same drugs.\u201cAmerica will not be cheated any longer, and especially will not be cheated by foreign countries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He directed his trade representative to \u201cmake fixing this injustice a top priority\u201d in negotiations with every trading partner.\u201cIt\u2019s time to end the global freeloading once and for all,\u201d Mr. Trump said.It is not clear why higher profits in other countries would be passed on to American consumers in the form of lower prices, and officials in those countries pushed back hard.\u201cWith our price regulations, drug companies are still making profits \u2014 just lower profits than in the United States,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Levine, the chairman of Canada\u2019s Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which reviews prices to ensure they are not excessive.The administration floated several ideas that could radically change the marketing of prescription drugs.Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said the Food and Drug Administration would explore requiring drug companies to disclose list prices in their television advertisements.The government, he said, will consider whether to \u201coutlaw rebates\u201d \u2014 the discounts and price concessions that are a key link in the drug supply chain. Pharmacy benefit managers are hired by insurers and large employers to negotiate lower drug prices, but they also receive rebate payments from drugmakers, creating a potential conflict of interest, the administration said.Mr. Trump said he would end \u201cthe dishonest double-dealing that allows the middleman to pocket rebates and discounts that should be passed on to consumers and patients.\u201dMark Merritt, the president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents drug benefit managers, said the real problem was the high prices set by drugmakers.\u201cGetting rid of rebates and other price concessions would leave patients and payers, including Medicaid and Medicare, at the mercy of drug manufacturers\u2019 pricing strategies,\u201d Mr. Merritt said.Experts said some of the president\u2019s ideas could help lower drug prices.\u201cIt\u2019s framed as a pro-competitive agenda, and touches on a range of government programs that the administration can change through regulation \u2014 so that the president can take unilateral action,\u201d said Daniel N. Mendelson, the president of Avalere Health, a research and consulting company. \u201cThe trick here for the administration is to do something visible before the midterm elections, so they can take credit for an action that reduces drug prices for consumers.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s \u201cblueprint to lower drug prices\u201d has four main themes: increasing competition in drug markets; giving private plans more tools to negotiate discounts for Medicare beneficiaries; providing new incentives for drug manufacturers to reduce list prices; and cutting consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs.The administration would lower out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients by requiring prescription drug plans to pass on some of the discounts and rebates they receive from drug manufacturers. Patients could see those savings at the pharmacy counter. At the same time, Medicare officials say, there could be a modest increase in premiums for Medicare drug coverage.Health policy experts like this idea because it reduces the burden on patients with serious chronic illnesses and spreads the expense of needed medications across the entire insured population.But Democrats said Mr. Trump\u2019s policy prescriptions fell far short of what was needed, especially next to the populist promises he made during the 2016 campaign.\u201cI think very expensive champagne will be popping in drug company boardrooms across the country tonight,\u201d said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, who has been investigating drug prices for the last year. \u201cThe president is apparently abandoning his campaign promise to authorize Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices.\u201dAdministration officials were somewhat defensive about the president\u2019s plan, saying it was bold and significant even though it was not what Democrats wanted \u2014 or what candidate Trump favored.In a round of television interviews on Friday, Mr. Azar said the president\u2019s plan included \u201cover 50 different initiatives \u2014 very sophisticated, the kind of thing you\u2019d expect from a C.E.O. like Donald Trump, getting at the real heart of the business problem.\u201dMr. Azar said the president\u2019s plan would \u201cunleash those who negotiate for us with the greater powers of the private sector\u201d to obtain good deals.In trade negotiations, the White House wants to put pressure on other countries to increase the prices of brand-name drugs, with the expectation that pharmaceutical companies would then lower prices here at home.America\u2019s trading partners \u201cneed to pay more because they\u2019re using socialist price controls, market access controls, to get unfair pricing,\u201d said Mr. Azar, a former top executive at the drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company. \u201cAnd they\u2019re doing it on the backs of their patients. God help you if you get cancer in some of these countries.\u201dOther nations, also struggling with high drug prices, scorned Mr. Trump\u2019s advice on this issue.\u201cDrug manufacturers in the United States set their own prices, and that is not the norm elsewhere in the world,\u201d a spokesman for the 28-member European Union said on Friday. \u201cE.U. member states have government entities that either negotiate drug prices or decide not to cover drugs whose prices they deem excessive. No similar negotiating happens in the U.S.\u201dKatie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago, and Peter Baker from Washington.Advertisement"}
